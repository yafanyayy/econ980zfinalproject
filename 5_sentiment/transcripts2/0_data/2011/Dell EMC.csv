I'm very pleased to report that EMC had a another great quarter to finish off a year of excellent operational and financial results. Q4 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow all new quarterly records for EMC. We also achieved a record-breaking year in 2010, with revenue of $17 billion, an increase of 21%. Non-GAAP operating margin for the full year of 22%, up 460 basis points; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.26, up 40% from 2009; and free cash flow of $3.4 billion, up 31% and 27% higher than non-GAAP net income.
2010 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow are also new annual records for EMC as well. Clearly, our vision and strategy are on target. The market is primed and ready and we have the right assets to help our customers on their journey to the cloud. As a result, in 2010, we executed on our triple play to simultaneously invest meaningfully in our business, take market share and improve profitability.
First, looking at the investments we made in our business. We stepped up investing research and development by 16% to approximately $2 billion, including software development costs that we capitalized. We invested $3.2 billion on key acquisitions, targeted at high growth areas and invested substantially in our go to market capabilities, including our international sales infrastructure and expanding our channel network.
Secondly, the market share gains we achieved were impressive, with faster market growth in areas like virtualization, security and storage, with especially strong gains in back in Archiving and in the high-end. For the full year 2010, we grew 21%, almost twice what we estimate was the growth for our total available markets.
Finally, investing in our business for growth and achieving sizable market share gains, we were still able to deliver a substantial leverage for our business in 2010. Products designed to deliver greater value, more efficiently and faster growth in our higher-margin businesses all contributed to a 340 basis point gain in non-GAAP gross margin over last year.
The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was even greater, up 460 basis points to 22% for the full year due to the operating expense efficiencies we also achieved. Let me point out that these are also very strong gains over 2008.
As we head into 2011, we're even better prepared to the potential in front of us than we were in 2010 as we have expanded our market opportunity with the acquisitions of reimplement Iselin. We've extended our reach down market with the addition of the VMX family of storage systems. And we've put an even greater distance between ourselves and our competitors across our storage portfolio with a newly refresh unified midtier storage family, new and enhanced products in our backup and archiving offering and valuable new software offerings for our flagship VMAX, to name just a few.
By building out the strongest portfolio in our history, we positioned ourselves in intersection of two of the most sweeping trends in IT, cloud computing and big data. This is where we expect 2011 to be another record revenue year with continued improvement in profitability. We are confident we can grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion, expand non-GAAP operating margin by about 100 basis points to approximately 23%, grow non-GAAP net income 20% to approximately $3.25 billion, grow non-GAAP earnings per share 16% to $1.46 and continue to meaningfully grow our strong free cash flow.
This is remarkable growth, particulary for a company of our size and also considering the very high far we set ourselves in 2010. We also remain committed to double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the next several years.
In addition to the continued growth of enterprise data, our progress is being driven by the convergence of two major trends in IT, cloud computing and big data. Cloud computing can also be described as IT as a service, leveraging on on demand, self-reliance virtualized infrastructure to deliver idea to service, cloud computing is more efficient, flexible and cost-effective. And while customers are eager to deply cloud architectures so they can begin capturing the efficiencies cloud computing affords, this is not a transformation that happens overnight, but happens in phases.
Phase I is a virtualization of smaller, deeper mantle off in IT owned applications, frequently with simple, efficient VM integrated midtier storage. Cost efficiencies are primary benefit here and we saw a large number of customers passing through this phase in 2010. On average, customers have virtualized about 30% of their applications and are now entering Phase II. Phase II is a virtualization of business-critical applications, ideally with more resilient infrastructure that meets demanding as always for performance, availability, workload mobility, recoverability and security. More and more customers are entering into this phase heading into 2011.
Well over half of the company's applications will be virtualized once the customers completely passed through this phase of the journey to cloud.
Phase III is when a customer is finally leveraging all of the power of a fully virtualized environment to provide IT as a service with automation, provisioning and chargeback, and drawing on compatible public cloud services where it makes sense. The early adopters are always just dying to get here. And as the customer cloud infrastructure develops, they look to building technology that will secure and protect their operations while achieving benefits initially than ever before. This means that best-of-breed and well-integrated capabilities for things like security and backup.
Such transitions to the cloud are becoming the norm and the vast majority of customers are at some point in their transformation to IT as a service. What is important is that whether the customers are just entering the first phase or well into the third, we have the product portfolio and the service expertise to accompany them every step of the way.
The second major trend that will drive our results in 2011 is big data, which is a primary contributor to the staggering pace of data growth. When we talk about big data, we are referring to the enormous repositories of corporate and Excel data, including unstructured information created by social media and other web repositories. We are also talking about the associated analytics that unlock the value contained within these massive amounts of data. Big data differs from the transactional and small file data and applications that have traditionally characterized the company's data center. It tends to be more sequential, less transactional and much, much bigger, measured in bytes rather than terabytes. The tools and platforms surrounding big date require new approaches and capability to handle these data sets. With the investments we've made through the acquisitions of Iselin and Greenplum, as well as in our own utmost offering, we are now squarely positioned to capture much of this large and growing incremental market opportunity.
Overall, given our strong basic technology assets both broad and deep with virtualization optimization that is second to none, we are becoming the partner of choice as customers consolidate and build out new data centers either for their own private clouds or to offer cloud services to their customers.
Now that I've given you a sense of what's driving our success in 2010 and going forward, let's look at our Q4 numbers in greater detail. Overall storage revenue growth accelerates to 17%, as we continue to gain share by enlarging our footprint in the data center, as well as through new customer acquisition. Customers choose EMC storage because they want efficiency, simplicity and performance, and EMC delivers. We deliver efficiency through features like FAST VP software which stands for Fully Automated Storage Tiering with virtual pools, and which automatically optimizes systems and vastly lowers TCO. We deliver simplicity exemplified by our advanced easy to use Unisphere interface in our midtier storage. We drove a performance with unparalleled VM integration of virtual provisioning across our portfolio and as this recent survey indicates, we continue to standout as the storage brand of choice in virtualized environments.
These differentiators, along with product quality, service and support that are consistently the best in the industry, helps us extend our storage market leadership position in Q4. Our Symmetrix product revenues grew 19% in Q4, there ar a couple of key differentiating features here that make our VMAX line so popular. The first of these is, its x86 -based scale-out architecture's purpose built for virtual environments. This evolution of an architecture to incorporate industry-standard processes enabled us to very quickly leverage the improvements to process to deliver faster, more reliable and more efficient performance. The second feature that sets it apart from alternatives is our ability to fully leverage solid-drive in enterpriese storage. We were the first to deliver the value to be had from solid-state and enterprise storage three years ago this month. And we continued to add value with our fully automated storage tiering software. The latest version of Which automatically optimizes the systems and delivers up to 40% more application performance and 40% of lower cost compared to single tier systems.
The EMC alone is able to deliver this value with solid state drives and customers are embracing this value with penetration rates of solid state drives and FAST on VMAX climbing once again in Q4.
When you add these two features together, the end result is a powerful, trusted and highly efficient high-end platform where our value proposition that customers love. This demonstrated our ability to innovate in ways that respond to customer needs is translating into market share. In fact, we think that when all the numbers are in for the year, we will have registered our biggest annual share gains in the high end inat least 10 years, which are a testament to the power of our offerings here. As customers consolidate these for data centers into new environments, meant to support cloud employments either public or private, they choose VMAX because of its highly scalable, usable production capacity and the small footprint made possible by cutting edge efficiency technologies. We had numerous examples across the globe in Q4 of customers selecting VMAX for their virtualized environments because of these advantages. We all verticals of all types, including at a healthcare authority in British Columbia, telecom providers in India and Israel, an energy company in the U.K., a government in the Middle East and large manufacturer right here in Massachusetts.
Let me give you an example from this past quarter that illustrates why VMAX is the high-end platform of choice. One of the largest plastic manufacturers in the world, recently consolidated its three main data centers globally and was looking to replace the entire storage infrastructure in Europe. Because they had used VMware for server and desktop virtualization, VM integration was a chief consideration for the storage they selected. Our ability to provide highly reliable and scalable storage solution, highly integrated with vCenter was key to displacing here. Moreover, our robust backup offerings and our integration with VMware's virtual development API enabled us to become this customer's global backup standard as well. They're now using Avamar, network and data domain to be their backup requirements which, like many customers, varied throughout the global environments.
Mid tier park revenue grew 23% in Q4 and was up 20% from Q3, representing a healthy acceleration from the sequential growth of 5% last quarter. This was especially encouraging as our product refresh coming in Q1 was hardly a secret. While we continued to have customers approach the EMC for traditional network storage requirements, we also saw a strong growth from customers working through early phase or departmental deployments of virtualization. Our long list of mid tier competitive takeouts in virtualized environments in Q4 attest this is happening across the globe in just every vertical, with customers range from health care, tech and Internet to manufacturing, government and transportation. As customers virtualize their data centers and standardize their consolidated environments onto a small number of trusted vendors, EMC stands out as the best-of-breed and best VM integrated information infrastructure provider. This is for new customers who need a vendor who can do more than just Phase I storage. EMC consistently stands out as the best candidate for consolidations like this in the mid tier because of our affinity with virtualized environments, because of the simplicity of our unified systems and because our market leading backup solutions that span customers backup performance. A great example in Q4 of a win due to these advantages came as momentum performance materials. This large silicon producers standardized upon VMware and view across the enterprise and was looking to standardize infrastructure for their remote data centers as well. With our simple, efficient and VMware integrated midtier unified products, as well as Avamar in our arsenal, we were selected as the storage standards globally. We expect cases like this to become much more prevalent in 2011 with our refreshed and expanded midtier product set. Having earned the trust of thousands of midtier customers with platinum storage products and services in their main production and disaster recovery environments, we are focused on expanding our footprint into departmental and remote offices. Our VMAX eline were very important here, as well as in reaching down market into the SMB space.
Our backup recovery systems division which includes data domain, Avamar and network have continues to all cylinders. Our resounding success here stems from our differentiated duplication technology and also from the EMC effect which is our ability to leverage our brand, our focus in research and development, and our global sales infrastructure to maximize the ROI from our acquisitions. The affirmation customer examples are great illustration of this affect. Our market leading digital technology sought after by customers frustrated by reproaches. These challenges are now so common to our backup offerings are becoming natural additional solution in accounts where the initial engagement was something entirely different.
This same approach is being applied to our acquisitions in salon and Greenplum, our model is to select differentiated technology that is clear to customers. In rapidly growing adjacent markets that are complementary to our own and then broaden this reach to exposure to our global sales channels, the backing of the EMC brand and other investments to maximize value.
This strategy augments our portfolio to meet the challenge of big data and helps to solidify our position as the cloud technology provider of choice. Early indicators of the success of this strategy are all good. Greenplum did very well in Q4 and we're especially pleased with theFAST ramp of the data computing appliance. Built on Greenplum technology, the data computing appliance combined leading innovation in workload management, and advanced analytics with the fastest data loading on the market today, which is important given the vast amount of source data they need to run analytics. Customers value all this plus the fact they can get the DC up and running very quickly.
Isilon's momentum continued with record revenue in Q4 on stand-alone basis, well above the company's expectations prior to the acquisition. In its six generations, Isilon scale technology has matured and is mainstream, enterprise ready, and meeting the big data challenges that characterize today's IT environment in a growing number of vertical markets. This is a great momentum, even before the benefit of the EMC effect.
On a going forward basis, Isilon will be included in our midtier storage number but it was not included in our Q4 revenue as we closed this transaction very late in the quarter. Complementary to Isilon is our utmost offering which uniquely focuses on globally distributed environments with object interface data. We remain confident that these two together will reach a $1 billion annual run rate during the second half of 2012.
Our services organization is definitely benefiting from the the transition to cloud architectures as cloud consulted engagements increased over 40% in Q4. As customers buildout private cloud infrastructures and even begin to bridge towards utilizing the capabilities public clouds have to offer, EMC's trusted advisors have pulled in, help customers architect the foundation for delivering IT as a service, a trend which even further increases EMC's relevance in next-generation data centers.
One of the fastest and easiest way to accelerate the transition to cloud architecture is with the and the strong VC momentum we experienced in Q3 has only accelerating in Q4 with the number of deals closed more than doubling quarter on quarter. As expected, deployments verticals and happening globally as a conversion infrastructure is universally appealing. Vbox enable customers to get cloud infrastructures up and running on best-of-breed technology in a fraction of the time required by additional deployments of competitive technology stacks. Reference architectures or Technology alliances that comport with the Vblock are still do-it-yourself assemblies and lacked the very advantage that makes Vblock popular, one SKU, preconfigured with a single manager interface and ready to deploy. A Vblock is best-of-breed technology that dramatically simplifies cloud deployments and customers are embracing it.
Vblock customers in Q4 includes service providers like Sun Brazil, our first official VCE partner in Brazil will be offering new cloud computing services to its customer based upon Vblocks. And Harris Corporation which is investing in its five integration centers to offer trusted Enterprise Cloud solutions to its customers. Corporations build our private cloud architectures are standardizing on Vblocks as well. With Vbox, customers can efficiently deploy highly secured cloud-based application for business innovation while reducing the capital and operating expenses associated with procuring, deploying and maintaining IT. The benefits to EMC of VCE areimportant. The majority of VCE deals are incremental to EMC, in addition to our traditional best-of-breed storage solutions, we now complete with the integrated players or best-of-breed converged infrastructure. Now we are positioned to win both ways.
Our RSA Security division finished 2010 with all-time record Q4 revenues of $209 million, up 28% year-on-year, driven by strength across product lines and geographies. RSA achieved excellent growth in 2010 with revenue growth accelerating every quarter this year. This stems from the fact that security continues to be foremost priority for CIOs and also from RSA's leadership and product leadership within security. Part of our competitive advantage is that many of our offerings span both physical and virtual infrastructures which is ideal as customers build out their clouds. As cloud environments grow in popularity, the built-in security that RSA provides is increasing relevance. RSA will continue to stand apart with offerings enable IT departments and cloud providers alike, to ensure compliance and security but to prove it as well.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was roughly flat in Q4, as customers transitioned from purchasing enterprisewide content management solutions to application centric solutions, the Documentum xCP. We believe we have a lot of the right assets to address the enormous opportunities to be had in the capture, management and governance of unstructured data. Information governance is increasingly a focus for corporations today where industries insurance and healthcare and demanding case and management solutions like those build on our xCP platform.
VMware grew 38% in the quarter to a record $835 million as customers are eager to benefit from the efficiency and agility the VMware's product that enables. VMWare is making good progress in expanding its markets globally. We are expanding footprint within the data centers as well. Approximately 30% of the data center server applications on average, arevirtualized today. We expect this figure to climb over 50% within the next two years.
VMWare will continue to leverage its unique basic technology assets to expand the technical and market leadership position we hold today. We have freelance strategy focused for modernizing infrastructure, applications and end user computing, VMware is positioned at the core of the movement to IT as a service.
Looking more closely at our financials. It is evident for the strategic combination of our technology assets which we've been assembling over the last several years is resulting in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. Overall, we grew revenue in Q4 19% to $4.9 billion,, reflecting solid double-digit growth from all of our geographies and especially our BRIC + 13  market which grew over 30%. The higher value we're delivering to customers is translating to better profitability for us. Non-GAAP gross margins increased 140 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points year-on-year to an impressive 61.9%, driven by volume and mix shift towards higher margin products. This expansion, coupled with ongoing efficiency gains in our offering expenses drove non-GAAP operating margin of 300 basis points year-on-year to a very very solid 25.4%. These improvements drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.42, up 27% from $0.33 a year ago. We ended the year with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. Partly driving this cash balance was a 31% growth of free cash flow in 2010 from last year to a full year free cash flow of $3.4 billion. This is well above non-GAAP net income for the period and a very good results.
We've also been investing some of this cash in our future, including $2.3 billion on acquisitions in Q4 with a 2010 total of $3.2 billion. This investment in key technologies, products and businesses, adds to portfolio and drives growth. In the consolidating IT market, the strength from our balance sheet in to make these investments is very important. We've also be returning cash to our shareholders via share purchases. In Q4, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of EMC for approximately $200 million. In 2010, we returned $1 billion to shareholders via our repurchase program. In addition, in 2010, we spent a small amount of $399 million to purchase VMware shares while VMware spent $339 million on share repurchases. Given the VMware's position as the cloud data center operating system of the future, we believe our relatively small purchases to maintain our ownership level our an excellent long term investment.
Turning now to 2011. The global economic outlook, while it could be better, is certainly a bit brighter than it was last year at this time. Joe will give you some more color about what we expect. What is clear is that the vast opportunity available to us at the crossroads of the megatrends of cloud computing and big data. EMC is particurly well-positioned to take advantages opportunity with a refresh product portfolio that meets customers needs for efficiency and simplicity. A services organization that's one of the most trusted in the industry, one of the most advanced and capable go to market organizations in the industry, a strong and growing partner in ecosystem and are expanding role at it's trusted cloud technology provider across the globe. We have never been in a better position. This alignment of IT trends with our capabilities gives us a high level of confidence and stronger momentum as we look ahead. As a result, in 2011, we expect to grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion to expand non-GAAP operating margin around 100 basis points to approximately 23%. This is on top with the significant improvements we made in 2010. To grow non-GAAP net income, 20% to approximately $3.25 billion; to grow non-GAAP EPS 16% to $1.46; and to increase our buyback of EMC shares for $1 billion in 2010 to $1.5 billion in 2011.
There are additional assumptions and expectations in our earnings release, but I'd like take a moment and point out a couple here. First, I'd like to point out an accounting requirement that has an increasingly meaningful impact on our fully diluted share count and, therefore, on our EPS calculation. The impact comes from the accounting for our outstanding convertible debt. As the EMC stock price goes above this $16.08 excise price of the convertible, accounting rules results in an increase in our calculated fully diluted shares. In other words, the stock price going up is leading to the accounting calculation for the number of fully diluted shares to also go up. You will probably want to be mindful of this impact as it can be quite large once the debt is outstanding, for example, assuming average stock price of $25, this would result in approximately 75 million shares added to the fully diluted share counts. Based upon our non-GAAP net income expectations for 2011, this would equal to $0.05 per share.
This $0.05 is pretty meaningful compared to the 2010 impact of only $0.02 per share. Taking this example a step further, the comparison of non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 versus $1.26 which represents 16% growth in 2011, would instead be $1.51 versus $1.28 or 18% growth, i.e. higher EPS and higher EPS growth. I believe this is a very important for you to understand because while this accounting impact has significant impacts on diluted non-GAAP earnings per share, the impact will be going away upon maturity of the convertible debt used to hedge we have in place. In other words, if the debt had already reached maturity, these accounting shares would not be in the calculation.
So it is an important factor to keep in mind and we've included a table in our supplemental schedule that illustrates the impact to share price changes on our diluted share count due to this accounting treatments of our convertible debt.
While the other consideration in regards to our modeling for 2011 is the nonoperating expense line. We have expect to increase by roughly $25 million from $75 million in 2010 to $100 million in 2011. The primary driver of this increase is our initial investment in VCE.
In conclusion, with our commitment to continue our triple play, of reinvesting for growth, and gaining market share and delivering leverage, we head into the year with a major focus on reinforcing our position as the provider of choice for cloud infrastructures. So while we expect to continue our excellent track record in 2011, more importantly, we are also establishing EMC strategically for the long term. There is no shortage of market opportunity and we've never been better positioned. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe who will give you more color on the outlook of the quarter and the vast opportunities that lie ahead."

I would like to begin by adding my welcome to everyone who has joined us for today's conference call. Thank you for your interest in EMC.
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q4 and I am proud to report that Q4 Cap is truly strong year for EMC in 2010. A year marked by rapid growth, market share gains, financial leverage and significant investment in technology innovation. Even more important is the fact that in 2010, we positioned ourselves very well, not only for 2011, but well beyond. I'd like to publicly congratulate the 49,000 people of EMC and VMware on their many accomplishments and thank them for their leadership, their laser focus on our customers and for their dedication. And on their behalf, I would like you to know that they are charged up and excited about our future prospects.
For sure, EMC and VMware are clear front leaders with compelling technology that will help our customers on their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, which will enable the massive benefits that IT as a service has to offer, namely, increased agility at significantly lower costs.
Today, I will not talk much about our cloud strategies or innovative products, services or partners as in exactly two weeks from today, we are hosting a strategic forum for investors and analysts. And I would like to invite you to join us for this event in person in Boston or via the Web.
I would now like to make a few comments on the 2011 macro environment and contrast this outlook with what we saw one year ago as we began 2010.
Last year at this time, we said we expected IT spending to grow 3% to 5% in 2010, and we said EMC's TAM or total addressable market will grow considerably faster in the 6% to 8% range. We also said on that call that EMC's plan for 2010 was to gain share and we set our goal to grow faster than our TAM. Our 2010 target was $16 billion which represented a 14% growth. We now believe IT spending grew in the 7% to 8% range in 2010. EMC's consolidated TAM grew 10% to 12% and EMC grew 21% or to be totally fair, a little over 19% on an apples-to-apples acquisition adjusted basis. For 2011, our forecast is for EMC global IT spending to increase 5% to 7% and EMC's TAM to grow in the 8% to 10% range. And as David has said, our plan is for 15% growth to $19.6 billion while growing non-GAAP EPS to $1.46 per share, an increase of 16%. As is our custom, the outlook we provided here today of $19.6 billion revenue and $1.46 per share is exactly the same numbers our Board of Directors has approved for management's plan. Additionally, EMC's board will also approve a free cash flow goal for management at our upcoming board meeting which we will share with you in our proxy. In 2011, we will focus on growing faster than the markets we serve, thus taking share, provide financial leverage and continue our investments in innovative products and solutions. And as always, we will strive to meet and beat our plan.
So what gives us confidence in our future? First, is our belief in our cloud/IT as a service vision which is tightly coupled with a very developed strategy for private, public and hybrid cloud computing. Second, is the incredibly rich, and I do mean incredibly rich product lineup and roadmap we have going for us in 2011. Third, the timing of our product growth map. For starters, the fact that one week ago today, we launched a record-breaking 41 new and enhanced storage products. This gives our sales force and our channel partners virtually an entire year to sell these high-value products. And, by the way, we're far from done. There are many more exciting products which we will launch throughout 2011.
Fourth, is our preparedness to take those products to market and delight our customers via our well-trained and motivated people, via our technology and service partners, via our channel and distribution partners, via our programs and via our BC coalition with Cisco which is now 700 people strong. Our best-of-breed convert infrastructure products and message is resonating very well with customers as VCE continues to outperform its plan by a considerable margin.
And fifth and very importantly, is our momentum and our will to win. With that, I'll now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter to finish off a year of excellent operational and financial results. Q4 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and",4375,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter to finish off a year of excellent operational and financial results. Q4 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow are all new quarterly records for EMC. We also achieved a record-breaking year in 2010, with revenue of $17 billion, an increase of 21%. Non-GAAP operating margin for the full year of 22%, up 460 basis points; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.26, up 40% from 2009; and free cash flow of $3.4 billion, up 31% and 27% higher than non-GAAP net income.
2010 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow are also new annual records for EMC as well. Clearly, our vision and strategy are on target. The market is primed and ready, and we have the right assets to help our customers on their journey to the cloud. As a result, in 2010, we executed on our triple play to simultaneously invest meaningfully in our business, take market share and improve profitability.
First, looking at the investments we made in our business. We stepped up investing in research and development by 16% to approximately $2 billion, including software development costs that were capitalized. We invested $3.2 billion on key acquisitions, targeted at high growth areas and invested substantially in our go-to-market capabilities, including our international sales infrastructure and expanding our channel network.
Secondly, the market share gains we achieved were impressive, with faster market growth in areas like virtualization, security and storage, with especially strong share gains in back-up and archiving and in the high-end. For the full year 2010, we grew 21%, almost twice what we estimate was the growth for our total available market.
Finally, even while investing in our business for growth and achieving sizable market share gains, we were still able to deliver a substantial leverage for our business in 2010. Products designed to deliver greater value, services driven more efficiently and faster growth in our higher-margin businesses all contributed to a 340 basis point gain in non-GAAP gross margin over last year.
The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was even greater, up 460 basis points to 22% for the full year due to the operating expense efficiencies we also achieved. Let me point out that these are also very strong gains over 2008.
As we head into 2011, we're even better prepared to see the potential in front of us than we were in 2010 as we have expanded our market opportunity with the acquisitions of Greenplum and Isilon. We've extended our reach down market with the addition of a VNXe family of storage systems. And we've put an even greater distance between ourselves and our competitors across our storage portfolio with a newly refreshed and unified mid-tier storage family, new and enhanced products in our backup and archiving offering and valuable new software offerings for our flagship VMAX, to name just a few.
By building out the strongest product portfolio in our history, we've positioned ourselves in the intersection of two of the most sweeping trends in IT: cloud computing and big data. This is where we expect 2011 to be another record revenue year with continued improvements in profitability. We are confident we can grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion, expand non-GAAP operating margin by about 100 basis points to approximately 23%, grow non-GAAP net income 20% to approximately $3.25 billion, grow non-GAAP earnings per share 16% to $1.46 and continue to meaningfully grow our strong free cash flow.
This is remarkable growth, particularly for a company of our size and also considering the very high bar we set ourselves in 2010. We also remain committed to double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the next several years.
In addition to the continued growth of enterprise data, our progress is being driven by the convergence of two major trends in IT, cloud computing and big data. Cloud computing can also be described as IT-As-A-Service, leveraging on on-demand, self-reliant virtualized infrastructure to deliver IT-As-A-Service, cloud computing is more efficient, flexible and cost-effective. And while customers are eager to deploy cloud architectures so they can begin capturing the efficiencies cloud computing affords, this is not a transformation that happens overnight, but happens in phases.
Phase 1 is the virtualization of smaller departmental often an IT-owned applications, frequently with simple, efficient VM integrated mid-tier storage. Cost efficiencies are primary benefit here and we saw a large number of customers passing through this phase in 2010. On average, customers have virtualized about 30% of their applications, and are now entering Phase 2. Phase 2 is the virtualization of business-critical applications, ideally with more resilient infrastructure that meets demanding SOAs for performance, availability, workload mobility, recoverability and security. More and more customers are entering into this phase heading into 2011.
Well over half of the company's applications will be virtualized once a customer has completely passed through this phase of the journey to the cloud.
Phase 3 is when a customer is finally leveraging all the power of a fully virtualized environment to provide IT-As-A-Service with automation, provisioning and charge back, and drawing on compatible public cloud services where it makes sense. The early adopters are always just dying to get here. And as a customer's cloud infrastructure develops, they look to building technologies that will secure and protect their operations whilst achieving benefits and agility than ever before. This means best-of-breed and well-integrated capabilities for things like security and backup.
Such transitions to the cloud are becoming the norm, and the vast majority of customers are at some point in their transformation to IT-As-A-Service. What is important is that whether customers are just entering the first phase or well into the third, we have the product portfolio and the service expertise to accompany them every step of the way.
The second major trend that will drive our results in 2011 is big data, which is a primary contributor to the staggering pace of data growth. When we talk about big data, we are referring to the enormous repositories of corporate and external data, including unstructured information created by social media and other web repositories. We're also talking about the associated analytics that unlock the value contained within these massive amounts of data. Big data differs from the transactional and small file data and applications that have traditionally characterized the company's data center. It tends to be more sequential, less transactional and much, much bigger, measured in petabytes rather than terabytes. The tools and platforms surrounding big date require new approaches and capabilities to handle these data sets. With the investments we've made through the acquisitions of Isilon and Greenplum, as well as in our own Atmos offering, we are now squarely positioned to capture much of this large and growing incremental market opportunity.
Overall, given our strong basic technology assets base both broad and deep with virtualization optimization that is second to none, we are becoming the partner of choice as customers consolidate and build out new data centers, either for their own private clouds or to offer cloud services to their customers.
Now that I've given you a sense of what's driving our success in 2010 and going forward, let's look at our Q4 numbers in greater detail. Overall, storage revenue growth accelerates to 17% as we continue to gain share by enlarging our footprint in the data center, as well as through new customer acquisition. Customers choose EMC storage because they want efficiency, simplicity and performance, and EMC delivers. We deliver efficiency through features like FAST VP software, which stands for Fully Automated Storage Tiering with virtual pools, and which automatically optimizes systems and vastly lowers TCO. We deliver simplicity exemplified by our advanced easy-to-use Unisphere interface in our mid-tier storage. We deliver performance with unparalleled VM integration of virtual provisioning across our portfolio and as this recent survey indicates, we continue to standout as the storage b vendor of choice in virtualized environments.
These differentiators, along with product quality, service and support that are consistently the best in the industry, helps us extend our storage market leadership position in Q4. Our Symmetrix product revenues grew 19% in Q4, there are a couple of key differentiating features here that make our VMAX line so popular. The first of these is its x86 -based scale-out architecture purpose built for virtual environments. This evolution of an architecture to incorporate industry-standard processes enables  us to very quickly leverage the improvements made to processes to deliver faster, more reliable and more efficient performance. The second feature that sets it apart from alternatives is our ability to fully leverage Solid State Drive in enterprise storage. We were the first to deliver the value to be had from Solid State Drive and enterprise storage three years ago this month, and we continued to add value with our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software. The latest version of which automatically optimizes systems and delivers up to 40% more application performance and 40% lower cost compared to single tiered systems.
EMC alone is able to deliver this value with Solid State Drives and customers are embracing this value with penetration rates of Solid State Drives and FAST on VMAX climbing once again in Q4. When you add these two features together, the end result is a powerful, trusted and highly efficient high-end platform with a value proposition that customers love. 
This demonstrated ability to innovate in ways that respond to customer needs is translating into market share. In fact, we think that when all the numbers are in for the year, we will have registered our biggest annual share gains in the high end in at least 10 years, which is a testament to the power of our offerings here. As customers consolidate district data centers into new environments meant to support cloud deployments either public or private, they choose VMAX because of its highly scalable, usable protecting capacity and a small footprint made possible by cutting edge efficiency technologies. We had numerous examples across the globe in Q4 of customers selecting VMAX for their virtualized environments because of these advantages. With sizeable wins in all verticals of all types, including at a healthcare authority in British Columbia, telecom providers in India and Israel, an energy company in the U.K., a government in the Middle East and a large manufacturer right here in Massachusetts.
Let me give you an example from this past quarter that illustrates why VMAX is the high-end platform of choice. One of the largest plastic manufacturers in the world recently consolidated their three main data centers globally and was looking to replace the entire storage infrastructure in Europe. Because they had to use VMware for server and desktop virtualization, VM integration was a chief consideration for the storage they selected. 
Our ability to provide highly reliable and scalable storage solution, highly integrated with vCenter was key to displacing Hitachi here. Moreover, our robust backup offerings and our integration with VMware's virtual disk development API enabled us to become this customer's global backup standard as well. They're now using Avamar, Networker and Data Domain to meet their backup requirements which, like many customers, vary throughout the global environments.
Mid-tier product revenue grew 23% in Q4 and was up 20% from Q3, representing a healthy acceleration from the sequential growth of 5% last quarter. This was especially encouraging as our product refresh coming in Q1 was hardly a secret. While we continued to have customers approach the EMC for traditional network storage requirements, we also saw strong growth from customers working through early phase or departmental deployments of virtualization. Our long list of mid-tier competitive takeouts in virtualized environments in Q4 attest this is happening across the globe in just about every vertical, with customers range from health care, tech and Internet to manufacturing, government and transportation. 
As customers virtualize their data centers and standardize their consolidated environments on to a small number of trusted vendors, EMC stands out as the best-of-breed and best VM-integrated information infrastructure provider. This is winning us new customers, who need a vendor who can do more than just Phase 1 storage. EMC consistently stands out as the best candidate for consolidations like this in the mid-tier because of our affinity with virtualized environments, because of the simplicity of our unified systems and because our market leading backup solutions that span customer's backup requirements. 
A great example in Q4 of a win due to these advantages came as Momentive Performance Materials. This large silicon producer standardized upon VMware and View across the enterprise and was looking to standardize infrastructure for their remote data centers as well. With our simple, efficient and VMware-integrated mi-dtier unified product, as well as Avamar in our arsenal, we were selected as their storage standard globally. 
We expect cases like this to become much more prevalent in 2011, with our refreshed and expanded mid-tier product set. Having earned the trust of thousands of mid-tier customers with platinum storage products and services in their main production and disaster recovery environments, we are focused on expanding our footprint into departmental and remote offices. Our VNXe line will be very important here, as well as in reaching down market into the SMB space.
Our Backup Recovery Systems division, which includes Data Domain, Avamar and Networker continue to fire on all cylinders. Our resounding success here stems from our differentiated deduplication technology and also from the EMC effect, which is our ability to deleverage our brand, our focus on research and development, and our global sales infrastructure to maximize the ROI from our acquisitions. The aforementioned customer examples are great illustration of this affect. Our market-leading dedup technology sought after by customers frustrated by antiquated backup approaches. This challenge is now so common to our backup offerings have become a natural additional solution in accounts where the initial engagement was something entirely different.
This same approach is being applied to our acquisitions of Isilon and Greenplum. Our model is to select differentiated technology that adds clear value to customers in rapidly growing adjacent markets that are complementary to our own and then broaden its reach to exposure to our global sales channels, the backing of the EMC brand and other investments to maximize value.
This strategy augments our portfolio to meet the challenges of big data and helps to solidify our position as the cloud technology provider of choice. Early indicators of the success of this strategy are all good. Greenplum did very well in Q4, and we're especially pleased with the fast ramp of the Data Computing Appliance. Built on Greenplum technology, the Data Computing Appliance combined leading innovation in workload management, fault tolerance, and advanced analytics with the fastest data loading on the market today, which is important given the vast amount of source data needed to run analytics. Customers value all this plus the fact they can get the DCA  up and running very quickly.
Isilon's momentum continued with record revenue in Q4 on stand-alone basis, well above the company's expectations prior to the acquisition. In its six generation, Isilon scale-out technology has matured and is mainstream, enterprise ready, and meeting the big data challenges that characterize today's IT environment in a growing number of vertical markets. This is a great momentum even before the benefit of the EMC effect.
On a going forward basis, Isilon will be included in our mid-tier storage number, but it was not included in our Q4 revenue as we closed this transaction very late in the quarter. Complementary to Isilon is our Atmos offering, which uniquely focuses on globally distributed environments with object interfaces to data. We remain confident that the two together will reach a $1 billion annual run rate during the second half of 2012.
Our services organization is definitely benefiting from the transition to cloud architectures as cloud-related consulting engagements increased over 40% in Q4. As customers build out private cloud infrastructures and even begin to bridge towards utilizing the capabilities public clouds have to offer, EMC's trusted advisors have pooled in, helped customers architect the foundation for delivering IT-As-A-Service, a trend which even further increases EMC's relevance in next-generation data centers.
One of the fastest and easiest ways to accelerate the transition to cloud architecture is with the Vblock, and the strong VCE momentum we experienced in Q3 has only accelerated in Q4 with the number of deals closed more than doubling quarter-on-quarter. As expected, deployments span a lot of these cases and verticals and are happening globally as a converged infrastructure is universally appealing. Vblocks enable customers to get cloud infrastructures up and running on best-of-breed technology in a fraction of the time required by traditional deployments of competitive technology stacks. Referenced architectures or technology alliances that put fort to compete with Vblock are still do-it-yourself assemblies, and lack the very advantage that make Vblocks popular, one SKU, pre-configured with a single manager interface and ready to deploy. A Vblock is best-of-breed technology that dramatically simplifies cloud deployments and customers are embracing it.
Vblock customers in Q4 includes service providers like Sonda Brazil, our first official VCE partner in Brazil, who'll be offering new cloud computing services to its customer based upon Vblocks. And Harris Corporation, which is investing in its cyber integration center to offer trusted enterprise cloud solutions to its customers. 
Corporations build out private cloud architectures are standardized on Vblocks as well. With Vblocks, customers can efficiently deploy highly secured cloud-based applications for business innovation, whilst reducing the capital and operating expenses associated with procuring, deploying and maintaining IT. The benefits to EMC of VCE are important. The majority of VCE deals are incremental to EMC, in addition to our traditional best-of-breed storage solutions, we now complete with the integrated plays with our best-of-breed converged infrastructure. Now we're positioned to win both ways.
Our RSA Security division finished 2010 with all-time record Q4 revenues of $209 million, up 28% year-on-year, driven by strength across product lines and geographies. RSA achieved excellent growth in 2010 with revenue growth accelerating every quarter this year. This strength stems from the fact that security continues to be foremost priority for CIOs and also from RSA's thought leadership and product leadership within security. Part of our competitive advantage is that many of our offerings span both physical and virtual infrastructures, which is ideal as customers build out their clouds. As cloud environments grow in popularity, the built-in security RSA provides is increasingly relevant. RSA will continue to stand apart with offerings to enable IT departments and cloud provider alike not only to ensure compliance and security but to prove it as well.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was roughly flat in Q4, as customers transitioned from purchasing enterprise-wide content management solutions to application-centric solutions with Documentum xCP. We believe we have a lot of the right assets to address the enormous opportunity to be had in the capture, management and governance of unstructured data. Information governance is increasingly a focus for corporations today while industries like insurance and healthcare are demanding case management solutions like those built on our xCP platform.
VMware grew 38% in the quarter to a record $835 million as customers are eager to benefit from the efficiency and agility that VMware's product set enables. VMWare is making good progress in expanding its markets globally. We're expanding footprint within the data centers as well. Approximately 30% of the data center server applications on average, are virtualized today. We expect this figure to climb over 50% within the next two years.
VMWare will continue to leverage its unique basic technology assets to expand the technical and market leadership position we hold today. We have freelance strategy focused for modernizing infrastructure, applications and end user computing, VMware is positioned at the core of the movement to IT-As-A-Service.
Looking more closely at our financials. It is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets, which we've been assembling over last several years is resulting in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. Overall, we grew revenue in Q4 19% to $4.9 billion reflecting solid double-digit growth from all of our geographies and especially our BRIC + 13 market, which grew over 30%. The higher value we're delivering to customers is translating to better profitability for us. Non-GAAP gross margins increased 140 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points year-on-year to an impressive 61.9%, driven by volume and mix shift towards higher margin products. This expansion, coupled with ongoing efficiency gains in our operating expenses drove non-GAAP operating margin of 300 basis points year-on-year to a very, very solid 25.4%. These improvements drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.42, up 27% from $0.33 a year ago. We ended the year with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. Partly driving this cash balance was a 31% growth of free cash flow in 2010 from last year to a full year free cash flow of $3.4 billion. This is well above non-GAAP net income for the period and a very good results. 
We've also been investing some of this cash in our future, including $2.3 billion on acquisitions in Q4 with a 2010 total of $3.2 billion. This investment in key technologies, products and businesses, adds to our portfolio and drives growth. In the consolidating IT market, the strength of our balance sheet to make these investments is very important. We've also been returning cash to our shareholders via share purchases. In Q4, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of EMC for approximately $200 million. In 2010, we returned $1 billion to shareholders via our repurchase program. In addition, in 2010, we spent a small amount of $399 million to purchase VMware shares while VMware spent $339 million on sales on share repurchases. Given VMware's position as the cloud data center operating system of the future, we believe our relatively small approach just to maintain our ownership level are an excellent long-term investment.
Turning now to 2011. The global economic outlook, while it could be better, is certainly a bit brighter than it was last year at this time. Joe will give you some more color about what we expect. What is clear is that the vast opportunity available to us at the crossroads of the mega trends of cloud computing and big data. 
EMC is particularly well-positioned to take advantage  of this opportunity with a refreshed product portfolio that meets customers needs for efficiency and simplicity. A services organization that's one of the most trusted in the industry, one of the most advanced and capable go to market organizations in the industry, a strong and growing partner ecosystem and are expanding role as a trusted cloud technology provider across the globe. We had never been better positioned. This alignment of IT trends with our capabilities gives us a high level of confidence and strong momentum as we look ahead. As a result, in 2011, we expect to grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion to expand non-GAAP operating margin around 100 basis points to approximately 23%. This is on top with the significant improvements we made in 2010. To grow non-GAAP net income, 20% to approximately $3.25 billion; to grow non-GAAP EPS 16% to $1.46; and to increase our buyback of EMC shares for $1 billion in 2010 to $1.5 billion in 2011.
There are additional assumptions and expectations in our earnings release. But I’d like to take a moment and point on a couple here. First, I’d like to point out an accounting requirement that has an increasingly meaningful impact on our fully diluted share count and therefore on our EPS calculation. The impact comes from the accounting for our outstanding convertible debt. As the EMC stock price goes above the $16.08 exercised price of the convertible, accounting rules results in an increase in our calculated fully diluted shares. In other words, the stock price going up is leading to the accounting calculation for the number of fully diluted shares to also go up.
You will probably want to be mindful of this impact as it can be quite large, whilst the debt is outstanding. For example, assuming an average stock price of $25, this would result in approximately 75 million shares added to the fully diluted share counts.
Based upon our non-GAAP net income expectations for 2011, this would equal $0.05 per share. This $0.05 is pretty meaningful compared to the 2010 impact of only $0.02 per share. Taking as example a step further, the comparison of non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 versus $1.26, which represents 16% growth in 2011 would instead be $1.51 versus $1.28 or 18% growth, i.e., higher EPS and high EPS growth. I believe this is very important for you to understand because while this accounting impact has significant impacts on diluted non-GAAP earnings per share, the impact will be going away upon maturity of the convertible debt due to the hedges we have in place.
In other words if a debt had already reached maturity, these accounting shares would not be in the calculation. So it is an important factor to keep in mind, and we've included a table in our supplemental schedule that illustrates the impact of share price changes on our diluted share count due to this accounting treatment of our convertible debts. One other consideration in regard to your modeling for 2011 is the non-operating expense line. We expect to increase by roughly $25 million from $75 million in 2010 to $100 million in 2011. The primary driver of this increase is our additional investment in VCE.
In conclusion, with our commitment to continue our triple play, our reinvesting for growth, gaining market share, and delivering leverage, we head into the year with a major focus on reinforcing our position as the provider of choice for cloud infrastructures. So, while we expect to continue our excellent track record in 2011, more importantly, we're also establishing EMC strategically for the long term. There is no shortage of market opportunity, and we've never been better positioned.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter, and the vast opportunities that lie ahead."

I would like to begin by adding my welcome to everyone who has joined us for today's conference call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q4, and I am proud to report that Q4 capped a truly strong year for EMC in 2010. A year marked by rapid growth, market share gains, financial leverage and significant investment in technology innovation. Even more important is the fact that in 2010, we positioned ourselves very well, not only for 2011 but well beyond.
I would like to publicly congratulate the 49,000 people of EMC and VMware on their many accomplishments and thank them for their leadership, their laser focus on our customers and for their dedication. And on their behalf, I would like you to know that they are charged-up and excited about our future prospects. For sure, EMC and VMware are clear front leaders with compelling technology that would help our customers on their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, which will enable the massive benefits that IT-As-A-Service has to offer, mainly, increased agility and significantly lower costs.
Today, I will not talk much about our cloud strategies or our innovative products, services or partners, as in exactly two weeks from today, we are hosting a strategic forum for investors and analysts. Paul, Rich [ph] and I like would like to invite you to join us for this event in person in Boston or via the web.
I would now like to make a few comments on the 2011 macro environment and contrast this outlook with what we saw one year ago as we began 2010. Last year at this time, we said we expected IT spending to grow 3% to 5% in 2010, and we've said EMC's TAM or total addressable market, would grow considerably faster in the 6% to 8% range. We also said on that call that EMC's plan for 2010 was to gain share and we set our goal to grow faster than our TAM. Our 2010 target was $16 billion, which represented a 14% growth. We now believe IT spending grew in the 7% to 8% range in 2010. EMC's consolidated TAM grew 10% to 12%, and EMC grew 21% or to be totally fair, a little over 19% on an apples-to-apples acquisition-adjusted basis. 
For 2011, our forecast is for EMC global IT spending to increase 5% to 7% and EMC's TAM to grow in the 8% to 10% range. And as David has said, our plan is for a 15% growth to $19.6 billion, while growing non-GAAP EPS to $1.46 per share, an increase of 16%.
As is our custom, the outlook we provided you today of $19.6 billion in revenue and $1.46 per share is exactly the same numbers our Board of Directors has approved for management's plan. Additionally, EMC's Board will also approve a free cash flow goal for management at our upcoming board meeting, which we will share with you in our proxy.
In 2011, we will focus on growing faster than the markets we serve, plus taking share, provide financial leverage and continue our investments in innovative products and solutions, and as always, we will strive to meet and beat our plan. So what gives us confidence in our future? First is our belief in our cloud/IT-As-A-Service vision, which is tightly coupled with a very developed strategy for private, public, and hybrid cloud computing. Second is the incredibly rich, and I do mean, incredibly rich product lineup and roadmap we had going for us in 2011. 
Third, the timing of that product roadmap. For starters, the fact that one week ago today, we launched a record breaking 41 new and enhanced storage products. This gives our sales force and channel partners virtually entire year to sell these high value products. And by the way, we’re far from done. There are many more exciting products, which we will launch throughout 2011. Fourth, is our preparedness to take those products to market and delight our customers via our well trained and motivated people, via our technology and service partners, via our channel and distribution partners, via our program, and via our VCE coalition with Cisco which is now 700 people strong. Our best-of-breed convert infrastructure products and message is resonating very well with customers as VCE continues to outperform its plan by a considerable margin.

Customer started then getting enough confidence, and most customers now are in Phase 2 where they're now getting those same kind of benefits by moving their mission critical apps. And that’s going quite well. And that’s the phase we’re in now, and probably we'll stay in most of the year, all year in my opinion. A few leading-edge customers, and getting into next year, customers will want to move to more IT-As-A-Service self portals, giving users more agility, giving users more control, making the applications run under a set of metrics that are policy and service level based. Then that kind of that's where this journey is headed. So, I would say we're just in the beginnings of step two. Two interesting data points, right now there are more -- as server shipments go more, applications are running on -- not as server shipments, as applications go, more applications now are running on virtualized servers than they are on physical servers. So that kind of chasm was crossed in actually in 2009 and that trend is continuing to grow. That being said, the potential that customers could virtualize, they are about 30% there on that journey. So again, pretty healthy data points. The ROIs are fantastic, and the quality of the virtualized infrastructure from VMware is fantastic and customers are going to continue to invest there. And also as you know, that has a tremendous impact on security and storage and protection, which we take care of from the EMC side of the family. So, all signs are good."

I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter to finish off a year of excellent operational and financial results. Q4 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow are all new quarterly records for EMC. We also achieved a record-breaking year in 2010, with revenue of $17 billion, an increase of 21%. Non-GAAP operating margin for the full year of 22%, up 460 basis points; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.26, up 40% from 2009; and free cash flow of $3.4 billion, up 31% and 27% higher than non-GAAP net income.
2010 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow are also new annual records for EMC as well. Clearly, our vision and strategy are on target. The market is primed and ready, and we have the right assets to help our customers on their journey to the cloud. As a result, in 2010, we executed on our triple play to simultaneously invest meaningfully in our business, take market share and improve profitability.
First, looking at the investments we made in our business. We stepped up investing in research and development by 16% to approximately $2 billion, including software development costs that were capitalized. We invested $3.2 billion on key acquisitions, targeted at high growth areas and invested substantially in our go-to-market capabilities, including our international sales infrastructure and expanding our channel network.
Secondly, the market share gains we achieved were impressive, with faster market growth in areas like virtualization, security and storage, with especially strong share gains in back-up and archiving and in the high-end. For the full year 2010, we grew 21%, almost twice what we estimate was the growth for our total available market.
Finally, even while investing in our business for growth and achieving sizable market share gains, we were still able to deliver a substantial leverage for our business in 2010. Products designed to deliver greater value, services driven more efficiently and faster growth in our higher-margin businesses all contributed to a 340 basis point gain in non-GAAP gross margin over last year.
The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was even greater, up 460 basis points to 22% for the full year due to the operating expense efficiencies we also achieved. Let me point out that these are also very strong gains over 2008.
As we head into 2011, we're even better prepared to see the potential in front of us than we were in 2010 as we have expanded our market opportunity with the acquisitions of Greenplum and Isilon. We've extended our reach down market with the addition of a VNXe family of storage systems. And we've put an even greater distance between ourselves and our competitors across our storage portfolio with a newly refreshed and unified mid-tier storage family, new and enhanced products in our backup and archiving offering and valuable new software offerings for our flagship VMAX, to name just a few.
By building out the strongest product portfolio in our history, we've positioned ourselves in the intersection of two of the most sweeping trends in IT: cloud computing and big data. This is where we expect 2011 to be another record revenue year with continued improvements in profitability. We are confident we can grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion, expand non-GAAP operating margin by about 100 basis points to approximately 23%, grow non-GAAP net income 20% to approximately $3.25 billion, grow non-GAAP earnings per share 16% to $1.46 and continue to meaningfully grow our strong free cash flow.
This is remarkable growth, particularly for a company of our size and also considering the very high bar we set ourselves in 2010. We also remain committed to double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the next several years.
In addition to the continued growth of enterprise data, our progress is being driven by the convergence of two major trends in IT, cloud computing and big data. Cloud computing can also be described as IT-As-A-Service, leveraging on on-demand, self-reliant virtualized infrastructure to deliver IT-As-A-Service, cloud computing is more efficient, flexible and cost-effective. And while customers are eager to deploy cloud architectures so they can begin capturing the efficiencies cloud computing affords, this is not a transformation that happens overnight, but happens in phases.
Phase 1 is the virtualization of smaller departmental often an IT-owned applications, frequently with simple, efficient VM integrated mid-tier storage. Cost efficiencies are primary benefit here and we saw a large number of customers passing through this phase in 2010. On average, customers have virtualized about 30% of their applications, and are now entering Phase 2. Phase 2 is the virtualization of business-critical applications, ideally with more resilient infrastructure that meets demanding SOAs for performance, availability, workload mobility, recoverability and security. More and more customers are entering into this phase heading into 2011.
Well over half of the company's applications will be virtualized once a customer has completely passed through this phase of the journey to the cloud.
Phase 3 is when a customer is finally leveraging all the power of a fully virtualized environment to provide IT-As-A-Service with automation, provisioning and charge back, and drawing on compatible public cloud services where it makes sense. The early adopters are always just dying to get here. And as a customer's cloud infrastructure develops, they look to building technologies that will secure and protect their operations whilst achieving benefits and agility than ever before. This means best-of-breed and well-integrated capabilities for things like security and backup.
Such transitions to the cloud are becoming the norm, and the vast majority of customers are at some point in their transformation to IT-As-A-Service. What is important is that whether customers are just entering the first phase or well into the third, we have the product portfolio and the service expertise to accompany them every step of the way.
The second major trend that will drive our results in 2011 is big data, which is a primary contributor to the staggering pace of data growth. When we talk about big data, we are referring to the enormous repositories of corporate and external data, including unstructured information created by social media and other web repositories. We're also talking about the associated analytics that unlock the value contained within these massive amounts of data. Big data differs from the transactional and small file data and applications that have traditionally characterized the company's data center. It tends to be more sequential, less transactional and much, much bigger, measured in petabytes rather than terabytes. The tools and platforms surrounding big data require new approaches and capabilities to handle these data sets. With the investments we've made through the acquisitions of Isilon and Greenplum, as well as in our own Atmos offering, we are now squarely positioned to capture much of this large and growing incremental market opportunity.
Overall, given our strong basic technology assets base both broad and deep with virtualization optimization that is second to none, we are becoming the partner of choice as customers consolidate and build out new data centers, either for their own private clouds or to offer cloud services to their customers.
Now that I've given you a sense of what's driving our success in 2010 and going forward, let's look at our Q4 numbers in greater detail. Overall, storage revenue growth accelerates to 17% as we continue to gain share by enlarging our footprint in the data center, as well as through new customer acquisition. Customers choose EMC storage because they want efficiency, simplicity and performance, and EMC delivers. We deliver efficiency through features like FAST VP software, which stands for Fully Automated Storage Tiering with virtual pools, and which automatically optimizes systems and vastly lowers TCO. We deliver simplicity exemplified by our advanced yet easy-to-use Unisphere interface in our mid-tier storage. We deliver performance with unparalleled VM integration of virtual provisioning across our portfolio and as this recent survey indicates, we continue to standout as the storage  vendor of choice in virtualized environments.
These differentiators, along with product quality, service and support that are consistently the best in the industry, helps us extend our storage market leadership position in Q4. Our Symmetrix product revenues grew 19% in Q4, there are a couple of key differentiating features here that make our VMAX line so popular. The first of these is its x86 -based scale-out architecture purpose built for virtual environments. This evolution of an architecture to incorporate industry-standard processes enables  us to very quickly leverage the improvements made to processes to deliver faster, more reliable and more efficient performance. The second feature that sets it apart from alternatives is our ability to fully leverage Solid State Drive in enterprise storage. We were the first to deliver the value to be had from Solid State Drive and enterprise storage three years ago this month, and we continued to add value with our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software. The latest version of which automatically optimizes systems and delivers up to 40% more application performance and 40% lower cost compared to single tiered systems.
EMC alone is able to deliver this value with Solid State Drives and customers are embracing this value with penetration rates of Solid State Drives and FAST on VMAX climbing once again in Q4. When you add these two features together, the end result is a powerful, trusted and highly efficient high-end platform with a value proposition that customers love. 
This demonstrated ability to innovate in ways that respond to customer needs is translating into market share. In fact, we think that when all the numbers are in for the year, we will have registered our biggest annual share gains in the high end in at least 10 years, which is a testament to the power of our offerings here. As customers consolidate district data centers into new environments meant to support cloud deployments either public or private, they choose VMAX because of its highly scalable, usable protecting capacity and a small footprint made possible by cutting edge efficiency technologies. We had numerous examples across the globe in Q4 of customers selecting VMAX for their virtualized environments because of these advantages. With sizeable wins in all verticals of all types, including at a healthcare authority in British Columbia, telecom providers in India and Israel, an energy company in the U.K., a government in the Middle East and a large manufacturer right here in Massachusetts.
Let me give you an example from this past quarter that illustrates why VMAX is the high-end platform of choice. One of the largest plastic manufacturers in the world recently consolidated to three main data centers globally and was looking to replace the entire storage infrastructure in Europe. Because they had to use VMware for server and desktop virtualization, VM integration was a chief consideration for the storage they selected. 
Our ability to provide highly reliable and scalable storage solution, highly integrated with vCenter was key to displacing Hitachi here. Moreover, our robust backup offerings and our integration with VMware's virtual disk development API enabled us to become this customer's global backup standard as well. They're now using Avamar, Networker and Data Domain to meet their backup requirements which, like many customers, vary throughout the global environments.
Mid-tier product revenue grew 23% in Q4 and was up 20% from Q3, representing a healthy acceleration from the sequential growth of 5% last quarter. This was especially encouraging as our product refresh coming in Q1 was hardly a secret. While we continue to have customers approach the EMC for traditional network storage requirements, we also saw strong growth from customers working through early phase or departmental deployments of virtualization. Our long list of mid-tier competitive takeouts in virtualized environments in Q4 attest this is happening across the globe in just about every vertical, with customers range from health care, tech and Internet to manufacturing, government and transportation. 
As customers virtualize their data centers and standardize their consolidated environments on to a small number of trusted vendors, EMC stands out as the best-of-breed and best VM-integrated information infrastructure provider. This is winning us new customers, who need a vendor who can do more than just Phase 1 storage. EMC consistently stands out as the best candidate for consolidations like this in the mid-tier because of our affinity with virtualized environments, because of the simplicity of our unified systems and because our market leading backup solutions that span customer's backup requirements. 
A great example in Q4 of a win due to these advantages came as Momentive Performance Materials. This large silicon producer standardized upon VMware and View across the enterprise and was looking to standardize infrastructure for their remote data centers as well. With our simple, efficient and VMware-integrated mid-tier unified products, as well as Avamar in our arsenal, we were selected as their storage standard globally. 
We expect cases like this to become much more prevalent in 2011, with our refreshed and expanded mid-tier product set. Having earned the trust of thousands of mid-tier customers with platinum storage products and services in their main production and disaster recovery environments, we are focused on expanding our footprint into departmental and remote offices. Our VNXe line will be very important here, as well as in reaching down market into the SMB space.
Our Backup Recovery Systems division, which includes Data Domain, Avamar and Networker continue to fire on all cylinders. Our resounding success here stems from our differentiated deduplication technology and also from the EMC effect, which is our ability to deleverage our brand, our focus on research and development, and our global sales infrastructure to maximize the ROI from our acquisitions. The aforementioned customer examples are great illustration of this affect. Our market-leading dedup technology sought after by customers frustrated by antiquated backup approaches. This challenge is now so common to our backup offerings have become a natural additional solution in accounts where the initial engagement was something entirely different.
This same approach is being applied to our acquisitions of Isilon and Greenplum. Our model is to select differentiated technology that adds clear value to customers in rapidly growing adjacent markets that are complementary to our own and then broaden its reach to exposure to our global sales channels, the backing of the EMC brand and other investments to maximize value.
This strategy augments our portfolio to meet the challenges of big data and helps to solidify our position as the cloud technology provider of choice. Early indicators of the success of this strategy are all good. Greenplum did very well in Q4, and we're especially pleased with the fast ramp of the Data Computing Appliance. Built on Greenplum technology, the Data Computing Appliance combined leading innovation in workload management, fault tolerance, and advanced analytics with the fastest data loading on the market today, which is important given the vast amount of source data needed to run analytics. Customers value all this plus the fact they can get the DCA  up and running very quickly.
Isilon's momentum continued with record revenue in Q4 on stand-alone basis, well above the company's expectations prior to the acquisition. In its six generation, Isilon scale-out technology has matured and is mainstream, enterprise ready, and meeting the big data challenges that characterize today's IT environments in a growing number of vertical markets. This is a great momentum even before the benefit of the EMC effect.
On a going forward basis, Isilon will be included in our mid-tier storage number, but it was not included in our Q4 revenue as we closed this transaction very late in the quarter. Complementary to Isilon is our Atmos offering, which uniquely focuses on globally distributed environments with object interfaces to data. We remain confident that the two together will reach a $1 billion annual run rate during the second half of 2012.
Our services organization is definitely benefiting from the transition to cloud architectures as cloud-related consulting engagements increased over 40% in Q4. As customers build out private cloud infrastructures and even begin to bridge towards utilizing the capabilities public clouds have to offer, EMC's trusted advisors have pooled in, helped customers architect the foundation for delivering IT-As-A-Service, a trend which even further increases EMC's relevance in next-generation data centers.
One of the fastest and easiest ways to accelerate the transition to cloud architecture is with the Vblock, and the strong VCE momentum we experienced in Q3 has only accelerated in Q4 with the number of deals closed more than doubling quarter-on-quarter. As expected, deployments span a lot of these cases and verticals and are happening globally as a converged infrastructure is universally appealing. Vblocks enable customers to get cloud infrastructures up and running on best-of-breed technology in a fraction of the time required by traditional deployments of competitive technology stacks. Referenced architectures or technology alliances that put fort to compete with Vblock are still do-it-yourself assemblies, and lack the very advantage that make Vblocks popular, one SKU, pre-configured with a single manager interface and ready to deploy. A Vblock is best-of-breed technology that dramatically simplifies cloud deployments and customers are embracing it.
Vblock customers in Q4 include service providers like Sonda Brazil, our first official VCE partner in Brazil, who'll be offering new cloud computing services to its customer based upon Vblocks. And Harris Corporation, which is investing in its cyber integration center to offer trusted enterprise cloud solutions to its customers. 
Corporations build out private cloud architectures are standardized on Vblocks as well. With Vblocks, customers can efficiently deploy highly secured cloud-based applications for business innovation, whilst reducing the capital and operating expenses associated with procuring, deploying and maintaining IT. The benefits to EMC of VCE are important. The majority of VCE deals are incremental to EMC, in addition to our traditional best-of-breed storage solutions, we now complete with the integrated plays with our best-of-breed converged infrastructure. Now we're positioned to win both ways.
Our RSA Security division finished 2010 with all-time record Q4 revenues of $209 million, up 28% year-on-year, driven by strength across product lines and geographies. RSA achieved excellent growth in 2010 with revenue growth accelerating every quarter this year. This strength stems from the fact that security continues to be foremost priority for CIOs and also from RSA's thought leadership and product leadership within security. Part of our competitive advantage is that many of our offerings span both physical and virtual infrastructures, which is ideal as customers build out their clouds. As cloud environments grow in popularity, the built-in security RSA provides is increasingly relevant. RSA will continue to stand apart with offerings to enable IT departments and cloud provider alike not only to ensure compliance and security but to prove it as well.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was roughly flat in Q4, as customers transitioned from purchasing enterprise-wide content management solutions to application-centric solutions with Documentum xCP. We believe we have a lot of the right assets to address the enormous opportunity to be had in the capture, management and governance of unstructured data. Information governance is increasingly a focus for corporations today while industries like insurance and healthcare are demanding case management solutions like those built on our xCP platform.
VMware grew 38% in the quarter to a record $835 million as customers are eager to benefit from the efficiency and agility that VMware's product set enables. VMWare is making good progress in expanding its market globally. We're expanding footprint within the data centers as well. Approximately 30% of a data center server applications on average, are virtualized today. We expect this figure to climb over 50% within the next two years.
VMWare will continue to leverage its unique basic technology assets to expand the technical and market leadership position we hold today. We have freelance strategy focused for modernizing infrastructure, applications and end user computing, VMware is positioned at the core of the movement to IT-As-A-Service.
Looking more closely at our financials. It is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets, which we've been assembling over last several years is resulting in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. Overall, we grew revenue in Q4 19% to $4.9 billion reflecting solid double-digit growth from all of our geographies and especially our BRIC + 13 markets, which grew over 30%. The higher value we're delivering to customers is translating to better profitability for us. Non-GAAP gross margins increased 140 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points year-on-year to an impressive 61.9%, driven by volume and mix shift towards higher margin products. This expansion, coupled with ongoing efficiency gains in our operating expenses drove non-GAAP operating margin of 300 basis points year-on-year to very solid 25.4%. These improvements drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.42, up 27% from $0.33 a year ago. We ended the year with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. Partly driving this cash balance was a 31% growth of free cash flow in 2010 from last year to a full year free cash flow of $3.4 billion. This is well above non-GAAP net income for the period and a very good results. 
We've also been investing some of this cash in our future, including $2.3 billion on acquisitions in Q4 with a 2010 total of $3.2 billion. This investment in key technologies, products and businesses, adds to our portfolio and drives growth. In the consolidating IT market, the strength of our balance sheet to make these investments is very important. We've also been returning cash to our shareholders via share purchases. In Q4, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of EMC for approximately $200 million. In 2010, we returned $1 billion to shareholders via our repurchase program. In addition, in 2010, we spent a small amount of $399 million to purchase VMware shares while VMware spent $339 million themselves on share repurchases. Given VMware's position as the cloud data center operating system of the future, we believe our relatively small approach just to maintain our ownership level are an excellent long-term investments.
Turning now to 2011. The global economic outlook, while it could be better, is certainly a bit brighter than it was last year at this time. Joe will give you some more color about what we expect. What is clear is that the vast opportunity available to us at the crossroads of the mega trends of cloud computing and big data. 
EMC is particularly well-positioned to take advantage  of this opportunity with a refreshed product portfolio that meets customers needs for efficiency and simplicity. A services organization that's one of the most trusted in the industry, one of the most advanced and capable go to market organizations in the industry, a strong and growing partner ecosystem and our expanding role as a trusted cloud technology provider across the globe. We had never been better positioned. This alignment of IT trends with our capabilities gives us a high level of confidence and strong momentum as we look ahead. As a result, in 2011, we expect to grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion to expand non-GAAP operating margin around 100 basis points to approximately 23%. This is on top of the significant improvements we made in 2010. To grow non-GAAP net income, 20% to approximately $3.25 billion; to grow non-GAAP EPS 16% to $1.46; and to increase our buyback of EMC shares for $1 billion in 2010 to $1.5 billion in 2011.
There are additional assumptions and expectations in our earnings release. But I’d like to take a moment and point on a couple here. First, I’d like to point out an accounting requirement that has an increasingly meaningful impact on our fully diluted share count and therefore on our EPS calculation. The impact comes from the accounting for our outstanding convertible debt. As the EMC stock price goes above the $16.08 excise price of the convertible, accounting rules results in an increase in our calculated fully diluted shares. In other words, the stock price going up is leading to the accounting calculation for the number of fully diluted shares to also go up.
You will probably want to be mindful of this impact as it can be quite large, whilst the debt is outstanding. For example, assuming an average stock price of $25, this would result in approximately 75 million shares added to the fully diluted share counts.
Based upon our non-GAAP net income expectations for 2011, this would equal $0.05 per share. This $0.05 is pretty meaningful compared to the 2010 impact of only $0.02 per share. Taking this example a step further, the comparison of non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 versus $1.26, which represents 16% growth in 2011 would instead be $1.51 versus $1.28 or 18% growth, i.e., higher EPS and high EPS growth. I believe this is very important for you to understand because while this accounting impact has significant impacts on diluted non-GAAP earnings per share, the impact will be going away upon maturity of the convertible debt due to the hedges we have in place.
In other words if a debt had already reached maturity, these accounting shares would not be in the calculation. So it is an important factor to keep in mind, and we've included a table in our supplemental schedule that illustrates the impact of share price changes on our diluted share count due to this accounting treatment of our convertible debt. One other consideration in regard to our modeling for 2011 is the non-operating expense line. We expect to increase by roughly $25 million from $75 million in 2010 to $100 million in 2011. The primary driver of this increase is our additional investment in VCE.
In conclusion, with our commitment to continue our triple play, our reinvesting for growth, gaining market share, and delivering leverage, we head into the year with a major focus on reinforcing our position as the provider of choice for cloud infrastructures. So, while we expect to continue our excellent track record in 2011, more importantly, we're also establishing EMC strategically for the long term. There is no shortage of market opportunity, and we've never been better positioned.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter, and the vast opportunities that lie ahead."

I would like to begin by adding my welcome to everyone who has joined us for today's conference call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q4, and I am proud to report that Q4 capped a truly strong year for EMC in 2010. A year marked by rapid growth, market share gains, financial leverage and significant investment in technology innovation. Even more important is the fact that in 2010, we positioned ourselves very well, not only for 2011 but well beyond.
I would like to publicly congratulate the 49,000 people of EMC and VMware on their many accomplishments and thank them for their leadership, their laser focus on our customers and for their dedication. And on their behalf, I would like you to know that they are charged-up and excited about our future prospects. For sure, EMC and VMware are clear front leaders with compelling technology that would help our customers on their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, which will enable the massive benefits that IT-As-A-Service has to offer, mainly, increased agility and significantly lower costs.
Today, I will not talk much about our cloud strategies or our innovative products, services or partners, as in exactly two weeks from today, we are hosting a strategic forum for investors and analysts. Paul, Rich [ph] and I like would like to invite you to join us for this event in person in Boston or via the web.
I would now like to make a few comments on the 2011 macro environment and contrast this outlook with what we saw one year ago as we began 2010. Last year at this time, we said we expected IT spending to grow 3% to 5% in 2010, and we've said EMC's TAM or total addressable market, would grow considerably faster in the 6% to 8% range. We also said on that call that EMC's plan for 2010 was to gain share and we set our goal to grow faster than our TAM. Our 2010 target was $16 billion, which represented a 14% growth. We now believe IT spending grew in the 7% to 8% range in 2010. EMC's consolidated TAM grew 10% to 12%, and EMC grew 21% or to be totally fair, a little over 19% on an apples-to-apples acquisition-adjusted basis. 
For 2011, our forecast is for EMC global IT spending to increase 5% to 7% and EMC's TAM to grow in the 8% to 10% range. And as David has said, our plan is for a 15% growth to $19.6 billion, while growing non-GAAP EPS to $1.46 per share, an increase of 16%.
As is our custom, the outlook we provided you today of $19.6 billion in revenue and $1.46 per share is exactly the same numbers our Board of Directors has approved for management's plan. Additionally, EMC's Board will also approve a free cash flow goal for management at our upcoming board meeting, which we will share with you in our proxy.
In 2011, we will focus on growing faster than the markets we serve, thus taking share, provide financial leverage and continue our investments in innovative products and solutions, and as always, we will strive to meet and beat our plan. So what gives us confidence in our future? First is our belief in our cloud/IT-As-A-Service vision, which is tightly coupled with a very developed strategy for private, public, and hybrid cloud computing. Second is the incredibly rich, and I do mean, incredibly rich product lineup and roadmap we had going for us in 2011. 
Third, the timing of that product roadmap. For starters, the fact that one week ago today, we launched a record breaking 41 new and enhanced storage products. This gives our sales force and channel partners virtually entire year to sell these high value products. And by the way, we’re far from done. There are many more exciting products, which we will launch throughout 2011. Fourth, is our preparedness to take those products to market and delight our customers via our well trained and motivated people, via our technology and service partners, via our channel and distribution partners, via our programs, and via our VCE coalition with Cisco which is now 700 people strong. Our best-of-breed convert infrastructure products and message is resonating very well with customers as VCE continues to outperform its plan by a considerable margin. Fifth, and very importantly, is our momentum and our will to win.
With that, I’ll now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today’s call. Tony."

Quite honestly, if we had more people with our consulting skill set, we could be doing more, even more than we’re doing right now. There is certainly a huge opportunity and a great appetite amongst our customers to help them layout those road maps. So we think it’s a very good leading indicator for how quickly people are going to move their technology forward as well."

To give you some evidence of that fact, the Dell OEM business with CLARiiON, our CLARiiON business to Dell that they OEM was down to approximately $55 million in Q4. As a reminder, Q4 has been historically our largest quarter of the year with Dell. So the Dell-driven revenue now, which is their OEM business, the one they drive by themselves, is actually getting quite small now. And I might add that our other channel, mid-tier channels grew over 44% in Q4. So, obviously, you can see where our major focus. Now that being said, we have thousands and thousands of joint customers with Dell that we sold together, and Dell sold using our products, and we will -- and a lot many of those customers expect us to work together. And for our part, we’re most willing to work together, and there are discussions underway. So while it's highly, highly unlikely, almost impossible that they'lll sell the VNXe. There are some considerations that they will resell VNX, and those discussions are undergoing, but I want to kind of end it where I started. It's a tactical partnership.

And that’s going quite well. And that’s the phase we’re in now, and probably we'll stay in most of the year, all year in my opinion. A few leading-edge customers, and getting into next year, customers will want to move to more [indiscernible] IT-As-A-Service self portals, giving users more agility, giving users more control, making the applications run under a set of metrics that are policy and service level based. Then that kind of that's where this journey is headed. So, I would say we're just in the beginnings of step two. Two interesting data points, right now there are more -- as server shipments go more, applications are running on -- not as server shipments, as applications go, more applications now are running on virtualized servers than they are on physical servers. So that kind of chasm was crossed in actually in 2009 and that trend is continuing to grow. That being said, the potential that customers could virtualize, they are about 30% there on that journey. So again, pretty healthy data points. The ROIs are fantastic, and the quality of the virtualized infrastructure from VMware is fantastic and customers are going to continue to invest there. And also as you know, that has a tremendous impact on security and storage and protection, which we take care of from the EMC side of the family. So, all signs are good."

We achieved record Q1 revenues of $4.6 billion, up 18% from last year's first quarter. And non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, up 19% over Q1 of last year. We improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin considerably for the first quarter last of year. And we achieved free cash flow of almost $860 million, well in excess of record Q1 non-GAAP net income of $700 million. We successfully executed on our financial triple play once again, gaining market share, investing in the future and improving profitability. We fully expect to continue realizing this triple play over the long term for two reasons.
One, we're in the early stages of the largest IT transformation in history which is creating enormous opportunities in cloud computing and big data. And two, we positioned ourselves to take full advantages of this opportunity by focusing on the transformation of IT infrastructure and applications. Customers recognize that their ability to compete is increasingly tied to the efficiency and agility of the IT operations, and their transition to cloud architectures to make their businesses more efficient, more flexible and more agile. To get there, they're seeking partners who can meet their requirements from start to finish. From their first Phase I server virtualization deployments through the Phase II large-scale ramping up of virtualization to include mission critical applications. Phase three implementation where IT is automated and offered as a service and well into the future.
Successfully navigating these faces could be challenging and doing so in the face of additional challenge created by the rise of big data makes it even more so. In addition to scalable yet manageable storage of terabytes of data, customers need to grow beyond and cons, continue to analyze and leverage the massive amounts of data generated from various sources such as on networks, the Web, consumers, surveillance systems and sensors. We are squarely focused on helping our customers take advantages of the rapid opportunities offered by both cloud and big data. And this focus drives us to continually identify and execute on opportunities that increase our value proposition to customers in this new world. As their IT needs gree larger and more complex and as more and more of the company's success is linked to IT, way of innovative and invested to come out in front of these needs. There is no other company in IT with the combination of market leading virtualization infrastructure assets that EMC has today. Getting to cloud, and for unlocking the value consider within the big data that surrounds us. Our virtualization and infrastructure assets are critically important for getting customers where they want to be. This is why EMC is a vendor of choice for organizations of every size and every vertical and it's a key reason why our opportunity is so vast.
Not only do we have an excellent base of technology assets, but we are expanding our reach by getting to market in many different ways. We're working directly with our customers to move them to cloud infrastructures and address their big data needs on their terms and timelines. We're investing in and expanding our channel to equip them to become more invaluable partners to their customers, we're looking to gain greater efficiencies from IT. We're working with dozens of service providers who want to deliver the efficiencies of IT as a scale for their customers and use best-of-breed technology to do so and we're meeting the rapidly expanding demand to converge IT infrastructures to VCE our joint venture.
In short, we're developing solutions and expanding our Go to Market in ways that are making it easier for the customer to take part in cloud computing and unlock the value of big data. There is a vast growth potential in the areas of where we compete and we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities at multiple levels. Given the strong growth we saw in the first quarter and the opportunity we see for the rest of the year, we are now more confident that we can meet and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, $1.46 non-GAAP EPS and $4 billion of free cash flow.
Now let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various lines of business, starting with information storage. Q1 information storage revenues were $3.4 billion, up 18%. For years, storage has been a top priority as information growth continues unabated. This phenomenon is purely on a growth out of fundamental level and is not likely to change anytime soon, but perhaps more important is the fact that these unbridled information growth has forced customers to seek mor efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data. The best solution for one customer may not be the best for another, which is why we continually strive to offer the very best in class technology tailored for various business requirements. Storage product revenues were up a robust 25% year-on-year, driven primarily by pent-up demand for the much-anticipated FAST VP software we announced in January. This, in turn, drove new the max system sales and upgrades. VMAX continues to be the smartest, most scalable and most efficient time storage system available in the markets and the ongoing introduction of unique capabilities such as flash, FAST end flex has led to tremendous growth since the introduction of max in April of 2009. The success and growth of this business has been great and given our share in the high end, it has resulted in higher expected growth in the market as well. While it's interesting to expect growth to moderate it is relatively mature market, we do expect to continue to grow faster than the market and gain share.
Our main reason we expect to continue to gain share is the ongoing introduction of unique and value-added capabilities such as FAST VP that I mentioned earlier. In Q1, we saw a steep increase in the sale of FAST licenses from Q4 and three quarters of the systems we shipped with FAST in Q1 used both flash and data. Clearly, customers have taken advantage of the value proposition offered by automated storage tiering and good reason as they able to achieve up to 40% more application performance, while significantly reducing the number of discs and power needed compared with single tier systems. This type of differentiation in value what will lead to our continued success in this market.
An excellent example in the quarter of how this differentiation is winning occurred with the rapidly growing IT service provider in Brazil. This company needs an infrastructure to support the VMware virtualized operating environment to host their customers platforms. Our mission-critical implementation their solution has to be proven, smart and ultra efficient, as well as perfectly suited for virtualized environments. With the ability to meet each of these requirements vmax was head and shoulders above the competition in this deal.
Our midtier storage revenue grew 20% in Q1, as our market-leading portfolio solutions offers important competitive distinctions in each of the areas it addresses. Looking across our broad set of capabilities in the mid tier, it is clear that our ability to meet the wide variety of mid to use cases is unique. We firmly believe that this strategic approach will continue to drive our success here. By keeping the value proposition of each offering very distinct, channel partners benefiting from selling the entire portfolio this is an important point and one of them which we are very focused.
In our traditional midtier storage space, our newly launch the NX family is being very well received by the markets. Our unified VMX props which is also part of our January announcements, started shipping the last week in February and was offered a strong start in March. NX represented over 50% of the traditional midtier orders we booked in the last two weeks in the quarter and we expect NX revenue to continue to ramp over the course of the year. It has a long list of advantages in this space really respond to. First it is simple, the market-leading capabilities of our file and block solutions are now combined into a single unified platform that is managed to a centralized and simple user interface. Also it is efficient, it is the only storage system that automates both file and block sub one tier with FAST VP the combination of this become pressure be duplication enables customers to significantly improve capacity efficiency. It was great to see that almost 50% of NX systems went out with flash capability which indicates customers are taking advantage of tiering. And finally, it is powerful by leveraging x86 -based multicore processor technology to maximize solutions throughput and bandwidth, the NX that it will record performance benchmark the network filed performance and overall response times. via Nexis is 3x faster than our previous generation of systems.
With the launch of NX, we drastically simplified our story software offerings by streamlining over 25 different software products into five suites. This has been extremely popular with our customers, as well as with channel partners as it's now much simpler to buy. The results was a dramatic increases in software penetration with NX and a deeper value proposition for our customers. In short, the NX feature set resonates the customers and was instrumental in winning several competitive deals in the quarter across a variety of verticals, including a telephone service provider building out infrastructure of the service for its client base, a bank needs to take advantage of information FAST and FAST Cache on to increase usable capacity and improve perfo at lowest costs. a restaurant chain looking for private cloud and a national police force where we were already a trusted provider and with NX we're able to display the incumbent vendor of this file storage.
We entered the SMB market in Q1 with the launch of VNXe which started shipping the 2nd week of March. The VNXe provides proven EMC quality into an affordable unified storage systems. We designed the to be easy to manage, easy to sell and easy to support with the features and functions you would expect from an EMC prop at a price you may not. the offers capabilities like advanced data reduction technology, automated technical support and efficient provisioning for mailboxes or VMware data stores at a enterprises it firmly establishes as the best value in the markets. Remember that this is a new prop in a new space being sold to new customers through new channel partners so it's going to take some time before we see a material benefit to our growth. However, we are pleased to report the VNXe is off to a strong start.
We are rapidly on boarding hundreds of new partners to sell the VNXe with existing channels. In fact, with VNXe launched events in dozens of cities across the globe, we signed on more new partners in the first quarter of this year than we signed on over the course of all of last year and the progress continues.
The significant majority of our midtier portfolio is sold via our channel partners and we are proud of the progress we're making here, particularly as our we have agreement with Dell declines less than $40 million of revenue in Q1. In response to feedback we solicited from our growing partner community just last week we announced several enhancements to our channel partner program to accelerate partner profitability. We'll continue to relationships in ways that are mutually beneficial both to EMC and to our channel partners.
Moving now to our backup recovery systems division which spans a variety of customer sizes, verticals and environments, VRS ability any backup environment helps explain this divisions consistently strong performance with our Data Domain products leading this growth. We expect this growth to continue especially given the ongoing enhancements we're making to our market-leading product lineup. On Monday, we announced the expansion of more for use in much larger production environments by integrating it with Data Domain technology. We also announced state-of-the-art VMWare backup enhancements year? VMware API to data protection and tight integration with BabyCenter, Apple Mark can now provide up to 3x the backupspeed of its nearest competitor. This is an excellent illustration of the EMC effect at its fullest means within EMC's existing accounts while leveraging the deep resource of EMC not only to connect with new customers, but also to drive valuable innovation as well.
We intend to use the power of the EMC effect to capture the opportunity presented by the big data with and data analytics as well. In the scale of that space, our iPhone storage have exceeded expectations in its first quarter within EMC. This is due to the merits of its highly differentiated technology with the global namespace, a multi-terabyte scalability, iPhone systems are designed to handle massive numbers of large files. In other words, big data. We continued to differentiate the iPhone technology. Last week, we launched our next-generation hardware and software. The systems incorporate greater tiering flexibility across S&B and SaaS and combined this tier backend with the large our next-generation core processors this technology improvements are leverage by innovations on the software side with significant enhancements to improve performance of mission critical data center operations and the recovery point objectives. The net effect is accelerated performance, throughput replication underscoring iPhone's market-leading position in scale.
Our technology advantage here is winning us new customers and getting us into environments where we're able to swap out competitors props that cannot be customer scalable requirements. iPhone is also seeing early examples of the EMC effects and benefiting from the strength of EMC's brand and global reach. A couple of large wins in China in Q1 illustrate why Isilon is a storage infrastructure of choice for and many big data applications in this case, the genomics. These customers need to make terabyte scale data sets simultaneously available to numerous instruments, users and data service. With Isilon, these customers are able to achieve unprecedented levels of both concurrent of sequential higher performance while saving significant time and capital costs.
Our data computing division continued to thrive in the big date analytics space, both recently recognized the RIM from architecture leadership in this space as our continued innovation, solid execution and strong cloud focus form the basis of our competitive advantage. With twice the data loading speed of its nearest competitor and the industry's best performance, the EMC data computing appliance foments more data analyzed faster and at lower costs. Because of these advantages, SaaS, the leader in business analytics software, recently announced the expansion of its high performance computing offerings on our data computing appliance. The combination of SaaS unique, analytic capabilities with comes massively powerful architecture in a complete purpose built appliance delivers a compelling value proposition to customers.
To sum up, our storage business has never been better positioned. Looking forward, we expect to see a bounce back of growth in the mid tier, driven by fourth quarter contributions from the new BX family and continued leadership in the high end. Again, our strength in storage comes from our ability to provide leading-edge technology to a broader range of customers cases and our proven track record and EMC emerges as the storage vendor of choice as customer transition to the cloud and navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by big data.
Our RSA Security revenues in Q1 were $174 million, up 8% year-on-year. We saw a strong growth from our GOC, data loss prevention and IPV solutions. This was somewhat offset by a pause in shipments as we reviewed and hard in our systems and responses to this sophisticated cyber attacks targeting RSAs that occurred in the first quarter. Customers are our first priority and RSA's and sales force are actively engaged in the customers and partners to address their questions and ensure they have the tools and support necessary to reinforce the security of their RSA Security ID environments. As you look ahead to the rest of the year, it is likely that we will give up some revenue growth within the RSA business in the short-term as we continue to work with customers and strengthen this ships in the long term.
This year's record attendance of the RSA conference which is the marquee security conference underscores the fact that the security challenges faced by IT organizations around the world are not going away. As the tax grow more sophisticated and targeted, customers need to defense mechanisms at multiple levels to defend against them. We deepened our RSA analytics and virtualization offerings early this month with the acquisition of net witness. This acquisition, adds network analysis and insight to better inform security managements. This is a highly complementary addition to our store of GOC, data loss prevention and security information and event management offerings as customers seek multiline security offerings, as threats become increasingly persistent and complex. Revenues from our Information and Intelligence Group in Q1 were $160 million, down 10% from Q1 of last year, when we saw a larger number of big orders, including one particularly large financial services transaction. 
While growth here has been disappointing, the technology is good. We're making some key changes to help this business perform to its potential. Our new SEP offering is earning accolades. It was awarded a leadership position by both for us and Gartner the most recent assessment of the space mix can be used to build intelligent case based apps faster at much lower costs and with fewer resources. We are building booking on top of SEP using modern virtuous frameworks. The surface for specific industries which will turn in allow for much faster solutions deployments and we reorganized the IDG sales force into a more vertically aligned structure with fewer accounts for rep, enabling our sales team to identify and execute on opportunities more rapidly. This is an initiative we expect to start bearing fruit in the second half of the year.
Because of these efforts, we expect this year to be one of modest growth and significant transition for IEG, which results being a businesses much better positioned for success. VMware revenue grew 33% in the quarter to a record $843 million. The VMware saw strengths across all geographies and benefited from high close rates of large enterprise license agreements in the quarter. This impressive growth of VMware stems from a few simple facts. Virtualization is now mainstream with the majority of new applications being deployed in various environments, It is a standard feature motivated centers. Virtualization is a fundamental first step for Cloud Computing. Without it, customers are limited by the inefficiencies of physical infrastructures and virtualization is being led by VMware which is head and shoulders above others in this space particularly before data center deployments.
In Q1, there continues to be countless examples of the affinity between VMware's robust virtualization platform and WMC's proven infrastructure. As more customers entering joined the cloud, we see more mission critical applications being virtualized and deployed on high-end infrastructure or said differently, this is to live up to the more demanding SOA these workloads require. Though there are many such examples of these implementations in Q1, in retail, telecom, Internet, construction and insurance, to name but a few.
Let me take a moment here for a couple of housekeeping items on how you should model VMware's results within EMC. First, we've broken it out for you the expected full-year minority interest of approximately $175 million. We've also provided you with an estimate of the additional dilution of $15 million for a non-GAAP EPS calculation. These items are being implied within our consolidated expectations, we noticed that everyone has auto correctly. These amounts to be relatively small historically but as VMWare's success continues it is increasingly important how non-GAAP EPS is calculated. The take away here is you should include both of these when modeling consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the full year. Across our business, we have a number of additional initiatives to facilitate customers transition to cloud. Our Consulting division to see good demand for systems building out cloud architectures. But going to hybrid cloud also means utilizing Enterprise cloud searches offered by external providers and we are directing a lot of energy to make sure service providers have the technology and expertise necessary to enable these offerings. We've made lots of progress in this fronts and you can expect additional announcements from us next week.
Through our joint venture with Cisco and VMware VCE we're helping customers get to IT as a service much more quickly with Vblock converged infrastructure products. The value proposition here is incredibly powerful as a Vblock enables the deployments of best-of-breed IT infrastructure in a matter of hours rather than days or even months. With an expanding pipeline and a workforce approaching 1,000, VCE opened its headquarters in Dallas last month and will soon open offices in San Jose, Rally, Durham and London. Given the market momentum, we are accelerating our investment in VCE. By this important route to market will service well in the rate's to create both private and public cloud infrastructures. We're increasing our projections for other expense in 2011 by approximately $70 million. The accelerated VCE investments is reflected here as our changes in the operating effects associated with VCE. However, we expect improvements to our operating margin from Vblock operated sales to effectively offset most of these increase in other expense during 2011.
We are focused on developing the broader IT ecosystem to support hybrid cloud implementations. The alternative to our broad-based strategy is the single vendor approach wherein customers are dependent upon one company for applications, infrastructure and services. Our open approach offers choice as engages an array of partners allowing customers to take advantage of developments and innovations, springing up across the broad ecosystem. While this strategy requires coordination of efforts across several players, we are committed as we fairly believe it offers the best long-term value proposition to our customers.
Looking more closely at our financials. It is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets which we've been building over the last several years results in fair value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. Total revenue grew 18% to $4.6 billion in Q1. Revenue from the U.S. was up double digits while our strategy to invest in geographies outside the U.S. is paying off, as the rapid growth of these markets helped drive our overall results. Our BRIC + 13 markets grew over 40%, and EMEA and APJ were up 21% and 43%, respectively. This helps drive our non-U.S. mix to record 49% of revenue. We improved non-GAAP gross margin by 160 basis points over last year's first quarter. This improvement was driven in part by our ability to offer differentiated features that enable customers to maximize the value of their information infrastructures. We continued to show leverage and our non-GAAP operating margin grew 220 basis points year-on-year to 21.7%. Results of these improvements were non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31, up 19% from $0.26 a year ago.
We recognized there's a lot of interest in Japan and how it might impact our supply chain. While the longer-term impacts of these tragic events are still unknown, we have very solid relationships with our suppliers and believe we've been able to develop a clearer picture of our near-term risks. After carefully assessing hundreds of our suppliers and their supplies that may be impacted, we have determined that only a handful currently have some supply risk exposure. We've taken risk mitigation steps to continue to monitor the situation. At this time, we do not see any meaningful impact in Q2 and continue to work with our suppliers to secure components we need for the second half.
We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned nearly $900 million in cash to shareholders in Q1, with the repurchase of more than 33 million EMC shares. Augmenting VMware's $148 million share repurchase in Q1, we also invested $38 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. To reiterate irrational of these purchases, we strongly believe in VMware's potential given its strategic position as the cloud data center operating system of the future. As a result, we believe our relatively small purchases to maintain our industry level on excellent long-term investment.
In closing, we are encouraged by our strong Q1 results and the opportunities as we look ahead for the rest of the year. Given the trends in the market our strategic position, our focus to execution, we now have greater confidence in our ability to commit and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 and free cash flow of $4 billion. Note that the non-GAAP EPS goal we gave you in January contemplate a share count of 2.23 billion. We since increased our share projected share count to 2.26 billion shares which impacts our full-year non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02. This is a direct result of the increase in our share price in Q1 driving a higher average share price assumption for the full year. Offsetting this, we now expect our operating margin for the full year to be between 23% and 24% due to better operating margins in our storage business and improved margins from VMware.
In summary, we executed well against our strategy in Q1, and we believe the outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond is bright. The major trends in cloud and big data are large and growing, our strategy is in place and we will continue to execute very well. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter and the vast opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?"

I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's Q1 earnings call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more pleased with the way our strategy and products are resonating with our customers. Clearly, customers are extremely interested in the massive benefits which private and public cloud computing can bring. And they see how our products, services and solutions can help them accelerate their journey to the cloud, while helping to me that as demands their business is placing on IT today.
Also, it is extremely clear that good financial results and winning strategies, products and services do not have happen at any company or organization without talented, hard-working, dedicated people. And EMC and VMware are truly blessed with more than 50,000 people who exhibit these winning traits as they focus day in and day out on the success of their customers. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their first class execution.
Let me now comment on IT spending and our expectations for the remainder of 2011. On balance, we still expect to see IT spending up this year in the 5% to 7% range, most probably in the higher end of that range. And we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technology, namely in virtualization, cloud OS in information storage, information protection, information security and then Information Management intelligence, our technology areas which will grow substantially faster than the 5% to 7% IT average.
However, while we are pretty confident that IT spending will be solid, I would like to note that there are some potential event risks such as the impacts of the disasters in Japan, global public-sector deficits and rising commodity prices especially oil that can cause a sense of uncertainty. We will continue to monitor these three resources of potential risks. And to be clear, we are still confident that we can meet and potentially beat our 2011 plan of $19.6 billion in revenue and $1.46 of non-GAAP EPS. The source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and big data strategies are well-placed, and are underpinned with winning products and fully committed and funded product roadmaps.
On the VMware side, vSphere, vShield, the cloud Director, vCenter, the fabric, cloud foundry and the claim are critical market-leading core elements for private, public and hybrid Cloud Computing. In cloud computing engenders information on a massive scale. We call this phenomena big data. Our VMAX, Isilon and our most product technologies along with the plugs addresses big data storage opportunity head-on. These products continued to be extremely well received by our customers on both the private and public side. And our Greenplum and IG suite of products helped customers get big value from their big data assets.
Next is massive scale of information needs to be projected. In other words, information needs to be highly available and eventually archived at reasonable cost points in concert with business process objectives. Here our data domain and network technologies featuring industry-leading performance, data compression and data deduplication hit the mark had on. Additionally, strong, effective and pervasive information security is quickly becoming a top four mandate for all IT data center environments especially for cloud computing environments. Here is where we see our products where identity protection and verification for data loss prevention, for security and event management, for governance risk and compliance, and now, with our acquisition of net witness for network forensic play a critical role. In short, we are the most complete suite of security technology products that meet the vigorous demands of massive scale clouds.
And finally, with demanding mid tier environments and SMB implementations, our be a nice and storage clients are generating a very strong reception from our customers.
All in all, we have an extremely well-placed and focused technology lineup back by our world-class services organization and our service provider partners to help accelerate our customers journey to the hybrid cloud. And the best news of all, we have more innovation coming. Stay tuned to EMC world which starts on May 9th where we will launch many more exciting new products that will help extend our leading cloud technology stack.
Thank you for joining us today. I'll now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

We announced the in middle part of January so we knew quite a little bit of a pause in the market until became available and that's what happened. Essentially, the replaces both cloud and Solaris and as I mentioned in the last two weeks of the quarter, we sold more than 50% of the orders from those 3 products moving towards the annex so we do expect the growth of annex to accelerate. We expect it to quite quickly certainly the second quarter to be well over 50% of what we call our traditional mid tier but we expect the combination of those 3 products to grow quite nicely and expect to bounce back in total growth in the mid tier in the second quarter because we'll have a full quarter of where we are shipping and selling. So that's the flavor on the mid tier. Relative to the year, obviously, we're off to a great start, the numbers I think speak for themselves. We did 18% revenue growth. We did the 19% non-GAAP EPS growth and of course, that combines with our annual guidance of 15% and 16%, respectively. So we obviously started off the Gates ahead of the pace and that's what I think it we're more confident now we can meet and of course potentially beat our guidance and we just want to see a little bit more the year developed before we change our numbers explicitly."

And of course, when you start tearing like that, you removed the need for customer device separate in the way high end, mid tier and low-end systems because you call get all those benefits in one architecture and of course, if you have say Symmetrix V-Max this probably the least expensive alternative for you is to put got a lot of horsepower and to put more drives with better big set of drives and use the FAST technology to move data very quickly, very efficiently to that lower tier. So in a way, that's helping clear the line so for sure, VMAX is now taking some loads that were in formerly midtier. As far as the VMAX line is concerned, as the performance and capabilities of that system we seeing a real customer instances 3x the performance as that technology gets more and more use in FAST works there we expect that. So basically do the lines overlap a bit, yes they do and that's intentional because when you leave gaps, that's where competitors drive.

As I mentioned we're up to close 1000 people which is certainly ahead of our plan at this point in time by a few hundred. So there's 2 things that are impacting that $70 million increase in guidance we gave you in the other expense line. The first is the fact that we are accelerating our expense a little bit more than we accelerated expected and the second piece is that because of selling the box and where we're reselling the box, more of the Vblock sales are being recorded directly on the parent P&L. So differently not much as the revenues flowing through VCE as we expected. What's happening is, that the margin that would have been captured by VCE is now being captured directly by us in our operating margins. Overtime, we do expect that to balance out a little bit. But for this year we expect that to be the case. What;s happening is, you got a little bit of accelerated investment and you've also got margin that would've been flowing through VCE now flowing up through the parent here so that's why I said, we expect to cover both of those through the operating results of Vblocks as they flow through the parents over the course of the year. Obviously, there'll be a slight timing issue. We're going be accelerated our investments with it. All the revenue on the other side.

If you remember from what we talked about last time, the increase in share price basically drives three things that account for the excess of 30 million shares in our forecast, the first is impact that luge from the convertible remember roughly of half of that is kind of what we call accounting dilution it goes away when the convertible matures about half of that is economic dilution we have to pay those shares out. The second is the smallest of the three, is with  highest share price we expect some increase in acceleration of option timing. Last but not least, the high share price impacted number of shares we can buy with the buyback we have for the year. As you know, we're committed to spending $1.5 billion on buying back EMC shares this year. We spent a little less than $900 million in the first quarter, so we actually did move pretty quickly getting out the blocks out of the earnings call just to start buying back and we look at the timing, the opportunity but we're still on track do the $1.5 billion. But bear in mind, again, on the share count, a big piece of the impact goes away and if you kind of look at our Q1 average, we have about 80 million shares in our share count which are from the accounting impacts of the convertible to when convertible matures, disappear completely so you've got a little bit of an artificial inflation in the share count as well as real inflation. Joe on dividends?"

I still think IT will not be immune from public sector as they really sharpen their pencil and try to cut back a bit.

We haven't been given any bad forecast or anything yet, but we just can't have about worry a little bit of an unknown.

And non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, up 19%",4434,"Thanks Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that EMC started off the year with solid results. We achieved record Q1 revenues of $4.6 billion, up 18% from last year's first quarter. And non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, up 19% over Q1 of last year. 
We improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin considerably from the first quarter last year. And we achieved free cash flow of almost $860 million, well in excess of record Q1 non-GAAP net income of $700 million. 
We successfully executed our financial triple play once again, gaining market share, investing in the future and improving profitability. We fully expect to continue realizing this triple play over the long term for two reasons: one, we're in the early stages of the largest IT transformation in history which is creating enormous opportunities in cloud computing and Big Data; and two, we positioned ourselves to take full advantage of this opportunity by focusing on the transformation of IT infrastructure and applications. 
Customers recognize that their ability to compete is increasingly tied to the efficiency and agility of the IT operations, and their transition into cloud architectures to make their businesses more efficient, more flexible and more agile. To get there, they're seeking partners who can meet their requirements from start to finish. From their first Phase 1 server virtualization deployments through the Phase 2 large-scale ramping up of virtualization to include mission-critical applications, through Phase 3 implementations where IT is automated and offered as a service and well into the future.
Successfully navigating these phases could be challenging, and doing so in the face of additional challenge created by the rise of Big Data makes it even more so. In addition to scalable yet manageable storage of petabytes of data, customers need knowledge to grow beyond pros and cons. They need to analyze and leverage the massive amounts of data generated from various sources, such as always-on networks, the Web, consumers, surveillance systems and sensors. 
We are squarely focused on helping our customers take advantages of the rapid, reemerging opportunities offered by both cloud and Big Data. And it's this focus that drives us to continually identify and execute on opportunities that increase our value proposition to customers in this new world. As their IT needs grow larger and more complex, and as more and more of the company's success is linked to IT, we have innovated and invested to come out in front of these needs. 
There is no other company in IT with the combination of market-leading virtualization and infrastructure assets that EMC has today: the getting to cloud and for unlocking the value contained within the Big Data that surrounds us. 
Our virtualization and infrastructure assets are critically important for getting customers where they want to be. This is why EMC is a vendor of choice for organizations, just for every size and every vertical, and it's a key reason why our opportunity is so vast.
Not only do we have an excellent base of technology assets, but we're expanding our reach by getting to market in many different ways. We're working directly with our customers to move in to cloud infrastructures and address that Big Data needs on their terms and timelines. We're investing in and expanding our channel to equip them to become more invaluable partners to their customers, who are looking to gain great efficiencies from IT. 
We're working with dozens of service providers who want to deliver the efficiencies of IT as a scale for their customers, and use best-of-breed technology to do so. And we're meeting the rapidly expanding demand to converge IT infrastructures to our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] joint venture.
In short, we're developing solutions and expanding our go-to-market in ways that make it easy for customers to take part in cloud computing and unlock the value of Big Data. There is a vast growth potential in the areas of where we compete and we're aggressively pursuing these opportunities at multiple levels. Given the strong growth we saw in the first quarter and the opportunity we see for rest of the year, we are now more confident that we can meet and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, $1.46 non-GAAP EPS and $4 billion of free cash flow.
Now let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various lines of business, starting with information storage. Q1 information storage revenues were $3.4 billion, up 18%. For years, storage has been a top priority as information growth continues unabated. This phenomenon is purely on a growth at a fundamental level and is not likely to change anytime soon. But perhaps more important is the fact that these unbridled information growth has forced customers to seek more efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data. The best solution for one customer may not be the best for another, which is why we continually strive to offer the very best-in-class technology, tailored for various business requirements. 
High-end storage product revenues were up a robust 25% year-on-year, driven primarily by pent-up demand for the much-anticipated FAST VP [Fully Automated Storage Tiering with Virtual Pools] tiering software we announced in January. This, in turn, drove new VMAX [Virtual Matrix Architecture] system sales and upgrades. VMAX continues to be the smartest, most scalable and most efficient high-end storage system available in the market. And the ongoing introduction of unique capabilities such as Flash [Enterprise Flash Drives], FAST and VPLEX has led to tremendous growth since the introduction of VMAX in April 2009. The success and growth of this business has been great, and given our share in the high end, it has resulted in higher than expected growth in the market as well. While it's realistic to expect growth to moderate in this relatively mature market, we do expect to continue to grow faster than the market and gain share.
Our main reason we expect to continue to gain share is the ongoing introduction of unique and value-added capabilities such as FAST VP that I mentioned earlier. In Q1, we saw a steep increase in the sale of FAST licenses from Q4 and 3/4 of systems we shipped with FAST in Q1 used both Flash and data. 
Clearly, customers has taken advantage of the value proposition offered by automated storage tiering, and for good reason, as they're able to achieve up to 40% more application performance, while significantly reducing the number of disks and power needed, compared with single-tier systems. This type of differentiation in value will what will lead to our continued success in this market.
An excellent example in the quarter of how this differentiation is winning occurred with a rapidly growing IT service provider in Brazil. This company needs an infrastructure to support the VMware virtualized operating environment to host their customers platforms, a mission-critical implementation. Their solution has to be proven, smart and ultra efficient, as well as perfectly suited for virtualized environments. With the ability to meet each of these requirements VMAX was head-and-shoulders above the competition in this deal.
Our mid-tier storage revenue grew 20% in Q1, as our market-leading portfolio solutions offers important competitive distinctions in each of the areas it addresses. Looking across our broad set of capabilities in the mid-tier, it is clear that our ability to meet the wide variety of mid-tier use cases is unique. We firmly believe that this strategic approach will continue to drive our success here. By keeping the value proposition of each offering very distinct, channel partners benefit from selling the entire portfolio, this is an important point and one of which we are very focused.
In our traditional mid-tier storage space, our newly launched VNX family is being very well received by the market. Our unified VNX products, which is also part of our January announcement, started shipping the last week in February and was off to a strong start in March. 
VNX represented over 50% of the traditional mid-tier orders we have booked in the last two weeks in the quarter and we expect VNX revenue to continue to ramp over the course of the year. It has a long list of advantages against competitors, advantages that customers in this space really respond to. 
First, it is simple. The market-leading capabilities of our file and block solutions are now combined into a single unified platform that is managed to a centralized and simple user interface. 
Also, it is efficient. It is the only storage system that automates both file and block sub-LUN tiering with FAST VP. The combination of this, the compression and file duplication, enables customers to significantly improve capacity efficiency. It was great to see that almost 50% of VNX systems went out with flash capability, which indicates customers are taking advantage of tiering. 
And finally, it is powerful. By leveraging x86-based multicore processor technology to maximize solution throughput and bandwidth, the VNX, that it will record performance benchmark the network file performance and overall response times. VNX is 3x faster than our previous generation systems.
With the launch of VNX, we drastically simplified our storage software offerings by streamlining over 25 different software products into five suites. This bundling has been extremely popular with our customers as well as with channel partners, as it's now much simpler to buy. The result was a dramatic increase in software penetration with VNX and a deeper value proposition for our customers. 
In short, the VNX features set resonates with customers and was instrumental in winning several competitive deals in the quarter, across a variety of verticals, including a telephone service provider, building out infrastructure of the service for its client base; a bank, needing to take advantage of information [ph] FAST and FAST Cache on VNX to increase usable capacity and improve performance at lowest costs; a restaurant chain, looking to move out to private cloud; and a national police force, where we were already a trusted provider, and with VNX we're able to displace the incumbent vendor of this tiered file storage.
We entered the SMB market in Q1 with the launch of VNXe which started shipping the 2nd week of March. The VNXe provides proven EMC quality into an affordable unified storage system. We designed the VNXe to be easy to manage, easy to sell and easy to support, with the features and functions you would expect from an EMC products at a price you may not. 
The VNXe offers capabilities like advanced data reduction technology, automated technical support and efficient provisioning for mailboxes or VMware data stores, as an enterprise, it firmly establishes it as the best value in the markets. Remember, that this is a new product in a new space being sold to new customers through new channel partners, so it's going to take some time before we see a material benefit to our growth. However, we are pleased to report that VNXe is off to a strong start.
We are rapidly on-boarding hundreds of new partners to sell the VNXe at a crazy price [ph] with existing channels. In fact, with VNXe launch events in dozens of cities across the globe, we signed on more new partners in the first quarter this year than we signed on over the course of all of last year, and the progress continues.
The significant majority of our mid-tier portfolio is sold via our channel partners and we are proud of progress we're making here, particularly, as our client -- oh, we have an agreement with Dell, the client's less than $40 million of revenue in Q1. 
In response to feedback we solicited from our growing partner community, just last week, we announced several enhancements to our channel partner program to accelerate partner profitability. We'll continue to deal with these relationships in ways that are mutually beneficial to both EMC and to our channel partners.
Moving now to our Backup Recovery Systems division, which spans a variety of customer sizes, verticals and environments. BRS' ability to add value to just about any backup environment helps explain this division's consistently strong performance, with our Data Domain products leading this growth. 
We expect this growth to continue, especially given the ongoing enhancements we're making to our market-leading product lineup. On Monday, we announced the expansion of Avamar for use in much larger production environments, by integrating it with Data Domain technology. We also announced state-of-the-art VMWare backup enhancements, with VMware APIs for Data Protection and tight integration with vCenter, Avamar can now provide up to 3x the backup speed of its nearest competitor. 
This is an excellent illustration of the EMC effect at its fullest, capturing the wealth of opportunities available within EMC's existing accounts, while leveraging the deep resource of EMC, not only to connect with new customers, but also to drive valuable innovation as well.
We intend to use the power of the EMC effect to capture the opportunity presented by Big Data, with scale on NAS [network-attached storage] and data analytics as well. In the scale of that space, our Isilon Storage Division exceeded expectations in its first quarter within EMC. This is due to the merits of its highly differentiated technology with the global namespace, a multi-petabyte scalability, Isilon Systems are designed to handle massive numbers of large files. In other words, Big Data. 
We continue to differentiate the Isilon technology. Last week, we launched our next-generation hardware and software. The new systems incorporate greater tiering flexibililty across SSD and FAST or SATA drives and combined this tier back-end with a large globally cogent cache and next-generation core processors. This technology improvements are leveraged by innovations on the software side, with significant enhancements to improve performance of mission-critical data center operations and with new recovery point objectives. The net effect is accelerated performance, throughput replication underscoring Isilon's market-leading position in scale at NAS.
Our technology advantage here is winning us new customers and getting us into environments where we're able to swap out competitors' products that cannot meet customers' scalability requirements. Isilon is also seeing early examples of the EMC effect and benefiting from the strength of EMC's brand and global reach. 
A couple of large wins in China in Q1 illustrate why Isilon is a storage infrastructure of choice for some many Big Data applications, in this case, the Genomics. These customers need to make petabyte scale data sets simultaneously available to numerous instruments, users and data service. With Isilon, these customers are able to achieve unprecedented levels of both concurrent of sequential higher performance, while saving significant time and capital costs.
Our Data Computing Division continues to thrive in the Big Data analytics space, both Forrester and Gartner have recently recognized the Greenplum for architecture leadership in this space, as our continued innovation, solid execution and strong cloud focus form the basis of our competitive advantage. With twice the data loading speed of its nearest competitor and the industry's best performance, the EMC Data Computing Appliance permits more data to be analyzed faster and at lower costs. Because of these advantages, FAST, the leader in business analytics software, recently announced the expansion of its high performance computing offerings on our Data Computing Appliance. The combination of FAST's unique analytic capabilities with Greenplum's massively parallel architecture in a complete purpose-built appliance, delivers a compelling value proposition to customers.
To sum up, our Storage business has never been better positioned. Looking forward, we expect to see a bounce back of growth in the mid-tier, driven by full quarter contributions from the new VNX family and continued leadership in the high end. Again, our strength in storage comes from our ability to provide bleeding-edge technology to a broader range of customers in used cases. After this, our depth of experience and our proven track record, and EMC emerges as the storage vendor of choice as customers transition to the cloud and navigate the challenges and opportunity presented by Big Data.
Our RSA Security revenues in Q1 were $174 million, up 8% year-on-year. We saw a strong growth from our GRC [governance, risk and compliance], data loss prevention and IPv solutions. This was somewhat offset by a pause in shipments as we reviewed and hardened our systems in response to the sophisticated cyber attacks targeting RSAs, that occurred in the quarter. 
Customers are our first priority, and RSA's management and sales force are actively engaged in the customers and partners to address their questions and ensure they have the tools and support necessary to reinforce the security of their RSA SecurID environments. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, it is likely that we will give up some revenue growth within the RSA business in the short term, as we continue to work with customers and strengthen these relationships for the long term.
This year's record attendance at the RSA conference, which is the marquee security conference, underscores the fact that the security challenges faced by IT organizations around the world are not going away. As attacks grow more sophisticated, previously targeted, customers need defense mechanisms at multiple levels to defend against them. 
We deepened our RSA's analytics and virtualization offerings early this month with the acquisition of NetWitness. This acquisition, adds network analysis and insight to better inform security managements. This is a highly complementary addition to our store of GRC, data loss prevention and security information and event management offerings, as customers seek multilayer security offerings, as threats become increasingly persistent and complex. 
Revenues from our Information Intelligence Group in Q1 were $160 million, down 10% from Q1 of last year, when we saw a larger number of big orders, including one particularly large financial services transaction. While growth here has been disappointing, the technology is good. We're making some key changes to help this business perform to its potential. 
Our new xCP offering is earning accolades. It was awarded a leadership position by both Forrester and Gartner, in the most recent assessment of the space, because it can be used to build intelligent case-based apps faster at much lower costs and with fewer resources. We are building lightweight applications on top of xCP, using modern virtualized frameworks. These are geared for specific industries, which will in turn allow for much faster solutions deployments. 
And we've reorganized the IIG [Information Intelligence Group] sales force into a more vertically aligned structure with fewer accounts for rep, enabling our sales teams to identify and execute on opportunities more rapidly. This is an initiative we expect to start bearing fruit in the second half of the year. Because of these efforts, we expect this year to be one of modest growth and significant transition for IIG, with results being a business as much better positioned for success. 
VMware revenue grew 33% in the quarter to a record $843 million. The VMware saw strength across all geographies and benefited from high close rates on large enterprise license agreements in the quarter. This impressive growth of VMware stems from a few simple facts. Virtualization is now mainstream, with the majority of new applications being deployed in virtual environments, it is a standard feature in modern data centers. 
Virtualization is a fundamental first step for cloud computing, without it, customers are limited by the inefficiencies of physical infrastructures. And virtualization is being led by VMware, which is head and shoulders above others in this space, particularly for full data center deployments.
In Q1, there continues to be countless examples of the affinity between VMware's robust virtualization platform and EMC's proven information infrastructure. As more customers entering Phase 2 in their journey to the cloud, we see more mission-critical applications being virtualized and deployed on high-end infrastructure or said differently, this can live up to the more demanding SLAs [Service Level Agreements] these workloads require. There are many such examples of these implementations in Q1, in retail, telecom, Internet, construction and insurance, to name but a few.
Let me take a moment here for a couple of housekeeping items on how you should model VMware's results within EMC. First, we've broken out for you the expected full-year minority interest of approximately $175 million. We've also provided you with an estimate of the additional dilution of $50 million for the non-GAAP EPS calculation. 
These items are being implied within our consolidated expectations, but we noticed not everyone has modeled in correctly. These amounts to be relatively small historically, but as VMWare's success continues it is increasingly important how non-GAAP EPS is calculated. The take away here is you should include both of these when modeling consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the full year. 
Across our business, we have a number of additional initiatives to facilitate customers transition to cloud. Our Consulting division continues to see good demand for assistance building out cloud architectures. But going to hybrid cloud also means utilizing enterprise cloud searches offered by external providers. And we're directing a lot of energy to make sure service providers have the technology and expertise necessary to enable these offerings. We've made lots of progress in this front, and you can expect additional announcements from us next week.
Through our joint venture with Cisco and VMware, VCE we're helping customers get to IT-as-a-Service much more quickly, with Vblock converged infrastructure products. The value proposition here is incredibly powerful as a Vblock enables the deployments of best-of-breed IT infrastructure in a matter of hours, rather than days or even months. With an expanding pipeline and a workforce approaching 1,000, VCE opened its headquarters in Dallas last month and will soon open offices in San Jose, Raleigh, Durham and London. 
Given the market momentum, we're accelerating our investment in ease in VCE. As it's important route to market, we'll service well in the race to create both private and public cloud infrastructures. We're increasing our projection for other expense in 2011 by approximately $70 million. The accelerated VCE investment is reflected here as our changes in the operating effects associated with VCE. However, we expect improvement to our operating margin from Vblock operating sales to effectively offset most of these increase in other expense during 2011.
We are focused on developing the broader IT ecosystem to support hybrid cloud implementations. The alternative to our broad-based strategy is the single-vendor approach, wherein customers are dependent upon one company for applications, infrastructure and services. Our open approach offers choice, as it engages an array of partners allowing customers to take advantage of developments and innovations, springing up across the broad ecosystem. While this strategy requires coordination of efforts across several players, we are committed, as we fairly believe it offers the best long-term value proposition to our customers.
Looking more closely at our financials. It is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets, which we've been building over the last several years, has resulted in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. 
Total revenue grew 18% to $4.6 billion in Q1. Revenue from the U.S. was up double digits, while our strategy to invest in geographies outside the U.S. is paying off, as the rapid growth of these markets helped drive our overall results. Our BRIC + 13 markets grew over 40%, and EMEA and APJ [Asia Pacific/Japan] were up 21% and 43%, respectively. This helps drive our non-U.S. mix to record 49% of revenue. 
We improved non-GAAP gross margin by 160 basis points over last year's first quarter. This improvement was driven in part by our ability to offer differentiated features that enable customers to maximize the value of their information infrastructures. We continued to show leverage and our non-GAAP operating margin grew 220 basis points year-on-year to 21.7%. Results of these improvements was non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31, up 19% from $0.26 a year ago.
We recognized there's a lot of interest in Japan and how it might impact our supply chain. While the longer-term impacts of these tragic events are still unknown, we have very solid relationships with our suppliers and believe we've been able to develop a clearer picture of our near-term risks. After carefully assessing hundreds of our suppliers and their supplies that may have been impacted, we have determined that only a handful currently have some supply risk exposure. We've taken risk mitigation steps and continue to monitor the situation. At this time, we do not see any meaningful impact in Q2 and continue to work with our suppliers to secure the components we need for the second half.
We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned nearly $900 million in cash to shareholders in Q1, with the repurchase of more than 33 million EMC shares. Augmenting VMware's $148 million share repurchase in Q1, we also invested $38 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. To reiterate the rationale for these purchases, we strongly believe in VMware's potential, given its strategic position as the cloud data center operating system of the future. As a result, we believe our relatively small purchase to maintain our eligibility [ph] level on excellent long-term investment.
In closing, we're encouraged by our strong Q1 results and the opportunities as we look ahead for the rest of the year. Given the trends in the market, our strategic position and our focus to execution, we now have greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 and free cash flow of $4 billion. 
Note that the non-GAAP EPS goal we gave you in January contemplate a share count of 2.23 billion. We since increased our projected share count to 2.26 billion shares, which impacts our full-year non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02. This is a direct result of the increase in our share price in Q1, driving a higher average share price assumption for the full year. Offsetting this, we now expect that operating margin for the full year to be between 23% and 24% due to better operating margins in our Storage business and improved margins from VMware.
In summary, we executed well against our strategy in Q1, and we believe the outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond is bright. The major trends in cloud and Big Data are large and growing, our strategy is in place and we will continue to execute very well. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter and the vast opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?"
121729,129550279,116035,"EMC Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, David.

Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more pleased with the way our strategy and products are resonating with our",745,"Thanks, David. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's Q1 earnings call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more pleased with the way our strategy and products are resonating with our customers. Clearly, customers are extremely interested in the massive benefits which private and public cloud computing can bring. And they see how our products, services and solutions can help them accelerate their journey to the cloud, while helping them meet the vast demands their business is placing on IT today.
Also, it is extremely clear that good financial results and winning strategies, products and services do not happen at any company or organization without talented, hard-working, dedicated people. And EMC and VMware are truly blessed with more than 50,000 people who exhibit these winning traits, as they focus day in and day out on the success of their customers. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their first class execution.
Let me now comment on IT spending and our expectations for the remainder of 2011. On balance, we still expect to see IT spending up this year in the 5% to 7% range, most probably in the higher end of that range. And we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technology, namely in virtualization, the cloud OS [operating system] and information storage, information protection, information security and then, information management intelligence, are technology areas which will grow substantially faster than the 5% to 7% IT average.
However, while we are pretty confident that IT spending will be solid, I would like to note that there are some potential event risks, such as the impacts of the disasters in Japan, global public-sector deficits and rising commodity prices, especially oil, that can cause a sense of uncertainty. We will continue to monitor these three resources of potential risks. And to be clear, we are still confident that we can meet and potentially beat our 2011 plan of $19.6 billion in revenue and $1.46 of non-GAAP EPS. 
The source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and Big Data strategies are well-placed, and are underpinned with winning products and fully committed and funded product roadmaps.
On the VMware side, vSphere, vShield, the vCloud Director, vCenter, the Fabric, cloud foundry and the claim are critical market-leading core elements for private, public and hybrid cloud computing, and cloud computing engenders information on a massive scale. We call this phenomena Big Data. Our VMAX, Isilon and Atmos product families, along with our virtual storage offering VPLEX, addresses Big Data storage opportunity head-on. 
These products continue to be extremely well-received by our customers on both the private and public side. And our Greenplum and IIG suite of products help customers get big value from their Big Data assets.
Next is massive scale of information needs to be protected. In other words, information needs to be highly available and eventually archived at reasonable cost points, in concert with business process objectives. Here our Data Domain, Avamar and network technologies, featuring industry-leading performance, data compression and data deduplication hit the mark head on. 
Additionally, strong, effective and pervasive information security is quick becoming a top four mandate for all IT data center environments, especially for cloud computing environments. Here is where we see our safety on newer products were identity protection and verification for data loss prevention; for security and event management; for governance, risk and compliance; and now, with our acquisition of NetWitness, for network forensic, play a critical role. In short, we are the most complete suite of security technology products that meet the vigorous demands of massive scale clouds.
And finally, with demanding mid-tier environments and SMB implementations, our VNX and VNXe storage lines are generating a very strong reception from our customers.
All in all, we have an extremely well-placed and focused technology lineup, backed by our world-class services organization and our service provider partners to help accelerate our customers' journey to the hybrid cloud. And the best news of all, we have more innovation coming. Stay tuned to EMC World, which starts on May 9th, where we will launch many more exciting new products that will help extend our leading cloud technology stack.
Thank you for joining us today. I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So relative to the VNX, we're very excited about the way that is progressing. As I've mentioned, we even start shipping the products until the last week in February, so we really had a very short selling quarter for VNX. We announced that, the course in the middle part of January, so we knew we created a little bit of a pause in the market until it became available, and that's what happened. Essentially, the VNX replaces both cloud and Celerra. And as I mentioned, in the last two weeks of the quarter, we sold more than 50% of the orders from those 3 products moving towards VNX. So we do expect the growth of VNX to accelerate. We expect it to quite quickly, certainly in the second quarter, it will be well over 50% of what we call our traditional mid-tier, but we expect the combination of those 3 products to grow quite nicely. And with others we expect to bounce back in total growth in the mid-tier in the second quarter, because we'll have a full quarter where we will be shipping and selling VNX. That's the flavor on the mid-tier. Relative to the year, obviously, we're off to a great start, the numbers I think speak for themselves. We did 18% revenue growth. We did the 19% non-GAAP EPS growth. And of course, that combines with our annual guidance of 15% and 16%, respectively. So we obviously started off out the gates, ahead of the pace. And that's why I said, we are more confident now. We can meet and of course potentially beat our guidance, and we just want to see a little bit more the year develop before we change our numbers explicitly."

And of course, when you start tiering like that, you remove the need for customer to buy separate, in the way high-end, mid-tier and low-end systems because you can get all those benefits in one architecture. And of course, if you have a, say a Symmetrix, a big farm of Symmetrix or VMAXs, probably the least expensive alternative for you is to put -- if you got a lot of horsepower and there's to put more drives with better big SATA drives and use the FAST technology to move data very quickly, very efficiently to that lower tier. So in a way, that's helping blur the line, so for sure, VMAX is now taking some loads that were in formerly mid-tier. As far as the VNX line is concerned, as the performance and capabilities of that system, I mean, it is -- we're seeing in real customer instances, 3x the performance as that technology gets more and more used, and FAST VP works there, we expect that. So basically, do the lines overlap a bit? Yes, they do, and that's intentional. Because when you leave gaps, that's where competitors drive.

So first of all, and Jowe will give you a little bit more color on how it's going. We are accelerating investment because the market opportunity is great. As I mentioned, we're up to close 1,0",301,"Yes, Ben. So let me talk about the P&L mechanics and dynamics. So first of all, and Jowe will give you a little bit more color on how it's going. We are accelerating investment because the market opportunity is great. As I mentioned, we're up to close 1,000 people which is certainly ahead of our plan at this point in time by a few hundred. So there's 2 things that are impacting that $70 million increase in guidance we gave you in the other expense line. The first is the fact that we are accelerating our expenses a little bit more than we accelerated, so expected. And the second piece, is that because of how we're selling Vblocks and where we're selling Vblocks. More of the Vblock sales are being recorded directly up on the parent P&L. So differently, not much as the revenues is flowing through VCE as we expected. What's happening is that the margin, that would have been captured by VCE, is now being captured directly by us in our operating margin. Over time, we do expect that to cap balance out a little bit, but for this year we expect that to be the case. What's happening is, you got a little bit of accelerated investment and you've also got margin that would've been flowing through VCE now flowing up through the parent. And that's why I said, we expect to cover both of those through the operating results of Vblocks as they flow through the parents over the course of the year. Obviously, there'll be a slight timing issue. We're going be accelerating our investments sooner when we're picking up all the revenue on the other side. But that's why we say net-net, it will be pretty neutral when you look at the full year guidance."

Let me talk about the share counts and how we're going on with buyback. So you're right, it started off the year, our guidance and share count has gone from $2.23 billion to $2.26 billion, and that's directly a function of share price. If you remember from what we talked about last time, the increase in share price basically drives three things, that's account for the extra 30 million shares in our forecast. The first is, it impacts the dilution from the convertible. Remember roughly half of that is kind of what we call accounting dilution, it goes away when the convertible matures. About half of that is economic dilution, as agreed we have to pay those shares out. Then the second is, the smallest of the three, is with a higher share price we expect some increase in acceleration of option timing. Last but not least, the high share price impacts the number of shares we can buy with the buyback we have for the year. As you know, we're committed to spending $1.5 billion on buying back EMC shares this year. We spent a little less than $900 million in the first quarter, so we actually did move pretty quickly getting out the blocks after the earnings call just to start buying back. And when we look at the timing, the opportunity, but we're still on track do the $1.5 billion. But bear in mind, again, on the share count, a big piece of the impact goes away. And if you kind of look at our Q1 average, we have about 80 million shares in our share count, which are from the accounting impact of the convertible. So when that convertible matures, disappear completely, so you've got a little bit of artificial inflation in the share count as well as real inflation. Joe on dividends?"

We fully expect to continue realizing this triple play over the long term for two reasons: one, we're in the early stages of the largest IT transformation in history which is creating enormous opportunities in cloud computing and Big Data; and two, we positioned ourselves to take full advantage of this opportunity by focusing on the transformation of IT infrastructure and applications.

To get there, they're seeking partners who can meet their requirements from start to finish. From their first Phase 1 server virtualization deployments through the Phase 2 large-scale ramping up of virtualization to include mission-critical applications, through Phase 3 implementations where IT is automated and offered as a service and well into the future.
Successfully navigating these phases could be challenging, and doing so in the face of additional challenge created by the rise of Big Data makes it even more so. In addition to scalable yet manageable storage of petabytes of data, customers need knowledge to grow beyond pros and cons. They need to analyze and leverage the massive amounts of data generated from various sources, such as always-on networks, the Web, consumers, surveillance systems and sensors. 
We are squarely focused on helping our customers take advantages of the rapid, reemerging opportunities offered by both cloud and Big Data. And it's this focus that drives us to continually identify and execute on opportunities that increase our value proposition to customers in this new world. As their IT needs grow larger and more complex, and as more and more of the company's success is linked to IT, we have innovated and invested to come out in front of these needs. 
There is no other company in IT with the combination of market-leading virtualization and infrastructure assets that EMC has today: the getting to cloud and for unlocking the value contained within the Big Data that surrounds us. 
Our virtualization and infrastructure assets are critically important for getting customers where they want to be. This is why EMC is a vendor of choice for organizations, just for every size and every vertical, and it's a key reason why our opportunity is so vast.
Not only do we have an excellent base of technology assets, but we're expanding our reach by getting to market in many different ways. We're working directly with our customers to move in to cloud infrastructures and address that Big Data needs on their terms and timelines. We're investing in and expanding our channel to equip them to become more invaluable partners to their customers, who are looking to gain great efficiencies from IT. 
We're working with dozens of service providers who want to deliver the efficiencies of IT as a scale for their customers, and use best-of-breed technology to do so. And we're meeting the rapidly expanding demand to converge IT infrastructures to our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] joint venture.
In short, we're developing solutions and expanding our go-to-market in ways that make it easy for customers to take part in cloud computing and unlock the value of Big Data. There is a vast growth potential in the areas of where we compete and we're aggressively pursuing these opportunities at multiple levels. Given the strong growth we saw in the first quarter and the opportunity we see for rest of the year, we are now more confident that we can meet and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, $1.46 non-GAAP EPS and $4 billion of free cash flow.
Now let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various lines of business, starting with information storage. Q1 information storage revenues were $3.4 billion, up 18%. For years, storage has been a top priority as information growth continues unabated. This phenomenon is purely on a growth at a fundamental level and is not likely to change anytime soon. But perhaps more important is the fact that this unbridled information growth has forced customers to seek more efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data. The best solution for one customer may not be the best for another, which is why we continually strive to offer the very best-in-class technology, tailored for various business requirements. 
High-end storage product revenues were up a robust 25% year-on-year, driven primarily by pent-up demand for the much-anticipated FAST VP [Fully Automated Storage Tiering with Virtual Pools] tiering software we announced in January. This, in turn, drove new VMAX [Virtual Matrix Architecture] system sales and upgrades. VMAX continues to be the smartest, most scalable and most efficient high-end storage system available in the market. And the ongoing introduction of unique capabilities such as Flash [Enterprise Flash Drives], FAST and VPLEX has led to tremendous growth since the introduction of VMAX in April 2009. The success and growth of this business has been great, and given our share in the high end, it has resulted in higher than expected growth in the market as well. While it's realistic to expect growth to moderate in this relatively mature market, we do expect to continue to grow faster than the market and gain share.
Our main reason we expect to continue to gain share is the ongoing introduction of unique and value-added capabilities such as FAST VP that I mentioned earlier. In Q1, we saw a steep increase in the sale of FAST licenses from Q4 and 3/4 of systems we shipped with FAST in Q1 used both Flash and data. 
Clearly, customers has taken advantage of the value proposition offered by automated storage tiering, and for good reason, as they're able to achieve up to 40% more application performance, while significantly reducing the number of disks and power needed, compared with single-tier systems. This type of differentiation in value will is what will lead to our continued success in this market.
An excellent example in the quarter of how this differentiation is winning occurred with a rapidly growing IT service provider in Brazil. This company needs an infrastructure to support the VMware virtualized operating environment to host their customers platforms. A mission-critical implementation, their solution has to be proven, smart and ultra efficient, as well as perfectly suited for virtualized environments. With the ability to meet each of these requirements VMAX was head-and-shoulders above the competition in this deal.
Our mid-tier storage revenue grew 20% in Q1, as our market-leading portfolio solutions offers important competitive distinctions in each of the areas it addresses. Looking across our broad set of capabilities in the mid-tier, it is clear that our ability to meet the wide variety of mid-tier use cases is unique. We firmly believe that this strategic approach will continue to drive our success here. By keeping the value proposition of each offering very distinct, channel partners benefit from selling the entire portfolio. This is an important point and one of which we are very focused.
In our traditional mid-tier storage space, our newly launched VNX family is being very well received by the market. Our unified VNX products, which is also part of our January announcement, started shipping the last week in February and was off to a strong start in March. 
VNX represented over 50% of the traditional mid-tier orders we have booked in the last two weeks in the quarter and we expect VNX revenue to continue to ramp over the course of the year. It has a long list of advantages against competitors, advantages that customers in this space really respond to. 
First, it is simple. The market-leading capabilities of our file and block solutions are now combined into a single unified platform that is managed to a centralized and simple user interface. 
Also, it is efficient. It is the only storage system that automates both file and block sub-LUN tiering with FAST VP. The combination of this, the compression and file duplication, enables customers to significantly improve capacity efficiency. It was great to see that almost 50% of VNX systems went out with flash capability, which indicates customers are taking advantage of tiering. 
And finally, it is powerful. By leveraging x86-based multi-core processor technology to maximize solution throughput and bandwidth, the VNX, that it will record performance benchmark the network file performance and overall response times. VNX is 3x faster than our previous generation systems.
With the launch of VNX, we drastically simplified our storage software offerings by streamlining over 25 different software products into five suites. This bundling has been extremely popular with our customers as well as with channel partners, as it's now much simpler to buy. The result was a dramatic increase in software penetration with VNX and a deeper value proposition for our customers. 
In short, the VNX features set resonates with customers and was instrumental in winning several competitive deals in the quarter, across a variety of verticals, including a telephone service provider, building out infrastructure of the service for its client base; a bank, eager to take advantage of information [ph] FAST and FAST Cache on VNX to increase usable capacity and improve performance at lowest costs; a restaurant chain, looking to move out to private cloud; and a national police force, where we were already a trusted provider, and with VNX we're able to displace the incumbent vendor of this tiered file storage.
We entered the SMB market in Q1 with the launch of VNXe which started shipping the 2nd week of March. The VNXe provides proven EMC quality into an affordable unified storage system. We designed the VNXe to be easy to manage, easy to sell and easy to support, with the features and functions you would expect from an EMC products at a price you may not. 
The VNXe offers capabilities like advanced data reduction technology, automated technical support and efficient provisioning for mailboxes or VMware data stores, as an enterprise, it firmly establishes it as the best value in the markets. Remember, that this is a new product in a new space being sold to new customers through new channel partners, so it's going to take some time before we see a material benefit to our growth. However, we are pleased to report that VNXe is off to a strong start.
We are rapidly on-boarding hundreds of new partners to sell the VNXe at a crazy [indiscernible] with existing channels. In fact, with VNXe launch events in dozens of cities across the globe, we signed on more new partners in the first quarter this year than we signed on over the course of all of last year, and the progress continues.
The significant majority of our mid-tier portfolio is sold via our channel partners and we are proud of progress we're making here, particularly, as our client -- oh, we have an agreement with Dell, the client's less than $40 million of revenue in Q1. 
In response to feedback we solicited from our growing partner community, just last week, we announced several enhancements to our channel partner program to accelerate partner profitability. We'll continue to deal with these relationships in ways that are mutually beneficial to both EMC and to our channel partners.
Moving now to our Backup Recovery Systems division, which spans a variety of customer sizes, verticals and environments. BRS' ability to add value to just about any backup environment helps explain this division's consistently strong performance, with our Data Domain products leading this growth. 
We expect this growth to continue, especially given the ongoing enhancements we're making to our market-leading product lineup. On Monday, we announced the expansion of Avamar for use in much larger production environments, by integrating it with Data Domain technology. We also announced state-of-the-art VMWare backup enhancements, with VMware APIs for Data Protection and tight integration with vCenter, Avamar can now provide up to 3x the backup speed of its nearest competitor. 
This is an excellent illustration of the EMC effect at its fullest, capturing the wealth of opportunities available within EMC's existing accounts, while leveraging the deep resource of EMC, not only to connect with new customers, but also to drive valuable innovation as well.
We intend to use the power of the EMC effect to capture the opportunity presented by Big Data, with scale on NAS [network-attached storage] and data analytics as well. In the scale of that space, our Isilon Storage Division exceeded expectations in its first quarter within EMC. This is due to the merits of its highly differentiated technology with the global namespace, a multi-petabyte scalability, Isilon Systems are designed to handle massive numbers of large files. In other words, Big Data. 
We continue to differentiate the Isilon technology. Last week, we launched our next-generation hardware and software. The new systems incorporate greater tiering flexibility across SSD and FAST or SATA drives and combined this tier back-end with a large globally cogent cache and next-generation core processors. This technology improvements are leveraged by innovations on the software side, with significant enhancements to improve performance of mission-critical data center operations and with new recovery point objectives. The net effect is accelerated performance, throughput replication underscoring Isilon's market-leading position in scale at NAS.
Our technology advantage here is winning us new customers and getting us into environments where we're able to swap out competitors' products that cannot meet customers' scalability requirements. Isilon is also seeing early examples of the EMC effect and benefiting from the strength of EMC's brand and global reach. 
A couple of large wins in China in Q1 illustrate why Isilon is a storage infrastructure of choice for some many Big Data applications, in these cases, the Genomics. These customers need to make petabyte scale data sets simultaneously available to numerous instruments, users and data service. With Isilon, these customers are able to achieve unprecedented levels of both concurrent of sequential higher performance, while saving significant time and capital costs.
Our Data Computing Division continues to thrive in the Big Data analytics space, both Forrester and Gartner have recently recognized the Greenplum for architecture leadership in this space, as our continued innovation, solid execution and strong cloud focus form the basis of our competitive advantage. With twice the data loading speed of its nearest competitor and the industry's best performance, the EMC Data Computing Appliance permits more data to be analyzed faster and at lower costs. Because of these advantages, FAST, the leader in business analytics software, recently announced the expansion of its high performance computing offerings on our Data Computing Appliance. The combination of FAST's unique analytic capabilities with Greenplum's massively parallel architecture in a complete purpose-built appliance, delivers a compelling value proposition to customers.
To sum up, our Storage business has never been better positioned. Looking forward, we expect to see a bounce back of growth in the mid-tier, driven by full-quarter contributions from the new VNX family and continued leadership in the high end. Again, our strength in storage comes from our ability to provide leading-edge technology to a broader range of customers in used cases. After this, our depth of experience and our proven track record, and EMC emerges as the storage vendor of choice as customers transition to the cloud and navigate the challenges and opportunity presented by Big Data.
Our RSA Security revenues in Q1 were $174 million, up 8% year-on-year. We saw a strong growth from our GRC [governance, risk and compliance], data loss prevention and IPv solutions. This was somewhat offset by a pause in shipments as we reviewed and hardened our systems in response to the sophisticated cyber attacks targeting RSAs that occurred in the quarter. 
Customers are our first priority, and RSA's management and sales force are actively engaged in the customers and partners to address their questions and ensure they have the tools and support necessary to reinforce the security of their RSA SecureID environments. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, it is likely that we will give up some revenue growth within the RSA business in the short term, as we continue to work with customers and strengthen these relationships for the long term.
This year's record attendance at the RSA conference, which is the marquee security conference, underscores the fact that the security challenges faced by IT organizations around the world are not going away. As attacks grow more sophisticated, previously targeted, customers need defense mechanisms at multiple levels to defend against them. 
We deepened our RSA's analytics and virtualization offerings early this month with the acquisition of NetWitness. This acquisition, adds network analysis and insight to better inform security managements. This is a highly complementary addition to our store of GRC, data loss prevention and security information and event management offerings, as customers seek multilayer security offerings, as threats become increasingly persistent and complex. 
Revenues from our Information Intelligence Group in Q1 were $160 million, down 10% from Q1 of last year, when we saw a larger number of big orders, including one particularly large financial services transaction. While growth here has been disappointing, the technology is good. We're making some key changes to help this business perform to its potential. 
Our new xCP offering is earning accolades. It was awarded a leadership position by both Forrester and Gartner, in the most recent assessment of the space, because it can be used to build intelligent case-based apps faster at much lower costs and with fewer resources. We are building lightweight applications on top of xCP, using modern virtualized frameworks. These are geared for specific industries, which will in turn allow for much faster solution deployments. 
And we've reorganized the IIG [Information Intelligence Group] sales force into a more vertically aligned structure with fewer accounts for rep, enabling our sales teams to identify and execute on opportunities more rapidly. This is an initiative we expect to start bearing fruit in the second half of the year. Because of these efforts, we expect this year to be one of modest growth and significant transition for IIG, with results being a business as much better positioned for success. 
VMware revenue grew 33% in the quarter to a record $843 million. The VMware saw strength across all geographies and benefited from high close rates on large enterprise license agreements in the quarter. This impressive growth of VMware stems from a few simple facts. Virtualization is now mainstream, with the majority of new applications being deployed in virtual environments, it is a standard feature in modern data centers. 
Virtualization is a fundamental first step for cloud computing, without it, customers are limited by the inefficiencies of physical infrastructures. And virtualization is being led by VMware, which is head and shoulders above others in this space, particularly for full data center deployments.
In Q1, there continues to be countless examples of the affinity between VMware's robust virtualization platform and EMC's proven information infrastructure. As more customers entering Phase 2 in their journey to the cloud, we see more mission-critical applications being virtualized and deployed on high-end infrastructure or said differently, this can live up to the more demanding SLAs [Service Level Agreements] these workloads require. There are many such examples of these implementations in Q1, in retail, telecom, Internet, construction and insurance, to name but a few.
Let me take a moment here for a couple of housekeeping items on how you should model VMware's results within EMC. First, we've broken out for you the expected full-year minority interest of approximately $175 million. We've also provided you with an estimate of the additional dilution of $50 million for the non-GAAP EPS calculation. 
These items are being implied within our consolidated expectations, but we noticed not everyone has modeled in correctly. These amounts have been relatively small historically, but as VMWare's success continues it is increasingly important how non-GAAP EPS is calculated. The take away here is you should include both of these when modeling consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the full year. 
Across our business, we have a number of additional initiatives to facilitate customers’ transition to cloud. Our Consulting division continues to see good demand for assistance building out cloud architectures. But getting to hybrid cloud also means utilizing enterprise cloud searches offered by external providers. And we're directing a lot of energy to make sure service providers have the technology and expertise necessary to enable these offerings. We've made lots of progress in this front, and you can expect additional announcements from us next week.
Through our joint venture with Cisco and VMware, VCE, we're helping customers get to IT-as-a-Service much more quickly, with Vblock converged infrastructure products. The value proposition here is incredibly powerful as a Vblock enables the deployments of best-of-breed IT infrastructure in a matter of hours, rather than days or even months. With an expanding pipeline and a workforce approaching 1,000, VCE opened its headquarters in Dallas last month and will soon open offices in San Jose, Raleigh, Durham and London. 
Given the market momentum, we're accelerating our investments in VCE. As it's important route to market, we'll service well in the race to create both private and public cloud infrastructures. We're increasing our projection for other expense in 2011 by approximately $70 million. The accelerated VCE investment is reflected here as our changes in the operating effects associated with VCE. However, we expect improvement to our operating margin from Vblock operating sales to effectively offset most of these increase in other expense during 2011.
We are focused on developing the broader IT ecosystem to support hybrid cloud implementations. The alternative to our broad-based strategy is the single-vendor approach, wherein customers are dependent upon one company for applications, infrastructure and services. Our open approach offers choice, as it engages an array of partners allowing customers to take advantage of developments and innovations, springing up across the broad ecosystem. While this strategy requires coordination of efforts across several players, we are committed, as we fairly believe it offers the best long-term value proposition to our customers.
Looking more closely at our financials. It is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets, which we've been building over the last several years, has resulted in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. 
Total revenue grew 18% to $4.6 billion in Q1. Revenue from the U.S. was up double digits, while our strategy to invest in geographies outside the U.S. is paying off, as the rapid growth of these markets helped drive our overall results. Our BRIC + 13 markets grew over 40%, and EMEA and APJ [Asia Pacific/Japan] were up 21% and 43%, respectively. This helps drive our non-U.S. mix to record 49% of revenue. 
We improved non-GAAP gross margin by 160 basis points over last year's first quarter. This improvement was driven in part by our ability to offer differentiated features that enable customers to maximize the value of their information infrastructures. We continued to show leverage and our non-GAAP operating margin grew 220 basis points year-on-year to 21.7%. Results of these improvements was non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31, up 19% from $0.26 a year ago.
We recognized there's a lot of interest in Japan and how it might impact our supply chain. While the longer-term impacts of these tragic events are still unknown, we have very solid relationships with our suppliers and believe we've been able to develop a clearer picture of our near-term risks. After carefully assessing hundreds of our suppliers and their supplies that may have been impacted, we have determined that only a handful currently have some supply risk exposure. We've taken risk mitigation steps and continue to monitor the situation. At this time, we do not see any meaningful impact in Q2 and continue to work with our suppliers to secure the components we need for the second half.
We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned nearly $900 million in cash to shareholders in Q1, with the repurchase of more than 33 million EMC shares. Augmenting VMware's $148 million share repurchase in Q1, we also invested $38 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. To reiterate the rationale for these purchases, we strongly believe in VMware's potential, given its strategic position as the cloud data center operating system of the future. As a result, we believe our relatively small purchase to maintain our ownership level on excellent long-term investment.
In closing, we're encouraged by our strong Q1 results and the opportunities as we look ahead for the rest of the year. Given the trends in the market, our strategic position and our focus to execution, we now have greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 and free cash flow of $4 billion. 
Note that the non-GAAP EPS goal we gave you in January contemplated a share count of 2.23 billion. We since increased our projected share count to 2.26 billion shares, which impacts our full-year non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02. This is a direct result of the increase in our share price in Q1, driving a higher average share price assumption for the full year. Offsetting this, we now expect that operating margin for the full year to be between 23% and 24% due to better operating margins in our Storage business and improved margins from VMware.
In summary, we executed well against our strategy in Q1, and we believe the outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond is bright. The major trends in cloud and Big Data are large and growing, our strategy is in place and we will continue to execute very well. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter and the vast opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?"

I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's Q1 earnings call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more pleased with the way our strategy and products are resonating with our customers. Clearly, customers are extremely interested in the massive benefits which private and public cloud computing can bring. And they see how our products, services and solutions can help them accelerate their journey to the cloud, while helping them meet the vast demands their business is placing on IT today.
Also, it is extremely clear that good financial results and winning strategies, products and services do not happen at any company or organization without talented, hard-working, dedicated people. And EMC and VMware are truly blessed with more than 50,000 people who exhibit these winning traits, as they focus day in and day out on the success of their customers. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their first class execution.
Let me now comment on IT spending and our expectations for the remainder of 2011. On balance, we still expect to see IT spending up this year in the 5% to 7% range, most probably in the higher end of that range. And we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technology, namely in virtualization, the cloud OS [operating system] and information storage, information protection, information security and then, information management intelligence, are technology areas which will grow substantially faster than the 5% to 7% IT average.
However, while we are pretty confident that IT spending will be solid, I would like to note that there are some potential event risks, such as the impacts of the disasters in Japan, global public-sector deficits and rising commodity prices, especially oil that can cause a sense of uncertainty. We will continue to monitor these three resources of potential risks. And to be clear, we are still confident that we can meet and potentially beat our 2011 plan of $19.6 billion in revenue and $1.46 of non-GAAP EPS. 
The source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and Big Data strategies are well-placed, and are underpinned with winning products and fully committed and funded product roadmaps.
On the VMware side, vSphere, vShield, the vCloud Director, vCenter, the vFabric, Cloud Foundry and the claim are critical market-leading core elements for private, public and hybrid cloud computing, and cloud computing engenders information on a massive scale. We call this phenomena Big Data. Our VMAX, Isilon and Atmos product families, along with our virtual storage offering VPLEX, addresses Big Data storage opportunity head-on. 
These products continue to be extremely well-received by our customers on both the private and public side. And our Greenplum and IIG suite of products help customers get big value from their Big Data assets.
Next is massive scale of information needs to be protected. In other words, information needs to be highly available and eventually archived at reasonable cost points, in concert with business process objectives. Here our Data Domain, Avamar and network technologies, featuring industry-leading performance, data compression and data de-duplication hit the mark head on. 
Additionally, strong, effective and pervasive information security is quick becoming a top four mandate for all IT data center environments, especially for cloud computing environments. Here is where we see our safety on newer products were identity protection and verification for data loss prevention; for security and event management; for governance, risk and compliance; and now, with our acquisition of NetWitness, for network forensic, play a critical role. In short, we are the most complete suite of security technology products that meet the vigorous demands of massive scale clouds.
And finally, with demanding mid-tier environments and SMB implementations, our VNX and VNXe storage lines are generating a very strong reception from our customers.
All in all, we have an extremely well-placed and focused technology lineup, backed by our world-class services organization and our service provider partners to help accelerate our customers' journey to the hybrid cloud. And the best news of all, we have more innovation coming. Stay tuned to EMC World, which starts on May 9th, where we will launch many more exciting new products that will help extend our leading cloud technology stack.
Thank you for joining us today. I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So relative to the VNX, we're very excited about the way that is progressing. As I've mentioned, we even start shipping the products until the last week in February, so we really had a very short selling quarter for VNX. We announced it, of course, in the middle part of January, so we knew we created a little bit of a pause in the market until it became available, and that's what happened. Essentially, the VNX replaces both cloud and Celerra. And as I mentioned, in the last two weeks of the quarter, we sold more than 50% of the orders from those 3 products moving towards VNX. So we do expect the growth of VNX to accelerate. We expect it to quite quickly, certainly in the second quarter, it will be well over 50% of the what we call our traditional mid-tier, but we expect the combination of those 3 products to grow quite nicely. And with others we expect to bounce back in total growth in the mid-tier in the second quarter, because we'll have a full quarter where we will be shipping and selling VNX. That's the flavor on the mid-tier. Relative to the year, obviously, we're off to a great start, the numbers I think speak for themselves. We did 18% revenue growth. We did the 19% non-GAAP EPS growth. And of course, that combines with our annual guidance of 15% and 16%, respectively. So we obviously started off out the gates, ahead of the pace. And that's why I said, we are more confident now. We can meet and of course potentially beat our guidance, and we just want to see a little bit more the year develop before we change our numbers explicitly."

And of course, when you start tiering like that, you remove the need for customer to buy separate, in a way, high-end, mid-tier and low-end systems because you can get all those benefits in one architecture. And of course, if you have a, say a Symmetrix, a big farm of Symmetrix or VMAXs, probably the least expensive alternative for you is to put – they’ve got a lot of horsepower and there's to put more drives with better big SATA drives and use the FAST technology to move data very quickly, very efficiently to that lower tier. So in a way, that's helping blur the line, so for sure, VMAX is now taking some loads that were in formerly mid-tier. As far as the VNX line is concerned, as the performance and capabilities of that system, I mean, it is -- we're seeing in real customer instances, 3x the performance as that technology gets more and more used, and FAST VP works there, we expect that. So basically, do the lines overlap a bit? Yes, they do, and that's intentional. Because when you leave gaps, that's where competitors drive. So we believe we're going to see a significant acceleration of VNX sales and VNXe sales, obviously, and we're very pleased with our position on both."

So first of all, and Joe will give you a little bit more color on how it's going. We are accelerating investment because the market opportunity is great. As I mentioned, we're up to close 1,00",299,"Yes, Ben. So let me talk about the P&L mechanics and dynamics. So first of all, and Joe will give you a little bit more color on how it's going. We are accelerating investment because the market opportunity is great. As I mentioned, we're up to close 1,000 people which is certainly ahead of our plan at this point in time by a few hundred. So there's 2 things that are impacting that $70 million increase in guidance we gave you in the other expense line. The first is the fact that we are accelerating our expenses a little bit more than we expected. And the second piece, is that because of how we're selling Vblocks and where we're selling Vblocks. More of the Vblock sales are being recorded directly up on the parent P&L. So differently, not much as the revenues is flowing through VCE as we expected. What's happening is that the margin that would have been captured by VCE, is now being captured directly by us in our operating margin. Over time, we do expect that to cap balance out a little bit, but for this year we expect that to be the case. What's happening is, you got a little bit of accelerated investment and you've also got margin that would've been flowing through VCE now flowing up through the parents. And that's why I said, we expect to cover both of those through the operating results of Vblocks as they flow through the parents over the course of the year. Obviously, there'll be a slight timing issue. We're going be accelerating our investments sooner when we're picking up all the revenue on the other side. But that's why we say net-net, it will be pretty neutral when you look at the full year guidance."

Let me talk about the share counts and how we're going on with buyback. So you're right, it started off the year, our guidance on share counts has gone from $2.23 billion to $2.26 billion, and that's directly a function of share price. If you remember from what we talked about last time, the increase in share price basically drives three things, that's account for the extra 30 million shares in our forecast. The first is, it impacts the dilution from the convertible. Remember roughly half of that is kind of what we call accounting dilution, it goes away when the convertible matures. About half of that is economic dilution, as agreed we have to pay those shares out. Then the second is, the smallest of the three, is with a higher share price we expect some increase in acceleration of option timing. Last but not least, the high share price impacts the number of shares we can buy with the buyback we have for the year. As you know, we're committed to spending $1.5 billion on buying back EMC shares this year. We spent a little less than $900 million in the first quarter, so we actually did move pretty quickly getting out the blocks after the earnings call just to start buying back. And when we look at the timing, the opportunity, but we're still on track do the $1.5 billion. But bear in mind, again, on the share count, a big piece of the impact goes away. And if you kind of look at our Q1 average, we have about 80 million shares in our share count, which are from the accounting impact of the convertible. So when that convertible matures, disappear completely, so you've got a little bit of artificial inflation in the share count as well as real inflation. Joe on dividends?"

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another quarter of record results. We achieved record second quarter revenues of $4.85 billion, up 20% from last year, as revenue growth improved from Q1 across all of our reporting segments. We achieved record Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.35, up 25% from Q2 of last year. And we continue to improve both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.
These results are further evidence that our strategy is on target and we continue to execute on our triple play. We gaining market share, investing for the future and improving profitability. Our unwavering focus on providing customers with the right technology to transform their IT and get the most of their data is resonating with our customers and winning us knew us ones. We have innovated and invested the of these needs and continue to do so day in and day out.
And in this focus on innovation that has earned us our market leading position which continues to get stronger. There is no other company in IT with our combination of best of breed technology for both the virtualization and infrastructure layers that enable cloud computing and for unlocking the value contained within big data that surrounds us. Given that we are still close to the beginning than at the end of this fundamental shift to cloud computing, we continue to invest and innovate in the right areas to ensure we take full advantage of the massive opportunity that lies ahead.
Now let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various businesses, starting with Information Storage.
Growth in our Information Storage revenue was strong, up 19% to $3.6 billion. Within that Information Storage, we saw the year-over-year growth changes we expected from the high and for the mid tier as our high-end product growth moderates to 15% while our mid-tier product growth accelerated to 27%. This acceleration was driven by the strong results from our new VNX Family. We are clearly gaining share across our portfolio for traditional data center workloads, for cloud deployments and for Big Data workloads as well. As we continue to seek out the most efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data, customers of all sizes across all industries look to us for the best solutions for their unique IT storage requirements.
In the high end, it is our unique suitability for emerging needs that is driving our share gains. While customers continue to choose VMAX because it's capabilities for mission critical usage in traditional data center implementations, that increasingly selecting VMAX with new use cases as well. VMAX is enterprise class reliability, availability and serviceability appeal to service provider customers who're implementing VMAX to cloud services where its service levels are mission critical. VMAX is tiered Storage capabilities leveraged by fully automated tiering software, offer a total cost of ownership that competes with and is displacing incumbent Tier 2 vendors. VMAX is also finding its way to new customers through VPLEX. VPLEX's ability to full storage resources from multiple data centers is a value proposition competitors cannot match and which open stores for traditional EMC solutions.
As we continue to innovate, our solutions remain leading edge, meeting the emerging requirements of a growing number of customers. This was demonstrated with the announcement of VMAX E last week. VMAX E packages enterprise class functionality into a smaller and simpler array that comes preloaded, preconfigured and virtually provisioned for rapid deployments. Designed for organizations with limited storage expertise and IT resources, VMAX E extends the value proposition of VMAX to customers across the globe. This was a case with options, the third largest auction house in the world. Auctions knew it needed something more than a dual control architecture to achieve the highest levels of availability possible for its online customers. But it also want a system that's easy to use and would take us a little footprint in the data center as possible. The 1.3 petabytes of active storage VMAX offered was most sufficient for its needs and FAST VP will allow them to operate this array at a lower total cost of ownership as being offered by the competitor. In this case, HP free path. In short, heritage auctions selected EMC because VMAX E allowed to continue its migration to high performance, fully virtualized environments within its budget constraints and to be up and running in just a few hours.
As this example illustrates, the ability to Tiered Storage automatically with FAST software is a key feature very popular with customers. The adoption of tiering technologies continues to ramp as we shift more Flash capacity in VMAX in the first half of 2011  than in all of 2010, and at the penetration rate of FAST on new systems continues to steadily increase. Our VMAX systems are shipped with FAST in Q2, we are seeing Flash and SATA go out with almost 90% of these, indicating how important automated tiering is to customers. Through the right data and the right place at the right time, maximize the efficiency of their systems and maximize the return of their storage investments.
Looking across our broad portfolio in the mid-tier, we benefited from growth in each of our mid-tier product groups, from the VMX line, backup recovery systems and big data storage technologies. Starting with the VNX which is just completed first full quarter availability, we are pleased our progress here. VNX is ramping according to plan, with VNX now accounting for approximately 2/3 of the sales of our unified storage products, which include the VNX and the VNXe, Celerra and CLARiiON. Almost half of VNX systems sold in Q2 shipped with NAS on block protocols highlighting the value customers get from its unified architecture and from the flexibility it these brings to their environment. Tiering is as much of a value preposition on VNX as it is in VMAX. As the penetration rates of FAST on a unified product continues to grow, Flash capacity on our unified storage products grew 39% from Q1, and in the first half of this year, exceeded Flash ships on unified products to all of 2010. VNX is the only product that offers storage efficiency to automated tiering on a unified architecture, enabling customers to get the maximum value from their storage investments.
We win in competitive situations time and again because we're able to offer what customer wants and while we what differs from customer to customer, we are able to address all of the high priority requirements as we saw with our Q2 wins. It was the flexibility of VNX it's unified block and file capabilities that won a deal at a U.K. -based media company. It was the ability to tier with FAST on VNX, the one that deal on a global agri business and it was VNX's superior support of the DI rollout within a Vblock that won us a deal on a state government agency in Missouri.
The VNXe is off to a very strong start and its successful expanding our penetration into the SMB and commercial segments of the market, as over 600 of our VNXe customers in Q2 were new to EMC. The channels that are so key to success here continues to grow in numbers and productivity. We recognize how important channels are to the success of VNX and VNXe. We partner recruitment well underway, we've added over 1,000 more partners in the quarter and we are focusing our effort on getting our new partners ramped, trained and selling in volume. We're making excess progress here as the non-dell channel revenue grew over 40% year-on-year for our unified storage products.
Before Backup and Recovery Systems business continues to be strong after 8 quarters as part of EMC, Data Domain continues to benefit from the EMC effects and its popularity is pushed our other backup technologies into the forefront helping to drive growth in Avamar and network in Q2. The combination of our large customer base with the best-of-breed backup technology portfolio in the industry is serving as well. Despite others try to make play in this space, our wins are steady and frequent is increasingly move outside of our customer base.
Now turning to our solutions being specifically developed to handle Big Data, including iso- 1, Apple us and EMC Greenplum, as you know, the opportunity in big data is enormous with a social media to the medical field to manufacturing, Big Data files are everywhere. We seize the moment to help shape how the industry makes sense of this and does so efficiently.
Starting with our it Isilon solution, EMC affects combined with leading technology, with product revenue more than doubling year-on-year and our pipeline expanding. While Isilon strengths was driven in large part by continued strong demand from its traditional customer verticals like media and life sciences, Isilon is expanding into new segments as well like manufacturing. We see these opportunities for several reasons. First, it's the maturity of Isilon's offering and its 6 generation Isilon is established, trusted and ready for use in enterprise class applications. Second, EMC leverages these other verticals is bringing Isilon into deals they might have not seen before and those deals close faster. Third, enterprises, now simply have more file-based data than before and they're seeking the most efficient ways of storage. And finally, as we now announced a few weeks ago, with the latest spec results, I salon offers the world' fastest filesystems and is increasingly the technology of choice for any customer looking for a best-of-breed Scale-out NAS solution.
In short, Isilon solution is the market leader in big data storage because of its ability to scale performance on massive capacity requirements and this sets up well for the EMC effect. In fact, in the example mentioned earlier, auctions augmented VMAX e purchase with an Isilon system for its vast amount of auction related contents. The ability to meet a variety of need that one customer illustrates the value of such a broad and deep product portfolio.
Complementing Isilon in our Big Data portfolio is Atlas for globally distributed cloud environments. Ideal for the geographic distribution of Project -based data, the newly announced Atlas 2.0 is 5x faster and 65% more efficient than its predecessor. Storage are service providers like Tier 1 hosting Canada and 9 fold in Australia select Atlas as the platform for their self-service cloud storage offerings for several reasons, including the ability to set policies to max service levels and simplify deployments because it's available as a completely integrated software and hardware cloud storage solutions.
Now matter how efficiently Big Data is stored, it is important that improvements work. Organizations need a reason to store such vast amount of data that might have limited use on a file by file basis, but which is aggregates have the power to present a treasure trove of valuable insights. While the immense value of these data might prevent is only just begun to be unlocked, EMC Greenplum is at the forefront of what is rapidly becoming a new important field in data science. In our Data Computing division, we're driving our Big Data agenda faster than the usual database players and firmly establishing ourselves as thought leaders in this space as we're creating innovative solutions for customers to help them capture all of the value they can from the information. In less than a year with EMC, EMC Greenplum has accomplished quite a lot. Last year, we rolled out the Data Computing Appliance, a product that now accounts for over half of our EMC Greenplum revenue. In Q1, we announced a partnership with the latest company SAS and the partnership is hitting all of the milestones we set out for us.
In May, we announced the availability of the Greenplum Hadoop Enterprise edition available as software or as an appliance, which makes Hadoop enterprise ready by adding features like realtime data interaction, greater reliability and improved user ease-of-use and deployments.
Armed with these next generation data analytics tools, we're helping customers unlock the values trapped in all of their information structures and  unstructured alike.
In all, our storage product portfolio is second to none. Our differentiated technology across our entire solution sets in the high end, mid tier and backup and in Big Data is driving our ongoing stronger than market growth. Since we're still in the early stages of transition to IT-as-a-Service and tackling Big Data, we're comfortable continuing to gain market share.
Turning to our RSA Security division. I'm pleased to report that year-on-year revenue growth in Q2 increased to 13% from 8% in Q1, both our identity management and protection, and security management compliance businesses grew in Q2. Importantly, our security business grew as well. Security is one of the most important factors underlying customer confidence as we move to the hybrid cloud and we believe RSA has a unique portfolio solution to help customers secure their cloud environments.
In March, RSA suffered a cyberattack resulting in some information related to RSA SecurID products being compromised. Since our last earnings announcement, increased coverage of the attack on RSA and attack on Lockheed Martin reported abuse inflation taken from RSA and a steady stream of use of cyber attacks unconnected to RSA combined a heightened customer concern about risk in general. These events causes to take some additional actions related security and so I wanted to take a few minutes to walk you through these events, the effect they're having on our business and how we think about RSA's future success.
So starting at the beginning, we've detected an extremely sophisticated cyberattack on RSA systems in March and determined that some information related to our customer SecureID systems have been extracted. We alerted customers with hours of determining of this information could potentially impact their SecureID systems. We published recommended best practices to help customers protect against broader attacks, potentially leveraging the information taken. We reached out to thousands of customers and partners to discuss what we knew and how and why they should implement our recommended best practices. We hardened heightened IT infrastructure and the processes related to SecureID manufacturing and delivery.
Our analysis of the attack to believe that likely targets within the defense sector and related government agencies, our recommended remediation steps for these customers therefore also include total replacements. Our analysis also led us to believe that financial gain was not the likely motive and that the information was not as useful in targeting individual consumer accounts. However, on a case-by-case basis, we offered additional remediation such as risk-based authentication to customers protecting web-based consumer financial transactions. The suspicions that our attack the started the defense sector was reinforced in June when Lockheed Martin disclosed an unsuccessful attack on its systems have used among other elements information taken in the attack on RSA. Lockheed Martin had implemented many security measures, including our best practices and successfully detected and thwarted this attack. Subsequently, they accelerated their plans for total replacements to complete their SecurID remediation. I would note that Lockheed Martin incident was not the result of a new attack on RSA and there was no change customer risk or recommended remediation steps. While this change with our customer sensitivity to risk, this was caused by the same news flow around cyber attacks as in addition to press coverage of the attack on Lockheed Martin, there was broad media coverage of attacks on organizations including Google, Sony, Epsilon, the Australian Goverment and PBS. While these attacks were entirely unrelated to RSA, the publicity resulted in many customers risk products going down while the level of awareness concern went up.
Given this heightened sensitivity in early June, we fully expanded our remediation programs to all SecurID customers, offering 2 additional production options. For customers using SecureID to protect intellectual property and corporate networks, we offered total replacements. These customers represents only about 1/3 of the SecureID installed units that constitute the vast majority of the number of customers. The customers using Secureid to protect web-based consumer financial transactions, we offered additional transaction monitoring. These represents about 2/3 of the SecurID installed units concentrated in a small number of customers.
So from the beginning, we focused on our customers needs. We worked for actively and openly with them immediately after the attack and continued to do so. Importantly, customers continues to tell us that they the understand what happened, are comfortable with our communication and appreciate how we're working with them to ensure their security environments are effective. So that's a recap of the events. Now moving to the financial impacts of the remediation efforts.
In Q1, we incurred an accrued costs associated with investigating the attack, hardening our systems and working with customers to implement our remediation programs. Given our estimates of the financial impacts of these remediation programs, based upon the information we had at that time, we include the costs within our non-GAAP results. As a result of our decision in June to expand our remediation programs, we recorded a $66 million charge during the second quarter. This charge provides for additional transaction monitoring for all consumed customers who want it and for total replacements for all corporate customers who want them. Given the increased impact of the expanded remediation programs on our financial results and its nonrecurring nature, we've excluded the charge from our Q2 non-GAAP results.
Looking forward, it is likely that RSA growth will remain a bit slower after remediation efforts continue, but we're confident we're doing the right things to maintain customer loyalty and confidence in SecurID. The best proof of this successful efforts is how customers have reacted and I'm pleased to say that overall customer feedback is positive and increasingly customers are showing confidence. Lockheed Martin continues to use SecurID as part of its late approach to security. We had significant SecurID renewals in Q2 for wide range of customers including financial services and telecommunications. And we also gained new SecurID customers, including an order of over $900,000 from a European financial institution. These are pretty good indicators we're doing the right things and growing customer trust.
This trust is key as customers look to protect themselves from increasing pervasive and sophisticated cyber attacks. Customers need advanced network analysis, realtime security and inflation monitoring, Data Loss Prevention, service itself that these technologies to work. RSA has these assets and you can expect to see us being more proactive with customer who are ready to move beyond remediation to advance protection.
In summary, we responded quickly to these attacks and the heightened customer concerns. We have clear customer remediation programs. We have a good understanding of financial impacts will have on our business. We're working every day to earn and maintain customer trust. And this is a big reason why SecureID remains the industry-standard in multifaceted authentication. Security is one of the most important facets of customer confidence as they move to hybrid cloud and we believe that RSA has a unique set of assets to continue to help our customers secure their cloud environments.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $169 million, up 6% quarter-on-quarter. IIG continues to evolve to meet the buying preferences of today's content management customers. We took another step in our direction in May with the announcements of the on-demand availability of Captiva, document sciences, and Documentum. These offerings bring together best of breed technologies from EMC, VMWare and RSA and accelerate the journey to the cloud customer running EMC content management and collaborative applications.
VMware revenue growth accelerated to 37% in the quarter to a record $921 million. Virtualization is a fundamental building block for cloud computing and as the market leader is clear the customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. We extended our already strong lead in virtualization with the announcements last week of the Vsphere 5 and a complementary suite of cloud infrastructure products. VSphere 5 processing capabilities are well beyond what even the most resource intensive applications might need and comes just as customers are increasingly look to move such mission critical applications into the cloud. Because EMC offers the broader support in the industry for VMware products across our storage, backup and security portfolios, we can rapidly leverage the powerful new vSphere 5 features across the rest of our portfolio.
Several of the features unveiled last week extend VMWare's reach. For instance, vSphere's storage appliance has the ability to turn a small amount of local disks on virtualized servers into network storage while Site Recovery Manager 5 has the ability to replicate VM's on the host. Both of these are ideal features for smaller and remote customers and offer an on ramp for them to grow into a more powerful array based capabilities as the tight integration of our virtual and product sets enables the disrupted transition. Likewise, the new storage distributor resource scheduling capability of VMware are enhancing and accelerated by FAST VP, making an ideal combination of simplicity, integration, cost savings and improved performance.
We also continued to integrate our capabilities to make the virtual world more secure than the fiscal 1 by embedding RSA Data Loss Prevention capabilities into VMware vShield. This is a transformational development as it allows the scanning to confidential data within vSphere and vShield itself meaning any workload running in vSphere inherits the same secure behavior. This is very different than the physical world where it's necessary to plug devices into network or install a software on their host. What this means in the real world is that customers can ensure compliance with standards like socks, Cap out, PCI or PII buy scanning data for sensitive information and do so with no agents inside the operating system.
The power of combining the proven virtual layer with a proven infrastructure layer is not lost on customers. We've seen time and time again that the tight integration of our products with VMware is winning us market share in virtual environments but it's even larger than our share in physical environments where we're also the market leader. As we did last quarter, we've broken out for you VMWare's expected full year minority interest, which is now approximately $185 million. The financial impacts of the minority interest will only get larger as VMware grows, affecting EMC consolidated net income and EPS. Not everyone is modeling this correctly. Because this impact is meaningful and very likely to get more meaningful over time, we provided our estimates of what it will be. It is important to model it correctly. Likewise, we've again broken out our estimates of VMware's additional dilution of $16 million. This accounting convention is required to reflect the impact on EMC's earnings per share of the incremental shares included in VMware's diluted share count that are not included in the minority interest calculation.
As the delta between the VMWare's basic and diluted EPS changes, so will the impact on consolidated EPS so this additional dilution must be considered to correctly forecast and calculate our consolidated EPS. At $16 million, it's incremental dilution will account for about $0.01 cent of EPS in 2011.
Both VMWare's minority interest and additional dilution should be considered in modeling consolidated EMC's non-GAAP EPS for the full year.
It is clear that EMC has an extremely powerful set of solutions to help customers transition to the hybrid cloud and to take full advantage of their Big Data assets. But enabling customers to get to full agility in their cloud environments is not something EMC can do on our own, fully transforming IT to a point where customers have control, efficiency and choice that today's technology can enable requires a combined effort of EMC and our partners. As we look across the IT ecosystem, we've identified a variety of opportunity to collaborate in way that benefit EMC, our partners and most importantly, our customers. To get customers to hybrid cloud and benefiting from Big Data, we're leveraging our own search organization, as well as our channel service partners, service providers and with our joint venture, VCE
Through our own services organization, we provide expertise to customers on the most effective ways to get to cloud and to leverage the big data assets. And cloud related engagements continues to be the biggest contributors to growth in our consulting group. In the second quarter, we won significant consulting projects in Korea, Netherlands, Mexico, Chile and the U.S., all the customers who are eagerly looking to transition to cloud architectures. We also leveraged the expertise of our many different partners to help customers transition to more IIG, a strategy that is a stark contrast of many of our competitors who push their own services. Our partners appreciate this approach and EMC is rapidly gaining traction here. Many of our efforts recently have been focused on recruiting new channel partners and getting them fully educated on all the advantages of EMC technology. As we continued to ramp business to these partners with some important for the success of our broad portfolio, mid-tier adn SMB products in particular, we are seeing that the improvements we made to expand our channel partner program were the right ones.
Our focus on better leveraging our channel partners extends to existing partners as well and we've seen our efforts pay off. We've been particularly focused on 3 of our largest channel partners and saw their combined revenue increased 73% from last year's Q2 for our unified storage products. This is a remarkable growth and a clear indication that our reach to new markets is rapidly gaining traction. Service providers are also very important to the success of our hybrid cloud strategy. We have established partnerships with over 40 leading service providers around the world to help them offer new public cloud services. Our service provider partner community includes telcos like AT&T and Verizon, ISPs like hosting.com, outsourcers like CSE and enterprise extended their core business like NYSE technologies. We expect the number of partners to grow, and more importantly, the cloud services to provide of our products to flourish as the possibilities for improving the current state of IT with new and innovative cloud services are plentiful. Finally, momentum continues to build at VCE. We've seen substantial demand from small and large customers, as well as partners who appreciate Vblocks convert, best to breed virtualized infrastructure. And VCE's revenue for the first half of 2011 already exceeds the revenue it achieved all of 2010. It's easy to understand customers enthusiasm given the differentiated nature of Vblock platforms. Of course, there are all of customers who instead may opt for record architecture with parts for VMware, Cisco and EMC. And this approach is what competitors are trying to mimic with their own reference architectures. But the real differentiator is Vblock platforms which address the very real issues the reference architecture cannot with a single combination that can be up and running on day 1, a single glass management. A clear upgrade path without worries about Controller or lease management and one point of contact for integrated services and support. As the only converged infrastructure products in the market today, that's built and shipped direct from manufacturing facilities to customers sites to rapidly build out a cloud data center we are confident that VCE will continue on its rapid growth trajectory. As VCE grows, we are seeing increasing sales repeat customers who are standardizing their NextGen data center on the Vblock and moving their enterprise workloads into full production on Vblock platforms.
We will continue to improve our technology portfolio and build out and deepen our relationship with partners purchase service and resulting in clear value for our customers as is evidenced in our Q2 results.
Turning back to our financials for the quarter. Total revenue grew 20% to $4.85 billion in Q2. We reported record revenue internationally with revenue from APJ up 34% and EMEA operating 20% from Q2 of 2010. Growth in North America was also strong at 17%. We improved non-GAAP gross margins by 210 basis points over last year's second quarter. Once again, this improvement was mainly driven by an increased mix of higher gross margin products including VMware. This improvement helps continue to show leverage and was the main driver for the increase in non-GAAP operating margin of 240 basis points year-on-year to 23.1%. Year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $1.56 billion, approximately $70 million higher than non-GAAP net income.
We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned approximately $230 million in cash to shareholders in Q2, with the repurchase of EMC shares bringing our stock repurchase to $1.1 billion for the first half. Augmenting VMWare's $133 million share purchases in Q2, we also invested $62 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. We spent approximately $700 million in Q2 on a combination of acquisitions, strategic and other related investments and the VMware land lease in Palo Alto.
In closing, given our strong results for the first half of the year and our outlook for continued strong execution in quarters 3 and 4, we are raising our expectations for the full year. We are now expect to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. Our success as a winning provider of technology to cloud and Big Data will ultimately be measured over the course of several years. Our strategy, innovation and continued strong execution keep us firmly on track to meet or exceed the financial targets we discussed in February to reach 2014 revenue of $28 billion and deliver EPS leverage on top of this implied strong top line growth. With our unique competitive position, strength of our strategy and model, and the vast opportunities that lies ahead, we're excited about what we can accomplish in cloud and Big Data not only in 2011, but over the course of next several years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe who will give more color on the outlook, the quarter, and the great opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?"

As always, thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q2 results. It is important to note that these results were underpinned buy solid growth across all of our major geographies and across the vast majority of our product divisions and business units. Balanced results are critical to sustain success.
Also critical to our long-term success is customer acceptance of our strategic vision and our ability to deliver against it. Clearly, our hybrid cloud and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers and they see our products and services as relevant and trust us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its massive benefits. I would like to recognize our 50,000 people around the world that are members of the EMC and VMware family and thank them for their many accomplishments, for their innovation, their hard work and their dedication to our customer success. Let me now comment on the global macro economic environment in which we operate and talk about our expectations for IT spending in the second half of 2011.
Starting with 2011 IT spending trends, we still believe that overall IT spending will be up in the 5% to 7% range this year, and we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technologies, namely in virtualization in, in Information Storage, information protection, and Information Security and in Big Data, are all technology areas which will grow substantially faster than a 5% to 7% average.
While we believe that IT spending in 2011 will be good, I would like to point that there are several potential macroeconomic risk areas that we continued to watch closely. As you may recall, at our Q1 conference call, we talked about 3 macro risks, namely, the disaster in Japan, a potential slowdown in public sector spending due to significant deficits and rising commodity prices especially oil. Reporting against each of these 3 potential risks in Q2, I am pleased to report that our year-over-year growth rate in Japan was good and we experienced.

Reporting against each of these 3 potential risks in Q2, I am pleased to report that our year-over-year growth rate in Japan was good and we experienced no major supply chain interruptions. And we expect the balance of 2011 to be okay. Our Q2 Public Sector revenues grew year-over-year in the low double digits but this is still an area we believe has the potential risk and we will continue to monitor this sector in the second half of the year. And as you know, commodity prices overall did not escalate much in Q2. In fact, the oil prices pulled back a bit, obviously, also an area to watch that greatly affects our economy. So all in all, no glaring red lights on these 3 potential risks to IT spending. That said, we did see some softness in southern Europe and we expect this softness to be with us through the second half of this year.
That said, these countries make up a very small percentage of EMC's consolidated revenues but their impact on Europe as a whole represents an additional risk factor. Although I'm not totally related to the economy, we experienced some softness in our content management business as was evidenced by the 5% year-on-year decline we posted in our IIG business unit. We are working hard to properly reposition this business. We have a plan and a new management team in place and we do expect to return to growth late this year or early next.
I assure you we will continue to monitor all sorts of potential risk to IT spending. But to be clear, we are confident in our ability to produce strong results this year. This is evidenced by the fact that we raised our guidance for 2011 today. As David has already said, we now expect to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and also exceed $1.48 of non-GAAP EPS.
I said 90 days ago, the source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and Big Data strategies are well-placed and our underpinned with winning products that are fully committed and funded product roadmaps. This is true today and in 2011 has been and will continue to be a banner year for us, with a record number of very significant product introductions. In Q1, at the EMC mega launch, we announced 41 new or significantly refreshed products, a significant note here with the launch of the and VNXe, the data domain archiver and FAST VP. I am pleased to report that all these products are doing well and FAST VP is now our fastest growing storage software product.
In Q2, at our attendance break in EMC world, again, had a series of very important product launches. For example, we launched a new Isolon hardware and a new version of its OneFS operating system. And Isilon System can now scale 15 petabytes under a single filesystem with unmatched performance and ease-of-use. I am pleased to report that Isilon is now our fastest growing storage platform. We introduced the Plex with the unique capability to pull EMC and non-EMC storage resources between data centers creating true virtual storage with the ability to access this pool of information from anywhere.
We also announced the expansion of our Greenplum big data strategy and launched our commitment to distribution and support and its integration with Greenplum software and the Greenplum appliance. And in the last 2 weeks, VMware launched vSphere 5, along with several other major product enhancements. In short, vSphere 5 now has the performance, scale, availability and ease-of-use features to run all, even the most mission critical applications and ensure the massive benefits of virtualization and cloud computing.
Also very importantly, EMC just launched Maxxi, a new scale-out to metrics platform with renowned ingenuity capabilities. This system closes the gap between our VNX and VMAX platforms. We actually started shipping Maxxi to customers in June, thus, we now have several systems installed and the feedback from customers is nothing short of outstanding. And lastly, we introduced period, an all new storage resource management solution for the virtualization and cloud computing era, featuring ease-of-use and the ability to massively scale. As you will note, the vast majority of these key product introductions are aimed to help our customers and our service partners accelerate their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, and there is more to come. As I have said before, consolidated EMC is a technology company and innovative products are the lifeblood of a technology company. To this end, we will continue to invest heavily in R&D and we will continue to acquire smaller companies who have leading technologies that enhance our strategic vision and give us faster time to market.
Additionally, to assure customers get exposed to our products and receive the maximum value from them, we will continue to build out our of high-quality partners to help our terrific sales and service organizations in the areas of product integration and solutions, product distribution, and with services and support. EMC are focused on building out a world-class partner ecosystem and the fruits of this effort is definitely showing up in our results.
Our joint venture with Cisco, VCE continues to grow in both revenue and relevance. Customer interest in Vblock and technologies is extremely high, and the installed base of the blog is performing very well. For sure, the blocks are proving their value proposition. And we expect Vblock sales to hit the billion-dollar run rate mark in the next several quarters. As this business has grown, Michael, John and I have tapped one our very successful and senior leaders, Frank to join VCE as its President and COO. We are pleased to have Frank on the VCE team. So again, thank you for joining us today and I like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So even though we're getting a more competitive price environment, we've also got a more competitive build, and the margin profile is exactly in line with what we expected with the full a quarter behind is good to be able to report on that."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another quarter of record results. We achieved record second quarter revenues of $4.85 billion, up 20% from last year, as revenue growth improved from Q1 across all of our reporting segments. We achieved record Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.35, up 25% from Q2 of last year. And we continue to improve both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.
These results are further evidence that our strategy is on target, and we continue to execute on our triple play. We're gaining market share, investing for the future and improving profitability. Our unwavering focus on providing customers with the right technology to transform their IT and get the most from their data is resonating with our customers and winning us new ones. We have innovated and invested to stay in front of these needs and continue to do so day in and day out.
It is this focus on innovation that has earned us our market-leading position, which continues to get stronger. There is no other company in IT with our combination of best-of-breed technology for both the virtualization and infrastructure layers that enable cloud computing and for unlocking the value contained within Big Data that surround us. Given that we're still close to the beginning than at the end of this fundamental shift to cloud computing, we continue to invest and innovate in the right areas to ensure we take full advantage of the massive opportunity that lies ahead.
Now let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various businesses, starting with Information Storage.
Growth in our Information Storage revenue was strong, up 19% to $3.6 billion. Within Information Storage, we saw the year-on-year growth rate changes we expected from the high-end and from the mid-tier, as our high-end product growth moderates to 15% while our mid-tier product growth accelerated to 27%. This acceleration was driven by the strong results from our new VNX Family. We're clearly gaining share across our portfolio for traditional data center workloads, for cloud deployments and for Big Data workloads as well. As we continue to seek out the most efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data, customers of all sizes and across all industries look to us for the best solutions for their unique IT storage requirements.
In the high end, it is our unique suitability for emerging needs that is driving our share gains. While customers continue to choose VMAX because its capabilities for mission-critical uses in traditional data center implementations, they're increasingly selecting VMAX for new use cases as well. VMAX's enterprise class reliability, availability and serviceability appeal to service provider customers who're implementing VMAX to cloud services where its service levels are mission critical. VMAX's tiered storage capabilities, leveraged by fully automated tiering software, offer a total cost of ownership that competes with and is displacing incumbent Tier 2 vendors. VMAX is also finding its way to new customers through VPLEX. VPLEX's ability to full storage resources from multiple data centers is a value proposition competitors cannot match and which opens doors for additional EMC solutions.
As we continue to innovate, our solutions remain leading edge, meeting the emerging requirements of a growing number of customers. This was demonstrated with the announcement of VMAXe last week. VMAXe packages enterprise-class functionality into a smaller and simpler array that comes preloaded, preconfigured and virtually provisioned for rapid deployments. Designed for organizations with limited storage expertise and IT resources, VMAXe extends the value proposition of VMAX to customers across the globe. This was the case with Heritage Auctions, the third largest auction house in the world. Heritage Auctions knew it needed something more than a dual-control architecture to achieve the highest levels of availability possible for its online customers. But it also wants a system that's easy to use and would take up as little footprint in the data center as possible. The 1.3 petabytes of active storage VMAXe offered was most sufficient for its needs. And FAST VP would allow them to operate this array at a lower total cost of ownership that is being offered by the competitor, in this case, HP 3PAR. In short, Heritage Auctions selected EMC because VMAXe allowed it to continue its migration to high performance, fully virtualized environments within its budget constraints and to be up and running in just a few hours.
As this example illustrates, the ability to tier storage automatically with FAST software is a key feature that's very popular with customers. The adoption of tiering technologies continues to ramp as we shift more Flash capacity in VMAX in the first half of 2011 than in all of 2010 and as the penetration rate of FAST on new systems continues to steadily increase. 
Of VMAX systems that shipped with FAST in Q2, we're seeing Flash and SATA go out with almost 90% of these, indicating how important automated tiering is to customers. Pulling the right data in the right place at the right time maximize the efficiency of their systems and maximize the return of their storage investments.
Looking across our broad portfolio in the mid-tier, we benefited from growth in each of our mid-tier product groups, from the VNX line, backup recovery systems and our Big Data storage technologies. 
Starting with the VNX, which just completed its first full quarter availability, we are pleased of our progress here. VNX is ramping according to plan, with VNX now accounting for approximately 2/3 of the sales of our unified storage products, which include the VNX and the VNXe, Celerra and CLARiiON. Almost half of VNX systems sold in Q2 shipped with NAS on block protocols, highlighting the value customers get from its unified architecture and from the flexibility it brings to these environments. Tiering is as much of a value preposition on VNX as it is in VMAX. As the penetration rates of FAST on our unified products continues to grow, Flash capacity on our unified storage products grew 39% from Q1 and in the first half of this year exceeded Flash ships on unified products to all of 2010. VNX is the only product that offers storage efficiency to automated tiering on a unified architecture, enabling customers to get the maximum value from their storage investments.
We win in competitive situations time and again because we're able to offer what customers want. And while what we want differs from customer to customer, we're able to address all of the high-priority requirements as we saw with our Q2 wins. It was the flexibility of VNX's unified block and file capabilities that won a deal at a U.K. -based media company. It was the ability to tier with FAST on VNX that won a deal at a global agribusiness. And it was VNX's superior support of VDI rollouts within a Vblock that won us a deal at a state government agency in Missouri.
The VNXe is off to a very strong start and is successful expanding our penetration into the SMB and commercial segments of the market, as over 600 of our VNXe customers in Q2 were new to EMC. The channels that are so key to success here continue to grow in numbers and productivity. We recognize how important channels are to the success of VNX and VNXe. With partner recruitment well underway, we've added over 1,000 more partners in the quarter, and we're focusing our effort on getting our new partners ramped, trained and selling volume. We're making excellent progress here as the non-Dell channel revenue grew over 40% year-on-year for our unified storage products.
Performance in our backup and recovery systems business continues to be strong. After 8 quarters as part of EMC, Data Domain continues to benefit from the EMC effects and its popularity has pushed our other backup technologies into the forefront, helping to drive growth in Avamar and Networker in Q2. The combination of a large customer base with the best-of-breed backup technology portfolio in the industry is serving us well. Despite others trying to make play in this space, our wins are steady and frequent as we increasingly move outside our customer base.
Now turning to our solutions being specifically developed to handle Big Data, including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum. As you know, the opportunity in Big Data is enormous. From social media to the medical field to manufacturing, Big Data files are everywhere. We're seizing the moment to help shape how the industry makes sense of this and does so efficiently.
Starting with our scale-out NAS solution. Isilon is showing all the whole box of the EMC effects, combined with leading technology, with product revenue more than doubling year-on-year and our pipeline expanding. While Isilon strengths was driven in large part by continued strong demand from its traditional customer verticals like media and life sciences, Isilon is expanding into new segments as well like manufacturing. 
We're seeing these opportunities for several reasons: First is the maturity of Isilon's offering. In its sixth generation, Isilon is established, trusted and ready for use in enterprise-class applications. Second, EMC leveraging these other verticals is bringing Isilon into deals they might not have seen before, and those deals close faster. Third, enterprises now simply have more file-based data than before, and they're seeking the most efficient ways to storage. And finally, as we announced a few weeks ago, with the latest spec results, Isilon offers the world's fastest file system and is increasingly the technology of choice for any customer looking for a best-of-breed scale-out NAS solution.
In short, Isilon solution is the market leader in Big Data storage because of its ability to scale performance on massive capacity requirements and this sets it up well for the EMC effect. In fact, in the example mentioned earlier, Heritage Auctions augmented its VMAXe purchase with an Isilon system for its vast amount of auction-related contents. The ability to meet a variety of need of one customer illustrates the value of such a broad and deep product portfolio.
Complementing Isilon in our Big Data portfolio is Atmos for globally distributed cloud environments. Ideal for the geographic distribution of project -based data, the newly announced Atmos 2.0 is 5x faster and 65% more efficient than its predecessor. Storages of the service providers like PEER 1 Hosting Canada and Ninefold in Australia select Atmos as the platform for their self-service cloud storage offerings for several reasons, including the ability to set policies to match service levels and simplify deployments because it's available as a completely integrated software and hardware cloud storage solutions.
No matter how efficiently Big Data is stored, it is important to prove its worth. Organizations need a reason to store such vast amount of data that might have limited use on a file-by-file basis, but which in aggregate, have the power to present a treasure trove of valuable insights. While the immense value of these data might present is only just begun to be unlocked, EMC Greenplum is at the forefront of what is rapidly becoming a new important field in data science. 
In our data computing division, we're driving our Big Data agenda faster than the traditional database players and firmly establishing ourselves as thought leaders in this space as we're creating innovative solutions for customers to help them capture all the value they can from their information. In less than a year within EMC, EMC Greenplum has accomplished quite a lot. Last year, we rolled out the Data Computing Appliance, a product that now accounts for over half of our EMC Greenplum revenue. In Q1, we announced a partnership with the analytics company, SAS, and the partnership is hitting all the milestones we set out for it.
In May, we announced the availability of the Greenplum Hadoop Enterprise edition available as software or as an appliance, which makes Hadoop enterprise-ready by adding features like realtime data interaction, greater reliability and improved ease-of-use and deployments.
Armed with these next-generation data analytics tools, we're helping customers unlock the values trapped in all their information, structured and  unstructured alike.
In all, our storage product portfolio is second to none. Our differentiated technology across our entire solution set in the high end, mid-tier and backup and in Big Data is driving our ongoing stronger-than-market growth. Since we're still in the early stages of transition to IT-As-A-Service and tackling Big Data, we're comfortable continuing to gain market share.
Turning to our RSA Security division. I'm pleased to report that year-on-year revenue growth in Q2 increased to 13% from 8% in Q1. Both our identity management and protection and security management compliance businesses grew in Q2. Importantly, our SecurID business grew as well. Security is one of the most important factors underlying customer confidence as we move to the hybrid cloud, and we believe RSA has a unique portfolio of solutions to help customers secure their cloud environments.
In March, RSA suffered a cyber attack, resulting in some information related to RSA SecurID products being compromised. Since the last earnings announcement, increased coverage of the attack on RSA and attack on Lockheed Martin reports of use information taken from RSA and a steady stream of news of cyber attacks unconnected to RSA combined to heighten customer concern about risk in general. These events caused us to take some additional actions related SecurID, and so I want to take a few minutes to walk you through these events, the effect they're having on our business and how we think about RSA's future success.
So starting at the beginning. We detected an extremely sophisticated cyber attack on RSA systems in March and determined that some information related to our customer SecurID systems have been extracted. We alerted customers within hours of determining this information could potentially impact their SecurID systems. We published recommended best practices to help customers protect against broader attacks, potentially leveraging the information taken. We reached out to thousands of customers and partners to discuss what we knew and how and why they should implement our recommended best practices. We hardened our IT infrastructure and the processes related to SecurID manufacturing and delivery.
Our analysis of the attack led us to believe that likely targets were the defense sector and related government agencies. Our recommended remediation steps for these customers, therefore, also included total replacements. Our analysis also led us to believe that financial gain was not the likely motive and that the information was not as useful in targeting individual consumer accounts. However, on a case-by-case basis, we offered additional remediation such as risk-based authentication to customers protecting web-based consumer financial transactions. The suspicions that our attack was targeting the defense sector was reinforced in June when Lockheed Martin disclosed an unsuccessful attack on its systems have utilized, among other elements, information taken in the attack on RSA. Lockheed Martin had implemented many security measures, including our best practices and successfully detected and thwarted this attack. Subsequently, they accelerated their plans for total replacements to complete their SecurID remediation. I would note the Lockheed Martin incident was not the result of a new attack on RSA, and there was no change in customer risk or recommended remediation steps. What did change was our customer's sensitivity to risk. This was caused by the same news flow around cyber attacks as in addition to press coverage of the attack on Lockheed Martin, there was broad media coverage of attacks on organizations including Google, Sony, Epsilon, the Australian government and PBS. While these attacks were entirely unrelated to RSA, the publicity resulted in many customers risk tolerance going down while the level of awareness and concern went up.
Given this heightened sensitivity in early June, we formally expanded our remediation programs to all SecurID customers, offering 2 additional protection options. For customers using SecurID to protect intellectual property and corporate networks, we offered total replacements. These customers represent only about 1/3 of the SecurID installed units that constitute the vast majority of the number of customers. For customers using SecurID to protect web-based consumer financial transactions, we offered additional transaction monitoring. These represents about 2/3 of the SecurID installed units concentrated in a small number of customers.
So from the beginning, we focused on our customers' needs. We worked proactively and openly with them immediately after the attack and continue to do so. Importantly, customers continue to tell us that they understand what happened, are comfortable with our communication and appreciate how we're working with them to ensure their SecurID environments are effective. 
So that's a recap of the events. Now moving to the financial impacts of the remediation efforts.
In Q1, we incurred an accrued costs associated with investigating the attack, hardening our systems and working with customers to implement our remediation programs. Given our estimates of the financial impacts of these remediation programs, based upon the information we had at that time, we included the costs within our non-GAAP results. As a result of our decision in June to expand our remediation programs, we recorded a $66 million charge during the second quarter. This charge provides for additional transaction monitoring for all consumer-oriented customers who want it and for total replacements for all corporate customers who want them. Given the increased impact of the expanded remediation programs on our financial results and its nonrecurring nature, we've excluded the charge from our Q2 non-GAAP results.
Looking forward, it is likely that RSA growth will remain a bit slower as remediation efforts continue, but we're confident that we're doing the right things to maintain customer loyalty and confidence in SecurID. The best proof of these successful efforts is how customers have reacted, and I'm pleased to say that overall customer feedback is positive and increasingly, customers are showing confidence. Lockheed Martin continues to use SecurID as part of its layered approach to security. We have significant SecurID renewals in Q2 for a wide range of customers including financial services and telecommunications. And we also gained new SecurID customers, including an order of over $900,000 from a European financial institution. These are pretty good indicators we're doing the right things in growing customer trust.
This trust is key as customers look to protect themselves from increasingly pervasive and sophisticated cyber attacks. Customers need advanced network analysis, realtime security events and information monitoring. The data loss prevention service is to help them put these technologies to work. RSA has these assets, and you can expect to see us being more proactive with customers who are ready to move beyond remediation to advanced protection.
In summary, we responded quickly to this attack and the heightened customer concerns. We have clear customer remediation programs. We have a good understanding of financial impacts this activity will have on our business. We're working everyday to earn and maintain customer trust, and this is a big reason why SecurID remains the industry standard in multifactor authentication. Security is one of the most important facets of customer confidence as they move to the hybrid cloud, and we believe that RSA has a unique set of assets to continue to help our customers secure their cloud environments.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $169 million, up 6% quarter-on-quarter. IIG continues to evolve to meet the buying preferences of today's content management customers. We took another step in that direction in May with the announcements of the on-demand availability of Captiva, Document Sciences, CenterStage and Documentum. These offerings bring together best-of-breed technologies from EMC, VMware and RSA and accelerate the journey to the cloud for customers running EMC content management and collaborative applications.
VMware revenue growth accelerated to 37% in the quarter to a record $921 million. Virtualization is the fundamental building block for cloud computing and as a market leader, it is clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. 
We extended our already strong lead in virtualization with the announcements last week of vSphere 5 and a complementary suite of cloud infrastructure products. vSphere 5's processing capabilities are well beyond what even the most resource-intensive applications might need and comes just as customers increasingly look to move such mission-critical applications into the cloud. Because EMC offers the broadest support in the industry for VMware products across our storage, backup and security portfolios, we can rapidly leverage the powerful new vSphere 5 features across the rest of our portfolio.
Several of the features unveiled last week extend VMware's reach. For instance, vSphere's storage appliance has the ability to turn a small amount of local disks on virtualized servers into network storage while Site Recovery Manager 5 has the ability to replicate VM's on the host. Both of these are ideal features for small and remote customers and offer an on ramp for them to grow into a more powerful array-based capabilities as the tight integration of our virtual and critical product sets enables a minimally disrupted transition. Likewise, the new storage distributor resource scheduler capability of VMware are enhanced and accelerated by FAST VP, making an ideal combination of simplicity, integration, cost savings and improved performance.
We also continued to integrate our capabilities to make the virtual world more secure than the physical one by embedding RSA data loss prevention capabilities into VMware vShield. This is a transformational development as it allows the scanning for confidential data within vSphere and vShield itself, meaning any workload running in vSphere inherits the same secure behavior. This is very different than the physical world where it's necessary to plug devices into network or install software on every host. What this means in the real world is that customers can ensure compliance with standards like SOX, HIPAA, PCI or PII by scanning data for sensitive information and do so with no agents inside the operating system.
The power of combining the proven virtual layer with a proven infrastructure layer is not lost on customers. We've seen time and time again that the tight integration of our product set with VMware is winning us market share in virtual environments, but it's even larger than our share in physical environments where we're also the market leader. 
As we did last quarter, we've broken out for you VMware's expected full year minority interest, which is now approximately $185 million. The financial impact of the minority interest will only get larger as VMware grows, affecting EMC consolidated net income and EPS. Not everyone is modeling this correctly. Because this impact is meaningful and very likely to get more meaningful over time, we provided our estimates of what it will be. It is important to model it correctly. Likewise, we've again broken out our estimates of VMware's additional dilution of $16 million. This accounting convention is required to reflect the impact on EMC's earnings per share of the incremental shares included in VMware's diluted share count that are not included in the minority interest calculation.
As the delta between the VMWare's basic and diluted EPS changes, so will the impact on consolidated EPS. So this additional dilution must be considered to correctly forecast and calculate our consolidated EPS. At $16 million, this incremental dilution will account for about $0.01 of EPS in 2011. Both VMWare's minority interest and additional dilution should be considered in modeling consolidated EMC's non-GAAP EPS for the full year.
It is clear that EMC has an extremely powerful set of solutions to help customers transition to the hybrid cloud and to take full advantage of their Big Data assets. But enabling customers to get to full agility in their cloud environments is not something EMC can do on our own, fully transforming IT to the point where customers have control, efficiency and choice that today's technology can enable,,, requires the combined efforts of EMC and our partners. As we look across the IT ecosystem, we've identified a variety of opportunity to collaborate in ways that benefit EMC, our partners and most importantly, our customers. To get customers to hybrid cloud and benefiting from Big Data, we're leveraging our own services organization as well as our channel service partners, service providers and with our joint venture, VCE.
Through our own services organization, we provide expertise to customers on the most effective ways to get to cloud and to leverage their Big Data assets. And cloud-related engagements continue to be the biggest contributors to growth in our consulting group. 
In the second quarter, we won significant consulting projects in Korea, Netherlands, Mexico, Chile and the U.S., all with customers who are eagerly looking to transition to cloud architectures. 
We also leveraged the expertise of our many different partners to help customers transition to more agile IT, a strategy that is in stark contrast to that of many of our competitors who push their own services. Our partners appreciate this approach, and EMC is rapidly gaining traction here. Many of our efforts recently have been focused on recruiting new channel partners and getting them fully educated on all the advantages of EMC technology. As we continue to ramp business through these partners who are so important for the success of our broad portfolio, our mid-tier and SMB products in particular, we're seeing that the improvements we've made to expand our channel partner program were the right ones.
Our focus on better leveraging our channel partners extends to existing partners as well, and we've seen our efforts pay off. We've been particularly focused on 3 of our largest channel partners and saw their combined revenue increased 73% from last year's Q2 for our unified storage products. This is remarkable growth and a clear indication that our reach to new markets is rapidly gaining traction. 
Service providers are also very important to the success of our hybrid cloud strategy. We have established partnerships with over 40 leading service providers around the world to help them offer new public cloud services. Our service provider partner community includes telcos like AT&T and Verizon, ISPs like Hosting.com, outsourcers like CSC and even enterprise extended their core business like NYSE Technologies. We expect the number of partners to grow and more importantly, the cloud services provided by our partners to flourish as the possibilities for improving the current state of IT with new and innovative cloud services are plentiful. 
Finally, momentum continues to build at VCE. We've seen substantial demand from small and large customers, as well as partners who appreciate Vblock's convert best-of-breed virtualized infrastructure. And VCE's revenue for the first half of 2011 already exceeds the revenue it achieved all of 2010. 
It's easy to understand customers' enthusiasm given the differentiated nature of Vblock platforms. Of course, there are also customers who, instead, may opt for reference architecture with parts from VMware, Cisco and EMC. And this approach is what competitors are trying to mimic with their own reference architectures. But the real differentiator is Vblock platforms, which address the very real issues that reference architecture cannot with a single converge product that can be up and running on day one, a single pane of glass of management. A clear upgrade path without worries about change control or lease management s and one point of contact for integrated services and support. As the only converged infrastructure products in the market today that's built and shipped direct from manufacturing facilities to customer sites to rapidly build out a cloud data center, we're confident that VCE will continue on its rapid growth trajectory. As VCE grows, we're seeing increasing sales to repeat customers who are standardizing their next gen data center on the Vblock are moving their enterprise workloads into full production on Vblock platforms.
We will continue to improve our technology portfolio and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach has served as well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as is evidenced in our Q2 results.
Turning back to our financials for the quarter. Total revenue grew 20% to $4.85 billion in Q2. We reported record revenue internationally with revenue from APJ up 34% and EMEA up 20% from Q2 of 2010. The growth in North America was also strong at 17%. We improved non-GAAP gross margins by 210 basis points over last year's second quarter. Once again this improvement was mainly driven by an increased mix of higher gross margin products including VMware. This improvement helps to continue to show leverage and was the main driver for the increase in non-GAAP operating margin of 240 basis points year-on-year to 23.1%. Year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $1.56 billion, approximately $70 million higher than non-GAAP net income.
We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned approximately $230 million in cash to shareholders in Q2 with the repurchase of EMC shares, bringing our stock repurchases to $1.1 billion for the first half. 
Augmenting VMWare's $133 million share purchases in Q2, we also invested $62 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. We spent approximately $700 million in Q2 on a combination of acquisitions, strategic and other related investments and the VMware land lease in Palo Alto.
In closing, given our strong results for the first half of the year and our outlook for continued strong execution in quarters 3 and 4, we are raising our expectations for the full year. We now expect to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. Our success as a winning provider of technology to cloud and Big Data will ultimately be measured over the course of several years. Our strategy, innovation and continued strong execution keep us firmly on track to meet or exceed the financial targets we discussed in February to reach 2014 revenue of $28 billion and deliver EPS leverage on top of this implied strong top line growth. With our unique competitive position, strength of our strategy and model and the vast opportunity that lies ahead, we're excited about what we can accomplish in cloud and Big Data not only in 2011, but over the course of next several years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe who'll give more color on the outlook, the quarter, and the great opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?"

As always, thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q2 results. It is important to note that these results were underpinned by solid growth across all of our major geographies and across the vast majority of our product divisions and business units. Balanced results are critical to sustain success.
Also critical to our long-term success is customer acceptance of our strategic vision and our ability to deliver against it. Clearly, our hybrid cloud and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers, and they see our products and services as relevant and trust us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its massive benefits. I would like to recognize our 50,000 people around the world that are members of the EMC and VMware family and thank them for their many accomplishments, for their innovation, their hard work and their dedication to our customer success. 
Let me now comment on the global macro economic environment in which we operate and talk about our expectations for IT spending in the second half of 2011.
Starting with 2011 IT spending trends. We still believe that overall IT spending will be up in the 5% to 7% range this year, and we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technologies, namely, in virtualization and in cloud OS, in information storage, information protection and information security and in Big Data are all technology areas, which will grow substantially faster than a 5% to 7% average.
While we believe that IT spending in 2011 will be good, I would like to point that there are several potential macroeconomic risk areas that we continue to watch closely. As you may recall, at our Q1 conference call, we talked about 3 macro risks, namely, the disaster in Japan, a potential slowdown in public sector spending due to significant deficits and rising commodity prices especially oil. Reporting against each of these 3 potential risks in Q2, I am pleased to report that our year-over-year growth rate in Japan was good and we experienced no major supply chain interruptions. And we expect the balance of 2011 to be okay. 
Our Q2 public sector revenues grew year-over-year in the low double digits, but this is still an area we believe has some potential risks, and we will continue to monitor this sector in the second half of the year. And as you know, commodity prices, overall, did not escalate much in Q2. In fact, oil prices pulled back a bit. Obviously, this is also an area to watch that greatly affects our economy. 
So all in all, no glaring red lights on these 3 potential risks to IT spending. That said, we did see some softness in Southern Europe, and we expect this softness to be with us through the second half of this year. That said, these countries make up a very small percentage of EMC's consolidated revenues, but their impact on Europe as a whole represents an additional risk factor. 
Although not totally related to the economy, we experienced some softness in our content management business as was evidenced by the 5% year-on-year decline we posted in our IIG business unit. We are working hard to properly reposition this business. We have a plan and a new management team in place and we do expect to return to growth late this year or early next.
I assure you we will continue to monitor all sources of potential risk to IT spending. But to be clear, we are confident in our ability to produce strong results this year. This is evidenced by the fact that we raised our guidance for 2011 today. As David has already said, we now expect to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and also exceed $1.48 of non-GAAP EPS.
I said 90 days ago, the source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and Big Data strategies are well placed and are underpinned with winning products on a fully committed and funded product roadmaps. This is true today, and 2011 has been and will continue to be a banner year for us with a record number of very significant product introductions. In Q1, at the EMC mega launch, we announced 41 new or significantly refreshed products. Of significant note here were the launch of VNX and VNXe, the Data Domain Archiver and FAST VP. I am pleased to report that all these products are doing well, and FAST VP is now our fastest growing storage software product.
In Q2, at our attendance-breaking EMC World, again had a series of very important product launches. For example, we launched new Isilon hardware and a new version of its OneFS operating system. An Isilon system can now scale up to 15 petabytes under a single file system with unmatched performance and ease of use. I am pleased to report that Isilon is now our fastest growing storage platform. 
We introduced the VPLEX Geo with the unique capability to pool EMC and non-EMC storage resources between data centers, creating true virtual storage with the ability to access this pooled information from anywhere.
We also announced the expansion of our Greenplum Big Data strategy and launched our commitment to Hadoop distribution and support and its integration with Greenplum software and the Greenplum appliance. 
And in the last 2 weeks, VMware launched vSphere 5, along with several other major product enhancements. In short, vSphere 5 now has the performance, scale, availability and ease-of-use features to run all, even the most mission-critical applications and ensure the massive benefits of virtualization and cloud computing.
Also very importantly, EMC just launched VMAXe, a new scale-up, scale-out symmetric platform with renowned ingenuity capabilities. This system closes the gap between our VNX and VMAX platforms. We actually started shipping VMAXe to customers in June, thus, we now have several systems installed and the feedback from customers is nothing short of outstanding. 
And lastly, we introduced ProSphere, an all new storage resource management solution for the virtualization and cloud computing era, featuring ease of use and the ability to massively scale. 
As you will note, the vast majority of these key product introductions are aimed to help our customers and our service partners accelerate their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, and there is more to come. As I have said before, consolidated EMC is a technology company, and innovative products are the lifeblood of a technology company. To this end, we will continue to invest heavily in R&D and we will continue to acquire smaller companies who have leading technologies that enhance our strategic vision and give us faster time to market.
Additionally, to assure customers get exposed to our products and receive the maximum value from them, we will continue to build out our keiretsu of high-quality partners to help our terrific sales and service organizations in the areas of product integration and solutions, product distribution and with services and support. We, at EMC, are focused hard on building out a world-class partner ecosystem, and the fruits of this effort is definitely showing up in our results.
Our joint venture with Cisco, VCE continues to grow in both revenue and relevance. Customer interest in Vblock converged technology is extremely high, and the installed base of Vblock is performing very well. For sure, Vblocks are proving their value proposition. And we expect Vblock sales to hit the $1 billion run rate mark in the next several quarters. 
As this business has grown, Michael, John and I have tapped one our very successful and senior leaders, Frank Hauck, to join VCE as its President and COO. We are pleased to have Frank on the VCE team. 
So again thank you for joining us today, and I'd now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

We said to expect that the leverage we're going to get this year is going to come almost entirely from gross margin with perhaps a little bit from OpEx. And that's what, in fact, you are seeing. But bear in mind, those 2 things go hand in hand, so for example, part of the reason why OpEx is higher the year is because we've got now the OpEx base from Isilon and from DCD inside our OpEx, and that's driving some of the expense. But also -- they're also driving gross margin. So you have to kind of look at the 2 lines hand-in-hand, but it's very much in line with what we expected. And as we go through the balance of the year, you'll continue to expect that trend with the majority of our leverage coming from gross margin."

And to give you a bit more color, if you took out Dell OEM, unified growth was over 25%, so giving you kind of flavor of how far we're going.

I'm pleased to report another quarter of record results. We achieved record second quarter revenues of $4.85 billion, up 20% from last year, as revenue growth improved from Q1 across all of o",5042,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another quarter of record results. We achieved record second quarter revenues of $4.85 billion, up 20% from last year, as revenue growth improved from Q1 across all of our reporting segments. We achieved record Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.35, up 25% from Q2 of last year. And we continue to improve both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.
These results are further evidence that our strategy is on target, and we continue to execute on our triple play. We're gaining market share, investing for the future and improving profitability. Our unwavering focus on providing customers with the right technology to transform their IT and get the most from their data is resonating with our customers and winning us new ones. We have innovated and invested to stay in front of these needs and continue to do so day in and day out.
It is this focus on innovation that has earned us our market-leading position, which continues to get stronger. There is no other company in IT with our combination of best-of-breed technology for both the virtualization and infrastructure layers that enable cloud computing and for unlocking the value contained within Big Data that surround us. Given that we're still close to the beginning than at the end of this fundamental shift to cloud computing, we continue to invest and innovate in the right areas to ensure we take full advantage of the massive opportunity that lies ahead.
Now let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various businesses, starting with Information Storage.
Growth in our Information Storage revenue was strong, up 19% to $3.6 billion. Within Information Storage, we saw the year-on-year growth rate changes we expected from the high-end and from the mid-tier, as our high-end product growth moderates to 15% while our mid-tier product growth accelerated to 27%. This acceleration was driven by the strong results from our new VNX Family. We're clearly gaining share across our portfolio for traditional data center workloads, for cloud deployments and for Big Data workloads as well. As we continue to seek out the most efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data, customers of all sizes and across all industries look to us for the best solutions for their unique IT storage requirements.
In the high end, it is our unique suitability for emerging needs that is driving our share gains. While customers continue to choose VMAX because its capabilities for mission-critical uses in traditional data center implementations, they're increasingly selecting VMAX for new use cases as well. VMAX's enterprise class reliability, availability and serviceability appeal to service provider customers who're implementing VMAX to cloud services where its service levels are mission critical. VMAX's tiered storage capabilities, leveraged by fully automated tiering software, offer a total cost of ownership that competes with and is displacing incumbent Tier 2 vendors. VMAX is also finding its way to new customers through VPLEX. VPLEX's ability to full storage resources from multiple data centers is a value proposition competitors cannot match and which opens doors for additional EMC solutions.
As we continue to innovate, our solutions remain leading edge, meeting the emerging requirements of a growing number of customers. This was demonstrated with the announcement of VMAXe last week. VMAXe packages enterprise-class functionality into a smaller and simpler array that comes preloaded, preconfigured and virtually provisioned for rapid deployments. Designed for organizations with limited storage expertise and IT resources, VMAXe extends the value proposition of VMAX to customers across the globe. This was the case with Heritage Auctions, the third largest auction house in the world. Heritage Auctions knew it needed something more than a dual-control architecture to achieve the highest levels of availability possible for its online customers. But it also wants a system that's easy to use and would take up as little footprint in the data center as possible. The 1.3 petabytes of active storage VMAXe offered was most sufficient for its needs. And FAST VP would allow them to operate this array at a lower total cost of ownership that is being offered by the competitor, in this case, HP 3PAR. In short, Heritage Auctions selected EMC because VMAXe allowed it to continue its migration to high performance, fully virtualized environments within its budget constraints and to be up and running in just a few hours.
As this example illustrates, the ability to tier storage automatically with FAST software is a key feature that's very popular with customers. The adoption of tiering technologies continues to ramp as we shift more Flash capacity in VMAX in the first half of 2011 than in all of 2010 and as the penetration rate of FAST on new systems continues to steadily increase. 
Of VMAX systems that shipped with FAST in Q2, we're seeing Flash and SATA go out with almost 90% of these, indicating how important automated tiering is to customers. Pulling the right data in the right place at the right time maximize the efficiency of their systems and maximize the return of their storage investments.
Looking across our broad portfolio in the mid-tier, we benefited from growth in each of our mid-tier product groups, from the VNX line, backup recovery systems and our Big Data storage technologies. 
Starting with the VNX, which just completed its first full quarter availability, we are pleased of our progress here. VNX is ramping according to plan, with VNX now accounting for approximately 2/3 of the sales of our unified storage products, which include the VNX and the VNXe, Celerra and CLARiiON. Almost half of VNX systems sold in Q2 shipped with NAS on block protocols, highlighting the value customers get from its unified architecture and from the flexibility it brings to these environments. Tiering is as much of a value preposition on VNX as it is in VMAX. As the penetration rates of FAST on our unified products continues to grow, Flash capacity on our unified storage products grew 39% from Q1 and in the first half of this year exceeded Flash ships on unified products to all of 2010. VNX is the only product that offers storage efficiency to automated tiering on a unified architecture, enabling customers to get the maximum value from their storage investments.
We win in competitive situations time and again because we're able to offer what customers want. And while what we want differs from customer to customer, we're able to address all of the high-priority requirements as we saw with our Q2 wins. It was the flexibility of VNX's unified block and file capabilities that won a deal at a U.K. -based media company. It was the ability to tier with FAST on VNX that won a deal at a global agribusiness. And it was VNX's superior support of VDI rollouts within a Vblock that won us a deal at a state government agency in Missouri.
The VNXe is off to a very strong start and is successfully expanding our penetration into the SMB and commercial segments of the market, as over 600 of our VNXe customers in Q2 were new to EMC. The channels that are so key to success here continue to grow in numbers and productivity. We recognize how important channels are to the success of VNX and VNXe. With partner recruitment well underway, we've added over 1,000 more partners in the quarter, and we're focusing our effort on getting our new partners ramped, trained and selling volume. We're making excellent progress here as the non-Dell channel revenue grew over 40% year-on-year for our unified storage products.
Performance in our Backup and Recovery Systems business continues to be strong. After 8 quarters as part of EMC, Data Domain continues to benefit from the EMC effects and its popularity has pushed our other backup technologies into the forefront, helping to drive growth in Avamar and Networker in Q2. The combination of a large customer base with the best-of-breed backup technology portfolio in the industry is serving us well. Despite others trying to make play in this space, our wins are steady and frequent as we increasingly move outside our customer base.
Now turning to our solutions being specifically developed to handle Big Data, including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum. As you know, the opportunity in Big Data is enormous. From social media to the medical field to manufacturing, Big Data files are everywhere. We're seizing the moment to help shape how the industry makes sense of this and does so efficiently.
Starting with our scale-out NAS solution, Isilon is showing all the hallmarks of the EMC effects, combined with leading technology, with product revenue more than doubling year-on-year and our pipeline expanding. While Isilon strengths was driven in large part by continued strong demand from its traditional customer verticals like media and life sciences, Isilon is expanding into new segments as well like manufacturing. 
We're seeing these opportunities for several reasons: First is the maturity of Isilon's offering. In its sixth generation, Isilon is established, trusted and ready for use in enterprise-class applications. Second, EMC leveraging these other verticals is bringing Isilon into deals they might not have seen before, and those deals close faster. Third, enterprises now simply have more file-based data than before, and they're seeking the most efficient ways to storage. And finally, as we announced a few weeks ago, with the latest spec results, Isilon offers the world's fastest file system and is increasingly the technology of choice for any customer looking for a best-of-breed scale-out NAS solution.
In short, Isilon solution is the market leader in Big Data storage because of its ability to scale performance on massive capacity requirements and this sets it up well for the EMC effect. In fact, in the example mentioned earlier, Heritage Auctions augmented its VMAXe purchase with an Isilon system for its vast amount of auction-related contents. The ability to meet a variety of need of one customer illustrates the value of such a broad and deep product portfolio.
Complementing Isilon in our Big Data portfolio is Atmos for globally distributed cloud environments. Ideal for the geographic distribution of project -based data, the newly announced Atmos 2.0 is 5x faster and 65% more efficient than its predecessor. Storages of the service providers like PEER 1 Hosting Canada and Ninefold in Australia select Atmos as the platform for their self-service cloud storage offerings for several reasons, including the ability to set policies to match service levels and simplify deployments because it's available as a completely integrated software and hardware cloud storage solution.
No matter how efficiently Big Data is stored, it is important to prove its worth. Organizations need a reason to store such vast amount of data that might have limited use on a file-by-file basis, but which in aggregate, have the power to present a treasure trove of valuable insights. While the immense value of these data might present is only just begun to be unlocked, EMC Greenplum is at the forefront of what is rapidly becoming a new important field in data science. 
In our data computing division, we're driving our Big Data agenda faster than the traditional database players and firmly establishing ourselves as thought leaders in this space as we're creating innovative solutions for customers to help them capture all the value they can from their information. In less than a year within EMC, EMC Greenplum has accomplished quite a lot. Last year, we rolled out the Data Computing Appliance, a product that now accounts for over half of our EMC Greenplum revenue. In Q1, we announced a partnership with the analytics company, SAS, and the partnership is hitting all the milestones we set out for it.
In May, we announced the availability of the Greenplum Hadoop Enterprise edition available as software or as an appliance, which makes Hadoop enterprise-ready by adding features like realtime data interaction, greater reliability and improved ease-of-use and deployments.
Armed with these next-generation data analytics tools, we're helping customers unlock the values trapped in all their information, structured and unstructured alike.
In all, our storage product portfolio is second to none. Our differentiated technology across our entire solution set in the high end, mid-tier and backup and in Big Data is driving our ongoing stronger-than-market growth. Since we're still in the early stages of transition to IT-As-A-Service and tackling Big Data, we're comfortable continuing to gain market share.
Turning to our RSA Security division. I'm pleased to report that year-on-year revenue growth in Q2 increased to 13% from 8% in Q1. Both our identity management and protection and security management compliance businesses grew in Q2. Importantly, our SecurID business grew as well. Security is one of the most important factors underlying customer confidence as we move to the hybrid cloud, and we believe RSA has a unique portfolio of solutions to help customers secure their cloud environments.
In March, RSA suffered a cyber attack, resulting in some information related to RSA SecurID products being compromised. Since the last earnings announcement, increased coverage of the attack on RSA and attack on Lockheed Martin reports of use information taken from RSA and a steady stream of news of cyber attacks unconnected to RSA combined to heighten customer concern about risk in general. These events caused us to take some additional actions related SecurID, and so I want to take a few minutes to walk you through these events, the effect they're having on our business and how we think about RSA's future success.
So starting at the beginning. We detected an extremely sophisticated cyber attack on RSA systems in March and determined that some information related to our customer SecurID systems had been extracted. We alerted customers within hours of determining this information could potentially impact their SecurID systems. We published recommended best practices to help customers protect against broader attacks, potentially leveraging the information taken. We reached out to thousands of customers and partners to discuss what we knew and how and why they should implement our recommended best practices. We hardened our IT infrastructure and the processes related to SecurID manufacturing and delivery.
Our analysis of the attack led us to believe that likely targets were the defense sector and related government agencies. Our recommended remediation steps for these customers, therefore, also included total replacements. Our analysis also led us to believe that financial gain was not the likely motive and that the information was not as useful in targeting individual consumer accounts. However, on a case-by-case basis, we offered additional remediation such as risk-based authentication to customers protecting web-based consumer financial transactions. The suspicions that our attack was targeting the defense sector was reinforced in June when Lockheed Martin disclosed an unsuccessful attack on its systems had utilized, among other elements, information taken in the attack on RSA. Lockheed Martin had implemented many security measures, including our best practices and successfully detected and thwarted this attack. Subsequently, they accelerated their plans for total replacements to complete their SecurID remediation. I would note the Lockheed Martin incident was not the result of a new attack on RSA, and there was no change in customer risk or recommended remediation steps. What did change was our customer's sensitivity to risk. This was caused by the same news flow around cyber attacks as in addition to press coverage of the attack on Lockheed Martin, there was broad media coverage of attacks on organizations including Google, Sony, Epsilon, the Australian government and PBS. While these attacks were entirely unrelated to RSA, the publicity resulted in many customers risk tolerance going down while the level of awareness and concern went up.
Given this heightened sensitivity in early June, we formally expanded our remediation programs to all SecurID customers, offering 2 additional protection options. For customers using SecurID to protect intellectual property and corporate networks, we offered total replacements. These customers represent only about 1/3 of the SecurID installed units that constitute the vast majority of the number of customers. For customers using SecurID to protect web-based consumer financial transactions, we offered additional transaction monitoring. These represents about 2/3 of the SecurID installed units concentrated in a small number of customers.
So from the beginning, we focused on our customers' needs. We worked proactively and openly with them immediately after the attack and continue to do so. Importantly, customers continue to tell us that they understand what happened, are comfortable with our communication and appreciate how we're working with them to ensure their SecurID environments are effective. 
So that's a recap of the events. Now moving to the financial impacts of the remediation efforts.
In Q1, we incurred an accrued costs associated with investigating the attack, hardening our systems and working with customers to implement our remediation programs. Given our estimates of the financial impacts of these remediation programs, based upon the information we had at that time, we included the costs within our non-GAAP results. As a result of our decision in June to expand our remediation programs, we recorded a $66 million charge during the second quarter. This charge provides for additional transaction monitoring for all consumer-oriented customers who want it and for total replacements for all corporate customers who want them. Given the increased impact of the expanded remediation programs on our financial results and its nonrecurring nature, we've excluded the charge from our Q2 non-GAAP results.
Looking forward, it is likely that RSA growth will remain a bit slower as remediation efforts continue, but we're confident that we're doing the right things to maintain customer loyalty and confidence in SecurID. The best proof of these successful efforts is how customers have reacted, and I'm pleased to say that overall customer feedback is positive and increasingly, customers are showing confidence. Lockheed Martin continues to use SecurID as part of its layered approach to security. We have significant SecurID renewals in Q2 for a wide range of customers including financial services and telecommunications. And we also gained new SecurID customers, including an order of over $900,000 from a European financial institution. These are pretty good indicators we're doing the right things in growing customer trust.
This trust is key as customers look to protect themselves from increasingly pervasive and sophisticated cyber attacks. Customers need advanced network analysis, realtime security events and information monitoring. The data loss prevention service is to help them put these technologies to work. RSA has these assets, and you can expect to see us being more proactive with customers who are ready to move beyond remediation to advanced protection.
In summary, we responded quickly to this attack and the heightened customer concerns. We have clear customer remediation programs. We have a good understanding of financial impacts this activity will have on our business. We're working everyday to earn and maintain customer trust, and this is a big reason why SecurID remains the industry standard in multifactor authentication. Security is one of the most important facets of customer confidence as they move to the hybrid cloud, and we believe that RSA has a unique set of assets to continue to help our customers secure their cloud environments.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $169 million, up 6% quarter-on-quarter. IIG continues to evolve to meet the buying preferences of today's content management customers. We took another step in that direction in May with the announcements of the on-demand availability of Captiva, Document Sciences, CenterStage and Documentum. These offerings bring together best-of-breed technologies from EMC, VMware and RSA and accelerate the journey to the cloud for customers running EMC content management and collaborative applications.
VMware revenue growth accelerated to 37% in the quarter to a record $921 million. Virtualization is the fundamental building block for cloud computing and as a market leader, it is clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. 
We extended our already strong lead in virtualization with the announcements last week of vSphere 5 and a complementary suite of cloud infrastructure products. vSphere 5's processing capabilities are well beyond what even the most resource-intensive applications might need and comes just as customers increasingly look to move such mission-critical applications into the cloud. Because EMC offers the broadest support in the industry for VMware products across our storage, backup and security portfolios, we can rapidly leverage the powerful new vSphere 5 features across the rest of our portfolio.
Several of the features unveiled last week extend VMware's reach. For instance, vSphere's storage appliance has the ability to turn a small amount of local disks on virtualized servers into network storage while Site Recovery Manager 5 has the ability to replicate VM's on the host. Both of these are ideal features for small and remote customers and offer an onramp for them to grow into a more powerful array-based capabilities as the tight integration of our virtual and critical product sets enables a minimally disrupted transition. Likewise, the new storage distributor resource scheduler capability of VMware are enhanced and accelerated by FAST VP, making an ideal combination of simplicity, integration, cost savings and improved performance.
We also continued to integrate our capabilities to make the virtual world more secure than the physical one by embedding RSA data loss prevention capabilities into VMware vShield. This is a transformational development as it allows the scanning for confidential data within vSphere and vShield itself, meaning any workload running in vSphere inherits the same secure behavior. This is very different than the physical world where it's necessary to plug devices into network or install software on every host. What this means in the real world is that customers can ensure compliance with standards like SOX, HIPAA, PCI or PII by scanning data for sensitive information and do so with no agents inside the operating system.
The power of combining the proven virtual layer with a proven infrastructure layer is not lost on customers. We've seen time and time again that the tight integration of our product set with VMware is winning us market share in virtual environments, but it's even larger than our share in physical environments where we're also the market leader. 
As we did last quarter, we've broken out for you VMware's expected full year minority interest, which is now approximately $185 million. The financial impact of the minority interest will only get larger as VMware grows, affecting EMC consolidated net income and EPS. Not everyone is modeling this correctly. Because this impact is meaningful and very likely to get more meaningful over time, we provided our estimates of what it will be. It is important to model it correctly. Likewise, we've again broken out our estimates of VMware's additional dilution of $16 million. This accounting convention is required to reflect the impact on EMC's earnings per share of the incremental shares included in VMware's diluted share count that are not included in the minority interest calculation.
As the delta between the VMWare's basic and diluted EPS changes, so will the impact on consolidated EPS. So this additional dilution must be considered to correctly forecast and calculate our consolidated EPS. At $16 million, this incremental dilution will account for about $0.01 of EPS in 2011. Both VMWare's minority interest and additional dilution should be considered in modeling consolidated EMC's non-GAAP EPS for the full year.
It is clear that EMC has an extremely powerful set of solutions to help customers transition to the hybrid cloud and to take full advantage of their Big Data assets. But enabling customers to get to full agility in their cloud environments is not something EMC can do on our own, fully transforming IT to the point where customers have control, efficiency and choice that today's technology can enable requires the combined efforts of EMC and our partners. As we look across the IT ecosystem, we've identified a variety of opportunity to collaborate in ways that benefit EMC, our partners and most importantly, our customers. To get customers to hybrid cloud and benefiting from Big Data, we're leveraging our own services organization as well as our channel service partners, service providers and with our joint venture, VCE.
Through our own services organization, we provide expertise to customers on the most effective ways to get to cloud and to leverage their Big Data assets. And cloud-related engagements continue to be the biggest contributors to growth in our consulting group. 
In the second quarter, we won significant consulting projects in Korea, Netherlands, Mexico, Chile and the U.S., all with customers who are eagerly looking to transition to cloud architectures. 
We also leveraged the expertise of our many different partners to help customers transition to more agile IT, a strategy that is in stark contrast to that of many of our competitors who push their own services. Our partners appreciate this approach, and EMC is rapidly gaining traction here. Many of our efforts recently have been focused on recruiting new channel partners and getting them fully educated on all the advantages of EMC technology. As we continue to ramp business through these partners who are so important for the success of our broad portfolio, our mid-tier and SMB products in particular, we're seeing that the improvements we've made to expand our channel partner program were the right ones.
Our focus on better leveraging our channel partners extends to existing partners as well, and we've seen our efforts pay off. We've been particularly focused on 3 of our largest channel partners and saw their combined revenue increased 73% from last year's Q2 for our unified storage products. This is remarkable growth and a clear indication that our reach to new markets is rapidly gaining traction. 
Service providers are also very important to the success of our hybrid cloud strategy. We have established partnerships with over 40 leading service providers around the world to help them offer new public cloud services. Our service provider partner community includes telcos like AT&T and Verizon, ISPs like Hosting.com, outsourcers like CSC and even enterprises extended their core business like NYSE Technologies. We expect the number of partners to grow and more importantly, the cloud services provided by our partners to flourish as the possibilities for improving the current state of IT with new and innovative cloud services are plentiful. 
Finally, momentum continues to build at VCE. We've seen substantial demand from small and large customers, as well as partners who appreciate Vblock's convert best-of-breed virtualized infrastructure. And VCE's revenue for the first half of 2011 already exceeds the revenue it achieved all of 2010. 
It's easy to understand customers' enthusiasm given the differentiated nature of Vblock platforms. Of course, there are also customers who, instead, may opt for reference architecture with parts from VMware, Cisco and EMC. And this approach is what competitors are trying to mimic with their own reference architectures. But the real differentiator is Vblock platforms, which address the very real issues that reference architecture cannot with a single converge product that can be up and running on day one, a single pane of glass of management. A clear upgrade path without worries about change control or lease management s and one point of contact for integrated services and support. As the only converged infrastructure products in the market today that's built and shipped direct from manufacturing facilities to customer sites to rapidly build out a cloud data center, we're confident that VCE will continue on its rapid growth trajectory. As VCE grows, we're seeing increasing sales to repeat customers who are standardizing their next gen data center on the Vblock are moving their enterprise workloads into full production on Vblock platforms.
We will continue to improve our technology portfolio and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach has served as well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as is evidenced in our Q2 results.
Turning back to our financials for the quarter. Total revenue grew 20% to $4.85 billion in Q2. We reported record revenue internationally with revenue from APJ up 34% and EMEA up 20% from Q2 of 2010. The growth in North America was also strong at 17%. We improved non-GAAP gross margins by 210 basis points over last year's second quarter. Once again this improvement was mainly driven by an increased mix of higher gross margin products including VMware. This improvement helps to continue to show leverage and was the main driver for the increase in non-GAAP operating margin of 240 basis points year-on-year to 23.1%. Year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $1.56 billion, approximately $70 million higher than non-GAAP net income.
We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned approximately $230 million in cash to shareholders in Q2 with the repurchase of EMC shares, bringing our stock repurchases to $1.1 billion for the first half. 
Augmenting VMWare's $133 million share purchases in Q2, we also invested $62 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. We spent approximately $700 million in Q2 on a combination of acquisitions, strategic and other related investments and the VMware land lease in Palo Alto.
In closing, given our strong results for the first half of the year and our outlook for continued strong execution in quarters 3 and 4, we are raising our expectations for the full year. We now expect to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. Our success as a winning provider of technology to cloud and Big Data will ultimately be measured over the course of several years. Our strategy, innovation and continued strong execution keep us firmly on track to meet or exceed the financial targets we discussed in February to reach 2014 revenue of $28 billion and deliver EPS leverage on top of this implied strong top line growth. With our unique competitive position, strength of our strategy and model and the vast opportunity that lies ahead, we're excited about what we can accomplish in cloud and Big Data not only in 2011, but over the course of next several years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe who'll give more color on the outlook, the quarter, and the great opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?"

As always, thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q2 results. It is important to note that these results were underpinned by solid growth across all of our major geographies and across the vast majority of our product divisions and business units. Balanced results are critical to sustain success.
Also critical to our long-term success is customer acceptance of our strategic vision and our ability to deliver against it. Clearly, our hybrid cloud and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers, and they see our products and services as relevant and trust us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its massive benefits. I would like to recognize our 50,000 people around the world that are members of the EMC and VMware family and thank them for their many accomplishments, for their innovation, their hard work and their dedication to our customer success. 
Let me now comment on the global macroeconomic environment in which we operate and talk about our expectations for IT spending in the second half of 2011.
Starting with 2011 IT spending trends. We still believe that overall IT spending will be up in the 5% to 7% range this year, and we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technologies, namely, in virtualization and in cloud OS, in information storage, information protection and information security and in Big Data are all technology areas, which will grow substantially faster than a 5% to 7% average.
While we believe that IT spending in 2011 will be good, I would like to point that there are several potential macroeconomic risk areas that we continue to watch closely. As you may recall, at our Q1 conference call, we talked about 3 macro risks, namely, the disaster in Japan, a potential slowdown in public sector spending due to significant deficits and rising commodity prices especially oil. Reporting against each of these 3 potential risks in Q2, I am pleased to report that our year-over-year growth rate in Japan was good and we experienced no major supply chain interruptions. And we expect the balance of 2011 to be okay. 
Our Q2 public sector revenues grew year-over-year in the low double digits, but this is still an area we believe has some potential risks, and we will continue to monitor this sector in the second half of the year. And as you know, commodity prices, overall, did not escalate much in Q2. In fact, oil prices pulled back a bit. Obviously, this is also an area to watch that greatly affects our economy. 
So all in all, no glaring red lights on these 3 potential risks to IT spending. That said, we did see some softness in Southern Europe, and we expect this softness to be with us through the second half of this year. That said, these countries make up a very small percentage of EMC's consolidated revenues, but their impact on Europe as a whole represents an additional risk factor. 
Although not totally related to the economy, we experienced some softness in our content management business as was evidenced by the 5% year-on-year decline we posted in our IIG business unit. We are working hard to properly reposition this business. We have a plan and a new management team in place and we do expect to return to growth late this year or early next.
I assure you we will continue to monitor all sources of potential risk to IT spending. But to be clear, we are confident in our ability to produce strong results this year. This is evidenced by the fact that we raised our guidance for 2011 today. As David has already said, we now expect to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and also exceed $1.48 of non-GAAP EPS.
I said 90 days ago, the source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and Big Data strategies are well placed and are underpinned with winning products on a fully committed and funded product roadmaps. This is true today, and 2011 has been and will continue to be a banner year for us with a record number of very significant product introductions. In Q1, at the EMC mega launch, we announced 41 new or significantly refreshed products. Of significant note here were the launch of VNX and VNXe, the Data Domain Archiver and FAST VP. I am pleased to report that all these products are doing well, and FAST VP is now our fastest growing storage software product.
In Q2, at our attendance-breaking EMC World, again we had a series of very important product launches. For example, we launched new Isilon hardware and a new version of its OneFS operating system. An Isilon system can now scale up to 15 petabytes under a single file system with unmatched performance and ease of use. I am pleased to report that Isilon is now our fastest growing storage platform. 
We introduced the VPLEX Geo with the unique capability to pool EMC and non-EMC storage resources between data centers, creating true virtual storage with the ability to access this pooled information from anywhere.
We also announced the expansion of our Greenplum Big Data strategy and launched our commitment to Hadoop distribution and support and its integration with Greenplum software and the Greenplum appliance. 
And in the last 2 weeks, VMware launched vSphere 5, along with several other major product enhancements. In short, vSphere 5 now has the performance, scale, availability and ease-of-use features to run all, even the most mission-critical applications and ensure the massive benefits of virtualization and cloud computing.
Also very importantly, EMC just launched VMAXe, a new scale-up, scale-out symmetric platform with renowned ingenuity capabilities. This system closes the gap between our VNX and VMAX platforms. We actually started shipping VMAXe to customers in June, thus, we now have several systems installed and the feedback from customers is nothing short of outstanding. 
And lastly, we introduced ProSphere, an all new storage resource management solution for the virtualization and cloud computing era, featuring ease of use and the ability to massively scale. 
As you will note, the vast majority of these key product introductions are aimed to help our customers and our service partners accelerate their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, and there is more to come. As I have said before, consolidated EMC is a technology company, and innovative products are the lifeblood of a technology company. To this end, we will continue to invest heavily in R&D and we will continue to acquire smaller companies who have leading technologies that enhance our strategic vision and give us faster time to market.
Additionally, to assure customers get exposed to our products and receive the maximum value from them, we will continue to build out our keiretsu of high-quality partners to help our terrific sales and service organizations in the areas of product integration and solutions, product distribution and with services and support. We, at EMC, are focused hard on building out a world-class partner ecosystem, and the fruits of this effort is definitely showing up in our results.
Our joint venture with Cisco, VCE continues to grow in both revenue and relevance. Customer interest in Vblock converged technology is extremely high, and the installed base of Vblocks is performing very well. For sure, Vblocks are proving their value proposition. And we expect Vblock sales to hit the $1 billion run rate mark in the next several quarters. 
As this business has grown, Michael, John and I have tapped one our very successful and senior leaders, Frank Hauck, to join VCE as its President and COO. We are pleased to have Frank on the VCE team. 
So again thank you for joining us today, and I'd now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

Obviously, smaller than the charge that we took in Q2. So that is a factor and actually accounts for a reasonable amount. We also saw a nice pickup in our services gross margin, particularly in the storage business. And then we do, as we go forward, year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, we're seeing improved mix from higher-margin products.

Now we also mentioned that in Q1, we have relatively weaker results in the mid-tier because we only announced VNX towards the end of the quarter. We saw those growth rates kind of swap over in the second quarter, so we expected the 25% to come down to 15%. The good news is 15% is still higher than the longer-term growth range we have for Symmetrix, which in our modeling is in that single-digit growth range. So we do expect it to probably continue to trend back towards that single digit, but there are a lot of good things going on in the high end with Sym being used in new used cases and the VMAXe, of course, also giving us a kicker as well. But that explains the trends and the changes between Q1 and Q2."

We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 18% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 23%. We again improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin both sequentially and year-on-year, and we grew free cash flow by more than 25% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our strong Q3 results underscore that our strategy continues to serve us well. Our sharp focus on areas of opportunity within cloud and Big Data is propelling ongoing momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions within these secular trends is resonating with customers, and our disciplined operational execution and control are driving our success. The combination of all 3 of these has striven our results over the past several quarters but I'd like to take a moment to take to focus upon the power of our portfolio. We achieved $4.98 billion of revenue this quarter, a record amount for any quarter in our history because the combination of our storage, virtualization and security offerings is compelling. Our results stem from having market-leading products and services in each of these high priority areas of IT spend, and also by leveraging capabilities across our lines of business. For example, we developed our storage solutions with an eye towards security and virtualization, and customers rely upon our expertise in these areas as they decide where to deploy their IT dollars. In any business environment, customers want to make their IT operations more efficient and more agile, having a partner who can get them there from start to finish is critical and this is why we win. This advantage was clearly demonstrated by our Information Storage results in Q3 where revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, driven by product revenue growth of 28% in the mid-tier. Our storage portfolio has been taking share in both the mid-tier and the high-end because we provide best-of-breed products which address customers specific use cases and uniquely enable them to manage massively expanding data volumes. Our high-end product revenue grew 7% over last year's Q3, which we believe is faster than the current growth rate for this segment of the markets. Customers with mission-critical data sets needing the very best reliability available and the scalability trust VMAX. While customers have traditionally purchased our high-end storage to handle the biggest and most important business applications and databases, they're increasingly using VMAX to meet additional needs. It's powerful scale architecture is ideal for emerging use cases such as service providers using of the customer facing workloads. And with the combination of FAST VP, flash and large data drive, VMAX can also automatically tier data across various drive types. These creativity lets customer store more data types on their SIM. Data in some cases used to be relegated to Tier 2 vendors and lower total the cost of ownership. As a result, we win against high-end and Tier 2 vendors alike with VMAX's unique scale-out and other tiering solution. We have a great example of this in Q3 at our global pharmaceutical company where we displaced 1.5 petabytes of Tier 2 storage because VMAX is powerful, trusted and smart. The resilience and sheer horsepower of the VMAX architecture was superior for supporting this customers database application or tier capabilities enable them to use tier drives and get better performance at a lower price. The introduction of FAST and Flash drives creates value proposition that is unmatched and is a key reason why we continued to be the leader in the high-end. We've been gaining share in the high-end and are equally confident about taking share in midrange storage as well. EMC has build out a unique best-of-breed midrange offering over the past few years. This allows us to attack additional midrange players head-on with a new converged VNX frontline from underneath with a new all and VNX offering and from the flanks, with market-leading back up and scale-out NAS offerings. As of this product portfolio a distribution channel that is double the number of partners in its ranks over the past year and vastly expanded the volume for these partners and you get a clear picture of why we're so confident retaking share in these segments. 
Let me touch briefly on some of these factors that are driving our acceleration momentum in the midrange. Starting with our VNX Family, which includes both VNX and VNXe. The transition from product generation unified mid-tier products is ramping according to plan, with over 80% of our new system revenue in this space coming from the VNX Family. VNXe, our new simplified storage solution, built and priced to meet the needs of the SMB market continues to flourish. VNXe has enhanced our revalue with existing customers who are deploying it in departmental and remote implementations. VNXe is winning us new accounts as well. Since introducing the VNXe in March, we've added well over 1,300 new to EMC customers with this easy-to-use storage solutions. As VNXe is a brand-new product that just came out this year, and our win share almost all incremental, it goes out without saying that we are also gaining share in the low-end. It's value proposition is clear, simple, efficient and affordable. VMX, like the VNXe, is also simple and efficient, and on top of it, delivers the raw power and effective utilization rates needed by large enterprises. It is winning us new footprint because of its ease-of-use, it's high integration with VMware and its ability to tier data automatically, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for customers. These attributes make the VNX a great fit for cloud environments which is why the largest distributors in the country chose to put its private cloud on the VNX. American Tire uses its VNX raised cloud, 99% virtualized on VMware to run its mission-critical Oracle e-business suites, and in doing so, was able to significantly increase performance during usage peaks. VNX replaced encumbered system as several other companies as well in Q3, including a global pharmaceutical company, a global retailer based in France, a financial software company based in California and an insurance company based in Michigan. With the xCelerated growth we saw in our unified platforms in Q3, it is clear we are gaining market share for additional and NAS vendors alike. Our Backup Recovery Systems business continued to lead the market and exemplify the EMC effects. We still have a lot of room to grow, both home and abroad. We expect BRS to be continue to one of our fastest growing segments for a couple of reasons. Our unique post deduplication makes is faster for both backup and recovery than the competition. And on top of this, it's the integration we built between the products in our portfolio. Whether a customer is simply replacing tape or virtualizing and working on a next-generation backup architecture, we can provide a best-of-breed solution. We saw this in Q3 with one of our long-time financial services customers who is now switching their entire backup environment to leverage our dedupe portfolio. A large city in Finland also expanded its EMC footprint on the strength of our combined BRS offerings, including network to great backups to diverse machines, Avamar for backing up the virtual machine files and Data Domain as a backup target. Altogether the solution enabled the city to reduce its Data Protection costs by 28%, the Tepper result that resonates with businesses and public sector organizations alike. With gross that continues outpace the market, we are clearly gaining share with our differentiated backup and recovery solutions. The same secular shift to ever larger data sets and file sizes is driving demand for our Big Data storage and analytics products and services as well. Our offerings here are growing faster than market, with the revenue for our portfolio of Big Data solutions including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum, up over 100% again in Q3. Within this, we are encouraged by the continued penetration of Isilon beyond verticals like life sciences media where Isilon has become the de facto standard. Isilon is now expanding its presence in broad implementations that are not vertical specific. And these more general purpose data center uses we're seeing a lot of purchasing for NAS solutions to run things like Neil and archiving, filesystems and home directories, where data consistently expands and requires a solution that can scale where other NAS implementations can not. Such was the case with a large provider in Q3. This bank was struggling with a solution for an incumbent mass vendor that just couldn't scale for its very general-purpose file shares, archives and backups. Isilon met their need for viable long-term NAS solution to offer simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease of use of management, and lower CapEx to improve utilization. Overall, Isilon has been tremendously successful in solving customer challenges and is making life increasingly difficult for the competition. In addition to the financial services I just mentioned, there is a long list of competitive displacements across a wide variety of more traditional NAS use cases. In fact, in Q3 alone, Isilon displaced encumbered vendor at one of North America's largest natural gas producers, universities in Georgia and New Jersey, an international law firm, and an IT managed services provider, to name but a few. The big story here with Isilon is that it's quite clear that we continued to be successful in verticals where they be been well known, but more importantly, we are taking share and removing competitors in more hard to use cases where other vendors closeted approaches cannot scale nearly as easily or as efficiently as Isilon's. Our excellent results across our midrange portfolio demonstrated the synergy of having so many best-of-breed tools in our back. Some scientists combination of Isilon for true scale-out file and VNX for database as we saw with the displacement in Q3, around the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions where performance and utilization were falling behind. Often, it's Data Domain, given the opportunities proven to present its value proposition to a new scale-out VNX customer as the story with numerous deals in Q3. Rudderless of the final solution, with EMC, customers can be confident of achieving optimal results across their environments, physical and virtual alike. Story massive and growing amounts of data is 1 thing, making sense of it getting real value out of these data that business insight is quite another and what Greenplum business does very well. Greenplum solution was built for the era of Big Data and for many companies, it's a next step in their analytic strategy. Greenplum's massively power crossing capabilities like companies capture more data and make it more readily available. This is true Big Data analytics as its more real-time nature explores the details of business operations and customer interactions that aren't typically captured in a data warehouse. Such was the case with the win in Q3 at financial regulatory entity which now puts Greenplum in 3 top of the trading and regulatory organizations. This organization was looking to process both structured and unstructured data to aid its decision making legacy system overload with the dramatic growth of data from outside sources and by the large volume of users. By augmenting their system with Greenplum, they are now able to process the large volumes of data necessary to spot patents that might be of regulatory interest. All companies are keen to harvest valuable insights like these, and this is why Greenplum's business continues to ramp in terms of both revenue and employees to keep pace with growing demand. 
Looking across our storage portfolio, it's clear our best-of-breed base of offerings is broad enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of customers and the wide variety of needs within each customer. We've always believed that it's best have the right tools for the job in this market and that the one-size-fits-all approach would ultimately be unsuccessful. The fact that we are gaining share in and across all our storage solutions sets is proof that customers agree with our approach. In addition, the fact the competitors are increasingly following our lead underscores the realization that their approach is being incomplete. EMC's storage innovation engine continues to produce new compelling products. The latest example is our service life flash initiative project lining and I'm pleased to report that this is progressing well with the first shipping in Q3. Our approach confines 5 nines Flash enhanced array technologies with best-of-breed server Flash and FAST software into a single architecture for a compelling combination. While our storage capabilities are broad, there are also deep comprising solutions that are second to none. We've proven leading-edge technology and standard of service that are consistently recognized as amongst the highest in the industry. Arm with these advantages, we're strengthening our storage leadership position in the 2 biggest opportunities in IT today, cloud and Big Data. Another key opportunity for us is building trust in the cloud and our RSA Security division is the critical asset that is allowing us to pursue it. With revenue up 16% over Q3 a year ago, RSA is benefiting from its integrated solutions set that works across physical and virtual environments. Our advanced security management and compliance solutions offers a situational awareness that today dynamic fresh environments requires. They are agile, adaptive, coordinated controls that get more predictive of patents of data movement and use behavior are absorbed, which contain the necessary remediation capabilities to ultimately flaw an attack. Our identity management and protection products are also seeing strong demand and benefiting from some larger renewals in the quarter. Customer trust in our solutions is high, and in fact, last month, SecurID won Information Security magazines readers Choice Award for Best Indication Product in 2011. Nearly 200 Information Security professionals polled in the spring and summer, ranked SecurID specialty highly with its integration compatibility with infrastructure and its ease of use for end-users and its scalability. Our long-standing data centric approach to IT security is clearly the right one. competitors seeing the advantages to this strategy and now trying to cobble tat point of products into more solution. In addition, security professionals are drawing on our expertise in IT security to discuss best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems. In the past few months, senior RSA officials have participated in APT Summit in Washington DC and London, and presented recommendations to Congress. We'll continue leverage our expertise in this space to help build the blueprint for an evolving environment within a rapidly shifting IT landscape. 
Revenue from our information intelligence group was $171 million, flat from Q2. NIG Continues to transition its offerings to lighter weight content-enabled applications on top of xCP using modern virtualized frameworks. In Q3, we announced documenting clients for iPad, an app which provides users secure access to information and Documentum enables them to access share and collaborate on their preferred device. VMware revenue grew 32% in the quarter to a record $941 million, driven by the massive shift to more efficient and more agile cloud architectures, for which virtualization is the cornerstone. The popularity of VMware is underscored by the record attenders of VMware of Las Vegas in August with more than 19,000 customers, partners, personalities, and by more than 20,000 registered for VMWorld Europe, and the Asia Pacific and Japan V4 events being held this week. VMware continues to differentiate itself in this space with virtualization offerings that are far more developed than any other competitors. By building onto these capabilities with more robust features in storage, business continuity, virtualized security and edge functions, moder infrastructure management are monitoring a multi provisioning resources, VMware continues to enhance its strategic relevance in the data center. With our shared vision for offering IT-As-A-Service in cloud environments, and ultimately, be a hybrid clouds, the evolution of EMC storage, Content Management and security portfolios, is increasingly complimentary to VMware's feature sets. We have already seen and studied that EMC is the infrastructure provider of choice in virtualized environment, yet another study in August shows extending our share here even further with 44% of polled naming EMC as the preferred provider for the virtualized environments. As VMware continues to build out its capabilities, our underlying researcher continues to be second to none for supporting virtualization. With VMware's stronger results, the full year minority interest expectation for VMware has increased slightly. Also, as we advised last quarter, it is important to correctly account for the additional dilution from VMware. Our expectation for the combination of the minority interest and VMware dilution for the full year is now approximately $220 million, an important consideration when modeling consolidated EMC EPS for the year. 
The line performance of our services organization extended into Q3 as customers continue to look to us to build out their cloud architectures and get the most from the information contained in the infrastructures. A great example of this was a milti-million deal signed in the quarter with the South American telco, as they embark on a multiyear IT transformation to align their fixed and wireless system, run their business more efficiently and enable more targeted cross selling across marketing of their products, they engaged us to help drive their cloud, Big Data insecurity strategy implementation. Customers also look to EMC to guide them thru projects dented on optimizing cost efficiencies such as data center consolidations. This is a case we won the world's largest pharmaceutical companies in Q3, which listed EMC for the consolidation of 10 globally dispersed data centers. This was a strategic win, thanks in part to the high-quality of product services engagements which opened the door for even larger opportunities against the incumbent provider, in this case, HP, in the future. As our products and services portfolio grows and evolves, so does our go to market approach. Our efforts to expand and deepen our channel relationships are paying off, for both EMC and for our partners. We've laid a strong foundation with on boarding of several thousand new channel partners year-to-date and are now directing our efforts towards averaging these incremental routes to markets. Our progress was recognized earlier this quarter by a computer reseller news which named us a winner in their prestigious 2011 ERC awards, and also awarded us a special 2011 Tech innovator award for VNXe, a channel only products. We added another channel only product in the quarter with the Data Domain 160 deduplication storage system for small enterprise data centers in remote offices. The strap we've made with our channel efforts are manifesting in our results with our mid-tier product revenues through non-Dell channels growing over 40% in Q3. In addition, VCE continues to gain traction with orders up approximately 50% from Q2, out of single converged infrastructure solution that can be up and running on day 1 with, a single painted glass of management and a single point of contact for integrated service and support, vBlocks are truly differentiated in the market. The value proposition of vBlock perhaps even more relevant in uncertain times as our converged infrastructure means faster and easier deployments that requires far few resources of reference architectures. For these reasons, we expect demand for vBlocks to continue its rapid growth. Across our business, we will continue to improve our technology portfolio, enhance our relationships with customers via our world-class services, salesforces, and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach to service well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as our results in Q3 and for the past several quarters have shown. In Q3, total revenue grew 18% to $4.98 billion. We reported strong growth internationally, with revenue from APJ leading the way up 37%, while the EMEA revenue grew 15% from Q3 of 2010. Growth in North America was also strong at 16% where we saw strength in financial services and year-over-year growth in federal. The power of our portfolio is also evidenced in our operating results where our faster growing higher-margin products continue to drive gross margin in the right direction. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 250 basis points over last year's third quarter to 63%, driven by a favorable revenue mix shifts and better gross margins across the business. This improvement helps us to continue to show leverage in non-GAAP operating margin which increased to 24% of revenue. We are very pleased with the progress we've made here over the last several years to improvements to our mix, improvements to our product and services costs, and efficiencies in our operating structure. And while we remain on the offensive to take advantage of the vast opportunity in cloud and Big Data, we'll do so while spending prudently and investing wisely. Our balance sheet and cash flow continues to be very strong. Deferred revenue grew 34% to $5.7 billion, driven by strong bookings and renewals. Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong, with trailing 12 months free cash flow of $3.8 billion, approximately $500 million than our non-GAAP income for the same period. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. We returned $800 million to shareholders in Q3 via the repurchase of EMC stock. We expect to repurchase the balance of the full $2 billion amount that is authorized by the Board in August before the end of the year. We now expect our average share count for the full year to be 2.235 billion shares. 
Turning now to the outlook. While Joe will give color on what we're seeing in the macro environment globally, one thing is fairly obvious. Uncertainty about the global macro environment has increased in the past few months. On the other hand, there are some things we are quite certain about. We are focused on the highest priorities in IT spent. Our product portfolio is in the best shape ever. Our go to market approach is well defined and our reach is expanding. Our partner ecosystem is getting stronger and our operations are more efficient than ever before. We are focused on our triple play over the long-term and the priorities we laid out to gain market share, invest for growth and deliver leverage continue to guide us through the balance of the year. We remain on track to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. 
In short, our strategy is sound, our investment approach is disciplined and our execution is solid. We expect these qualities which driven our success over the past several years to continue to serve us well as we navigate next year and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

They were hallmarked by impressive top line growth, which undoubtedly produced share gains for us, and leveraged on both the bottom line and in free cash flow. The key ingredient to our success was balanced growth, double-digit year-on-year growth across the vast majority of our product and business units; namely, in VMware with its leading virtualization and cloud software; in our Information Storage business; in our information protection business; in our Information Security business; and in our information analytics business. Additionally, we exhibited this balanced double-digit year-on-year growth in our global services business and across our major geographies, in the Americas, in EMEA and in EPG. These impressive results are clear indicators that our hybrid cloud computing and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers. They see our products and services as relevant, and they are entrusting us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its significant advantages. I would like to recognize the more than 52,000 people around the world who are members of EMC and VMware family, and thank them for their innovation, their hard work and for their dedication to our customers' success. 
I would now like to add a little more color as to what we saw and experience in regard to customer spending trends in information technology in Q3. And then comment on what we expect to see in Q4 and a little bit beyond. For sure, in Q3, we saw that customers where examining their IT purchases with more scrutiny. Customers are looking for, in fact, demanding that their investments in IT yield real productivity gains and help them achieve competitive advantage and/or better intimacy with their customers and constituencies. This increased level of scrutiny resulted in our order flows being skewed more towards the end of the quarter. The good news is that we saw our customer interest in cloud computing both private and public to be quite high and growing. Even better news is that EMC and VMware are becoming more relevant as we are being viewed by more and more customers as a strategic partner, as they accelerate their plans and journey to the cloud. In Q4, we fully expect this customer spending scrutiny and selectedness towards IT purchases to continued. The winners will be the IT vendors that can surely help customers produce faster ROIs, the ones that have the strategy, products, services and ecosystem to help customers move to and receive the massive benefits of IT-As-A-Service, and of course, we expect EMC and VMware to remain at the top of this list. Within this context, we believe that IT spending in Q4 will represent a meaningful increase over Q3, but perhaps a tick below our normal Q3 to Q4 increase. I know there's a lot of interest in our take on what 2012 might look like, and as always, we will speak in depth about 2012 on our January call. But since this level of interest in next year isn't higher than normal, I thought I would share 3 beliefs we currently hold about 2012. First, we expect that there will be growth in global IT spending next year, but this growth rate is likely to be somewhat lower than what we saw and are seeing this year. Second, we are confident that interest in and investment in cloud computing, Big Data and security will remain top IT spending priorities. And third, we expect EMC to continue to gain share in our markets, therefore, growing significantly faster than the IT spending growth average. With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

So first of all, as I mentioned in my comments, if you look at what we call unified which is basically the old 2 Cs plus VNX, now 80% of the systems revenue from that category is now in the VNX Family, so the transition to VNX has happened. As I mentioned again in my comments, obviously, we are seeing a lot of upgrades potential and upgrade happening from installed base, but we're also winning a number of new accounts as I mentioned. The third point I'd make is, that the channel play with VNX is also very strong, with VNXe close to 1,500 new to EMC customers this year, and as I mentioned, again, the non-Dell channel revenues for the mid-tier in total, the biggest piece is unified, is up 40% year-on-year.

When you go down that list, interestingly enough, in public sector, knock on wood, I know others are seeing it, but so far, we're not seeing this public sector growth slow in the U.S. are in federal government. But we did see some public-sector, a little bit of public-sector slow down in Europe. I talked about Southern Europe, certainly, that's something that continue to watch and how that impact on the Eurozone. On the commodity front, you read what I read, again, oil prices are down and most commodity prices are down also. So that doesn't seem to be too big of a potential risk right at this point. The banking sector, everybody worries about, it's really interesting. We saw in the U.S. kind of a slow first half, but a resurgence in the second half of this year. In Europe, in some of the Eurozone banks, there was a little bit of softness in Q3, so we'll continue to watch that. So that's a pretty broad brush of what we're seeing.

We wanted to make it very clear that Isilon, whilst it may have grown up in kind of more vertically oriented marketplaces, is really doing exceptionally well in the horizontal markets, particularly people who just have kind of large scale-out file requirements. And the key is simplicity. What you do with Isilon agencies, you start small and you basically at to the systems and a scales linearly, it has very high utilization rate as well. So it really is displacing systems well often, other vendors will have multiple filesystems that are trying to do a single job and there's a lot of load-balancing going on between those filesystems. We can just put one in there that replaces the entire amounts. And one example I mentioned on the call, one example is we've actually displaced incumbent NAS vendors. And then in the vertical markets, obviously, places like oil and gas, media, whereas it's becoming a household name et cetera, still going very, very well.

And with VNXe, we expect to get slightly lower than average gross margins in the prior products for that is because we're aiming that at a price penetration point. But in total, the gross margins are pretty comfortable that the new family to the old family and that's pretty much how it's being playing out. That's the strategy we talked about January and as you've gone through the year that's what we've seen happening, obviously, we got a much more opportunity to sell software and upsell software packages, we basically repackaged a lot of our standalone software products into 3 or 4 bundles on the VNX and that's also being successful so we're getting higher software attached rates which is also helping gross margins so we think we are very well-positioned competitively on the VNX and also VNXe and the margin profile is as we expected. A couple of other things I'd point out, as well is that on the VNX, with the higher range models kind of the mid-tier, we are getting over 50% penetration rates on both Flash and FAST, which is really driving the tier storage agenda which is again is relatively unique in the market place and is also helping with margin. So the strategy is we played it out in terms of bringing, the tiering, bringing the differentiation and having the price point differences is working for us in the margins and holding it well."

You talked about the order flow and what I was -- the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick which usually doesn't happen. But so if we didn't have the forecast for that I'd say, we pulled in but we didn't. We don't get backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really that we had our sites, we had the fearless forecast and we know where the orders were forecasted, we follow them, and those were the orders we got. So they just came later and we saw our customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels within the organization looking at and purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to kind of signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. But also, it's clear to us the customers are going to spend on priority items and they're not freezing. So you always get this question, how does this look to you compared to 2008, and I think it looks vastly different. And again, we're in considerably different shape, because if you look at our product portfolio 2008 we since, we didn't VMAX, we didn't, we didn't that VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum anticipated have Data Domain. We got Data Domain end of year. VSphere 4 not vSphere 5, so we, as a company, and a lot of situation and customers while they're being diligent still want to get productivity gains and remain competitive. And it's really interesting, you watch the financials in the U.S., I was a little bit slower in the first half of this year and it was -- we watched it closely. But in that second and third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects come, can't be held back any longer, their spending. So and I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe, we saw a little bit of the and the Eurozone banks are stronger the first half of the second half. But again, these projects, they have -- everybody's got a worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States and so it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one that I continue to worry about is public sector, is a lot of governments if I had 1 systemic where you will be that as governments are really stretched and they got to be. But again, we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a bit more color of what we're seeing. I don't if I answered all your points in your question."

What we think is the most important aspect of storage is how you auto tier. And customers can store a string of information bits, bytes, you can do it in memory, you can do it in Flash technology, there's several different kinds of Flash technology, there's SLC, there's MLC, there's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K Fibre Channel drives, you got 10-K /-slash drives. You got huge 3 terabyte going to 4 terabytes SATA drive so depending on where you store the data, you got tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the broad tiers of this 1001 in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see that customers how we used all those technologies and then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership. And again, actually produce drives, arrays that are smaller, more green, and far far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing, what moves the needle most in storage, I would tell you it's that. The storage virtualization is basically used today for how to you move data across different arrays. And we have with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed and you're going to see a lot more of some of that technology be even put in the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position, and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go."

And it course those economies are just natively growing. If you look at EMC as a younger, much younger company, despite being formed in 1979, we really didn't get up on stores until 1991-ish. So our revenues are still, and of course, Q3 is probably more U.S. skewed which is 54% of revenues, but kind of in most for the other quarters you'll see our -- we still have 52-ish percent of our revenues in the U.S. so obviously, we have a lot more potential outside the U.S. for our products and services and we've been focusing on that percentage, on that potential while still growing the U.S. at very good percentages. So part of it is focused, part of it is the -- I think the attractiveness of our product line. Part of it is the fact that we have younger and have a lot more growth opportunity relative to our potential outside the U.S. and I think that's why Asia. In Europe, as you said, as David said, in constant currency, we grew 12% which we think is pretty good. Clearly, taking share in Europe and I think in the U.S., without a doubt, we took share.

We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 18% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 23%. We again improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin both sequentially and year-on-year, and we grew free cash flow by more than 25% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our strong Q3 results underscore that our strategy continues to serve us well. Our sharp focus on key areas of opportunity within cloud and Big Data is propelling ongoing momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions within these secular trends is resonating with customers, and our disciplined operational execution and control are driving our success. The combination of all 3 of these has driven our results over the past several quarters, but I'd like to take a moment to focus upon the power of our portfolio. 
We achieved $4.98 billion of revenue this quarter, a record amount for any quarter in our history because the combination of our storage, virtualization and security offerings is compelling. Our results stem from having market-leading products and services in each of these high-priority areas of IT spend and also by leveraging capabilities across our lines of business. For example, we developed our storage solutions with an eye towards security and virtualization, and customers rely upon our expertise in these areas as they decide where to deploy their IT dollars. 
In any business environment, customers want to make their IT operations more efficient and more agile. Having a partner who can get them there from start to finish is critical, and this is why we win. This advantage was clearly demonstrated by our Information Storage results in Q3 where revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, driven by product revenue growth of 28% in the mid-tier. 
Our storage portfolio has been taking share in both the mid-tier and the high end because we provide best-of-breed products which address customers specific use cases and uniquely enable them to manage massively expanding data volumes. Our high-end product revenue grew 7% over last year's Q3, which we believe is faster than the current growth rate for this segment of the markets. 
Customers with mission-critical data sets needing the very best reliability, availability and scalability trust VMAX. While customers have traditionally purchased our high-end storage to handle their biggest and most important business applications and databases, they're increasingly using VMAX to meet additional needs. Its powerful scale architecture is ideal for emerging use cases such as service providers using it for customer facing workloads. And with the combination of FAST VP, Flash and large data drives, VMAX can automatically tier data across various drive types. This capability lets customers store more data types on their SIEM; data in some cases used to relegate the Tier 2 vendors and lower the total cost of ownership. As a result, we win against high-end and Tier-2 vendors alike with VMAX's unique scale-out and other tiering solution. We had a great example of this in Q3 at a global pharmaceutical company where we displaced 1.5 petabytes of Tier 2 storage because VMAX is powerful, trusted and smart. The resilience and sheer horsepower of the VMAX architecture was far superior for supporting this customers database application. Moreover VMAX's tiering capabilities enable them to use tier drives and get better performance at a lower price. The introduction of FAST and Flash drives creates a value proposition that is unmatched and is a key reason why we continue to be the leader in the high end. 
We've been gaining share in the high end and are equally confident about taking share in midrange storage as well. EMC has built out a unique best-of-breed midrange offering over the past few years. This allows us to attack traditional midrange players head-on with a new converged VNX frontline from underneath with a new low-end VNXe offering and from the flanks, with market-leading backup and scale-out NAS offerings. 
Add to this product portfolio, a distribution channel that has doubled the number of partners in its ranks over the past year and vastly expanded the volume through these partners, and you get a clear picture of why we're so confident we're taking share in these segments. 
Let me touch briefly on some of these factors that are driving our acceleration momentum in the midrange. Starting with our VNX Family, which includes both VNX and VNXe. The transition from product generation unified mid-tier products is ramping according to plan, with over 80% of our new system revenue in this space coming from the VNX Family. 
VNXe, our new simplified storage solution built and priced to meet the needs of the SMB market, continues to flourish. VNXe has enhanced our value with existing customers who are deploying it in departmental and remote implementations. VNXe is winning us new accounts as well. Since introducing the VNXe in March, we've added well over 1,300 new to EMC customers with this easy-to-use storage solution. As VNXe is a brand-new product that just came out this year, and our win share are almost all incremental, it goes out saying that we are also gaining share in the low end. Its value proposition is clear, simple, efficient and affordable. 
VMX, like the VNXe, is also simple and efficient, and on top of it, delivers the raw power and effective utilization rates needed by large enterprises. It is winning us new footprint because of its ease-of-use, its high integration with VMware and its ability to tier data automatically, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for customers. These attributes make VNX a great fit for cloud environments which is why the largest tire distributor in the country chose to put its private cloud on VNX. American Tire uses its VNX-based cloud, 99% virtualized on VMware, to run its mission-critical Oracle e-business suites, and in doing so, was able to significantly increase performance during usage peaks. VNX replaced incumbent systems as several other companies as well in Q3, including a global pharmaceutical company, a global retailer based in France, a financial software company based in California and an insurance company based in Michigan. With the accelerated growth we saw in our unified platforms in Q3, it is clear we're gaining market share from traditional SAN and NAS vendors alike. 
Our Backup Recovery Systems business continued to lead the market and exemplified the EMC effects. We still have a lot of room to grow, both home and abroad. We expect BRS to continue to be one of our fastest growing segments for a couple of reasons. Our unique approach to deduplication makes us faster for both backup and recovery than the competition. And on top of this is the integration we built between the products in our portfolio. Whether a customer is simply replacing tape or virtualizing and working on a next-generation backup architecture, we can provide a best-of-breed solution. We saw this in Q3 with one of our longtime financial services customers who is now switching their entire backup environment to leverage our dedupe portfolio. A large city in Finland also expanded its EMC footprint on the strength of our combined BRS offerings, including Networker to create backups of their virtual machines, Avamar for backing up the virtual machine files and Data Domain as the backup target. Altogether, this solution enabled the city to reduce its data protection costs by 28%, the type of result that resonates with businesses and public sector organizations alike. With growth that continues to outpace the market, we are clearly gaining share with our differentiated backup and recovery solutions. 
The same secular shift to ever larger data sets and file sizes is driving demand for our Big Data storage and analytics products and services as well. Our offerings here are growing faster than the market, with the revenue for our portfolio of Big Data solutions including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum, up over 100% again in Q3. Within this, we're encouraged by the continued penetration of Isilon beyond verticals like life sciences in media where Isilon has become the de facto standard. Isilon is now expanding its presence in broad implementations that are not vertical specific. In these more general purpose data center uses, we're seeing a lot of purchasing for NAS solutions to run things like Neil [ph] and archiving, filesystems and home directories where data consistently expands and requires a solution that can scale where other NAS implementations can not. Such was the case with a large financial service provider in Q3. This bank was struggling with a solution for an incumbent mass vendor that just couldn't scale for its growing general-purpose file shares, archives and backups. Isilon met their need for viable long-term NAS solution that offered simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease of use of managements and lower CapEx to improve utilization. Overall, Isilon has been tremendously successful in solving customer challenges and is making life increasingly difficult for the competition. 
In addition to the financial services I just mentioned, there is a long list of competitive displacements across a wide variety of more traditional NAS use cases. In fact, in Q3 alone, Isilon displaced incumbent vendor at one of North America's largest natural gas producers, universities in Georgia and New Jersey, an international law firm, and an IT managed service provider, to name but a few. The big story here with Isilon is that it's quite clear that we continue to be successful in verticals where they've been well known, but more importantly, we are taking share and removing competitors in more horizontal use cases where other vendors' clustered approaches cannot scale nearly as easily or as efficiently as Isilon's. 
Our excellent results across our midrange portfolio demonstrate the synergy of having so many best-of-breed tools in our back. Sometimes it's the combination of Isilon for true scale-out file and VNX for database as we saw with the displacement in Q3 on one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions where performance and utilization were falling behind. Often, it's Data Domain, given the opportunities to present its value proposition to a new scale-out VNX customer as we saw in numerous deals in Q3. Regardless of the final solution with EMC, customers can be confident of achieving optimal results across their environments, physical and virtual alike. 
Story massive and growing amounts of data is one thing, making sense of and getting real value out of this data to add business insight is quite another and what our Greenplum business does very well. Greenplum solution was built for the era of Big Data. And for many companies, it's a next step in their analytic strategy. Greenplum's massively power processing capabilities like companies capture more data and make it more readily available. This is true Big Data analytics as its more real-time nature explores the details of business operations and customer interactions that aren't typically captured in a data warehouse. 
Such was the case with the win in Q3 at a financial regulatory entity which now puts Greenplum in 3 of the top trading and regulatory organizations. This organization was looking to process both structured and unstructured data to aid its decision making as its legacy system was being overloaded with the dramatic growth of data from outside sources and by the large volume of users. By augmenting their system with Greenplum, they are now able to process the large volumes of data necessary to spot patents that might be of regulatory interest. All companies are keen to harvest valuable insights like this, and this is why Greenplum's business continues to ramp in terms of both revenue and employees to keep pace with growing demand. 
Looking across our storage portfolio, it's clear our best-of-breed base of offerings is broad enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of customers and the wide variety of needs within each customer. We've always believed that it's best to have the right tool for the job in this market and that the; ""one size fits all"" approach would ultimately be unsuccessful. The fact that we're gaining share in and across all our storage solutions sets is proof that customers agree with our approach. In addition, the fact the competitors are increasingly following our lead underscores the realization that their approaches have been incomplete. 
EMC's storage innovation engine continues to produce new compelling products. The latest example is our service life Flash initiative project lining, and I'm pleased to report that this is progressing well with the first shipping in Q3. Our approach confines five 9s Flash-enhanced array technologies with best-of-breed server Flash and FAST software into a single architecture for a compelling combination. 
While our storage capabilities are broad, there are also deep comprising solutions that are second to none. We've proven leading-edge technology and standard of service that are consistently recognized as amongst the highest in the industry. Arm with these advantages, we're strengthening our storage leadership position in the 2 biggest opportunities in IT today, cloud and Big Data. 
Another key opportunity for us is building trust in the cloud, and our RSA Security division is the critical asset that is allowing us to pursue it. With revenue up 16% over Q3 a year ago, RSA is benefiting from its integrated solutions set that works across physical and virtual environments. Our advanced security management and compliance solutions offer the situational awareness that today dynamic threat environments requires. They are agile, adaptive, coordinated controls that get more predictive as patents of data movement and use behavior are absorbed, which contain the necessary remediation capabilities to ultimately thwart an attack. Our identity management and protection products are also seeing strong demand and benefiting from some larger renewals in the quarter. Customer trust in our solutions is high, and in fact, last month, SecurID won Information Security Magazine's Readers' Choice Award for Best Authentication Product in 2011. Nearly 200 Information Security professionals polled in the spring and summer, ranked SecurID especially highly for its integration and compatibility with existing infrastructure and its ease of use for end-users and its scalability. 
Our long-standing data centric approach to IT security is clearly the right one. Competitors seeing the advantages to this strategy are now trying to cobble their point products into a more cohesive solution. In addition, security professionals are drawing on our expertise in IT security to discuss best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems. 
In the past few months, senior RSA officials have participated in APT Summit in Washington D.C. and London and presented recommendations to Congress. We'll continue to leverage our expertise in this space to help build the blueprint for an evolving threat environments within a rapidly shifting IT landscape. 
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $171 million, flat from Q2. IIG continues to transition its offerings to lighter-weight, content-enabled applications on top of xCP using modern virtualized frameworks. In Q3, we announced Documentum clients for iPad, an app which provides users secure access to information and Documentum and enables them to access share and collaborate on their preferred device. 
VMware revenue grew 32% in the quarter to a record $941 million, driven by the massive shift to more efficient and more agile cloud architectures, for which virtualization is the cornerstone. The popularity of VMware is underscored by the record attendance at VMworld in Las Vegas in August with more than 19,000 customers, partners, press and analysts, and by more than 20,000 registered for VMWorld Europe and the Asia Pacific and Japan V4 events being held this week. VMware continues to differentiate itself in this space with virtualization offerings that are far more developed than any other competitors. By building onto vSphere's capabilities with more robust features in storage, business continuity, virtualized security and edge functions, modern infrastructure management and monitoring, a multi-tenant provisioning resources, VMware continues to enhance its strategic relevance in the data center. 
With our shared vision for offering IT-As-A-Service in cloud environments and ultimately, via hybrid clouds, the evolution of EMC storage, Content Management and security portfolio is increasingly complementary to VMware's feature set. We have already seen in study after study that EMC is the infrastructure provider of choice in virtualized environments, yet another study in August showed us extending our share here even further with 44% of CIOs polled naming EMC as the preferred provider for the virtualized environments. As VMware continues to build out its capabilities, our underlying infrastructure will continue to be second to none for supporting virtualization. 
With VMware's stronger results, the full year minority interest expectation for VMware has increased slightly. Also, as we advised last quarter, it is important to correctly account for the additional dilution from VMware. Our expectation for the combination of the minority interest and VMware dilution for the full year is now approximately $220 million, an important consideration when modeling consolidated EMC EPS for the year. 
The excellent performance of our services organization extended into Q3 as customers continue to look to us to build out their cloud architectures and get the most from the information contained in the infrastructures. A great example of this was a milti-million dollar deal signed in the quarter with a South American telco. As they embark on a multiyear IT transformation to align their fixed and wireless systems, run their business more efficiently and enable more targeted crossselling across marketing of their products, they engaged us to help drive their cloud, Big Data and security strategy implementation. 
Customers also look to EMC to guide them through projects centered on optimizing cost efficiency such as data center consolidations. This was a case we won the world's largest pharmaceutical companies in Q3, which listed EMC for the consolidation of 10 globally dispersed data centers. This was a strategic win, thanks in part to the high quality of product service engagements which opened the door for even larger opportunities against the incumbent provider, in this case, HP, in the future. 
As our products and services portfolio grows and evolves, so does our go-to-market approach. Our efforts to expand and deepen our channel relationships are paying off for both EMC and for our partners. We've laid a strong foundation with the onboarding of several thousand new channel partners year-to-date and are now directing our efforts towards averaging these incremental routes to markets. 
Our progress was recognized earlier this quarter by Computer Reseller News which named us a winner in their prestigious 2011 ARC awards, and also awarded us a special 2011 Tech Innovator award for VNXe, a channel-only products. We added another channel-only product in the quarter with the Data Domain 160 deduplication storage system for small enterprise data centers in remote offices. The strides we've made with our channel efforts are manifesting our results with our mid-tier product revenues through non-Dell channels growing over 40% in Q3. 
In addition, VCE continues to gain traction with orders up approximately 50% from Q2 as a single converged infrastructure solution that can be up and running on day one. With a single pane of glass for management and a single point of contact for integrated service and support, Vblocks are truly differentiated in the market. The value proposition of Vblocks perhaps even more relevant in uncertain times as our converged infrastructure means faster and easier deployments that requires far few resources of reference architectures. For these reasons, we expect demand for Vblocks to continue its rapid growth. 
Across all business, we will continue to improve our technology portfolio, enhance our relationships with customers via our world-class services and sales forces, and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach will serve us well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as our results in Q3 and for the past several quarters have shown. 
In Q3, total revenue grew 18% to $4.98 billion. We reported strong growth internationally, with revenue from APJ leading the way up 37%, while the EMEA revenue grew 15% from Q3 of 2010. Growth in North America was also strong at 16% where we saw strength in financial services and year-over-year growth in federal. The power of our portfolio is also evidenced in our operating results where our faster growing higher-margin products continue to drive gross margin in the right direction. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 250 basis points over last year's third quarter to 63%, driven by favorable revenue mix shifts and better gross margins across the business. This improvement helps us to continue to show leverage in non-GAAP operating margin which increased to 24% of revenue. 
We are very pleased with the progress we've made here over the last several years through improvements to our mix, improvements to our product and services costs, and efficiencies in our operating structure. And while we remain on the offensive to take advantage of the vast opportunity in cloud and Big Data, we'll do so while spending prudently and investing wisely. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow continues to be very strong. Deferred revenue grew 34% to $5.7 billion, driven by strong bookings and renewals. Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong, with trailing 12 months free cash flow of $3.8 billion, approximately $500 million than non-GAAP net income for the same period. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. We returned $800 million to shareholders in Q3 via the repurchase of EMC stock. We expect to repurchase the balance of the full $2 billion amount that was authorized by the board in August before the end of the year. We now expect our average share count for the full year to be 2.235 billion shares. 
Turning now to the outlook. While Joe will give color on what we're seeing in the macro environment globally, one thing is fairly obvious. Uncertainty about the global macro environment has increased in the past few months. On the other hand, there are some things we are quite certain about. We're focused on the highest priorities in IT spend. Our product portfolio is in the best shape ever. Our go-to-market approach is well defined and our reach is expanding. Our partner ecosystem is getting stronger and our operations are more efficient than ever before. We are focused on our a triple play over the long term and the priorities we laid out to gain market share, invest for growth and deliver leverage continue to guide us through the balance of the year. We remain on track to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. 
In short, our strategy is sound, our investment approach is disciplined and our execution is solid. We expect these qualities, which have driven our success over the past several years, to continue to serve us well as we navigate next year and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

Thank you very much for joining us. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 results. They were hallmarked by impressive top line growth, which undoubtedly produced share gains for us, and leveraged on both the bottom line and in free cash flow. The key ingredient to our success was balanced growth, double-digit year-on-year growth across the vast majority of our product and business units; namely, in VMware with its leading virtualization and cloud-aware software; in our Information Storage business; in our Information Protection business; in our Information Security business; and in our information analytics business. Additionally, we exhibited this balanced double-digit, year-on-year growth in our global services business and across our major geographies, in the Americas, in EMEA and in APJ. These impressive results are clear indicators that our hybrid cloud computing and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers. They see our products and services as relevant, and they are entrusting us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its significant advantages. I would like to recognize the more than 52,000 people around the world who are members of the EMC and VMware Family and thank them for their innovation, their hard work and for their dedication to our customers' success. 
I would now like to add a little more color as to what we saw and experienced in regard to customer spending trends in information technology in Q3 and then comment on what we expect to see in Q4 and a little bit beyond. For sure, in Q3, we saw that customers were examining their IT purchases with more scrutiny. Customers are looking for, in fact, demanding that their IT -- their investments in IT yield real productivity gains and help them achieve competitive advantage and/or better intimacy with their customers and constituencies. This increased level of scrutiny resulted in our order flows being skewed more towards the end of the quarter. The good news is that we saw a customer interest in cloud computing both private and public to be quite high and growing. Even better news is that EMC and VMware are becoming more relevant as we are being viewed by more and more customers as a strategic partner, as they accelerate their plans and journey to the cloud. 
In Q4, we fully expect this customer spending scrutiny and selectiveness towards IT purchases to continue. The winners will be the IT vendors that can truly help customers produce faster ROIs, the ones that have the strategy, products, services and ecosystem to help customers move to and receive the massive benefits of IT-As-A-Service, and of course, we expect EMC and VMware to remain at the top of this list. Within this context, we believe that IT spending in Q4 will represent a meaningful increase over Q3, but perhaps a tick below our normal Q3 to Q4 increase. I know there's a lot of interest in our take on what 2012 might look like, and as always, we will speak in depth about 2012 on our January call. But since this level of interest in next year isn't higher than normal, I thought I would share 3 beliefs we currently hold about 2012. First, we expect that there will be growth in global IT spending next year, but this growth rate is likely to be somewhat lower than what we saw and are seeing this year. Second, we are confident that interest in and investment in cloud computing, Big Data and security will remain top IT spending priorities. And third, we expect EMC to continue to gain share on our markets, therefore, growing significantly faster than the IT spending growth average. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

As I mentioned again in my comments, obviously, we are seeing a lot of upgrade potential and upgrade happening from the installed base, but we're also winning a number of new accounts as I mentioned. The third point I'd make is, that the channel play with VNX is also very strong, with VNXe close to 1,500 new to EMC customers this year, and as I mentioned, again, the non-Dell channel revenues for the mid-tier in total, the biggest piece is unified, is up 40% year-on-year.

You go down that list, interestingly enough, in public sector, knock on wood, I know others are seeing it, but so far, we're not seeing this public-sector growth slow in the U.S. or in federal government. But we did see some public sector -- a little bit of public-sector slowdown in Europe. I had talked about southern Europe, certainly, that's something we continue to watch and how that impacts on the Eurozone. On the commodity front, you read what I read, again, that oil prices are down and most commodity prices are down also. So that doesn't seem to be too potential -- too big of a potential risk right at this point. The banking sector, everybody worries about, it's really interesting. We saw in the U.S. kind of a slow first half, but a resurgence in the second half of this year. In Europe, in some of the Eurozone banks, there was a little bit of softness in Q3, so we'll continue to watch that. So that's a pretty broad brush of what we're seeing. But overall, again, this slip back into prose, I do expect that we will see a budget flush that ends up being a little bit slower than normal."

Year-on-year, our VNX products grew over 20% year-on-year. And so in other words, if you took Celerra, CLARiiON last year and you took those same product families this year with VNX, VNXe, we grew over 20%. So the family is doing fine. We're having applicability across a wide, probably all verticals and in several big cloud topology. So we're very pleased with the way the VNX Family is progressing."

I mean, we wanted to make it very clear that Isilon, whilst it may have grown up in a kind of more vertically oriented marketplace, is really doing exceptionally well in the horizontal markets, particularly people who just have kind of large scale-out file requirements. And the key is simplicity. What you do with Isilon is you start small and you basically add to the systems and it scales linearly. It has a very high utilization rate as well. So it really is displacing systems well often. Other vendors will have multiple filesystems that will try and do a single job, and there's a lot of load-balancing going on between those filesystems. We can just put one in there that replaces the entire amounts. And all the example I mentioned on the call were examples where we've actually displaced incumbent NAS vendors. And then in the vertical markets, obviously, places like oil and gas, media, where it's becoming a household name, et cetera, still going very, very well. I think the message here is that what we've got with Isilon and with VNX and with Data Domain is in each cases we've got a best-of-breed platform, and the best-of-breed platform is providing better utilization, better returns and is not providing a compromised compared to a one-size-fits-all, and that seems to be the solution that's winning in the market right now."

And with VNXe, we expect to get slightly lower than average gross margins in the prior products, so that is -- because we're aiming that at a price penetration point. But in total, the gross margins are pretty comparable in terms of the new family to the old family, and that's pretty much how it's being playing out. That's the strategy we talked about in January. And as you've gone through the year, that's what we've seen happening. Obviously, we've got a much more opportunity to sell software and upsell software packages on the VNX. We basically repackaged a lot of our standalone software products into 3 or 4 bundles on the VNX, and that's also being successful. So we're getting higher software attached rates which is also helping gross margins. So we think we're very well positioned competitively on VNX and also VNXe, and the margin profile is as we expected. A couple of other things I'd point out as well is that on the VNX, with the higher range models that kind of high end and mid-tier, we're getting over 50% penetration rates on both Flash and FAST, which is really driving the tier storage agenda which is, again, is relatively unique in the market place and is also helping with margins. So the strategy as we played it out in terms of bringing the tiering, bringing the differentiation and having the price point differences is working for us in the margins and holding it well."

I would say given the prevailing economic uncertainty in Europe, that actually sounds a little counterintuitive to me. I would have thought that uncertainty would have heightened over the course of the quarter. So perhaps you can explain what you think happened in September that led to that statement. Is there any risk of pull forward from Q4 into Q3 perhaps you can allude to backlog? And then finally, related to that, if normal seasonality is kind of 12% to 15%, other than spending levels being a tick below normal, what other considerations should we be thinking about in building our models for Q4?"

You talked about the order flow, and what I was -- the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick which usually doesn't happen. But -- so if we didn't have the forecast for the quarter, I'd say, maybe we pulled in but we didn't. I mean, and we don't give backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really was that we had our sites, we had the fearless forecast and we knew where the orders were forecasted, we follow them, and those were the orders we got. So they just came later and we saw our customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels looking at -- levels within the organization looking at and purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to kind of -- signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. But also, it's clear to us that customers are going to spend on priority items, and they're not freezing. So you always get this question, how do you -- how does this look to you compared to 2008? And I think it looks vastly different. And again, we're in considerably different shape because if you look at our product portfolio in 2008, since then, we didn't have VMAX, we didn't have VPLEX, we didn't have VNX, we didn't have VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum, we didn't have Data Domain -- or we just got Data Domain in the end of that year. We're on vSphere 3 going to vSphere 4 not vSphere 5. So we're -- we as a company are in a lot of situation, and customers, while they're being diligent, still want to get productivity gains and remain competitive. And it's really interesting, you watch the financials in the U.S., it was a little bit slower in the first half of this year and it was -- we watched it closely. But in the second -- in  third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects come, can't be held back any longer, they're spending. So -- and I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe. We saw a little bit of the converse there, some of the Eurozone banks are stronger in the first half than the second half. But again, these projects, they have -- everybody's got a worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States and -- so it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one I continue to worry about is public sector as a lot of governments, if I had one systemic where you will be that as governments are really stretched and they got to be. But again, there, we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a little bit more color of what we're seeing. Did I answer -- I don't know if I answered all your points in your question."

And you can -- customers can store a string of information bits, bytes. You can do it in memory. You can do it in Flash technology. There's several different kinds of Flash technology. There's SLC. There's MLC. There's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K Fibre Channel drives. You got 10K  Flash drives. You got huge 3-terabyte going to 4-terabyte SATA drives. So depending on where you store the data, you got tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the other tiers that are 1001 in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see with customers is how we used all those technologies. And then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership and again, actually produce drives -- arrays that are smaller, more green, and far, far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing -- what moves the needle most in storage, I would tell you it's that. The storage virtualization is basically used today for how do you move data across different arrays. And we have -- with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings, and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed. And you're going to see a lot more of -- some of that technology even be put into the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position, and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go."

If you look at EMC as a lot -- a younger, much younger company, despite being formed in 1979, we really didn't get up on storage until 1991-ish. So our revenues are still -- and, of course, Q3 is probably more U.S. skewed which is 54% of revenues, but kind of in a -- most for the other quarters you'll see our -- we still have 52-ish percent of our revenues in the U.S. So obviously, we have a lot more potential outside the U.S. for our products and services, and we've been focusing on that percentage -- on that potential while still growing the U.S. at very good percentages. So we're very -- so part of it is focused, part of it is the, I think, just the attractiveness of our product line.

We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 18% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 23%. We again improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin both sequentially and year-on-year, and we grew free cash flow by more than 25% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Our strong Q3 results underscore that our strategy continues to serve us well. Our sharp focus on key areas of opportunity within cloud and Big Data is propelling ongoing momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions within these secular trends is resonating with customers, and our disciplined operational execution and control are driving our success. The combination of all 3 of these has driven our results over the past several quarters, but I'd like to take a moment to focus upon the power of our portfolio. 
We achieved $4.98 billion of revenue this quarter, a record amount for any quarter in our history because the combination of our storage, virtualization and security offerings is compelling. Our results stem from having market-leading products and services in each of these high-priority areas of IT spend and also by leveraging capabilities across our lines of business. For example, we developed our storage solutions with an eye towards security and virtualization, and customers rely upon our expertise in these areas as they decide where to deploy their IT dollars. 
In any business environment, customers want to make their IT operations more efficient and more agile. Having a partner who can get them there from start to finish is critical, and this is why we win. This advantage was clearly demonstrated by our Information Storage results in Q3 where revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, driven by product revenue growth of 28% in the mid-tier. 
Our storage portfolio has been taking share in both the mid-tier and the high end because we provide best-of-breed products which address customers specific use cases and uniquely enable them to manage massively expanding data volumes. Our high-end product revenue grew 7% over last year's Q3, which we believe is faster than the current growth rate for this segment of the markets. 
Customers with mission-critical data sets needing the very best reliability, availability and scalability trust VMAX. While customers have traditionally purchased our high-end storage to handle their biggest and most important business applications and databases, they're increasingly using VMAX to meet additional needs. Its powerful scale architecture is ideal for emerging use cases such as service providers using it for customer facing workloads. And with the combination of FAST VP, Flash and large data drives, VMAX can automatically tier data across various drive types. This capability lets customers store more data types on their SIEM; data in some cases used to relegate the Tier 2 vendors and lower the total cost of ownership. As a result, we win against high-end and Tier-2 vendors alike with VMAX's unique scale-out and other tiering solution. We had a great example of this in Q3 at a global pharmaceutical company where we displaced 1.5 petabytes of Tier 2 storage because VMAX is powerful, trusted and smart. The resilience and sheer horsepower of the VMAX architecture was far superior for supporting this customers database application. Moreover VMAX's tiering capabilities enable them to use tier drives and get better performance at a lower price. The introduction of FAST and Flash drives creates a value proposition that is unmatched and is a key reason why we continue to be the leader in the high end. 
We've been gaining share in the high end and are equally confident about taking share in midrange storage as well. EMC has built out a unique best-of-breed midrange offering over the past few years. This allows us to attack traditional midrange players head-on with a new converged VNX frontline from underneath with a new low-end VNXe offering and from the flanks, with market-leading backup and scale-out NAS offerings. 
Add to this product portfolio, a distribution channel that has doubled the number of partners in its ranks over the past year and vastly expanded the volume through these partners, and you get a clear picture of why we're so confident we're taking share in these segments. 
Let me touch briefly on some of these factors that are driving our acceleration momentum in the midrange. Starting with our VNX Family, which includes both VNX and VNXe. The transition from product generation unified mid-tier products is ramping according to plan, with over 80% of our new system revenue in this space coming from the VNX Family. 
VNXe, our new simplified storage solution built and priced to meet the needs of the SMB market, continues to flourish. VNXe has enhanced our value with existing customers who are deploying it in departmental and remote implementations. VNXe is winning us new accounts as well. Since introducing the VNXe in March, we've added well over 1,300 new to EMC customers with this easy-to-use storage solution. As VNXe is a brand-new product that just came out this year, and our win share are almost all incremental, it goes out saying that we are also gaining share in the low end. Its value proposition is clear, simple, efficient and affordable. 
VMX, like the VNXe, is also simple and efficient, and on top of it, delivers the raw power and effective utilization rates needed by large enterprises. It is winning us new footprint because of its ease-of-use, its high integration with VMware and its ability to tier data automatically, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for customers. 
These attributes make VNX a great fit for cloud environments which is why the largest tire distributor in the country chose to put its private cloud on VNX. American Tire uses its VNX-based cloud, 99% virtualized on VMware, to run its mission-critical Oracle e-business suites, and in doing so, was able to significantly increase performance during usage peaks. VNX replaced incumbent systems as several other companies as well in Q3, including a global pharmaceutical company, a global retailer based in France, a financial software company based in California and an insurance company based in Michigan. 
With the accelerated growth we saw in our unified platforms in Q3, it is clear we're gaining market share from traditional SAN and NAS vendors alike. 
Our Backup Recovery Systems business continued to lead the market and exemplified the EMC effects. We still have a lot of room to grow, both home and abroad. We expect BRS to continue to be one of our fastest growing segments for a couple of reasons. Our unique approach to deduplication makes us faster for both backup and recovery than a competition. And on top of this is the integration we built between the products in our portfolio. Whether a customer is simply replacing tape or virtualizing and working on a next-generation backup architecture, we can provide a best-of-breed solution. We saw this in Q3 with one of our longtime financial services customers who is now switching their entire backup environment to leverage our dedupe portfolio. A large city in Finland also expanded its EMC footprint on the strength of our combined BRS offerings, including Networker to create backups of their virtual machines, Avamar for backing up the virtual machine files and Data Domain as the backup target. 
Altogether, this solution enabled the city to reduce its data protection costs by 28%, the type of result that resonates with businesses and public sector organizations alike. With growth that continues to outpace the market, we are clearly gaining share with our differentiated backup and recovery solutions. 
The same secular shift to ever larger data sets and file sizes is driving demand for our Big Data storage and analytics products and services as well. Our offerings here are growing faster than the market, with the revenue for our portfolio of Big Data solutions including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum, up over 100% again in Q3. Within this, we're encouraged by the continued penetration of Isilon beyond verticals like life sciences in media where Isilon has become the de facto standard. Isilon is now expanding its presence in broad implementations that are not vertical specific. In these more general purpose data center uses, we're seeing a lot of purchasing for NAS solutions to run things like Neil [ph] and archiving, filesystems and home directories where data consistently expands and requires a solution that can scale where other NAS implementations can not. Such was the case with a large financial service provider in Q3. This bank was struggling with a solution for an incumbent NAS vendor that just couldn't scale for its growing general-purpose file shares, archives and backups. Isilon met their need for viable long-term NAS solution that offered simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease of use of managements and lower CapEx to improve utilization. Overall, Isilon has been tremendously successful in solving customer challenges and is making life increasingly difficult for the competition. 
In addition to the financial services I just mentioned, there is a long list of competitive displacements across a wide variety of more traditional NAS use cases. In fact, in Q3 alone, Isilon displaced incumbent vendor at one of North America's largest natural gas producers, universities in Georgia and New Jersey, an international law firm, and an IT managed service provider, to name but a few. The big story here with Isilon is that it's quite clear that we continue to be successful in verticals where they've been well known, but more importantly, we are taking share and removing competitors in more horizontal use cases where other vendors' clustered approaches cannot scale nearly as easily or as efficiently as Isilon's. 
Our excellent results across our midrange portfolio demonstrate the synergy of having so many best-of-breed tools in our back. Sometimes it's the combination of Isilon for true scale-out file and VNX for database as we saw with the displacement in Q3 on one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions where performance and utilization were falling behind. Often, it's Data Domain, given the opportunities to present its value proposition to a new scale-out VNX customer as we saw in numerous deals in Q3. Regardless of the final solution with EMC, customers can be confident of achieving optimal results across their environments, physical and virtual alike. 
Story massive and growing amounts of data is one thing, making sense of and getting real value out of this data to add business insight is quite another and what our Greenplum business does very well. Greenplum solution was built for the era of Big Data. And for many companies, it's a next step in their analytic strategy. Greenplum's massively power processing capabilities let companies capture more data and make it more readily available. This is true Big Data analytics as its more real-time nature explores the details of business operations and customer interactions that aren't typically captured in a data warehouse. 
Such was the case with the win in Q3 at a financial regulatory entity which now puts Greenplum in 3 of the top trading and regulatory organizations. This organization was looking to process both structured and unstructured data to aid its decision making as its legacy system was being overloaded with the dramatic growth of data from outside sources and by the large volume of users. By augmenting their system with Greenplum, they are now able to process the large volumes of data necessary to spot patents that might be of regulatory interest. All companies are keen to harvest valuable insights like these, and this is why Greenplum's business continues to ramp in terms of both revenue and employees to keep pace with growing demand. 
Looking across our storage portfolio, it's clear our best-of-breed base of offerings is broad enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of customers and the wide variety of needs within each customer. We've always believed that it's best to have the right tool for the job in this market and that the ""one size fits all"" approach would ultimately be unsuccessful. The fact that we're gaining share in and across all our storage solutions sets is proof that customers agree with our approach. In addition, the fact the competitors are increasingly following our lead underscores the realization that their approaches have been incomplete. 
EMC's storage innovation engine continues to produce new compelling products. The latest example is our service life Flash initiative project lining, and I'm pleased to report that this is progressing well with the first shipping in Q3. Our approach confines five 9s Flash-enhanced array technologies with best-of-breed server Flash and FAST software into a single architecture for a compelling combination. 
While our storage capabilities are broad, there are also deep comprising solutions that are second to none. We've proven leading-edge technology and standard of service that are consistently recognized as amongst the highest in the industry. Armed with these advantages, we're strengthening our storage leadership position in the 2 biggest opportunities in IT today, Cloud and Big Data. 
Another key opportunity for us is building trust in the cloud, and our RSA Security division is the critical asset that is allowing us to pursue it. With revenue up 16% over Q3 a year ago, RSA is benefiting from its integrated solutions set that works across physical and virtual environments. Our advanced security management and compliance solutions offer the situational awareness that today dynamic threat environments requires. They are agile, adaptive, coordinated controls that get more predictive as patents of data movement and use behavior are absorbed, which contain the necessary remediation capabilities to ultimately thwart an attack. Our identity management and protection products are also seeing strong demand and benefiting from some larger renewals in the quarter. Customer trust in our solutions is high, and in fact, last month, SecurID won Information Security Magazine's Readers' Choice Award for Best Authentication Product in 2011. Nearly 200 Information Security professionals polled in the spring and summer, ranked SecurID especially highly for its integration and compatibility with existing infrastructure and its ease of use for end-users and its scalability. 
Our long-standing data centric approach to IT security is clearly the right one. Competitors seeing the advantages to this strategy are now trying to cobble their point products into a more cohesive solution. In addition, security professionals are drawing on our expertise in IT security to discuss best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems. 
In the past few months, senior RSA officials have participated in APT Summit in Washington D.C. and London and presented recommendations to Congress. We'll continue to leverage our expertise in this space to help build the blueprint for an evolving threat environments within a rapidly shifting IT landscape. 
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $171 million, flat from Q2. IIG continues to transition its offerings to lighter-weight, content-enabled applications on top of xCP using modern virtualized frameworks. In Q3, we announced Documentum clients for iPad, an app which provides users secure access to information and Documentum and enables them to access share and collaborate on their preferred device. 
VMware revenue grew 32% in the quarter to a record $941 million, driven by the massive shift to more efficient and more agile cloud architectures, for which virtualization is the cornerstone. The popularity of VMware is underscored by the record attendance at VMworld in Las Vegas in August with more than 19,000 customers, partners, press and analysts, and by more than 20,000 registered for VMWorld Europe and the Asia Pacific and Japan V4 events being held this week. VMware continues to differentiate itself in this space with virtualization offerings that are far more developed than any other competitors. By building onto vSphere's capabilities with more robust features in storage, business continuity, virtualized security and edge functions, modern infrastructure management and monitoring, a multi-tenant provisioning resources, VMware continues to enhance its strategic relevance in the data center. 
With our shared vision for offering IT-As-A-Service in cloud environments and ultimately, via hybrid clouds, the evolution of EMC storage, Content Management and security portfolio is increasingly complementary to VMware's feature set. We have already seen in study after study that EMC is the infrastructure provider of choice in virtualized environments, yet another study in August showed us extending our share here even further with 44% of CIOs polled naming EMC as the preferred provider for the virtualized environments. As VMware continues to build out its capabilities, our underlying infrastructure will continue to be second to none for supporting virtualization. 
With VMware's stronger results, the full year minority interest expectation for VMware has increased slightly. Also, as we advised last quarter, it is important to correctly account for the additional dilution from VMware. Our expectation for the combination of the minority interest and VMware dilution for the full year is now approximately $220 million, an important consideration when modeling consolidated EMC EPS for the year. 
The excellent performance of our services organization extended into Q3 as customers continue to look to us to build out their cloud architectures and get the most from the information contained in the infrastructures. A great example of this was a milti-million dollar deal signed in the quarter with a South American telco. As they embark on a multiyear IT transformation to align their fixed and wireless systems, run their business more efficiently and enable more targeted cross-selling across marketing of their products, they engaged us to help drive their cloud, Big Data and security strategy implementation. 
Customers also look to EMC to guide them through projects centered on optimizing cost efficiency such as data center consolidations. This was a case we won the world's largest pharmaceutical companies in Q3, which listed EMC for the consolidation of 10 globally dispersed data centers. This was a strategic win, thanks in part to the high quality of product service engagements which opened the door for even larger opportunities against the incumbent provider, in this case, HP, in the future. 
As our products and services portfolio grows and evolves, so does our go-to-market approach. Our efforts to expand and deepen our channel relationships are paying off for both EMC and for our partners. We've laid a strong foundation with the onboarding of several thousand new channel partners year-to-date and are now directing our efforts towards averaging these incremental routes to markets. 
Our progress was recognized earlier this quarter by Computer Reseller News which named us a winner in their prestigious 2011 ARC awards, and also awarded us a special 2011 Tech Innovator award for VNXe, a channel-only products. We added another channel-only product in the quarter with the Data Domain 160 deduplication storage system for small enterprise data centers in remote offices. The strides we've made with our channel efforts are manifesting our results with our mid-tier product revenues through non-Dell channels growing over 40% in Q3. 
In addition, VCE continues to gain traction with orders up approximately 50% from Q2 as a single converged infrastructure solution that can be up and running on day one. With a single pane of glass for management and a single point of contact for integrated service and support, Vblocks are truly differentiated in the market. The value proposition of Vblocks perhaps even more relevant in uncertain times as our converged infrastructure means faster and easier deployments that requires far few resources of reference architectures. For these reasons, we expect demand for Vblocks to continue its rapid growth. 
Across all business, we will continue to improve our technology portfolio, enhance our relationships with customers via our world-class services and sales forces, and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach will serve us well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as our results in Q3 and for the past several quarters have shown. 
In Q3, total revenue grew 18% to $4.98 billion. We reported strong growth internationally, with revenue from APJ leading the way up 37%, while the EMEA revenue grew 15% from Q3 of 2010. Growth in North America was also strong at 16% where we saw strength in financial services and year-over-year growth in federal. The power of our portfolio is also evidenced in our operating results where our faster growing higher-margin products continue to drive gross margin in the right direction. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 250 basis points over last year's third quarter to 63%, driven by favorable revenue mix shifts and better gross margins across the business. This improvement helps us to continue to show leverage in non-GAAP operating margin which increased to 24% of revenue. 
We are very pleased with the progress we've made here over the last several years through improvements to our mix, improvements to our product and services costs, and efficiencies in our operating structure. And while we remain on the offensive to take advantage of the vast opportunity in cloud and Big Data, we'll do so while spending prudently and investing wisely. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow continues to be very strong. Deferred revenue grew 34% to $5.7 billion, driven by strong bookings and renewals. Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong, with trailing 12 months free cash flow of $3.8 billion, approximately $500 million than non-GAAP net income for the same period. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. We returned $800 million to shareholders in Q3 via the repurchase of EMC stock. We expect to repurchase the balance of the full $2 billion amount that was authorized by the board in August before the end of the year. We now expect our average share count for the full year to be 2.235 billion shares. 
Turning now to the outlook. While Joe will give color on what we're seeing in the macro environment globally, one thing is fairly obvious. Uncertainty about the global macro environment has increased in the past few months. On the other hand, there are some things we are quite certain about. We're focused on the highest priorities in IT spend. Our product portfolio is in the best shape ever. Our go-to-market approach is well defined and our reach is expanding. Our partner ecosystem is getting stronger and our operations are more efficient than ever before. 
We are focused on our a triple play over the long term and the priorities we laid out to gain market share, invest for growth and deliver leverage continue to guide us through the balance of the year. We remain on track to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. 
In short, our strategy is sound, our investment approach is disciplined and our execution is solid. We expect these qualities, which have driven our success over the past several years, to continue to serve us well as we navigate next year and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"
121729,141309808,173492,"EMC Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, David.

Thank you very much for joining us. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 results. They were hallmarked by impressive top line growth, which undoubtedly produced share gains for us, and leveraged on both the bottom line and in free cash flow. 
The key ingredient to our success was balanced growth, double-digit year-on-year growth across the vast majority of our product and business units; namely, in VMware with its leading virtualization and cloud-aware software; in our Information Storage business; in our Information Protection business; in our Information Security business; and in our information analytics business. 
Additionally, we exhibited this balanced double-digit, year-on-year growth in our global services business and across our major geographies, in the Americas, in EMEA and in APJ. These impressive results are clear indicators that our hybrid cloud computing and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers. They see our products and services as relevant, and they are entrusting us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its significant advantages. I would like to recognize the more than 52,000 people around the world who are members of the EMC and VMware Family and thank them for their innovation, their hard work and for their dedication to our customers' success. 
I would now like to add a little more color as to what we saw and experienced in regard to customer spending trends in information technology in Q3 and then comment on what we expect to see in Q4 and a little bit beyond. For sure, in Q3, we saw that customers were examining their IT purchases with more scrutiny. Customers are looking for, in fact, demanding that their IT -- that their investments in IT yield real productivity gains and help them achieve competitive advantage and/or better intimacy with their customers and constituencies. 
This increased level of scrutiny resulted in our order flows being skewed more towards the end of the quarter. The good news is that we saw a customer interest in cloud computing both private and public to be quite high and growing. Even better news is that EMC and VMware are becoming more relevant as we are being viewed by more and more customers as a strategic partner, as they accelerate their plans and journey to the cloud. 
In Q4, we fully expect this customer spending scrutiny and selectiveness towards IT purchases to continue. The winners will be the IT vendors that can truly help customers produce faster ROIs, the ones that have the strategy, products, services and ecosystem to help customers move to and receive the massive benefits of IT-As-A-Service, and of course, we expect EMC and VMware to remain at the top of this list. 
Within this context, we believe that IT spending in Q4 will represent a meaningful increase over Q3, but perhaps a tick below our normal Q3 to Q4 increase. I know there's a lot of interest in our take on what 2012 might look like, and as always, we will speak in depth about 2012 on our January call. But since this level of interest in next year isn't higher than normal, I thought I would share 3 beliefs we currently hold about 2012. 
First, we expect that there will be growth in global IT spending next year, but this growth rate is likely to be somewhat lower than what we saw and are seeing this year. Second, we are confident that interest in and investment in cloud computing, Big Data and security will remain top IT spending priorities. And third, we expect EMC to continue to gain share on our markets, therefore, growing significantly faster than the IT spending growth average. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

The third point I'd make is, that the channel play with VNX is also very strong, with VNXe close to 1,500 new to EMC customers this year, and as I mentioned, again, the non-Dell channel revenues for the mid-tier in total, the biggest piece is unified, is up 40% year-on-year.

So I still think it will be fairly good. Within that, I mentioned areas to watch where public sector, what was happening in southern Europe, what was happening with commodity pricing. You go down that list, interestingly enough, in public sector, knock on wood, I know others are seeing it, but so far, we're not seeing this public-sector growth slow in the U.S. or in federal government. But we did see some public sector -- a little bit of public-sector slowdown in Europe. 
I had talked about southern Europe, certainly, that's something we continue to watch and how that impacts on the Eurozone. On the commodity front, you read what I read, again, that oil prices are down and most commodity prices are down also. So that doesn't seem to be too potential -- too big of a potential risk right at this point. The banking sector, everybody worries about, it's really interesting. We saw in the U.S. kind of a slow first half, but a resurgence in the second half of this year. In Europe, in some of the Eurozone banks, there was a little bit of softness in Q3, so we'll continue to watch that. So that's a pretty broad brush of what we're seeing. But overall, again, this slip back into prose, I do expect that we will see a budget flush that ends up being a little bit slower than normal."

I mean, we wanted to make it very clear that Isilon, whilst it may have grown up in a kind of more vertically oriented marketplace, is really doing exceptionally well in the horizontal markets, particularly people who just have kind of large scale-out file requirements. And the key is simplicity. What you do with Isilon is you start small and you basically add to the systems and it scales linearly. It has a very high utilization rate as well. So it really is displacing systems well often. Other vendors will have multiple filesystems that will try and do a single job, and there's a lot of load-balancing going on between those filesystems. We can just put one in there that replaces the entire amounts. And all the example I mentioned on the call were examples where we've actually displaced incumbent NAS vendors. And then in the vertical markets, obviously, places like oil and gas, media, where it's becoming a household name, et cetera, still going very, very well. 
I think the message here is that what we've got with Isilon and with VNX and with Data Domain is in each cases we've got a best-of-breed platform, and the best-of-breed platform is providing better utilization, better returns and is not providing a compromise compared to a one-size-fits-all, and that seems to be the solution that's winning in the market right now."

And with VNXe, we expect to get slightly lower than average gross margins in the prior products, so that is -- because we're aiming that at a price penetration point. 
But in total, the gross margins are pretty comparable in terms of the new family to the old family, and that's pretty much how it's being playing out. That's the strategy we talked about in January. And as you've gone through the year, that's what we've seen happening. Obviously, we've got a much more opportunity to sell software and upsell software packages on the VNX. We basically repackaged a lot of our standalone software products into 3 or 4 bundles on the VNX, and that's also being successful. So we're getting higher software attached rates which is also helping gross margins. 
So we think we're very well positioned competitively on VNX and also VNXe, and the margin profile is as we expected. A couple of other things I'd point out as well is that on the VNX, with the higher range models that kind of high end and mid-tier, we're getting over 50% penetration rates on both Flash and FAST, which is really driving the tier storage agenda which is, again, is relatively unique in the market place and is also helping with margins. So the strategy as we played it out in terms of bringing the tiering, bringing the differentiation and having the price point differences is working for us in the margins and holding it well."

You talked about the order flow, and what I was -- the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick which usually doesn't happen. But -- so if we didn't have the forecast for the quarter, I'd say, maybe we pulled in but we didn't. I mean, and we don't give backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really was that we had our sites, we had the fearless forecast and we knew where the orders were forecasted, we follow them, and those were the orders we got. So they just came later and we saw our customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels looking at -- levels within the organization looking at and purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to kind of -- signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. 
But also, it's clear to us that customers are going to spend on priority items, and they're not freezing. So you always get this question, how do you -- how does this look to you compared to 2008? And I think it looks vastly different. And again, we're in considerably different shape because if you look at our product portfolio in 2008, since then, we didn't have VMAX, we didn't have VPLEX, we didn't have VNX, we didn't have VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum, we didn't have Data Domain -- or we just got Data Domain in the end of that year. We're on vSphere 3 going to vSphere 4 not vSphere 5. 
So we're -- we as a company are in a lot of situation, and customers, while they're being diligent, still want to get productivity gains and remain competitive. And it's really interesting, you watch the financials in the U.S., it was a little bit slower in the first half of this year and it was -- we watched it closely. But in the second -- in  third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects come, can't be held back any longer, they're spending. So -- and I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe. We saw a little bit of the converse there, some of the Eurozone banks are stronger in the first half than the second half. 
But again, these projects, they have -- everybody's got a worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States and -- so it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one I continue to worry about is public sector as a lot of governments, if I had one systemic where you will be that as governments are really stretched and they got to be. But again, there, we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a little bit more color of what we're seeing.

And then, really, apart from that, we really want to keep our comments on everything else to do with 2012 until we get together again in January when we'll give you a lot more color on what we're seeing out there."

And you can -- customers can store a string of information bits, bytes. You can do it in memory. You can do it in Flash technology. There's several different kinds of Flash technology. There's SLC. There's MLC. There's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K Fibre Channel drives. You got 10K  Flash drives. You got huge 3-terabyte going to 4-terabyte SATA drives. 
So depending on where you store the data, you got tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the other tiers that are 1001 in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see with customers is how we used all those technologies. And then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership and again, actually produce drives -- arrays that are smaller, more green, and far, far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing -- what moves the needle most in storage, I would tell you it's that. The storage virtualization is basically used today for how do you move data across different arrays. And we have -- with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings, and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed. And you're going to see a lot more of -- some of that technology even be put into the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position, and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go."

If we broken out our business in the Middle East and other parts of the world, countries in the world where we're quite robust, and it's the big investment we've been doing in these rapidly growing economies and new developing economies, which is paying off. And of course the way those economies are just natively growing. 
If you look at EMC as a lot -- a younger, much younger company, despite being formed in 1979, we really didn't get up on storage until 1991-ish. So our revenues are still -- and, of course, Q3 is probably more U.S. skewed which is 54% of revenues, but kind of in a -- most of the other quarters you'll see our -- we still have 52-ish percent of our revenues in the U.S. So obviously, we have a lot more potential outside the U.S. for our products and services, and we've been focusing on that percentage -- on that potential while still growing the U.S. at very good percentages. So we're very -- so part of it is focused, part of it is the, I think, just the attractiveness of our product line. Part of it is the fact that we have younger and have a lot more growth opportunity relative to our potential outside the U.S., and I think that's why Asia. 
In Europe, as you said, as David said, in constant currency, we grew 12% which we think is pretty good. Clearly, taking share in Europe. And I think in the U.S., without a doubt, we took share. So we had some pretty good balance and good products, good strategy, good go-to-market and a lot of good people on them, very fortunate."

We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 18% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 23%. We again improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin both sequentially and year-on-year, and we grew free cash flow by more than 25% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Our strong Q3 results underscore that our strategy continues to serve us well. Our sharp focus on key areas of opportunity within cloud and Big Data is propelling ongoing momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions within these secular trends is resonating with customers, and our disciplined operational execution and control are driving our success. The combination of all 3 of these has driven our results over the past several quarters, but I'd like to take a moment to focus upon the power of our portfolio. 
We achieved $4.98 billion of revenue this quarter, a record amount for any quarter in our history because the combination of our storage, virtualization and security offerings is compelling. Our results stem from having market-leading products and services in each of these high-priority areas of IT spend and also by leveraging capabilities across our lines of business. For example, we developed our storage solutions with an eye towards security and virtualization, and customers rely upon our expertise in these areas as they decide where to deploy their IT dollars. 
In any business environment, customers want to make their IT operations more efficient and more agile. Having a partner who can get them there from start to finish is critical, and this is why we win. This advantage was clearly demonstrated by our Information Storage results in Q3 where revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, driven by product revenue growth of 28% in the mid-tier. 
Our storage portfolio has been taking share in both the mid-tier and the high end because we provide best-of-breed products which address customers’ specific use cases and uniquely enable them to manage massively expanding data volumes. Our high-end product revenue grew 7% over last year's Q3, which we believe is faster than the current growth rate for this segment of the markets. 
Customers with mission-critical data sets needing the very best reliability, availability and scalability trust VMAX. While customers have traditionally purchased our high-end storage to handle their biggest and most important business applications and databases, they're increasingly using VMAX to meet additional needs. Its powerful scale architecture is ideal for emerging use cases such as service providers using it for customer facing workloads. And with the combination of FAST VP, Flash and large data drives, VMAX can automatically tier data across various drive types. This capability lets customers store more data types on their SIEM; data in some cases used to relegate the Tier 2 vendors and lower the total cost of ownership. As a result, we win against high-end and Tier-2 vendors alike with VMAX's unique scale-out and other tiering solution. We had a great example of this in Q3 at a global pharmaceutical company where we displaced 1.5 petabytes of Tier 2 storage because VMAX is powerful, trusted and smart. The resilience and sheer horsepower of the VMAX architecture was far superior for supporting this customers database application. Moreover VMAX's tiering capabilities enable them to use tier drives and get better performance at a lower price. The introduction of FAST and Flash drives creates a value proposition that is unmatched and is a key reason why we continue to be the leader in the high end. 
We've been gaining share in the high end and are equally confident about taking share in midrange storage as well. EMC has built out a unique best-of-breed midrange offering over the past few years. This allows us to attack traditional midrange players head-on with a new converged VNX frontline from underneath with a new low-end VNXe offering and from the flanks, with market-leading backup and scale-out NAS offerings. 
Add to this product portfolio, a distribution channel that has doubled the number of partners in its ranks over the past year and vastly expanded the volume through these partners, and you get a clear picture of why we're so confident we're taking share in these segments. 
Let me touch briefly on some of these factors that are driving our acceleration momentum in the midrange. Starting with our VNX Family, which includes both VNX and VNXe. The transition from product generation unified mid-tier products is ramping according to plan, with over 80% of our new system revenue in this space coming from the VNX Family. 
VNXe, our new simplified storage solution built and priced to meet the needs of the SMB market, continues to flourish. VNXe has enhanced our value with existing customers who are deploying it in departmental and remote implementations. VNXe is winning us new accounts as well. Since introducing the VNXe in March, we've added well over 1,300 new to EMC customers with this easy-to-use storage solution. As VNXe is a brand-new product that just came out this year, and our win share are almost all incremental, it goes out saying that we are also gaining share in the low end. Its value proposition is clear, simple, efficient and affordable. 
VMX, like the VNXe, is also simple and efficient, and on top of it, delivers the raw power and effective utilization rates needed by large enterprises. It is winning us new footprint because of its ease-of-use, its high integration with VMware and its ability to tier data automatically, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for customers. 
These attributes make VNX a great fit for cloud environments which is why the largest tire distributor in the country chose to put its private cloud on VNX. American Tire uses its VNX-based cloud, 99% virtualized on VMware, to run its mission-critical Oracle e-business suites, and in doing so, was able to significantly increase performance during usage peaks. VNX replaced incumbent systems as several other companies as well in Q3, including a global pharmaceutical company, a global retailer based in France, a financial software company based in California and an insurance company based in Michigan. 
With the accelerated growth we saw in our unified platforms in Q3, it is clear we're gaining market share from traditional SAN and NAS vendors alike. 
Our Backup Recovery Systems business continued to lead the market and exemplified the EMC effects. We still have a lot of room to grow, both home and abroad. We expect BRS to continue to be one of our fastest growing segments for a couple of reasons. Our unique approach to deduplication makes us faster for both backup and recovery than a competition. And on top of this is the integration we built between the products in our portfolio. Whether a customer is simply replacing tape or virtualizing and working on a next-generation backup architecture, we can provide a best-of-breed solution. We saw this in Q3 with one of our longtime financial services customers who is now switching their entire backup environment to leverage our dedupe portfolio. A large city in Finland also expanded its EMC footprint on the strength of our combined BRS offerings, including Networker to create backups of their virtual machines, Avamar for backing up the virtual machine files and Data Domain as the backup target. 
Altogether, this solution enabled the city to reduce its data protection costs by 28%, the type of result that resonates with businesses and public sector organizations alike. With growth that continues to outpace the market, we are clearly gaining share with our differentiated backup and recovery solutions. 
The same secular shift to ever larger data sets and file sizes is driving demand for our Big Data storage and analytics products and services as well. Our offerings here are growing faster than the market, with the revenue for our portfolio of Big Data solutions including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum, up over 100% again in Q3. Within this, we're encouraged by the continued penetration of Isilon beyond verticals like life sciences in media where Isilon has become the de facto standard. Isilon is now expanding its presence in broad implementations that are not vertical specific. In these more general purpose data center uses, we're seeing a lot of purchasing for NAS solutions to run things like Neil [ph] and archiving, filesystems and home directories where data consistently expands and requires a solution that can scale where other NAS implementations cannot. Such was the case with a large financial service provider in Q3. This bank was struggling with a solution for an incumbent NAS vendor that just couldn't scale for its growing general-purpose file shares, archives and backups. Isilon met their need for viable long-term NAS solution that offered simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease of use of managements and lower CapEx to improve utilization. Overall, Isilon has been tremendously successful in solving customer challenges and is making life increasingly difficult for the competition. 
In addition to the financial services I just mentioned, there is a long list of competitive displacements across a wide variety of more traditional NAS use cases. In fact, in Q3 alone, Isilon displaced incumbent vendor at one of North America's largest natural gas producers, universities in Georgia and New Jersey, an international law firm, and an IT managed service provider, to name but a few. The big story here with Isilon is that it's quite clear that we continue to be successful in verticals where they've been well known, but more importantly, we are taking share and removing competitors in more horizontal use cases where other vendors' clustered approaches cannot scale nearly as easily or as efficiently as Isilon's. 
Our excellent results across our midrange portfolio demonstrate the synergy of having so many best-of-breed tools in our back. Sometimes it's the combination of Isilon for true scale-out file and VNX for database as we saw with the displacement in Q3 on one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions where performance and utilization were falling behind. Often, it's Data Domain, given the opportunities to present its value proposition to a new scale-out VNX customer as we saw in numerous deals in Q3. Regardless of the final solution with EMC, customers can be confident of achieving optimal results across their environments, physical and virtual alike. 
Story massive and growing amounts of data is one thing, making sense of and getting real value out of this data to add business insight is quite another and what our Greenplum business does very well. Greenplum solution was built for the era of Big Data. And for many companies, it's a next step in their analytic strategy. Greenplum's massively power processing capabilities let companies capture more data and make it more readily available. This is true Big Data analytics as its more real-time nature explores the details of business operations and customer interactions that aren't typically captured in a data warehouse. 
Such was the case with the win in Q3 at a financial regulatory entity which now puts Greenplum in 3 of the top trading and regulatory organizations. This organization was looking to process both structured and unstructured data to aid its decision making as its legacy system was being overloaded with the dramatic growth of data from outside sources and by the large volume of users. By augmenting their system with Greenplum, they are now able to process the large volumes of data necessary to spot patents that might be of regulatory interest. All companies are keen to harvest valuable insights like these, and this is why Greenplum's business continues to ramp in terms of both revenue and employees to keep pace with growing demand. 
Looking across our storage portfolio, it's clear our best-of-breed base of offerings is broad enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of customers and the wide variety of needs within each customer. We've always believed that it's best to have the right tool for the job in this market and that the ""one size fits all"" approach would ultimately be unsuccessful. The fact that we're gaining share in and across all our storage solutions sets is proof that customers agree with our approach. In addition, the fact the competitors are increasingly following our lead underscores the realization that their approaches have been incomplete. 
EMC's storage innovation engine continues to produce new compelling products. The latest example is our service life Flash initiative project lining, and I'm pleased to report that this is progressing well with the first shipping in Q3. Our approach confines five 9s Flash-enhanced array technologies with best-of-breed server Flash and FAST software into a single architecture for a compelling combination. 
While our storage capabilities are broad, there are also deep comprising solutions that are second to none. We've proven leading-edge technology and standard of service that are consistently recognized as amongst the highest in the industry. Armed with these advantages, we're strengthening our storage leadership position in the 2 biggest opportunities in IT today, cloud and Big Data. 
Another key opportunity for us is building trust in the cloud, and our RSA Security division is the critical asset that is allowing us to pursue it. With revenue up 16% over Q3 a year ago, RSA is benefiting from its integrated solutions set that works across physical and virtual environments. Our advanced security management and compliance solutions offer the situational awareness that today dynamic threat environments requires. They are agile, adaptive, coordinated controls that get more predictive as patents of data movement and use behavior are absorbed, which contain the necessary remediation capabilities to ultimately thwart an attack. Our identity management and protection products are also seeing strong demand and benefiting from some larger renewals in the quarter. Customer trust in our solutions is high, and in fact, last month, SecurID won Information Security Magazine's Readers' Choice Award for Best Authentication Product in 2011. Nearly 200 Information Security professionals polled in the spring and summer, ranked SecurID especially highly for its integration and compatibility with existing infrastructure and its ease of use for end-users and its scalability. 
Our long-standing data centric approach to IT security is clearly the right one. Competitors seeing the advantages to this strategy are now trying to cobble their point products into a more cohesive solution. In addition, security professionals are drawing on our expertise in IT security to discuss best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems. 
In the past few months, senior RSA officials have participated in APT Summit in Washington D.C. and London and presented recommendations to Congress. We'll continue to leverage our expertise in this space to help build the blueprint for an evolving threat environments within a rapidly shifting IT landscape. 
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $171 million, flat from Q2. IIG continues to transition its offerings to lighter-weight, content-enabled applications on top of xCP using modern virtualized frameworks. In Q3, we announced Documentum clients for iPad, an app which provides users secure access to information and Documentum and enables them to access share and collaborate on their preferred device. 
VMware revenue grew 32% in the quarter to a record $941 million, driven by the massive shift to more efficient and more agile cloud architectures, for which virtualization is the cornerstone. The popularity of VMware is underscored by the record attendance at VMworld in Las Vegas in August with more than 19,000 customers, partners, press and analysts, and by more than 20,000 registered for VMWorld Europe and the Asia Pacific and Japan V4 events being held this week. VMware continues to differentiate itself in this space with virtualization offerings that are far more developed than any other competitors. By building onto vSphere's capabilities with more robust features in storage, business continuity, virtualized security and edge functions, modern infrastructure management and monitoring, a multi-tenant provisioning resources, VMware continues to enhance its strategic relevance in the data center. 
With our shared vision for offering IT-As-A-Service in cloud environments and ultimately, via hybrid clouds, the evolution of EMC storage, Content Management and security portfolio is increasingly complementary to VMware's feature set. We have already seen in study after study that EMC is the infrastructure provider of choice in virtualized environments, yet another study in August showed us extending our share here even further with 44% of CIOs polled naming EMC as the preferred provider for the virtualized environments. As VMware continues to build out its capabilities, our underlying infrastructure will continue to be second to none for supporting virtualization. 
With VMware's stronger results, the full year minority interest expectation for VMware has increased slightly. Also, as we advised last quarter, it is important to correctly account for the additional dilution from VMware. Our expectation for the combination of the minority interest and VMware dilution for the full year is now approximately $220 million, an important consideration when modeling consolidated EMC EPS for the year. 
The excellent performance of our services organization extended into Q3 as customers continue to look to us to build out their cloud architectures and get the most from the information contained in the infrastructures. A great example of this was a milti-million dollar deal signed in the quarter with a South American telco. As they embark on a multiyear IT transformation to align their fixed and wireless systems, run their business more efficiently and enable more targeted cross-selling across marketing of their products, they engaged us to help drive their cloud, Big Data and security strategy implementation. 
Customers also look to EMC to guide them through projects centered on optimizing cost efficiency such as data center consolidations. This was a case we won the world's largest pharmaceutical companies in Q3, which listed EMC for the consolidation of 10 globally dispersed data centers. This was a strategic win, thanks in part to the high quality of product service engagements which opened the door for even larger opportunities against the incumbent provider, in this case, HP, in the future. 
As our products and services portfolio grows and evolves, so does our go-to-market approach. Our efforts to expand and deepen our channel relationships are paying off for both EMC and for our partners. We've laid a strong foundation with the onboarding of several thousand new channel partners year-to-date and are now directing our efforts towards averaging these incremental routes to markets. 
Our progress was recognized earlier this quarter by Computer Reseller News which named us a winner in their prestigious 2011 ARC awards, and also awarded us a special 2011 Tech Innovator award for VNXe, a channel-only products. We added another channel-only product in the quarter with the Data Domain 160 deduplication storage system for small enterprise data centers in remote offices. The strides we've made with our channel efforts are manifesting our results with our mid-tier product revenues through non-Dell channels growing over 40% in Q3. 
In addition, VCE continues to gain traction with orders up approximately 50% from Q2 as a single converged infrastructure solution that can be up and running on day one. With a single pane of glass for management and a single point of contact for integrated service and support, Vblocks are truly differentiated in the market. The value proposition of Vblocks perhaps even more relevant in uncertain times as our converged infrastructure means faster and easier deployments that requires far few resources of reference architectures. For these reasons, we expect demand for Vblocks to continue its rapid growth. 
Across all business, we will continue to improve our technology portfolio, enhance our relationships with customers via our world-class services and sales forces, and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach will serve us well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as our results in Q3 and for the past several quarters have shown. 
In Q3, total revenue grew 18% to $4.98 billion. We reported strong growth internationally, with revenue from APJ leading the way up 37%, while the EMEA revenue grew 15% from Q3 of 2010. Growth in North America was also strong at 16% where we saw strength in financial services and year-over-year growth in federal. The power of our portfolio is also evidenced in our operating results where our faster growing higher-margin products continue to drive gross margin in the right direction. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 250 basis points over last year's third quarter to 63%, driven by favorable revenue mix shifts and better gross margins across the business. This improvement helps us to continue to show leverage in non-GAAP operating margin which increased to 24% of revenue. 
We are very pleased with the progress we've made here over the last several years through improvements to our mix, improvements to our product and services costs, and efficiencies in our operating structure. And while we remain on the offensive to take advantage of the vast opportunity in cloud and Big Data, we'll do so while spending prudently and investing wisely. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow continues to be very strong. Deferred revenue grew 34% to $5.7 billion, driven by strong bookings and renewals. Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong, with trailing 12 months free cash flow of $3.8 billion, approximately $500 million than non-GAAP net income for the same period. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. We returned $800 million to shareholders in Q3 via the repurchase of EMC stock. We expect to repurchase the balance of the full $2 billion amount that was authorized by the board in August before the end of the year. We now expect our average share count for the full year to be 2.235 billion shares. 
Turning now to the outlook. While Joe will give color on what we're seeing in the macro environment globally, one thing is fairly obvious. Uncertainty about the global macro environment has increased in the past few months. On the other hand, there are some things we are quite certain about. We're focused on the highest priorities in IT spend. Our product portfolio is in the best shape ever. Our go-to-market approach is well defined and our reach is expanding. Our partner ecosystem is getting stronger and our operations are more efficient than ever before. 
We are focused on our a triple play over the long term and the priorities we laid out to gain market share, invest for growth and deliver leverage continue to guide us through the balance of the year. We remain on track to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48. 
In short, our strategy is sound, our investment approach is disciplined and our execution is solid. We expect these qualities, which have driven our success over the past several years, to continue to serve us well as we navigate next year and beyond.

Thank you very much for joining us. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 results. They were hallmarked by impressive top line growth, which undoubtedly produced share gains for us, and leveraged on both the bottom line and in free cash flow. 
The key ingredient to our success was balanced growth, double-digit year-on-year growth across the vast majority of our product and business units; namely, in VMware with its leading virtualization and cloud-aware software; in our Information Storage business; in our Information Protection business; in our Information Security business; and in our information analytics business. 
Additionally, we exhibited this balanced double-digit, year-on-year growth in our global services business and across our major geographies, in the Americas, in EMEA and in APJ. These impressive results are clear indicators that our hybrid cloud computing and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers. They see our products and services as relevant, and they are entrusting us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its significant advantages. I would like to recognize the more than 52,000 people around the world who are members of the EMC and VMware Family and thank them for their innovation, their hard work and for their dedication to our customers' success. 
I would now like to add a little more color as to what we saw and experienced in regard to customer spending trends in information technology in Q3 and then comment on what we expect to see in Q4 and a little bit beyond. For sure, in Q3, we saw that customers were examining their IT purchases with more scrutiny. Customers are looking for, in fact, demanding that their IT -- that their investments in IT yield real productivity gains and help them achieve competitive advantage and/or better intimacy with their customers and constituencies. 
This increased level of scrutiny resulted in our order flows being skewed more towards the end of the quarter. The good news is that we saw a customer interest in cloud computing both private and public to be quite high and growing. Even better news is that EMC and VMware are becoming more relevant as we are being viewed by more and more customers as a strategic partner, as they accelerate their plans and journey to the cloud. 
In Q4, we fully expect this customer spending scrutiny and selectiveness towards IT purchases to continue. The winners will be the IT vendors that can truly help customers produce faster ROIs, the ones that have the strategy, products, services and ecosystem to help customers move to and receive the massive benefits of IT-As-A-Service, and of course, we expect EMC and VMware to remain at the top of this list. 
Within this context, we believe that IT spending in Q4 will represent a meaningful increase over Q3, but perhaps a tick below our normal Q3 to Q4 increase. I know there's a lot of interest in our take on what 2012 might look like, and as always, we will speak in depth about 2012 on our January call. But since this level of interest in next year isn't higher than normal, I thought I would share 3 beliefs we currently hold about 2012. 
First, we expect that there will be growth in global IT spending next year, but this growth rate is likely to be somewhat lower than what we saw and are seeing this year. Second, we are confident that interest in and investment in cloud computing, Big Data and security will remain top IT spending priorities. And third, we expect EMC to continue to gain share on our markets, therefore, growing significantly faster than the IT spending growth average. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

As I mentioned again in my comments, obviously, we are seeing a lot of upgrade potential and upgrade happening from the installed base, but we're also winning a number of new accounts as I mentioned. 
The third point I'd make is, that the channel play with VNX is also very strong, with VNXe close to 1,500 new to EMC customers this year, and as I mentioned, again, the non-Dell channel revenues for the mid-tier in total, the biggest piece is unified, is up 40% year-on-year.

You go down that list, interestingly enough, in public sector, knock on wood, I know others are seeing it, but so far, we're not seeing this public-sector growth slow in the U.S. or in federal government. But we did see some public sector -- a little bit of public-sector slowdown in Europe. 
I had talked about southern Europe, certainly, that's something we continue to watch and how that impacts on the Eurozone. On the commodity front, you read what I read, again, that oil prices are down and most commodity prices are down also. So that doesn't seem to be too potential -- too big of a potential risk right at this point. The banking sector, everybody worries about, it's really interesting. We saw in the U.S. kind of a slow first half, but a resurgence in the second half of this year. In Europe, in some of the Eurozone banks, there was a little bit of softness in Q3, so we'll continue to watch that. So that's a pretty broad brush of what we're seeing. But overall, again, this slip back into prose, I do expect that we will see a budget flush that ends up being a little bit slower than normal."

I mean, we wanted to make it very clear that Isilon, whilst it may have grown up in a kind of more vertically oriented marketplace, is really doing exceptionally well in the horizontal markets, particularly people who just have kind of large scale-out file requirements. And the key is simplicity. What you do with Isilon is you start small and you basically add to the systems and it scales linearly. It has a very high utilization rate as well. So it really is displacing systems well often. Other vendors will have multiple filesystems that will try and do a single job, and there's a lot of load-balancing going on between those filesystems. We can just put one in there that replaces the entire amounts. And all the example I mentioned on the call were examples where we've actually displaced incumbent NAS vendors. And then in the vertical markets, obviously, places like oil and gas, media, where it's becoming a household name, et cetera, still going very, very well. 
I think the message here is that what we've got with Isilon and with VNX and with Data Domain is in each cases we've got a best-of-breed platform, and the best-of-breed platform is providing better utilization, better returns and is not providing a compromise compared to a one-size-fits-all, and that seems to be the solution that's winning in the market right now."

And with VNXe, we expect to get slightly lower than average gross margins in the prior products, so that is -- because we're aiming that at a price penetration point. 
But in total, the gross margins are pretty comparable in terms of the new family to the old family, and that's pretty much how it's being playing out. That's the strategy we talked about in January. And as you've gone through the year, that's what we've seen happening. Obviously, we've got a much more opportunity to sell software and upsell software packages on the VNX. We basically repackaged a lot of our standalone software products into 3 or 4 bundles on the VNX, and that's also being successful. So we're getting higher software attached rates which is also helping gross margins. 
So we think we're very well positioned competitively on VNX and also VNXe, and the margin profile is as we expected. A couple of other things I'd point out as well is that on the VNX, with the higher range models that kind of high end and mid-tier, we're getting over 50% penetration rates on both Flash and FAST, which is really driving the tier storage agenda which is, again, is relatively unique in the market place and is also helping with margins. So the strategy as we played it out in terms of bringing the tiering, bringing the differentiation and having the price point differences is working for us in the margins and holding it well."

I would say given the prevailing economic uncertainty in Europe, that actually sounds a little counterintuitive to me. I would have thought that uncertainty would have heightened over the course of the quarter. So perhaps you can explain what you think happened in September that led to that statement. Is there any risk of pull forward from Q4 into Q3 perhaps you can allude to backlog? And then finally, related to that, if normal seasonality is kind of 12% to 15%, other than spending levels being a tick below normal, what other considerations should we be thinking about in building our models for Q4?"

You talked about the order flow, and what I was -- the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick which usually doesn't happen. But -- so if we didn't have the forecast for the quarter, I'd say, maybe we pulled in but we didn't. I mean, and we don't give backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really was that we had our sites, we had the fearless forecast and we knew where the orders were forecasted, we follow them, and those were the orders we got. So they just came later and we saw our customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels looking at -- levels within the organization looking at and purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to kind of -- signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. 
But also, it's clear to us that customers are going to spend on priority items, and they're not freezing. So you always get this question, how do you -- how does this look to you compared to 2008? And I think it looks vastly different. And again, we're in considerably different shape because if you look at our product portfolio in 2008, since then, we didn't have VMAX, we didn't have VPLEX, we didn't have VNX, we didn't have VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum, we didn't have Data Domain -- or we just got Data Domain in the end of that year. We're on vSphere 3 going to vSphere 4 not vSphere 5. 
So we're -- we as a company are in a lot of situation, and customers, while they're being diligent, still want to get productivity gains and remain competitive. And it's really interesting, you watch the financials in the U.S., it was a little bit slower in the first half of this year and it was -- we watched it closely. But in the second -- in  third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects come, can't be held back any longer, they're spending. So -- and I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe. We saw a little bit of the converse there, some of the Eurozone banks are stronger in the first half than the second half. 
But again, these projects, they have -- everybody's got a worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States and -- so it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one I continue to worry about is public sector as a lot of governments, if I had one systemic where you will be that as governments are really stretched and they got to be. But again, there, we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a little bit more color of what we're seeing. Did I answer -- I don't know if I answered all your points in your question."

And you can -- customers can store a string of information bits, bytes. You can do it in memory. You can do it in Flash technology. There's several different kinds of Flash technology. There's SLC. There's MLC. There's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K Fibre Channel drives. You got 10K  Flash drives. You got huge 3-terabyte going to 4-terabyte SATA drives. 
So depending on where you store the data, you got tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the other tiers that are 1001 in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see with customers is how we used all those technologies. And then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership and again, actually produce drives -- arrays that are smaller, more green, and far, far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing -- what moves the needle most in storage, I would tell you it's that. The storage virtualization is basically used today for how do you move data across different arrays. And we have -- with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings, and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed. And you're going to see a lot more of -- some of that technology even be put into the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position, and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go."

If we broken out our business in the Middle East and other parts of the world, countries in the world where we're quite robust, and it's the big investment we've been doing in these rapidly growing economies and new developing economies, which is paying off. And of course the way those economies are just natively growing. 
If you look at EMC as a lot -- a younger, much younger company, despite being formed in 1979, we really didn't get up on storage until 1991-ish. So our revenues are still -- and, of course, Q3 is probably more U.S. skewed which is 54% of revenues, but kind of in a -- most of the other quarters you'll see our -- we still have 52-ish percent of our revenues in the U.S. So obviously, we have a lot more potential outside the U.S. for our products and services, and we've been focusing on that percentage -- on that potential while still growing the U.S. at very good percentages. So we're very -- so part of it is focused, part of it is the, I think, just the attractiveness of our product line. Part of it is the fact that we have younger and have a lot more growth opportunity relative to our potential outside the U.S., and I think that's why Asia. 
In Europe, as you said, as David said, in constant currency, we grew 12% which we think is pretty good. Clearly, taking share in Europe. And I think in the U.S., without a doubt, we took share.
