Well, it's fair to say we had a great year, capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter orders were up 23%, and revenue increased 24%. I was pleased to see broad-based revenue gains and margin expansion with all segments achieving double-digit revenue growth and higher margins. Furthermore, we saw the continuing improvement in the majority of our end markets, most notably those served by Electronic Technologies, Energy and Material Handling.
Many of the tailwinds that help produce our strong 2010 results are continuing. To name just a few. Knowles continues to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the strong growth in smartphones. As a result of this growth, we expanded capacity for MEMS microphones 20% in 2010. And in 2011, capacity will increase at an even greater rate. Our electronic equipment companies had a very strong year and continue to diversify their end markets. This is best illustrated by DEK's significant penetration in the solar equipment space. Solar products represented 37% of DEK's fourth quarter revenue, and we expect it to continue to grow. Our energy platform continues to benefit from increased recount deployment, rising oil prices and an increase in shale drilling. We see this market remaining robust in 2011.
Businesses within our Material Handling platform are seeing improved industrial production and rising investment in infrastructure projects, which have provided them a much better marketplace. The fourth quarter marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue increases in this platform. A personal objective of mine is our geographic expansion. I was pleased to see our focus on developing economies result in full year growth of 50% for Asia and 52% for Latin America. The fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter our Asian revenue exceeded Europe's revenue. Acquisitions have also been a major focus for us, as we worked on a full pipeline of deals. In 2010, we closed on six add-on acquisitions for a combined purchase price of $105 million. We closed four more deals this month for a total price of $425 million, including Harbison-Fischer.
In December, we announced our intention to acquire the sound solutions business of NXP semiconductors, and we still expect this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. I'm extremely excited with all of our recent acquisitions. As our pipeline rebuilds, we will continue to be acquisitive in our five growth spaces. I am very pleased with our excellent performance in 2010 and our focus on customers, share gains, geographic expansion and productivity. I am convinced we have built a foundation to produce even stronger results in 2011. With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

We'll start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. Earnings per share increased 85% to $1.01. After adjusting for tax benefits of $0.07, EPS",1425,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. We'll start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. Earnings per share increased 85% to $1.01. After adjusting for tax benefits of $0.07, EPS was $0.94, a 71% improvement. Bookings increased 23% over last year to $1.9 billion, and backlog grew 30% to $1.4 billion. Book-to-bill finished solid at 1.03%. Margins increased at all segments on both a quarterly and full year basis. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.3%, up 320 basis points. For the full year, segment margin was a record 16.4%.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $378 million. For the year, we generated $767 million of free cash flow, representing 11% of revenue. We are pleased with this performance given the investments we made to support our growth.
Turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 23%, with acquisitions contributing 2% and FX having a negative impact of 1%. For the full year, organic growth was 20% and growth from acquisitions was 4%. The majority of our full year acquisition growth in 2010 was in Engineered Systems, and was largely related to the Barker acquisition in late 2009. Electronic Technologies led all segments with full year organic growth of 39%, followed by Fluid Management with 25%, Industrial Products and Engineered Systems contributed 14% and 12%, respectively.
Turning to Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, we saw sequential revenue increases at three segments. Electronic Technologies grew sequential revenue 6%, while Fluid Management and Industrial Products increased 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, as expected, the normal seasonal slowdown at Hill PHOENIX resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Engineered Systems of 12%. On a sequential basis, bookings increased 6%, reflecting solid demand at Knowles, Product ID and our Energy and Material Handling businesses.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $485 million and $54 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 30%, respectively. Bookings were $527 million, an increase of 22%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequential bookings were up 16%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.09. Industrial Products operating margin was 11.2%, up 100 basis points from the prior year, but down 140 basis points sequentially due to product mix. With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 39% to $230 million. Earnings increased 153%, driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, Material Handling margins were up 650 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $249 million, an increase of 38% over last year and up 12% sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.08. With respect to our mobile equipment platform, sales were $256 million, an increase of 6% from last year. Earnings of $35 million were down 13%. Margins decreased 280 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle revenue. Sequential bookings increased 20% to $279 million and book-to-bill finished at 1.09.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $548 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 47% to $70 million. Operating margin was 13%, a 280 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting stronger conversion at both platforms. Bookings were $573 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year. On a sequential basis, bookings grew 5%. Book-to-bill ended at 1.05.
With respect to our product identification platform, strong demand in developing economies and new product launches drove good results. Fourth quarter sales were $237 million, an increase of 10% before a negative FX impact of 2%. Year-over-year earnings increased 32%, and margins improved 380 basis points. Book-to-bill was 1.02.
Moving to engineered products. Sales were $311 million, an increase of 23%, with acquisitions accounting for 7% of the growth. Earnings increased 59%, resulting in margin expansion of 240 basis points. Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements, which were partially offset by continued price material to cost spread at SWEP.
Engineered products bookings were $332 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year and were broad-based. Sequential bookings increased 1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07.
Moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 31% to $439 million, while earnings increased 53% to $104 million. Operating margin was 23.6%, a 350 basis point expansion over last year. Bookings were $437 million, an increase of 26% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of one.
With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $244 million, while earnings increased 73%. Margin improved 440 basis points on significantly higher volume, principally driven by an expanding rig count. Quarterly bookings increased 40% to $247 million and grew 16% sequentially, as energy markets continue to be solid. Book-to-bill was 1.01.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $195 million, an increase of 14%. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in international sales. Earnings increased 17%, resulting in a 60 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 13% year-over-year to $191 million, and book-to-bill remains steady at 0.98. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of this platform served markets, including chemical, transportation, retail fueling and life sciences.
Now turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $406 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of the markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year, which with continuing strong sales of electronic assembly equipment, MEMS microphones, and our expanded solar offerings. Sequential revenue increased 6%, exceeding expectations. Earnings were $76 million, a 92% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.8%, a 520 basis point expansion, driven by significantly higher volume at our higher gross margin businesses. Bookings were $390 million, up 28% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 76% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. Book-to-bill was 0.85, representing their normal seasonal pattern. Recent positive news coming from major semiconductor OEMs indicate that 2011 CapEx spending will be up modestly.
Lastly, our communication components companies posted another solid quarter and ended with a strong book-to-bill of 1.05.
Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional information. Going to Slide 10. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense was $26 million, essentially flat with last year. Corporate expense was up $6 million from the prior year, in line with our previous guidance. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter tax rate was 21.4%. This rate was largely impacted by two components totaling $0.07 EPS, a $0.05 benefit from discrete state tax settlements and $0.02 benefit from recent tax legislation.
Now turning to Slide 11. For 2011, we are forecasting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and expect acquisitions to contribute 3%. This includes all 2010 and recently closed acquisitions, the largest being Harbison-Fischer. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 9% to 11%. First, breaking down organic growth by segment. We expect Industrial Products in Engineered Systems to be up 4% to 6%. Fluid Management revenues should increase 7% to 9%, and Electronic Technologies should grow between 9% and 11%. Secondly, with respect to acquisitions. Fluid Management will add an additional 11% to their growth, largely driven by Harbison-Fischer. In total, Fluid Management's revenue will increase 18% to 20% for the full year. Our other three segments will each add about 1% growth to the previously mentioned organic growth rates. Corporate expense and interest expense should be about flat and CapEx should be up versus 2010 to support our growth initiatives. Lastly, we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 29%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume will be the biggest driver of our increase in earnings. Volume product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.40 to $0.58. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.08 to $0.09. Again, this amount does not include sound solutions. Net productivity will again be a significant source of earnings growth. In total, we expect productivity to yield $0.23 to $0.28. In 2011, we'll increase our investment in R&D and sales and marketing activities in support of growth initiatives. These important investments will impact EPS $0.14 to $0.18. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.25, an increase of 17% to 22% over 2010's adjusted EPS of $3.47.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

And as Brad just indicated, we are expecting even stronger results in 2011. Given the size of strategic importance of Harbison-Fische and Sound Solutions,  I'd like to provide a quick recap of each deal. Harbison-Fische is a leading manufacturer of rod pumps used in artificial lift applications in the oil and gas markets. This addition to our energy platform expands our product portfolio and enables us to deliver a more complete rod lift solution to our customers. The transaction also increases our scale and allows us to better penetrate the attractive international oil and gas markets. Harbison-Fische will contribute roughly $160 million to full year revenue and will increase the revenue of our energy platform to roughly $1.2 billion in 2011.
Sound Solutions is a leading manufacturer of speakers and receivers used in cell phones and other wireless devices. By adding the products and capabilities of Sound Solutions, Knowles will become the leading audio supplier in the fast growing mobile handset industry. Sound Solutions 2010 full year revenue was $330 million, and when added to Knowles, will create an industry leader with annual revenue well in excess of $800 million.
Looking forward to 2011, I believe the focus we have on product innovation, geographic expansion, leveraging our scale and disciplined capital allocation has us very well-positioned for the future. A growing economy worldwide, coupled with increased demand for energy, wireless communications in the rising middle class and developing economies should provide significant opportunities for Dover.
In short, I believe the future is quite bright for Dover, and I expect strong results in 2011.
In closing, the results we posted in 2010 do not just happen. It required the concerted efforts of our entire organization. I'd like to personally thank everyone at Dover for their commitment and contributions to a very fine year. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

Are you asking that not likely to be clear, but I wasn't sure of you're talking about sub segment ET or how do you see the ET from a compares and growth rate standpoint playing out in 2011?"

Well, it's fair to say we had a great year capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter orders were up 23%, and revenue increased 24%. I was pleased to see broad-based revenue gains and margin expansion with all segments achieving double-digit revenue growth and higher margins. Furthermore, we saw the continuing improvement in the majority of our end markets, most notably those served by Electronic Technologies, Energy and Material Handling.
Many of the tailwinds that helped produce our strong 2010 results are continuing. To name just a few: Knowles continues to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the strong growth in smartphones. As a result of this growth, we expanded capacity for MEMS microphones 20% in 2010. And in 2011, capacity will increase at an even greater rate. Our electronic equipment companies had a very strong year and continue to diversify their end markets. This is best illustrated by DEK's significant penetration in the solar equipment space. Solar products represented 37% of DEK's fourth quarter revenue, and we expect it to continue to grow. Our Energy platform continues to benefit from increased rig count deployment, rising oil prices and an increase in shale drilling. We see this market remaining robust in 2011.
Businesses within our Material Handling platform are seeing improved industrial production and rising investment in infrastructure projects, which have provided them a much better marketplace. The fourth quarter marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue increases in this platform. A personal objective of mine is our geographic expansion. I was pleased to see our focus on developing economies result in full year growth of 50% for Asia and 52% for Latin America. The fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter our Asian revenue exceeded Europe's revenue. Acquisitions have also been a major focus for us, as we worked on a full pipeline of deals. In 2010, we closed on six add-on acquisitions for a combined purchase price of $105 million. We've closed four more deals this month for a total price of $425 million, including Harbison-Fischer.
In December, we announced our intention to acquire the Sound Solutions business of NXP Semiconductors, and we still expect this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. I'm extremely excited with all of our recent acquisitions. As our pipeline rebuilds, we will continue to be acquisitive in our five growth spaces. I am very pleased with our excellent performance in 2010 and our focus on customers, share gains, geographic expansion and productivity. I am convinced we have built a foundation to produce even stronger results in 2011.
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. Earnings per share increased 85% to $1.01. After adjusting for tax benefits of $0.07, EPS",1422,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. Earnings per share increased 85% to $1.01. After adjusting for tax benefits of $0.07, EPS was $0.94, a 71% improvement. Bookings increased 23% over last year to $1.9 billion, and backlog grew 30% to $1.4 billion. Book-to-bill finished solid at 1.03. Margins increased at all segments on both a quarterly and full year basis. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.3%, up 320 basis points. For the full year, segment margin was a record 16.4%.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $378 million. For the year, we generated $767 million of free cash flow, representing 11% of revenue. We are pleased with this performance given the investments we made to support our growth.
Turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 23%, with acquisitions contributing 2% and FX having a negative impact of 1%. For the full year, organic growth was 20% and growth from acquisitions was 4%. The majority of our full year acquisition growth in 2010 was in Engineered Systems, and was largely related to the Barker acquisition in late 2009. Electronic Technologies led all segments with full year organic growth of 39%, followed by Fluid Management with 25%, Industrial Products and Engineered Systems contributed 14% and 12%, respectively.
Turning to Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, we saw sequential revenue increases at three segments. Electronic Technologies grew sequential revenue 6%, while Fluid Management and Industrial Products increased 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, as expected, the normal seasonal slowdown at Hill PHOENIX resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Engineered Systems of 12%. On a sequential basis, bookings increased 6%, reflecting solid demand at Knowles, Product ID and our Energy and Material Handling businesses.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $485 million and $54 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 30%, respectively. Bookings were $527 million, an increase of 22%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequential bookings were up 16%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.09. Industrial Products' operating margin was 11.2%, up 100 basis points from the prior year, but down 140 basis points sequentially due to product mix. With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 39% to $230 million. Earnings increased 153%, driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, Material Handling margins were up 650 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $249 million, an increase of 38% over last year and up 12% sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.08. With respect to our mobile equipment platform, sales were $256 million, an increase of 6% from last year. Earnings of $35 million were down 13%. Margins decreased 280 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle revenue. Sequential bookings increased 20% to $279 million and book-to-bill finished at 1.09.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $548 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 47% to $70 million. Operating margin was 13%, a 280 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting stronger conversion at both platforms. Bookings were $573 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year. On a sequential basis, bookings grew 5%. Book-to-bill ended at 1.05.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, strong demand in developing economies and new product launches drove good results. Fourth quarter sales were $237 million, an increase of 10% before a negative FX impact of 2%. Year-over-year earnings increased 32%, and margins improved 380 basis points. Book-to-bill was 1.02.
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $311 million, an increase of 23%, with acquisitions accounting for 7% of the growth. Earnings increased 59%, resulting in margin expansion of 240 basis points. Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements, which were partially offset by continued price material cost spread at SWEP.
Engineered Products' bookings were $332 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year and were broad-based. Sequential bookings increased 1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07.
Moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 31% to $439 million, while earnings increased 53% to $104 million. Operating margin was 23.6%, a 350 basis point expansion over last year. Bookings were $437 million, an increase of 26% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $244 million, while earnings increased 73%. Margin improved 440 basis points on significantly higher volume, principally driven by an expanding rig count. Quarterly bookings increased 40% to $247 million and grew 16% sequentially, as energy markets continue to be solid. Book-to-bill was 1.01.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $195 million, an increase of 14%. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in international sales. Earnings increased 17%, resulting in a 60 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 13% year-over-year to $191 million, and book-to-bill remains steady at 0.98. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of this platform's served markets, including chemical, transportation, retail fueling and life sciences.
Now turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies' revenue was $406 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year, with continuing strong sales of electronic assembly equipment, MEMS microphones, and our expanded solar offerings. Sequential revenue increased 6%, exceeding expectations. Earnings were $76 million, a 92% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.8%, a 520 basis point expansion, driven by significantly higher volume at our higher gross margin businesses. Bookings were $390 million, up 28% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 76% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. Book-to-bill was 0.85, representing their normal seasonal pattern. Recent positive news coming from major semiconductor OEMs indicate that 2011 CapEx spending will be up modestly.
Lastly, our Communication Components companies posted another solid quarter and ended with a strong book-to-bill of 1.05.
Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional information. Going to Slide 10. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense was $26 million, essentially flat with last year. Corporate expense was up $6 million from the prior year, in line with our previous guidance. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter tax rate was 21.4%. This rate was largely impacted by two components totaling $0.07 EPS: a $0.05 benefit from discrete state tax settlements and $0.02 benefit from recent tax legislation.
Now turning to Slide 11. For 2011, we are forecasting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and expect acquisitions to contribute 3%. This includes all 2010 and recently closed acquisitions, the largest being Harbison-Fischer. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 9% to 11%.
First, breaking down organic growth by segment. We expect Industrial Products in Engineered Systems to be up 4% to 6%. Fluid Management revenues should increase 7% to 9%, and Electronic Technologies should grow between 9% and 11%. 
Secondly, with respect to acquisitions. Fluid Management will add an additional 11% to their growth, largely driven by Harbison-Fischer. In total, Fluid Management's revenue will increase 18% to 20% for the full year. Our other three segments will each add about 1% growth to the previously-mentioned organic growth rates. Corporate expense and interest expense should be about flat and CapEx should be up versus 2010 to support our growth initiatives. Lastly, we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 29%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume will be the biggest driver of our increase in earnings. Volume product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.40 to $0.58. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.08 to $0.09. Again, this amount does not include Sound Solutions. Net productivity will again be a significant source of earnings growth. In total, we expect productivity to yield $0.23 to $0.28. In 2011, we'll increase our investment in R&D and sales and marketing activities in support of growth initiatives. These important investments will impact EPS $0.14 to $0.18. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.25, an increase of 17% to 22% over 2010's adjusted EPS of $3.47.

And as Brad just indicated, we are expecting even stronger results in 2011. Given the size and strategic importance of Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions,  I'd like to provide a quick recap of each deal. Harbison-Fischer is a leading manufacturer of rod pumps used in artificial lift applications in the oil and gas markets. This addition to our Energy platform expands our product portfolio and enables us to deliver a more complete rod lift solution to our customers. The transaction also increases our scale and allows us to better penetrate the attractive international oil and gas markets. Harbison-Fischer will contribute roughly $160 million to full year revenue and will increase the revenue of our Energy platform to roughly $1.2 billion in 2011.
Sound Solutions is a leading manufacturer of speakers and receivers used in cell phones and other wireless devices. By adding the products and capabilities of Sound Solutions, Knowles will become the leading audio supplier in the fast growing mobile handset industry. Sound Solutions' 2010 full year revenue was $330 million, and when added to Knowles, will create an industry leader with annual revenue well in excess of $800 million.
Looking forward to 2011, I believe the focus we have on product innovation, geographic expansion, leveraging our scale and disciplined capital allocation has us very well-positioned for the future. A growing economy worldwide, coupled with increased demand for energy, wireless communications in the rising middle class and developing economies should provide significant opportunities for Dover.
In short, I believe the future is quite bright for Dover, and I expect strong results in 2011.
In closing, the results we posted in 2010 do not just happen. It required the concerted efforts of our entire organization. I'd like to personally thank everyone at Dover for their commitment and contributions to a very fine year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

Well, it's fair to say we had a great year capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter orders were up 23%, and revenue increased 24%. I was pleased to see broad-based revenue gains and margin expansion with all segments achieving double-digit revenue growth and higher margins. Furthermore, we saw the continuing improvement in the majority of our end markets, most notably those served by Electronic Technologies, Energy and Material Handling.
Many of the tailwinds that helped produce our strong 2010 results are continuing. To name just a few: Knowles continues to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the strong growth in smartphones. As a result of this growth, we expanded capacity for MEMS microphones 20% in 2010. And in 2011, capacity will increase at an even greater rate. Our electronic equipment companies had a very strong year and continue to diversify their end markets. This is best illustrated by DEK's significant penetration in the solar equipment space. Solar products represented 37% of DEK's fourth quarter revenue, and we expect it to continue to grow. Our Energy platform continues to benefit from increased rig count deployment, rising oil prices and an increase in shale drilling. We see this market remaining robust in 2011.
Businesses within our Material Handling platform are seeing improved industrial production and rising investment in infrastructure projects, which have provided them a much better marketplace. The fourth quarter marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue increases in this platform. A personal objective of mine is our geographic expansion. I was pleased to see our focus on developing economies result in full year growth of 50% for Asia and 52% for Latin America. The fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter our Asian revenue exceeded Europe's revenue. Acquisitions have also been a major focus for us, as we worked on a full pipeline of deals. In 2010, we closed on six add-on acquisitions for a combined purchase price of $105 million. We've closed four more deals this month for a total price of $425 million, including Harbison-Fischer.
In December, we announced our intention to acquire the Sound Solutions business of NXP Semiconductors, and we still expect this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. I'm extremely excited with all of our recent acquisitions. As our pipeline rebuilds, we will continue to be acquisitive in our five growth spaces. I am very pleased with our excellent performance in 2010 and our focus on customers, share gains, geographic expansion and productivity. I am convinced we have built a foundation to produce even stronger results in 2011.
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. Earnings per share increased 85% to $1.01. After adjusting for tax benefits of $0.07, EPS",1422,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. Earnings per share increased 85% to $1.01. After adjusting for tax benefits of $0.07, EPS was $0.94, a 71% improvement. Bookings increased 23% over last year to $1.9 billion, and backlog grew 30% to $1.4 billion. Book-to-bill finished solid at 1.03. Margins increased at all segments on both a quarterly and full year basis. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.3%, up 320 basis points. For the full year, segment margin was a record 16.4%.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $378 million. For the year, we generated $767 million of free cash flow, representing 11% of revenue. We are pleased with this performance given the investments we made to support our growth.
Turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 23%, with acquisitions contributing 2% and FX having a negative impact of 1%. For the full year, organic growth was 20% and growth from acquisitions was 4%. The majority of our full year acquisition growth in 2010 was in Engineered Systems, and was largely related to the Barker acquisition in late 2009. Electronic Technologies led all segments with full year organic growth of 39%, followed by Fluid Management with 25%, Industrial Products and Engineered Systems contributed 14% and 12%, respectively.
Turning to Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, we saw sequential revenue increases at three segments. Electronic Technologies grew sequential revenue 6%, while Fluid Management and Industrial Products increased 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, as expected, the normal seasonal slowdown at Hill PHOENIX resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Engineered Systems of 12%. On a sequential basis, bookings increased 6%, reflecting solid demand at Knowles, Product ID and our Energy and Material Handling businesses.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $485 million and $54 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 30%, respectively. Bookings were $527 million, an increase of 22%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequential bookings were up 16%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.09. Industrial Products' operating margin was 11.2%, up 100 basis points from the prior year, but down 140 basis points sequentially due to product mix. With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 39% to $230 million. Earnings increased 153%, driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, Material Handling margins were up 650 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $249 million, an increase of 38% over last year and up 12% sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.08. With respect to our mobile equipment platform, sales were $256 million, an increase of 6% from last year. Earnings of $35 million were down 13%. Margins decreased 280 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle revenue. Sequential bookings increased 20% to $279 million and book-to-bill finished at 1.09.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $548 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 47% to $70 million. Operating margin was 13%, a 280 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting stronger conversion at both platforms. Bookings were $573 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year. On a sequential basis, bookings grew 5%. Book-to-bill ended at 1.05.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, strong demand in developing economies and new product launches drove good results. Fourth quarter sales were $237 million, an increase of 10% before a negative FX impact of 2%. Year-over-year earnings increased 32%, and margins improved 380 basis points. Book-to-bill was 1.02.
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $311 million, an increase of 23%, with acquisitions accounting for 7% of the growth. Earnings increased 59%, resulting in margin expansion of 240 basis points. Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements, which were partially offset by continued price material cost spread at SWEP.
Engineered Products' bookings were $332 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year and were broad-based. Sequential bookings increased 1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07.
Moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 31% to $439 million, while earnings increased 53% to $104 million. Operating margin was 23.6%, a 350 basis point expansion over last year. Bookings were $437 million, an increase of 26% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $244 million, while earnings increased 73%. Margin improved 440 basis points on significantly higher volume, principally driven by an expanding rig count. Quarterly bookings increased 40% to $247 million and grew 16% sequentially, as energy markets continue to be solid. Book-to-bill was 1.01.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $195 million, an increase of 14%. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in international sales. Earnings increased 17%, resulting in a 60 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 13% year-over-year to $191 million, and book-to-bill remains steady at 0.98. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of this platform's served markets, including chemical, transportation, retail fueling and life sciences.
Now turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies' revenue was $406 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year, with continuing strong sales of electronic assembly equipment, MEMS microphones, and our expanded solar offerings. Sequential revenue increased 6%, exceeding expectations. Earnings were $76 million, a 92% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.8%, a 520 basis point expansion, driven by significantly higher volume at our higher gross margin businesses. Bookings were $390 million, up 28% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 76% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. Book-to-bill was 0.85, representing their normal seasonal pattern. Recent positive news coming from major semiconductor OEMs indicate that 2011 CapEx spending will be up modestly.
Lastly, our Communication Components companies posted another solid quarter and ended with a strong book-to-bill of 1.05.
Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional information. Going to Slide 10. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense was $26 million, essentially flat with last year. Corporate expense was up $6 million from the prior year, in line with our previous guidance. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter tax rate was 21.4%. This rate was largely impacted by two components totaling $0.07 EPS: a $0.05 benefit from discrete state tax settlements and $0.02 benefit from recent tax legislation.
Now turning to Slide 11. For 2011, we are forecasting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and expect acquisitions to contribute 3%. This includes all 2010 and recently closed acquisitions, the largest being Harbison-Fischer. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 9% to 11%.
First, breaking down organic growth by segment. We expect Industrial Products in Engineered Systems to be up 4% to 6%. Fluid Management revenues should increase 7% to 9%, and Electronic Technologies should grow between 9% and 11%. 
Secondly, with respect to acquisitions. Fluid Management will add an additional 11% to their growth, largely driven by Harbison-Fischer. In total, Fluid Management's revenue will increase 18% to 20% for the full year. Our other three segments will each add about 1% growth to the previously-mentioned organic growth rates. Corporate expense and interest expense should be about flat and CapEx should be up versus 2010 to support our growth initiatives. Lastly, we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 29%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume will be the biggest driver of our increase in earnings. Volume product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.40 to $0.58. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.08 to $0.09. Again, this amount does not include Sound Solutions. Net productivity will again be a significant source of earnings growth. In total, we expect productivity to yield $0.23 to $0.28. In 2011, we'll increase our investment in R&D and sales and marketing activities in support of growth initiatives. These important investments will impact EPS $0.14 to $0.18. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.25, an increase of 17% to 22% over 2010's adjusted EPS of $3.47.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

And as Brad just indicated, we are expecting even stronger results in 2011. Given the size and strategic importance of Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions, I'd like to provide a quick recap of each deal. Harbison-Fischer is a leading manufacturer of rod pumps used in artificial lift applications in the oil and gas markets. This addition to our Energy platform expands our product portfolio and enables us to deliver a more complete rod lift solution to our customers. The transaction also increases our scale and allows us to better penetrate the attractive international oil and gas markets. Harbison-Fischer will contribute roughly $160 million to full-year revenue and will increase the revenue of our Energy platform to roughly $1.2 billion in 2011.
Sound Solutions is a leading manufacturer of speakers and receivers used in cell phones and other wireless devices. By adding the products and capabilities of Sound Solutions, Knowles will become the leading audio supplier in the fast growing mobile handset industry. Sound Solutions' 2010 full year revenue was $330 million, and when added to Knowles, will create an industry leader with annual revenue well in excess of $800 million.
Looking forward to 2011, I believe the focus we have on product innovation, geographic expansion, leveraging our scale and disciplined capital allocation has us very well-positioned for the future. A growing economy worldwide, coupled with increased demand for energy, wireless communications in the rising middle class and developing economies should provide significant opportunities for Dover.
In short, I believe the future is quite bright for Dover, and I expect strong results in 2011.
In closing, the results we posted in 2010 do not just happen. It required the concerted efforts of our entire organization. I'd like to personally thank everyone at Dover for their commitment and contributions to a very fine year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011, as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trends in mobile handsets, cellular equipment, the oil and gas market and global industrial production. These trends are reflected in our strong first quarter results and give me the confidence to increase our full year expectations.
All segments achieved double-digit revenue growth and higher margins, absent deal costs. For the first quarter, orders were up 27% and revenue, 24%. Our first quarter order rates of $2.2 billion were at record level for Dover. As we discussed last quarter, we are making deliberate decisions to invest for growth. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to dedicate significant time and resources on international growth initiatives and product innovation. In the first quarter, our incremental investments in engineering and sales and marketing, especially in emerging economies, are driving emerging market growth. First quarter revenue derived from Asia and Latin America was 20% of Dover's total with a collective growth rate of 38%. We believe this trend is sustainable over the midterm.
As we did in China in 2009, we are now putting the necessary infrastructure in place in Brazil and India to ensure we are well-positioned to fully participate in these key growth markets. While still relatively small, our first quarter growth rate was 28% in Brazil and 38% in India.
Acquisition activity continued in the first quarter, as we closed on four deals for a combined purchase price of $425 million. In particular, I could not be more pleased with results thus far of Harbison-Fischer, the largest of these acquisitions. Customer feedback has been quite positive with respect to our combined offerings in artificial milk. The integration is proceeding at a pace faster than originally anticipated, and we are seeing early success in our efforts to expand into international markets.
As you recall, in December, we announced the signing of the agreement to acquire Sound Solutions. We originally expected this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. We are diligently working through the regulatory approval process, which is taking longer than originally thought. As a result, we don't expect this deal to close before the mid of the second quarter.
In addition, our acquisition pipeline is rebuilding nicely, a result of internal initiatives and an active M&A environment. I am confident we'll announce additional deals in 2011.
Before I turn it over to Brad, let me say I am extremely pleased with the start to our year. We continue to deliver strong financial performance while keeping our eye on our longer-term objectives."
174901,129090377,116536,"Dover Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% i",1734,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% improvement. Taking the margin for the quarter was 15.6%, up 60 basis points. Margins increased at all segments, absent one-time deal costs.
Bookings increased 27% over last year to $2.2 billion, and were broad-based with virtually all companies showing year-over-year improvement. This increase was aided by some accelerated bookings related to energy and military customers. Book-to-bill finished at a very strong 1.15. Backlog grew 37% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $80 million. We remain confident that our full year free cash flow generation will be in the range of 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. First quarter organic revenue growth was 19%, with acquisitions contributing 4% and FX adding 1%. Organic revenue growth was double-digit at all segments. Electronic Technologies increased 27%, Industrial Products and Fluid Management both posted organic growth of 20%, while Engineered Systems grew 14%.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 14% of their total growth of 34%.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. For the quarter, Fluid Management grew sequential revenues 16%, driven by robust energy markets, while Industrial Products and Engineered Systems increased 7% and 2%, respectively. As expected, the normal seasonality of the global Electronics market resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Electronic Technologies of 8%. Bookings increased 17% over the fourth quarter 2010, reflecting solid demand. We are seeing particular strength in Industrial Products, energy, Fluid Solutions and engineered products, including the normal seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX. Industrial Products and energy strong bookings were driven in part by some accelerated orders from military and energy-related products.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $519 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 21% and 26%, respectively. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gains. Industrial Product's operating margin was 12.4%, up 50 basis points from the prior year, as benefits from volume increases in productivity were partially offset by product mix and incremental investment in product and business development activities. Bookings were $625 million, an increase of 44%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.21. This growth was influenced by pricing actions, a significant military order and strong activity in our companies that serve the downstream energy market.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 34% to $253 million, while earnings increased 45%. Strong results continue to be driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, material handling's margins were up 130 basis points, reflecting volume increases and improving productivity. For the quarter, bookings were $289 million, an increase of 41%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.14.
With respect to our mobile equipment platforms, sales were $267 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings of $38 million were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle sales. Book-to-bill finished at 1.26, as we continue to see significant orders for our crude oil and tribal trailers.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $560 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 23% to $67 million. Operating margin was 12%, a 70 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting volume leverage, partially offset by material cost escalation. Bookings were $633 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
With respect to our product identification platform, first quarter sales were $226 million, an increase of 7%, which included a 2% gain from FX. Year-over-year earnings increased only 5%, as margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to new product costs and increases in investment in emerging markets. Revenue was also impacted by some softness in the U.S., although China and Latin America saw growth rates of 11% and 34%, respectively. Bookings increased 6% to $233 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.03.
Moving to Engineered Products. The strong results for this platform are broad-based, as each company reported improved revenue and earnings. Sales were $334 million, an increase of 23%. Earnings increased 46%, resulting in margin expansion of 190 basis points. This favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume and productivity improvements. We experienced some material cost escalations in the quarter, and pricing actions are underway to narrow the price cost spread.  Engineered Products bookings were $400 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.20.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, first quarter sales earnings and bookings were all time highs. Revenue increased 34% to $509 million, while earnings increased 31% to $114 million. Acquisitions accounted for 13% of the growth. Operating margin was 22.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points from last year. Margin was impacted by acquisition costs of approximately $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, segment margin was 23.4%, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $304 million, while earnings increased 45% on rising North American rig counts and our recent acquisitions. We continue to see strong drilling activity. Margins remained very strong but decreased 70 basis points due to acquisition costs. Quarterly bookings increased 70% to $355 million, with about 1/3 of the bookings growth coming from acquisitions. Bookings ended at 1.17, as energy markets continued to be extremely strong.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $206 million, an increase of 17%. We continue to see broad-based growth across many end markets, including chemical, food and beverage and transportation. Our emerging market initiatives are gaining traction, contributing 33% growth in China. Earnings increased 22%, resulting in an 80 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 22% year-over-year to $218 million, and the book-to-bill remained solid at 1.06.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $373 million, an increase of 28%. We continue to see strong sales of electronic assembly and test equipment, MEMS microphones and solar products. Our company serving the telecom markets had more modest results, due to softer telecom CapEx spending. Earnings increased to $60 million, a 33% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 16%, a 60 basis point expansion. Bookings were $420 million, up 17% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 62% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. In particular, DEK solar products have been quite successful, resulting in several new customer wins. In total, solar products drove half of the revenue growth in electronic assembly and test. Book-to-bill was 1.22, representing a normal seasonal upswing and strength in solar bookings.
Lastly, our communication component companies posted another solid quarter in revenue, as strength at Knowles, particularly in MEMS, was partially offset by telecom CapEx softness at Vectron and CMP. Communication components exit the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.05.
Going to Slide 10. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued new long-term debt totaling $800 million in February. The proceeds were used to fund maturing notes and acquisitions in the quarter. As a result of the incremental new debt, first quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year. Full year interest expense is now expected to be up approximately $10 million from our prior forecast. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $36 million, in line with our expectations for the quarter.
With respect to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 23.9%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.04 EPS benefit from discrete state tax settlement and a more favorable mix of non-U.S. earnings. Adjusting for the discrete tax benefit, the first quarter rate would have been 27.2%. Going forward, our strong growth outside of the U.S. is now expected to reduce our full year rate to 27% to 28% or one point lower than our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given the strong first quarter bookings, we are now forecasting organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and expect completed acquisitions to contribute around 3%. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 12% to 14%. Breaking down the organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems revenue should increase one point from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 6% to 8%. Electronic technology's revenue should increase two points from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 11% to 13%. Fluid Management's revenue should increase three points from our prior forecast for a new range of 10% to 12%. This increase is driven by broad-based improvements in our end markets. Lastly, Industrial Products should increase of five points from our prior forecast to be in the range of 8% to 10%. This significant increase is largely driven by strong infrastructure in energy markets.
With respect to acquisition growth, Industrial Products and Electronic Technologies should add around 1% on top of their organic growth range. Fluid Management's acquisition growth should be an additional 12%, largely driven by their acquisition of Harbison-Fischer. So in total, Fluid Management's revenue should increase 22% to 24%. Corporate expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance. As mentioned, interest expense will be up due to our recent debt issuance, and we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.57 to $0.71, with volume being the largest driver. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.10 to $0.11, up $0.02 from our previous guidance. As discussed last quarter, investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20. Interest expense will be $0.03 higher than previously forecasted. Lastly, our reduced full year tax rate due to the strength of our international earnings should positively impact EPS $0.05.
In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.45. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

There could be, depending on how we want to label a customer or the project, there could be a little bit of activity in the first quarter that we would label as accelerated. How much? Okay, maybe $75 million or $80 million. We did have a one-time military order in the first quarter. I think it was $20 million or $25 million range. It will not repeat again this year. And we had some energy-related bookings, both within Industrial Products, as well as in our energy platform that I would label as more of annual or project type of buys that don't fall into what I call a quarterly drumbeat. So you need to layer that in when you look at the $2.2 billion. That said, and I'm not try to take anything at all away from the first quarter outstanding bookings.

To give you a little bit more color, we still are forecasting, and this is in our guidance, we are still forecasting about a 5.5% to 6% growth for the year for Hill PHOENIX year-over-year. So when you take the year's forecast and look at our performance in the first quarter, Jeff, I will tell you that we're probably going to see a little bit different waterfall on the revenue split this year versus what we saw last year. We are seeing the first half probably being 10% to 12% revenue growth, with the second half being essentially flat. It has a lot to do -- it has all to do which is project timing both this year and last year. Just timing differences. But the business is performing quite well. Order rates were up, I don't know, 5% or 6% in the first quarter versus a year ago. We happen to like the profile of our order rates. We had some pretty strong business in the first quarter with our systems business, which is always a good indicator that the case business will follow in a few weeks. We're going to see that normal seasonal patterns and the data that we've seen, the industry data that we seen for the first quarter, I think we took a little bit of orchid share on keys business in the first quarter. I do know, that's my color on Hill PHOENIX."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011 as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trend",457,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011 as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trends in mobile handsets, solar equipment, the oil and gas market and global industrial production. These trends are reflected in our strong first quarter results and give me the confidence to increase our full year expectations.
All segments achieved double-digit revenue growth and higher margins, absent deal cost. For the first quarter, orders were up 27% and revenue, 24%. Our first quarter order rates of $2.2 billion were at record level for Dover. As we discussed last quarter, we are making deliberate decisions to invest for growth. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to dedicate significant time and resources on international growth initiatives and product innovation. 
In the first quarter, our incremental investments in engineering and sales and marketing, especially in emerging economies, are driving emerging market growth. First quarter revenue derived from Asia and Latin America was 20% of Dover's total with a collective growth rate of 38%. We believe this trend is sustainable over the midterm.
As we did in China in 2009, we are now putting the necessary infrastructure in place in Brazil and India to ensure we are well positioned to fully participate in these key growth markets. While still relatively small, our first quarter growth rate was 28% in Brazil and 38% in India.
Acquisition activity continued in the first quarter as we closed on four deals for a combined purchase price of $425 million. In particular, I could not be more pleased with results thus far of Harbison-Fischer, the largest of these acquisitions. Customer feedback has been quite positive with respect to our combined offerings in artificial lift. The integration is proceeding at a pace faster than originally anticipated, and we are seeing early success in our efforts to expand into international markets.
As you recall, in December, we announced the signing of the agreement to acquire Sound Solutions. We originally expected this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. We are diligently working through the regulatory approval process, which is taking longer than originally thought. As a result, we don't expect this deal to close before the mid of the second quarter.
In addition, our acquisition pipeline is rebuilding nicely, a result of internal initiatives and an active M&A environment. I am confident we'll announce additional deals in 2011.
Before I turn it over to Brad, let me say I am extremely pleased with the start to our year. We continue to deliver strong financial performance while keeping our eye on our longer-term objectives."

Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% i",1731,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% improvement. Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, up 60 basis points. Margins increased at all segments, absent onetime deal costs.
Bookings increased 27% over last year to $2.2 billion and were broad-based with virtually all companies showing year-over-year improvement. This increase was aided by some accelerated bookings related to energy and military customers. Book-to-bill finished at a very strong 1.15. Backlog grew 37% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $80 million. We remain confident that our full year free cash flow generation will be in the range of 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. First quarter organic revenue growth was 19%, with acquisitions contributing 4% and FX adding 1%. Organic revenue growth was double-digit at all segments. Electronic Technologies increased 27%. Industrial Products and Fluid Management both posted organic growth of 20%, while Engineered Systems grew 14%. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 14% of their total growth of 34%.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. For the quarter, Fluid Management grew sequential revenues 16%, driven by robust energy markets, while Industrial Products and Engineered Systems increased 7% and 2%, respectively. As expected, the normal seasonality of the global electronics market resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Electronic Technologies of 8%. Bookings increased 17% over the fourth quarter 2010, reflecting solid demand. We are seeing particular strength in Industrial Products, Energy, Fluid Solution and Engineered Products, including the normal seasonal ramp-up at Hill PHOENIX. Industrial Products and Energy's strong bookings were driven in part by some accelerated orders from military and energy-related products.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $519 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 21% and 26%, respectively. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gains. Industrial Product's operating margin was 12.4%, up 50 basis points from the prior year, as benefits from volume increases and productivity were partially offset by product mix and incremental investment in product and business development activities. Bookings were $625 million, an increase of 44%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.21. This growth was influenced by pricing actions, a significant military order and strong activity in our companies that serve the downstream energy market.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 34% to $253 million, while earnings increased 45%. Strong results continue to be driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, Material Handling's margins were up 130 basis points, reflecting volume increases and improving productivity. 
For the quarter, bookings were $289 million, an increase of 41%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.14.
With respect to our mobile equipment platforms, sales were $267 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings of $38 million were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle sales. Book-to-bill finished at 1.26, as we continue to see significant orders for our crude oil and dry bulk trailers.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $560 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 23% to $67 million. Operating margin was 12%, a 70 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting volume leverage, partially offset by material cost escalation. Bookings were $633 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, first quarter sales were $226 million, an increase of 7%, which included a 2% gain from FX. Year-over-year earnings increased only 5%, as margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to new product costs and increases in investment in emerging markets. Revenue was also impacted by some softness in the U.S., although China and Latin America saw growth rates of 11% and 34%, respectively. Bookings increased 6% to $233 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.03.
Moving to Engineered Products. The strong results for this platform are broad-based, as each company reported improved revenue and earnings. Sales were $334 million, an increase of 23%. Earnings increased 46%, resulting in margin expansion of 190 basis points. This favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume and productivity improvements. We experienced some material cost escalations in the quarter, and pricing actions are underway to narrow the price cost spread.  Engineered Products bookings were $400 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.20.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, first quarter sales earnings and bookings were all-time highs. Revenue increased 34% to $509 million, while earnings increased 31% to $114 million. Acquisitions accounted for 13% of the growth. Operating margin was 22.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points from last year. Margin was impacted by acquisition costs of approximately $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, segment margin was 23.4%, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $304 million, while earnings increased 45% on rising North American rig counts and our recent acquisitions. We continue to see strong drilling activity. Margins remained very strong but decreased 70 basis points due to acquisition costs. Quarterly bookings increased 70% to $355 million, with about 1/3 of the bookings growth coming from acquisitions. Bookings ended at 1.17, as energy markets continued to be extremely strong.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $206 million, an increase of 17%. We continue to see broad-based growth across many end markets, including chemical, food and beverage and transportation. Our emerging market initiatives are gaining traction, contributing 33% growth in China. Earnings increased 22%, resulting in an 80 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 22% year-over-year to $218 million, and the book-to-bill remained solid at 1.06.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $373 million, an increase of 28%. We continue to see strong sales of electronic assembly and test equipment, MEMS microphones and solar products. Our company serving the telecom markets had more modest results, due to softer telecom CapEx spending. Earnings increased to $60 million, a 33% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 16%, a 60 basis point expansion. Bookings were $420 million, up 17% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 62% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. In particular, DEK solar products have been quite successful, resulting in several new customer wins. In total, solar products drove half of the revenue growth in electronic assembly and test. Book-to-bill was 1.22, representing a normal seasonal upswing and strength in solar bookings.
Lastly, our communication component companies posted another solid quarter in revenue, as strength at Knowles, particularly MEMS, was partially offset by telecom CapEx softness at Vectron and CMP. Communication components exited the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.05.
Going to Slide 10. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued new long-term debt totaling $800 million in February. The proceeds were used to fund maturing notes and acquisitions in the quarter. As a result of the incremental new debt, first quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year. Full year interest expense is now expected to be up approximately $10 million from our prior forecast. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $36 million, in line with our expectations for the quarter.
With respect to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 23.9%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.04 EPS benefit from discrete state tax settlement and a more favorable mix of non-U.S. earnings. Adjusting for the discrete tax benefit, the first quarter rate would have been 27.2%. Going forward, our strong growth outside the U.S. is now expected to reduce our full year rate to 27% to 28%, or one point lower than our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given the strong first quarter bookings, we are now forecasting organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and expect the completed acquisitions to contribute around 3%. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 12% to 14%. 
Breaking down the organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems revenue should increase one point from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 6% to 8%. Electronic Technologies' revenue should increase two points from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 11% to 13%. Fluid Management's revenue should increase three points from our prior forecast for a new range of 10% to 12%. This increase is driven by broad-based improvements in their end markets. Lastly, Industrial Products should increase of five points from our prior forecast to be in the range of 8% to 10%. This significant increase is largely driven by strong infrastructure in energy markets.
With respect to acquisition growth, Industrial Products and Electronic Technologies should add around 1% on top of their organic growth range. Fluid Management's acquisition growth should be an additional 12%, largely driven by their acquisition of Harbison-Fischer. So in total, Fluid Management's revenue should increase 22% to 24%. Corporate expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance. As mentioned, interest expense will be up due to our recent debt issuance, and we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.57 to $0.71, with volume being the largest driver. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.10 to $0.11, up $0.02 from our previous guidance. As discussed last quarter, investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20. Interest expense will be $0.03 higher than previously forecasted. Lastly, our reduced full year tax rate, due to the strength of our international earnings, should positively impact EPS $0.05.
In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.45. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

It's mostly around some specialty bearings and some electronic assemblies, all of which were -- we've got workarounds with other suppliers or with second source suppliers. I don't believe it has had an impact on any of our customer service activity to date. It is something that we're watching, not just with our direct suppliers, but as you point out, with our customer's suppliers. And as of yet, we are not seeing any pushback from supply disruptions from Japan."

That said, our year-over-year revenue growth for Product ID was only 7%. I think it was 5% organic after stripping out FX. It is lower than it should be.

We're committed to do this. I think this is a great business that we have. I am very, very interested and committed to this business. And I think even part of the margin pressure we saw in the first quarter was a deliberate decision we made to significantly increase some of our business development and sales and marketing expenses in this business, especially in emerging economies.

It wasn't one specific segment or area of the business. It was across the board. Now to give you a little bit of color. There could be, depending upon how we want to label a customer or the project, there could be a little bit of activity in the first quarter that we would label as accelerated. How much? Okay, maybe $75 million or $80 million. We did have a one-time military order in the first quarter. I think it was $20 million or $25 million range. It will not repeat again this year. And we had some energy-related bookings, both within Industrial Products as well as in our energy platform, that I would label as more of annual or project type of buys that don't fall into what I call a quarterly drumbeat. So you need to layer that in when you look at the $2.2 billion. That said, and I'm not try to take anything at all away from the first quarter outstanding bookings. That said, what we saw in the first quarter continued strength in energy, continued strength in Electronics, continued strength in Engineered Products. And then we saw the kick in, in the first quarter that we started to see in the second half of last year of our mid-to-late cycle businesses. And Nigel, it's very, very evident when you look at Industrial Products. And I think that is the big difference in the first quarter.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011 as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trend",457,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011 as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trends in mobile handsets, solar equipment, the oil and gas market and global industrial production. These trends are reflected in our strong first quarter results and give me the confidence to increase our full year expectations.
All segments achieved double-digit revenue growth and higher margins, absent deal cost. For the first quarter, orders were up 27% and revenue, 24%. Our first quarter order rates of $2.2 billion were at record level for Dover. As we discussed last quarter, we are making deliberate decisions to invest for growth. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to dedicate significant time and resources on international growth initiatives and product innovation. 
In the first quarter, our incremental investments in engineering and sales and marketing, especially in emerging economies, are driving emerging market growth. First quarter revenue derived from Asia and Latin America was 20% of Dover's total with a collective growth rate of 38%. We believe this trend is sustainable over the midterm.
As we did in China in 2009, we are now putting the necessary infrastructure in place in Brazil and India to ensure we are well positioned to fully participate in these key growth markets. While still relatively small, our first quarter growth rate was 28% in Brazil and 38% in India.
Acquisition activity continued in the first quarter as we closed on four deals for a combined purchase price of $425 million. In particular, I could not be more pleased with results thus far of Harbison-Fischer, the largest of these acquisitions. Customer feedback has been quite positive with respect to our combined offerings in artificial lift. The integration is proceeding at a pace faster than originally anticipated, and we are seeing early success in our efforts to expand into international markets.
As you recall, in December, we announced the signing of the agreement to acquire Sound Solutions. We originally expected this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. We are diligently working through the regulatory approval process, which is taking longer than originally thought. As a result, we don't expect this deal to close before the mid of the second quarter.
In addition, our acquisition pipeline is rebuilding nicely, a result of internal initiatives and an active M&A environment. I am confident we'll announce additional deals in 2011.
Before I turn it over to Brad, let me say I am extremely pleased with the start to our year. We continue to deliver strong financial performance while keeping our eye on our longer-term objectives."
174901,129090377,116735,"Dover Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% i",1730,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% improvement. Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, up 60 basis points. Margins increased at all segments, absent onetime deal costs.
Bookings increased 27% over last year to $2.2 billion and were broad-based with virtually all companies showing year-over-year improvement. This increase was aided by some accelerated bookings related to energy and military customers. Book-to-bill finished at a very strong 1.15. Backlog grew 37% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $80 million. We remain confident that our full year free cash flow generation will be in the range of 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. First quarter organic revenue growth was 19%, with acquisitions contributing 4% and FX adding 1%. Organic revenue growth was double-digit at all segments. Electronic Technologies increased 27%. Industrial Products and Fluid Management both posted organic growth of 20%, while Engineered Systems grew 14%. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 14% of their total growth of 34%.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. For the quarter, Fluid Management grew sequential revenues 16%, driven by robust energy markets, while Industrial Products and Engineered Systems increased 7% and 2%, respectively. As expected, the normal seasonality of the global electronics market resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Electronic Technologies of 8%. Bookings increased 17% over the fourth quarter 2010, reflecting solid demand. We are seeing particular strength in Industrial Products, Energy, Fluid Solution and Engineered Products, including the normal seasonal ramp-up at Hill PHOENIX. Industrial Products and Energy's strong bookings were driven in part by some accelerated orders from military and energy-related products.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $519 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 21% and 26%, respectively. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gains. Industrial Product's operating margin was 12.4%, up 50 basis points from the prior year, as benefits from volume increases and productivity were partially offset by product mix and incremental investment in product and business development activities. Bookings were $625 million, an increase of 44%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.21. This growth was influenced by pricing actions, a significant military order and strong activity in our companies that serve the downstream energy market.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 34% to $253 million, while earnings increased 45%. Strong results continue to be driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, Material Handling's margins were up 130 basis points, reflecting volume increases and improving productivity. 
For the quarter, bookings were $289 million, an increase of 41%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.14.
With respect to our mobile equipment platforms, sales were $267 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings of $38 million were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle sales. Book-to-bill finished at 1.26, as we continue to see significant orders for our crude oil and dry bulk trailers.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $560 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 23% to $67 million. Operating margin was 12%, a 70 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting volume leverage, partially offset by material cost escalation. Bookings were $633 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, first quarter sales were $226 million, an increase of 7%, which included a 2% gain from FX. Year-over-year earnings increased only 5%, as margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to new product costs and increases in investment in emerging markets. Revenue was also impacted by some softness in the U.S., although China and Latin America saw growth rates of 11% and 34%, respectively. Bookings increased 6% to $233 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.03.
Moving to Engineered Products. The strong results for this platform are broad-based, as each company reported improved revenue and earnings. Sales were $334 million, an increase of 23%. Earnings increased 46%, resulting in margin expansion of 190 basis points. This favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume and productivity improvements. We experienced some material cost escalations in the quarter, and pricing actions are underway to narrow the price cost spread.  Engineered Products bookings were $400 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.20.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, first quarter sales earnings and bookings were all-time highs. Revenue increased 34% to $509 million, while earnings increased 31% to $114 million. Acquisitions accounted for 13% of the growth. Operating margin was 22.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points from last year. Margin was impacted by acquisition costs of approximately $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, segment margin was 23.4%, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $304 million, while earnings increased 45% on rising North American rig counts and our recent acquisitions. We continue to see strong drilling activity. Margins remained very strong but decreased 70 basis points due to acquisition costs. Quarterly bookings increased 70% to $355 million, with about 1/3 of the bookings growth coming from acquisitions. Bookings ended at 1.17, as energy markets continued to be extremely strong.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $206 million, an increase of 17%. We continue to see broad-based growth across many end markets, including chemical, food and beverage and transportation. Our emerging market initiatives are gaining traction, contributing 33% growth in China. Earnings increased 22%, resulting in an 80 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 22% year-over-year to $218 million, and the book-to-bill remained solid at 1.06.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $373 million, an increase of 28%. We continue to see strong sales of electronic assembly and test equipment, MEMS microphones and solar products. Our company serving the telecom markets had more modest results, due to softer telecom CapEx spending. Earnings increased to $60 million, a 33% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 16%, a 60 basis point expansion. Bookings were $420 million, up 17% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 62% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. In particular, DEK solar products have been quite successful, resulting in several new customer wins. In total, solar products drove half of the revenue growth in electronic assembly and test. Book-to-bill was 1.22, representing a normal seasonal upswing and strength in solar bookings.
Lastly, our communication component companies posted another solid quarter in revenue, as strength at Knowles, particularly MEMS, was partially offset by telecom CapEx softness at Vectron and CMP. Communication components exited the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.05.
Going to Slide 10. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued new long-term debt totaling $800 million in February. The proceeds were used to fund maturing notes and acquisitions in the quarter. As a result of the incremental new debt, first quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year. Full year interest expense is now expected to be up approximately $10 million from our prior forecast. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $36 million, in line with our expectations for the quarter.
With respect to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 23.9%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.04 EPS benefit from discrete state tax settlements and a more favorable mix of non-U.S. earnings. Adjusting for the discrete tax benefit, the first quarter rate would have been 27.2%. Going forward, our strong growth outside the U.S. is now expected to reduce our full year rate to 27% to 28%, or one point lower than our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given the strong first quarter bookings, we are now forecasting organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and expect completed acquisitions to contribute around 3%. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 12% to 14%. 
Breaking down the organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems revenue should increase one point from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 6% to 8%. Electronic Technologies' revenue should increase two points from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 11% to 13%. Fluid Management's revenue should increase 3 points from our prior forecast for a new range of 10% to 12%. This increase is driven by broad-based improvements in their end markets. Lastly, Industrial Products should increase of 5 points from our prior forecast to be in the range of 8% to 10%. This significant increase is largely driven by strong infrastructure in energy markets.
With respect to acquisition growth, Industrial Products and Electronic Technologies should add around 1% on top of their organic growth range. Fluid Management's acquisition growth should be an additional 12%, largely driven by their acquisition of Harbison-Fischer. So in total, Fluid Management's revenue should increase 22% to 24%. Corporate expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance. As mentioned, interest expense will be up due to our recent debt issuance, and we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.57 to $0.71, with volume being the largest driver. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.10 to $0.11, up $0.02 from our previous guidance. As discussed last quarter, investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20. Interest expense will be $0.03 higher than previously forecasted. Lastly, our reduced full year tax rate, due to the strength of our international earnings, should positively impact EPS $0.05.
In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.45. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

And I think our concerns at that time were probably, or not probably, were much higher than they are today. The impact is rather modest. It's mostly around some specialty bearings and some electronic assemblies, all of which were -- we've got workarounds with other suppliers or with second source suppliers. I don't believe it has had an impact on any of our customer service activity to date.

Maybe you were being kind there to try to offer me an out on the first quarter performance, and I'm not going to take it. I think I commented on this on the January call that I, not just myself, we're a bit disappointed with -- I would label it as being a few quarters late with some of our new product development launches, And I am pleased that we actually started shipping our new products around the middle of the first quarter, and we're quite pleased with the uptake in those products that we saw in late February and especially the order intake in the month of March. That said, our year-over-year revenue growth for Product ID was only 7%. I think it was 5% organic after stripping out FX. It is lower than it should be. And I think we have a challenge in front of us over the next 2 or 3 quarters to reverse a little bit of what we've been struggling with for the last 3 or 4 quarters. We're committed to do this. I think this is a great business that we have. I am very, very interested and committed to this business. And I think even part of the margin pressure we saw in the first quarter was a deliberate decision we made to significantly increase some of our business development and sales and marketing expenses in this business, especially in emerging economies. Now with respect to your M&A, my answer is yes. Yes, we think there are still some opportunities. I will call it tightly connected to our current marking and coding businesses, both direct coding as well as bar-coding. But I also believe there are some adjacent spaces that would fit well with what we do and what we'd like to do, and we're looking."

That said, I'm also going to tell you, it built during the quarter. The month of March was stronger than February. February was a little bit stronger than January. We saw it across-the-board. It wasn't one specific segment or area of the business. It was across the board. Now to give you a little bit of color. There could be, depending upon how we want to label a customer or the project, there could be a little bit of activity in the first quarter that we would label as accelerated. How much? Okay, maybe $75 million or $80 million. We did have a one-time military order in the first quarter. I think it was $20 million or $25 million range. It will not repeat again this year. And we had some energy-related bookings, both within Industrial Products as well as in our energy platform, that I would label as more of annual or project type of buys that don't fall into what I call a quarterly drumbeat. So you need to layer that in when you look at the $2.2 billion. That said, and I'm not trying to take anything at all away from the first quarter outstanding bookings. That said, what we saw in the first quarter continued strength in energy, continued strength in Electronics, continued strength in Engineered Products. And then we saw the kick in, in the first quarter that we started to see in the second half of last year of our mid-to-late cycle businesses. And Nigel, it's very, very evident when you look at Industrial Products. And I think that is the big difference in the first quarter. You just cannot ignore, you just can't ignore the impact on the mid-and-late cycle businesses, predominantly those businesses are within Industrial Products."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011 as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trend",457,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Dover had an excellent start to 2011 as the momentum that was evident last year continued to build in the first quarter. We continue to see strong trends in mobile handsets, solar equipment, the oil and gas market and global industrial production. These trends are reflected in our strong first quarter results and give me the confidence to increase our full year expectations.
All segments achieved double-digit revenue growth and higher margins, absent deal cost. For the first quarter, orders were up 27% and revenue, 24%. Our first quarter order rates of $2.2 billion were at record level for Dover. As we discussed last quarter, we are making deliberate decisions to invest for growth. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to dedicate significant time and resources on international growth initiatives and product innovation. 
In the first quarter, our incremental investments in engineering and sales and marketing, especially in emerging economies, are driving emerging market growth. First quarter revenue derived from Asia and Latin America was 20% of Dover's total with a collective growth rate of 38%. We believe this trend is sustainable over the midterm.
As we did in China in 2009, we are now putting the necessary infrastructure in place in Brazil and India to ensure we are well positioned to fully participate in these key growth markets. While still relatively small, our first quarter growth rate was 28% in Brazil and 38% in India.
Acquisition activity continued in the first quarter as we closed on four deals for a combined purchase price of $425 million. In particular, I could not be more pleased with results thus far of Harbison-Fischer, the largest of these acquisitions. Customer feedback has been quite positive with respect to our combined offerings in artificial lift. The integration is proceeding at a pace faster than originally anticipated, and we are seeing early success in our efforts to expand into international markets.
As you recall, in December, we announced the signing of the agreement to acquire Sound Solutions. We originally expected this acquisition to close around the end of the first quarter. We are diligently working through the regulatory approval process, which is taking longer than originally thought. As a result, we don't expect this deal to close before the mid of the second quarter.
In addition, our acquisition pipeline is rebuilding nicely, a result of internal initiatives and an active M&A environment. I am confident we'll announce additional deals in 2011.
Before I turn it over to Brad, let me say I am extremely pleased with the start to our year. We continue to deliver strong financial performance while keeping our eye on our longer-term objectives."
174901,129090377,116820,"Dover Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% i",1730,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 24%. Earnings per share increased 48% to $0.96. After adjusting for discrete tax benefit, EPS was $0.92, a 42% improvement. Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, up 60 basis points. Margins increased at all segments, absent onetime deal costs.
Bookings increased 27% over last year to $2.2 billion and were broad-based with virtually all companies showing year-over-year improvement. This increase was aided by some accelerated bookings related to energy and military customers. Book-to-bill finished at a very strong 1.15. Backlog grew 37% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $80 million. We remain confident that our full year free cash flow generation will be in the range of 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. First quarter organic revenue growth was 19%, with acquisitions contributing 4% and FX adding 1%. Organic revenue growth was double-digit at all segments. Electronic Technologies increased 27%. Industrial Products and Fluid Management both posted organic growth of 20%, while Engineered Systems grew 14%. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 14% of their total growth of 34%.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. For the quarter, Fluid Management grew sequential revenues 16%, driven by robust energy markets, while Industrial Products and Engineered Systems increased 7% and 2%, respectively. As expected, the normal seasonality of the global electronics market resulted in a sequential revenue decline at Electronic Technologies of 8%. Bookings increased 17% over the fourth quarter 2010, reflecting solid demand. We are seeing particular strength in Industrial Products, Energy, Fluid Solution and Engineered Products, including the normal seasonal ramp-up at Hill PHOENIX. Industrial Products and Energy's strong bookings were driven in part by some accelerated orders from military and energy-related products.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $519 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 21% and 26%, respectively. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gains. Industrial Product's operating margin was 12.4%, up 50 basis points from the prior year, as benefits from volume increases and productivity were partially offset by product mix and incremental investment in product and business development activities. Bookings were $625 million, an increase of 44%, resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.21. This growth was influenced by pricing actions, a significant military order and strong activity in our companies that serve the downstream energy market.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 34% to $253 million, while earnings increased 45%. Strong results continue to be driven by increased activity across most end markets, including infrastructure and energy. In total, Material Handling's margins were up 130 basis points, reflecting volume increases and improving productivity. 
For the quarter, bookings were $289 million, an increase of 41%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.14.
With respect to our mobile equipment platforms, sales were $267 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings of $38 million were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix on lower defense and refuse vehicle sales. Book-to-bill finished at 1.26, as we continue to see significant orders for our crude oil and dry bulk trailers.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $560 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and segment earnings increased 23% to $67 million. Operating margin was 12%, a 70 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting volume leverage, partially offset by material cost escalation. Bookings were $633 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, first quarter sales were $226 million, an increase of 7%, which included a 2% gain from FX. Year-over-year earnings increased only 5%, as margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to new product costs and increases in investment in emerging markets. Revenue was also impacted by some softness in the U.S., although China and Latin America saw growth rates of 11% and 34%, respectively. Bookings increased 6% to $233 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.03.
Moving to Engineered Products. The strong results for this platform are broad-based, as each company reported improved revenue and earnings. Sales were $334 million, an increase of 23%. Earnings increased 46%, resulting in margin expansion of 190 basis points. This favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume and productivity improvements. We experienced some material cost escalations in the quarter, and pricing actions are underway to narrow the price cost spread.  Engineered Products bookings were $400 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.20.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, first quarter sales earnings and bookings were all-time highs. Revenue increased 34% to $509 million, while earnings increased 31% to $114 million. Acquisitions accounted for 13% of the growth. Operating margin was 22.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points from last year. Margin was impacted by acquisition costs of approximately $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, segment margin was 23.4%, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 48% to $304 million, while earnings increased 45% on rising North American rig counts and our recent acquisitions. We continue to see strong drilling activity. Margins remained very strong but decreased 70 basis points due to acquisition costs. Quarterly bookings increased 70% to $355 million, with about 1/3 of the bookings growth coming from acquisitions. Bookings ended at 1.17, as energy markets continued to be extremely strong.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $206 million, an increase of 17%. We continue to see broad-based growth across many end markets, including chemical, food and beverage and transportation. Our emerging market initiatives are gaining traction, contributing 33% growth in China. Earnings increased 22%, resulting in an 80 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 22% year-over-year to $218 million, and the book-to-bill remained solid at 1.06.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $373 million, an increase of 28%. We continue to see strong sales of electronic assembly and test equipment, MEMS microphones and solar products. Our company serving the telecom markets had more modest results, due to softer telecom CapEx spending. Earnings increased to $60 million, a 33% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 16%, a 60 basis point expansion. Bookings were $420 million, up 17% over last year. Book-to-bill ended at 1.13.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 62% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. In particular, DEK solar products have been quite successful, resulting in several new customer wins. In total, solar products drove half of the revenue growth in electronic assembly and test. Book-to-bill was 1.22, representing a normal seasonal upswing and strength in solar bookings.
Lastly, our communication component companies posted another solid quarter in revenue, as strength at Knowles, particularly MEMS, was partially offset by telecom CapEx softness at Vectron and CMP. Communication components exited the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.05.
Going to Slide 10. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued new long-term debt totaling $800 million in February. The proceeds were used to fund maturing notes and acquisitions in the quarter. As a result of the incremental new debt, first quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year. Full year interest expense is now expected to be up approximately $10 million from our prior forecast. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $36 million, in line with our expectations for the quarter.
With respect to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 23.9%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.04 EPS benefit from discrete state tax settlements and a more favorable mix of non-U.S. earnings. Adjusting for the discrete tax benefit, the first quarter rate would have been 27.2%. Going forward, our strong growth outside the U.S. is now expected to reduce our full year rate to 27% to 28%, or one point lower than our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given the strong first quarter bookings, we are now forecasting organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and expect completed acquisitions to contribute around 3%. Therefore, our total revenue growth is expected to be 12% to 14%. 
Breaking down the organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems revenue should increase one point from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 6% to 8%. Electronic Technologies' revenue should increase two points from our prior forecast and now be in the range of 11% to 13%. Fluid Management's revenue should increase 3 points from our prior forecast for a new range of 10% to 12%. This increase is driven by broad-based improvements in their end markets. Lastly, Industrial Products should increase of 5 points from our prior forecast to be in the range of 8% to 10%. This significant increase is largely driven by strong infrastructure in energy markets.
With respect to acquisition growth, Industrial Products and Electronic Technologies should add around 1% on top of their organic growth range. Fluid Management's acquisition growth should be an additional 12%, largely driven by their acquisition of Harbison-Fischer. So in total, Fluid Management's revenue should increase 22% to 24%. Corporate expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance. As mentioned, interest expense will be up due to our recent debt issuance, and we expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.57 to $0.71, with volume being the largest driver. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.10 to $0.11, up $0.02 from our previous guidance. As discussed last quarter, investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20. Interest expense will be $0.03 higher than previously forecasted. Lastly, our reduced full year tax rate, due to the strength of our international earnings, should positively impact EPS $0.05.
In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.45. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

This did receive a fair amount of attention around Dover and our businesses after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. And I think our concerns at that time were probably, or not probably, were much higher than they are today. The impact is rather modest. It's mostly around some specialty bearings and some electronic assemblies, all of which were -- we've got workarounds with other suppliers or with second source suppliers. I don't believe it has had an impact on any of our customer service activity to date.

That said, I'm also going to tell you, it built during the quarter. The month of March was stronger than February. February was a little bit stronger than January. We saw it across-the-board. It wasn't one specific segment or area of the business. It was across the board. Now to give you a little bit of color. There could be, depending upon how we want to label a customer or the project, there could be a little bit of activity in the first quarter that we would label as accelerated. How much? Okay, maybe $75 million or $80 million. We did have a one-time military order in the first quarter. I think it was $20 million or $25 million range. It will not repeat again this year. And we had some energy-related bookings, both within Industrial Products as well as in our energy platform, that I would label as more of annual or project type of buys that don't fall into what I call a quarterly drumbeat. So you need to layer that in when you look at the $2.2 billion. That said, and I'm not trying to take anything at all away from the first quarter outstanding bookings. That said, what we saw in the first quarter continued strength in energy, continued strength in Electronics, continued strength in Engineered Products. And then we saw the kick in, in the first quarter that we started to see in the second half of last year of our mid-to-late cycle businesses. And Nigel, it's very, very evident when you look at Industrial Products. And I think that is the big difference in the first quarter. You just cannot ignore, you just can't ignore the impact on the mid-and-late cycle businesses, predominantly those businesses are within Industrial Products."

We are seeing the first half probably being 10% to 12% revenue growth with the second half being essentially flat. It has a lot to do -- it has all to do with just project timing both this year and last year. Just in timing differences. But the business is performing quite well.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am very pleased with our second quarter performance. Following a strong first quarter, we again saw growth in both revenue and earnings and a strong b",533,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am very pleased with our second quarter performance. Following a strong first quarter, we again saw growth in both revenue and earnings and a strong book-to-bill of 1.03. The strength in our orders was broad-based and was largely driven by continuing strength in the Energy and Fluid Solutions markets, mobile handsets and global industrial production. These strong trends are continuing into the second half of the year along with moderating trends and grocery retail remodeling and solar equipment. 
All segments achieved double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Segment margin hit 17.4%, an all-time high for Dover. Orders were up 15% and revenue increased 21%. This solid performance enabled Dover to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.19.
I continue to feel positive about our businesses, and as a result, we are increasing full year revenue growth and earnings guidance. We also continue to invest for growth. In addition to our Sound Solutions acquisition, which I'll discuss later, we're investing in international growth initiatives, product innovation and additional capacity where appropriate. These investments are clearly paying off. 
In the second quarter, revenue from China and Latin America increased 43% and 61%, respectively. We continue to make inroads into emerging economies, and I expect our penetration to increase over time, further supported by our newly expanded regional headquarter capabilities in Brazil and India. 
I mentioned capacity investments. These additions are in process at many of our operations in China, including a new shared manufacturing facility in Suzhou and expansion of our electronics campus in Shenzhen. In addition, we have recently added MEMS production to our Knowles facility in Malaysia. Domestically, we have put more capacity into U.S. synthetics, and we are expanding the Knowles R&D facility. These projects all have significant strategic value and will help drive future growth.
While we were focused on growth, we continue to look for opportunities to take out cost and streamline our businesses. In fact, we worked on several selective minor restructurings and integrations in the second quarter. In early July, we announced the completion of our Sound Solutions acquisition. This is a key addition for Dover and enables us to serve the fast-growing handset market even better. We now become a more significant supplier to our customers as we leverage technology and scale. Our postmerger integration team is already fully engaged, and I have the highest confidence they will create substantial value for their customers and for Dover.
Our pipeline has matured and developed nicely, and I believe we will complete additional deals before the end of the year. Our focus continues to be on our 5 growth spaces and opportunities that provide synergies with existing businesses. 
In summary, let me say I am very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year. We serve several end markets where growth continues to flourish especially in the markets served by Energy and Fluid Solutions, handset markets and in developing economies. We will continue to deliver strong financial performance, while keeping a close eye on cost and market developments. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,137168007,144704,"Dover Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2011",2011-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 21%. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.31. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.19, a 3",1933,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 21%. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.31. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.19, a 31% improvement. Segment margin for the quarter was 17.4%, up 50 basis points over the prior year. Margin performance was led by Fluid Management and Electronic Technology. 
Bookings increased 15% over last year to $2.2 billion and were broad-based with continued strength in Energy, Industrial Products and Fluid Solutions. Book-to-bill finished at a solid 1.03. Backlog grew 28% to $1.8 billion. 
In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $136 million or 6.3% of revenue, impacted by the timing of CapEx investment and tax payments. We remained on target for full year cash flow generation to be 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. Second quarter revenue growth of 21% was comprised of 14% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions and 3% FX. Organic revenue growth was strong at all segments, with Industrial Products leading the way at 20%. Electronic Technologies and Fluid Management posted organic growth of 17% and 16%, respectively, while Engineered Systems grew 8%. 
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management where acquisitions contributed 14% of their growth.
Now turning to Slide 5. Total revenue increased 10% over the first quarter. Engineered Systems grew sequential revenue 15%, driven by the normal seasonality of the retailer refrigeration market. Electronic Technologies grew 11% from the seasonally slower first quarter. Industrial Products and Fluid Management increased 9% and 5%, respectively. Bookings declined 2% from the first quarter of 2011. Of note, bookings were down 6% at Electronic Technologies and were heavily influenced by weaker solid equipment orders in the second quarter.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $566 million and $73 million of earnings, an increase of 23% and 19%, respectively. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gain. Industrial Products operating margin was 12.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix, the continued incremental investment in product and business development activities and onetime gains on the sale of facilities in the second quarter of 2010.
Bookings were $628 million, an increase of 23% resulting in a solid book-to-bill of 1.11. This growth was influenced by strong downstream Energy orders and steady growth in our infrastructure-related businesses. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 29% to $277 million, while earnings increased 22%. Strong top line results continue to be driven by increased activity of cost of the majority of end markets, including Energy and infrastructure. In total, Material Handling's margins declined 90 basis points, largely reflecting the onetime gain in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusting for this gain, second quarter margin would have increased 70 basis points.
For the quarter, bookings were $293 million, an increase of 31%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.06. With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $291 million, an increase of 17%. Earnings were up 15%. Margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix and production ramp-up costs. Bookings increased 16% to $336 million and book-to-bill finished at 1.16.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $646 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and earnings increased 11% to $94 million. These results were all-time records. Operating margin was 14.6%, essentially flat with last year, reflecting strong volume leverage in Engineered Products, offset by Product ID. Bookings were $640 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, second quarter sales were $239 million, an increase of 9%, which included 6% FX. Year-over-year earnings were flat. Margins decreased 150 basis points, primarily due to new product launch costs early in the quarter and increased sales activities. Bookings increased 7% to $239 million resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Bookings improved sequentially through the quarter, and we continue to see significant opportunities in front of Product ID as we focus on product development and sales and marketing activities.
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $407 million, an increase of 14% and earnings increased 24%, resulting in margin expansion of 140 basis points. This favorable margin performance was driven by volume gains and improvements in material price cost spread, especially at SWEP. Engineered Products bookings were $401 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.99. 
As previously mentioned, we anticipate weaker market conditions for Hill PHOENIX for the remainder of the year, primarily the result of softer remodel activity for most food retailers. However, we expect Hill PHOENIX's strong position will enable them to continue to outpace their markets.
Moving to Slide 8. Fluid Management produced another tremendous quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $535 million, while earnings increased 37% to $131 million. Acquisitions accounted for 14% of the growth. Operating margin was 24.6%, an 80 basis point improvement from last year. This positive margin performance was largely driven by volume gains. Bookings were $555 million, an increase of 33% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.04. We expect this segment's strong performance to continue.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 49% to $321 million, while earnings increased 50% on rising U.S. rig counts, stable Energy prices and our recent acquisitions. Margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to see strong fundamentals in our served markets. Quarterly bookings increased 48% to $336 million with roughly 1/3 of growth coming from acquisitions. Book-to-bill ended at 1.05.
Now moving to Fluid Solutions. Revenue in this platform increased 14% to $240 million and earnings improved 12%. Margins declined 40 basis points driven by onetime costs associated with selective integration and restructuring activities. We continue to see broad-based growth driven by strength in many of our served markets, including petrochemical and energy and our expansion efforts in emerging markets. Bookings increased 14% year-over-year to $219 million, and book-to-bill remains solid at 1.02.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $412 million, an increase of 19%. This result was driven by strong solar sales and solid results for electronic assembly and test equipment and MEMS microphones. Our company is serving the telecom markets continue to post more modest results. Earnings increased to $77 million, a 29% improvement over last year. Operating margin was very strong at 18.6%, 140 basis point expansion, reflecting good leverage on volume. Bookings were $394 million, essentially flat with last year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.95, reflecting a significant drop in demand for solar products, greatly influenced by the lack of clarity on European solar subsidies. We expect this trend will likely to continue in the near term. Adjusting for solar apartment revenue and orders, book-to-bill would have been 1.06.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 39% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. Growth was across all businesses with solar being the biggest driver of revenue growth and margin expansion. 
Lastly, our communication performance companies' revenue increased 7% on strength and Knowles particularly MEMS. We expect favorable performance at Knowles to continue.
Going to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year and in line with our expectations. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $35 million and also in line with our expectations. 
With respect to taxes, our second quarter tax rate was 20.2%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.12 EPS benefit from discrete federal tax settlements. Adjusting for this benefit, the second quarter rate would have been 27.4%. We now expect the full year normalized effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given our strong second quarter and the addition of Sound Solutions, we are now forecasting full year revenue growth of 18% to 20%, an increase of 6 percentage points from our prior forecast. Organic growth increases 3 points to 12% to 14%, while acquisition growth including Sound Solutions, is expected to contribute 6%. 
Breaking down organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems will be in the range of 7% to 9%, up 1 percentage point. Electronic Technologies will be in the range of 12% to 14%, also, an increase of 1 point.
Fluid Management's revenue growth is now forecasted to be in the range of 14% to 16%, up 4 percentage points. This significant increase is driven by broad-based growth in our end markets. 
Lastly, Industrial Products is now forecasted to be in the range of 12% to 14%, also an increase of 4 points. This increase represents stronger-than-anticipated first half revenue and the continued recovery in mid and late cycle businesses within this segment. 
Now with regard to acquisition growth. Fluid Management should increase 13%, largely driven by Harbison-Fischer. In total, Fluid Management's revenue will increase 27% to 29%.
Electronic Technologies acquisitions, primarily Knowles Sound Solutions, will add 14 points on top of their already strong organic growth for full year growth of 26% to 28%. 
Lastly, Industrial Products acquisitions should add around 1%. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance, and as mentioned, we expect a slightly lower full year normalized tax rate.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.67 to $0.76. This reflects an improvement from our previous guidance, primarily reflecting strong organic growth. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.06 to $0.07, down $0.04 from the midpoint of our previous guidance, driven by the Sound Solutions acquisition. Investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20, and interest expense will have a $0.03 impact.
Lastly, our normalized tax rate and discrete tax benefits will add a total of $0.23. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.60. 
In summary, we have increased guidance $0.17 from the previous midpoint. Breaking this down, $0.12 is from a discrete tax benefit and $0.02 from a lower tax rate. Sound Solutions will be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive while improved performance add $0.07 to our revised guidance.
Before I turn it back to Bob, I want to briefly review the performance of Sound Solutions in 2011 and our expectations for 2012 on Slide 13. In 2011, we anticipate revenue of $190 million to $200 million. While second half revenue in total is consistent with our prior expectations, revenue will accelerate from the third to fourth quarter as we significantly ramp up new customers and products. This ramp is principally connected to Nokia market share losses and significant business increases with other customers. We expect Knowles Sound Solutions to be at $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive in 2011, reflecting changes in customer mix, ramp-up costs for new customers and the timing of onetime acquisition-related expenses. Of course, this estimate is subject to finalization of purchase accounting. The bulk of these acquisition expenses and ramp-up costs will be recognized in the third quarter, largely driving dilution of $0.06 to $0.08. In the fourth quarter, we expect this acquisition to be approximately $0.03 accretive.
Now with regard to 2012. We anticipate Knowles Sound Solutions will generate full year revenue of $400 million to $410 million and be $0.18 to $0.22 accretive. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

We entered the second half of the year facing at few uncertainties in the macro environment. That said, Dover will continue to achieve meaningful growth, with second half revenue up 17% including 9% organic. Product innovation and geographic expansion activities, our increasing penetration in the energy and handset markets and our mid and late cycle businesses especially Fluid Solutions, will give us many opportunities for growth. I am confident Dover will continue to win in its markets. 
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the buying award received by our U.S. synthetics team. They recently won the Shingle Award, a very prestigious recognition of operational excellence. U.S. synthetics' achievement is a significant tribute to their employees, and it also reflects the Dover-wide emphasis on lean practices and operational excellence. 
As always, I want to thank our employees, customers and suppliers around the world. Our strong results are a testament to their tireless efforts and support.

I want to step back and give you a little bit of color here on what we're seeing at Sound Solutions, and I'm sure this has been widely published and discussed in some of the business journals. But as this business entered the third quarter, we clearly are dealing with customer transition issues. They're centered around Nokia. If you look back at 2010, Nokia probably represented about 65% of Sound Solutions business as Nokia has suffered over the last couple of quarters with market share loss and. As we have pretty quickly transitioned to bringing new customers on, as we entered the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, our expectation for 2012, now this is the transition over a 2-year period, but our expectation for 2012 is that our business with Nokia actually may only represent about 35% to 40% of our total. The bulk of this transition to new customers is actually taking place here in the second half of this year. So if you get on some of the ramp-up cost and end customer conversion cost that we're going to eat mostly here in the third quarter a little bit of it flowing into the fourth quarter and you look at 2012 as a steady run rate, the EBITDA target that we shared with you folks about 6 or 8 months ago on the initial call, high 20s, we fully expect to have Sound Solutions at that high 20 EBITDA rate in the second half of next year. How early in the first half is going to depend upon some of the customer transitions that we make over the next couple of quarters. With respect to Knowles, I don't think you should model continuing margin expansion at Knowles. You may see a little bit of noise and from quarter-to-quarter but that's going to be depend on what mix and customer mix, but this business operates at quite high operating margins per day. And I would tell you that our focus here for the next couple of years is not to expand the margins but to expand the market."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am very pleased with our second quarter performance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am very pleased with our second quarter performance. Following a strong first quarter, we again saw growth in both revenue and earnings and a strong book-to-bill of 1.03. The strength in our orders was broad-based and was largely driven by continuing strength in the Energy and Fluid Solutions markets, mobile handsets and global industrial production. These strong trends are continuing into the second half of the year, along with moderating trends and grocery retail remodeling and solar equipment. 
All segments achieved double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Segment margin hit 17.4%, an all-time high for Dover. Orders were up 15% and revenue increased 21%. This solid performance enabled Dover to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.19.
I continue to feel positive about our businesses, and as a result, we are increasing full year revenue growth and earnings guidance. We also continue to invest for growth. In addition to our Sound Solutions acquisition, which I'll discuss later, we're investing in international growth initiatives, product innovation and additional capacity, where appropriate. These investments are clearly paying off. 
In the second quarter, revenue from China and Latin America increased 43% and 61%, respectively. We continue to make inroads into emerging economies, and I expect our penetration to increase over time, further supported by our newly expanded regional headquarter capabilities in Brazil and India. 
I mentioned capacity investments. These additions are in process at many of our operations in China, including a new shared manufacturing facility in Suzhou and expansion of our electronics campus in Shenzhen. In addition, we have recently added MEMS production to our Knowles facility in Malaysia. Domestically, we have put more capacity into U.S. synthetics, and we are expanding the Knowles R&D facility. These projects all have significant strategic value and will help drive future growth.
While we were focused on growth, we continue to look for opportunities to take out cost and streamline our businesses. In fact, we worked on several selective minor restructurings and integrations in the second quarter. In early July, we announced the completion of our Sound Solutions acquisition. This is a key addition for Dover and enables us to serve the fast-growing handset market even better. We now become a more significant supplier to our customers as we leverage technology and scale. Our postmerger integration team is already fully engaged, and I have the highest confidence they will create substantial value for their customers and for Dover.
Our pipeline has matured and developed nicely, and I believe we will complete additional deals before the end of the year. Our focus continues to be on our 5 growth spaces and opportunities that provide synergies with existing businesses. 
In summary, let me say I am very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year. We serve several end markets where growth continues to flourish, especially in the markets served by Energy and Fluid Solutions, handset markets and in developing economies. We will continue to deliver strong financial performance, while keeping a close eye on cost and market developments. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,137168007,144871,"Dover Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2011",2011-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 21%. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.31. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.19, a 3",1937,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 21%. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.31. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.19, a 31% improvement. Segment margin for the quarter was 17.4%, up 50 basis points over the prior year. Margin performance was led by Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. 
Bookings increased 15% over last year to $2.2 billion and were broad-based with continued strength in Energy, Industrial Products and Fluid Solutions. Book-to-bill finished at a solid 1.03. Backlog grew 28% to $1.8 billion. 
In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $136 million or 6.3% of revenue, impacted by the timing of CapEx investment and tax payments. We remained on target for full year cash flow generation to be 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. Second quarter revenue growth of 21% was comprised of 14% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions and 3% FX. Organic revenue growth was strong at all segments, with Industrial Products leading the way at 20%. Electronic Technologies and Fluid Management posted organic growth of 17% and 16%, respectively, while Engineered Systems grew 8%. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 14% of their growth.
Now turning to Slide 5. Total revenue increased 10% over the first quarter. Engineered Systems grew sequential revenue of 15%, driven by the normal seasonality of the retail refrigeration market. Electronic Technologies grew 11% from the seasonally slower first quarter. Industrial Products and Fluid Management increased 9% and 5%, respectively. Bookings declined 2% from the first quarter of 2011. Of note, bookings were down 6% at Electronic Technologies and were heavily influenced by weaker solid equipment orders in the second quarter.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $566 million and $73 million of earnings, an increase of 23% and 19%, respectively. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gain. Industrial Products operating margin was 12.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix, the continued incremental investment in product and business development activities and onetime gains on the sale of facilities in the second quarter of 2010.
Bookings were $628 million, an increase of 23%, resulting in a solid book-to-bill of 1.11. This growth was influenced by strong downstream Energy orders and steady growth in our infrastructure-related businesses. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 29% to $277 million while earnings increased 22%. Strong top line results continue to be driven by increased activity of cost of the majority of end markets, including Energy and infrastructure. In total, Material Handling's margins declined 90 basis points, largely reflecting the onetime gain in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusting for this gain, second quarter margin would have increased 70 basis points.
For the quarter, bookings were $293 million, an increase of 31%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.06. With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $291 million, an increase of 17%. Earnings were up 15%. Margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix and production ramp-up costs. Bookings increased 16% to $336 million and book-to-bill finished at 1.16.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $646 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year, and earnings increased 11% to $94 million. These results were all-time records. Operating margin was 14.6%, essentially flat with last year, reflecting strong volume leverage in Engineered Products, offset by Product ID. Bookings were $640 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, second quarter sales were $239 million, an increase of 9%, which included 6% FX. Year-over-year earnings were flat. Margins decreased 150 basis points, primarily due to new product launch costs early in the quarter and increased sales activities. Bookings increased 7% to $239 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Bookings improved sequentially through the quarter, and we continue to see significant opportunities in front of Product ID as we focus on product development and sales and marketing activities.
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $407 million, an increase of 14%, and earnings increased 24%, resulting in margin expansion of 140 basis points. This favorable margin performance was driven by volume gains and improvements in material price cost spread, especially at SWEP. Engineered Products bookings were $401 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.99. 
As previously mentioned, we anticipate weaker market conditions for Hill PHOENIX for the remainder of the year, primarily the result of softer remodel activity for most food retailers. However, we expect Hill PHOENIX's strong position will enable them to continue to outpace their markets.
Moving to Slide 8. Fluid Management produced another tremendous quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $535 million, while earnings increased 37% to $131 million. Acquisitions accounted for 14% of the growth. Operating margin was 24.6%, an 80 basis point improvement from last year. This positive margin performance was largely driven by volume gains. Bookings were $555 million, an increase of 33% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.04. We expect this segment's strong performance to continue.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 49% to $321 million, while earnings increased 50% on rising U.S. rig counts, stable Energy prices and our recent acquisitions. Margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to see strong fundamentals in our served markets. Quarterly bookings increased 48% to $336 million, with roughly 1/3 of growth coming from acquisitions. Book-to-bill ended at 1.05.
Now moving to Fluid Solutions. Revenue in this platform increased 14% to $214 million, and earnings improved 12%. Margins declined 40 basis points, driven by onetime costs associated with selective integration and restructuring activities. We continue to see broad-based growth driven by strength in many of our served markets, including petrochemical and energy and our expansion efforts in emerging markets. Bookings increased 14% year-over-year to $219 million, and book-to-bill remains solid at 1.02.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $412 million, an increase of 19%. This result was driven by strong solar sales and solid results for electronic assembly and test equipment and MEMS microphones. Our companies serving the telecom markets continue to post more modest results. Earnings increased to $77 million, a 29% improvement over last year. Operating margin was very strong at 18.6%, 140 basis point expansion, reflecting good leverage on volume. Bookings were $394 million, essentially flat with last year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.95, reflecting a significant drop in demand for solar products, greatly influenced by the lack of clarity on European solar subsidies. We expect this trend will likely to continue in the near term. Adjusting for solar apartment revenue and orders, book-to-bill would have been 1.06.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 39% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. Growth was across all businesses, with solar being the biggest driver of revenue growth and margin expansion. 
Lastly, our communication performance companies' revenue increased 7% on strength at Knowles, particularly MEMS. We expect favorable performance at Knowles to continue.
Going to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year and in line with our expectations. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $35 million and also in line with our expectations. 
With respect to taxes, our second quarter tax rate was 20.2%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.12 EPS benefit from discrete federal tax settlements. Adjusting for this benefit, the second quarter rate would have been 27.4%. We now expect the full year normalized effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given our strong second quarter and the addition of Sound Solutions, we are now forecasting full year revenue growth of 18% to 20%, an increase of 6 percentage points from our prior forecast. Organic growth increases 3 points to 12% to 14% while acquisition growth, including Sound Solutions, is expected to contribute 6%. 
Breaking down organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems will be in the range of 7% to 9%, up 1 percentage point. Electronic Technologies will be in the range of 12% to 14%, also an increase of 1 point. Fluid Management's revenue growth is now forecasted to be in the range of 14% to 16%, up 4 percentage points. This significant increase is driven by broad-based growth in our end markets. Lastly, Industrial Products is now forecasted to be in the range of 12% to 14%, also an increase of 4 points. This increase represents stronger-than-anticipated first half revenue and the continued recovery in mid and late cycle businesses within this segment. 
Now with regard to acquisition growth. Fluid Management should see -- should increase 13%, largely driven by Harbison-Fischer. In total, Fluid Management's revenue will increase 27% to 29%. Electronic Technologies acquisitions, primarily Knowles Sound Solutions, will add 14 points on top of their already strong organic growth for full year growth of 26% to 28%. Lastly, Industrial Products acquisitions should add around 1%. 
Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance. And as mentioned, we expect a slightly lower full year normalized tax rate.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume, product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.67 to $0.76. This reflects an improvement from our previous guidance, primarily reflecting strong organic growth. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.06 to $0.07, down $0.04 from the midpoint of our previous guidance, driven by the Sound Solutions acquisition. Investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20, and interest expense will have a $0.03 impact. Lastly, our normalized tax rate and discrete tax benefits will add a total of $0.23. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.60. 
In summary, we have increased guidance $0.17 from the previous midpoint. Breaking this down, $0.12 is from a discrete tax benefit and $0.02 from a lower tax rate. Sound Solutions will be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive while improved performance adds $0.07 to our revised guidance.
Before I turn it back to Bob, I want to briefly review the performance of Sound Solutions in 2011 and our expectations for 2012 on Slide 13. In 2011, we anticipate revenue of $190 million to $200 million. While second half revenue in total is consistent with our prior expectations, revenue will accelerate from the third to fourth quarter as we significantly ramp up new customers and products. This ramp is principally connected to the Nokia market share losses and significant business increases with other customers. 
We expect Knowles Sound Solutions to be at $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive in 2011, reflecting changes in customer mix, ramp-up costs for new customers and the timing of onetime acquisition-related expenses. Of course, this estimate is subject to finalization of purchase accounting. The bulk of these acquisition expenses and ramp-up costs will be recognized in the third quarter, largely driving dilution of $0.06 to $0.08. In the fourth quarter, we expect this acquisition to be approximately $0.03 accretive.
Now with regard to 2012. We anticipate Knowles Sound Solutions will generate full year revenue of $400 million to $410 million and be $0.18 to $0.22 accretive. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

We entered the second half of the year facing at few uncertainties in the macro environment. That said, Dover will continue to achieve meaningful growth, with second half revenue up 17%, including 9% organic. Product innovation and geographic expansion activities, our increasing penetration in the energy and handset markets and our mid and late cycle businesses, especially Fluid Solutions, will give us many opportunities for growth. I am confident Dover will continue to win in its markets. 
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the fine award received by our US Synthetic's team. They recently won The Shingo award, a very prestigious recognition of operational excellence. US Synthetic's achievement is a significant tribute to their employees, and it also reflects the Dover-wide emphasis on lean practices and operational excellence. 
As always, I want to thank our employees, customers and suppliers around the world. Our strong results are a testament to their tireless efforts and support.

I want to step back and give you a little bit of color here on what we're seeing at Sound Solutions. And I'm sure this has been widely published and discussed in some of the business journals. But as this business entered the third quarter, we clearly are dealing with customer transition issues. They're centered around Nokia. If you look back at 2010, Nokia probably represented about 65% of Sound Solutions business. As Nokia has suffered over the last couple of quarters with market share loss and as we have pretty quickly transitioned to bringing new customers on as we entered the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, our expectation for 2012, now this is the transition over a 2-year period, but our expectation for 2012 is that our business with Nokia actually may only represent about 35% to 40% of our total. The bulk of this transition to new customers is actually taking place here in the second half of this year. So if you get on some of the ramp-up cost and customer conversion cost that we're going to eat mostly here in the third quarter, a little bit of it flowing into the fourth quarter, and you look at 2012 as a steady run rate, the EBITDA target that we shared with you folks about 6 or 8 months ago on the initial call, high 20s, we fully expect to have Sound Solutions at that high 20 EBITDA rate in the second half of next year. How early in the first half is going to depend upon some of the customer transitions that we'll make over the next couple of quarters. With respect to Knowles, I don't think you should model continuing margin expansion at Knowles. You may see a little bit of noise and perturbation from quarter-to-quarter but that's going to be depend on what mix and customer mix, but this business operates at quite high operating margins per day. And I would tell you that our focus here for the next couple of years is not to expand the margins but to expand the market."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am very pleased with our second quarter performance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am very pleased with our second quarter performance. Following a strong first quarter, we again saw growth in both revenue and earnings and a strong book-to-bill of 1.03. The strength in our orders was broad-based and was largely driven by continuing strength in the Energy and Fluid Solutions markets, mobile handsets and global industrial production. These strong trends are continuing into the second half of the year, along with moderating trends and grocery retail remodeling and solar equipment. 
All segments achieved double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Segment margin hit 17.4%, an all-time high for Dover. Orders were up 15% and revenue increased 21%. This solid performance enabled Dover to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.19.
I continue to feel positive about our businesses, and as a result, we are increasing full year revenue growth and earnings guidance. We also continue to invest for growth. In addition to our Sound Solutions acquisition, which I'll discuss later, we're investing in international growth initiatives, product innovation and additional capacity, where appropriate. These investments are clearly paying off. 
In the second quarter, revenue from China and Latin America increased 43% and 61%, respectively. We continue to make inroads into emerging economies, and I expect our penetration to increase over time, further supported by our newly expanded regional headquarter capabilities in Brazil and India. 
I mentioned capacity investments. These additions are in process at many of our operations in China, including a new shared manufacturing facility in Suzhou and expansion of our electronics campus in Shenzhen. In addition, we have recently added MEMS production to our Knowles facility in Malaysia. Domestically, we have put more capacity into U.S. synthetics, and we are expanding the Knowles R&D facility. These projects all have significant strategic value and will help drive future growth.
While we were focused on growth, we continue to look for opportunities to take out cost and streamline our businesses. In fact, we worked on several selective minor restructurings and integrations in the second quarter. In early July, we announced the completion of our Sound Solutions acquisition. This is a key addition for Dover and enables us to serve the fast-growing handset market even better. We now become a more significant supplier to our customers as we leverage technology and scale. Our postmerger integration team is already fully engaged, and I have the highest confidence they will create substantial value for their customers and for Dover.
Our pipeline has matured and developed nicely, and I believe we will complete additional deals before the end of the year. Our focus continues to be on our 5 growth spaces and opportunities that provide synergies with existing businesses. 
In summary, let me say I am very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year. We serve several end markets where growth continues to flourish, especially in the markets served by Energy and Fluid Solutions, handset markets and in developing economies. We will continue to deliver strong financial performance, while keeping a close eye on cost and market developments. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,137168007,145100,"Dover Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2011",2011-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 21%. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.31. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.19, a 3",1933,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 21%. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.31. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.19, a 31% improvement. Segment margin for the quarter was 17.4%, up 50 basis points over the prior year. Margin performance was led by Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. 
Bookings increased 15% over last year to $2.2 billion and were broad-based with continued strength in Energy, Industrial Products and Fluid Solutions. Book-to-bill finished at a solid 1.03. Backlog grew 28% to $1.8 billion. 
In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $136 million or 6.3% of revenue, impacted by the timing of CapEx investment and tax payments. We remain on target for full year cash flow generation to be 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. Second quarter revenue growth of 21% was comprised of 14% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions and 3% FX. Organic revenue growth was strong at all segments, with Industrial Products leading the way at 20%. Electronic Technologies and Fluid Management posted organic growth of 17% and 16%, respectively, while Engineered Systems grew 8%. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 14% of their growth.
Now turning to Slide 5. Total revenue increased 10% over the first quarter. Engineered Systems grew sequential revenue 15%, driven by the normal seasonality of the retail refrigeration market. Electronic Technologies grew 11% from the seasonally slower first quarter. Industrial Products and Fluid Management increased 9% and 5%, respectively. Bookings declined 2% from the first quarter of 2011. Of note, bookings were down 6% at Electronic Technologies and were heavily influenced by weaker solar equipment orders in the second quarter.
Now turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $566 million and $73 million of earnings, an increase of 23% and 19%, respectively. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue gain. Industrial Products operating margin was 12.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix, the continued incremental investment in product and business development activities and onetime gains on the sale of facilities in the second quarter of 2010.
Bookings were $628 million, an increase of 23%, resulting in a solid book-to-bill of 1.11. This growth was influenced by strong downstream Energy orders and steady growth in our infrastructure-related businesses. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 29% to $277 million while earnings increased 22%. Strong top line results continue to be driven by increased activity across the majority of end markets, including Energy and infrastructure. In total, Material Handling's margins declined 90 basis points, largely reflecting the onetime gain in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusting for this gain, second quarter margin would have increased 70 basis points.
For the quarter, bookings were $293 million, an increase of 31%, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.06. With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $291 million, an increase of 17%. Earnings were up 15%. Margins decreased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix and production ramp-up costs. Bookings increased 16% to $336 million and book-to-bill finished at 1.16.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $646 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year, and earnings increased 11% to $94 million. These results were all-time records. Operating margin was 14.6%, essentially flat with last year, reflecting strong volume leverage in Engineered Products, offset by Product ID. Bookings were $640 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, second quarter sales were $239 million, an increase of 9%, which included 6% FX. Year-over-year earnings were flat. Margins decreased 150 basis points, primarily due to new product launch costs early in the quarter and increased sales activities. Bookings increased 7% to $239 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Bookings improved sequentially through the quarter, and we continue to see significant opportunities in front of Product ID as we focus on product development and sales and marketing activities.
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $407 million, an increase of 14%, and earnings increased 24%, resulting in margin expansion of 140 basis points. This favorable margin performance was driven by volume gains and improvements in material price cost spread, especially at SWEP. Engineered Products bookings were $401 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.99. 
As previously mentioned, we anticipate weaker market conditions for Hill PHOENIX for the remainder of the year, primarily the result of softer remodel activity for most food retailers. However, we expect Hill PHOENIX's strong position will enable them to continue to outpace their markets.
Moving to Slide 8. Fluid Management produced another tremendous quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $535 million, while earnings increased 37% to $131 million. Acquisitions accounted for 14% of the growth. Operating margin was 24.6%, an 80 basis point improvement from last year. This positive margin performance was largely driven by volume gains. Bookings were $555 million, an increase of 33% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.04. We expect this segment's strong performance to continue.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 49% to $321 million, while earnings increased 50% on rising U.S. rig counts, stable Energy prices and our recent acquisitions. Margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to see strong fundamentals in our served markets. Quarterly bookings increased 48% to $336 million, with roughly 1/3 of growth coming from acquisitions. Book-to-bill ended at 1.05.
Now moving to Fluid Solutions. Revenue in this platform increased 14% to $214 million, and earnings improved 12%. Margins declined 40 basis points, driven by onetime costs associated with selective integration and restructuring activities. We continue to see broad-based growth driven by strength in many of our served markets, including petrochemical and Energy and our expansion efforts in Emerging Markets. Bookings increased 14% year-over-year to $219 million, and book-to-bill remains solid at 1.02.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $412 million, an increase of 19%. This result was driven by strong solar sales and solid results for electronic assembly and test equipment and MEMS microphones. Our companies serving the telecom markets continue to post more modest results. Earnings increased to $77 million, a 29% improvement over last year. Operating margin was very strong at 18.6%, 140 basis point expansion, reflecting good leverage on volume. Bookings were $394 million, essentially flat with last year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.95, reflecting a significant drop in demand for solar products, greatly influenced by the lack of clarity on European solar subsidies. We expect this trend will likely to continue in the near term. Adjusting for solar equipment revenue and orders, book-to-bill would have been 1.06.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test companies posted a 39% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to expand margin. Growth was across all businesses, with solar being the biggest driver of revenue growth and margin expansion. 
Lastly, our communication components companies' revenue increased 7% on strength at Knowles, particularly MEMS. We expect favorable performance at Knowles to continue.
Going to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $28 million, an increase of $1 million over last year and in line with our expectations. Corporate expense was up $3 million from the prior year to $35 million and also in line with our expectations. 
With respect to taxes, our second quarter tax rate was 20.2%. The rate was positively impacted by a $0.12 EPS benefit from discrete federal tax settlements. Adjusting for this benefit, the second quarter rate would have been 27.4%. We now expect the full year normalized effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%.
Now turning to Slide 11. Given our strong second quarter and the addition of Sound Solutions, we are now forecasting full year revenue growth of 18% to 20%, an increase of 6 percentage points from our prior forecast. Organic growth increases 3 points to 12% to 14% while acquisition growth, including Sound Solutions, is expected to contribute 6%. 
Breaking down organic growth by segment. We now expect Engineered Systems will be in the range of 7% to 9%, up 1 percentage point. Electronic Technologies will be in the range of 12% to 14%, also an increase of 1 point. Fluid Management's revenue growth is now forecasted to be in the range of 14% to 16%, up 4 percentage points. This significant increase is driven by broad-based growth in their end markets. Lastly, Industrial Products is now forecasted to be in the range of 12% to 14%, also an increase of 4 points. This increase represents stronger-than-anticipated first half revenue and the continued recovery in mid and late cycle businesses within this segment. 
Now with regard to acquisition growth. Fluid Management should see -- should increase 13%, largely driven by Harbison-Fischer. In total, Fluid Management's revenue will increase 27% to 29%. Electronic Technologies acquisitions, primarily Knowles Sound Solutions, will add 14 points on top of their already strong organic growth for full year growth of 26% to 28%. Lastly, Industrial Products acquisitions should add around 1%. 
Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx are unchanged from our previous guidance. And as mentioned, we expect a slightly lower full year normalized tax rate.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume, product mix and pricing should increase earnings $0.67 to $0.76. This reflects an improvement from our previous guidance, primarily reflecting strong organic growth. Net productivity is expected to yield $0.26 to $0.30. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.06 to $0.07, down $0.04 from the midpoint of our previous guidance, driven by the Sound Solutions acquisition. Investments will impact EPS $0.16 to $0.20, and interest expense will have a $0.03 impact. Lastly, our normalized tax rate and discrete tax benefits will add a total of $0.23. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.60. 
In summary, we have increased guidance $0.17 from the previous midpoint. Breaking this down, $0.12 is from a discrete tax benefit and $0.02 from a lower tax rate. Sound Solutions will be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive while improved performance adds $0.07 to our revised guidance.
Before I turn it back to Bob, I want to briefly review the performance of Sound Solutions in 2011 and our expectations for 2012 on Slide 13. In 2011, we anticipate revenue of $190 million to $200 million. While second half revenue in total is consistent with our prior expectations, revenue will accelerate from the third to fourth quarter as we significantly ramp up new customers and products. This ramp is principally connected to the Nokia market share losses and significant business increases with other customers. 
We expect Knowles Sound Solutions to be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive in 2011, reflecting changes in customer mix, ramp-up costs for new customers and the timing of onetime acquisition-related expenses. Of course, this estimate is subject to finalization of purchase accounting. The bulk of these acquisition expenses and ramp-up costs will be recognized in the third quarter, largely driving dilution of $0.06 to $0.08. In the fourth quarter, we expect this acquisition to be approximately $0.03 accretive.
Now with regard to 2012. We anticipate Knowles Sound Solutions will generate full year revenue of $400 million to $410 million and be $0.18 to $0.22 accretive. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

We entered the second half of the year facing a few uncertainties in the macro environment. That said, Dover will continue to achieve meaningful growth, with second half revenue up 17%, including 9% organic. Product innovation and geographic expansion activities, our increasing penetration in the energy and handset markets and our mid and late cycle businesses, especially Fluid Solutions, will give us many opportunities for growth. I am confident Dover will continue to win in its markets. 
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the fine award received by our U.S. Synthetic's team. They recently won The Shingo award, a very prestigious recognition of operational excellence.

I want to step back and give you a little bit of color here on what we're seeing at Sound Solutions. And I'm sure this has been widely published and discussed in some of the business journals. But as this business entered the third quarter, we clearly are dealing with customer transition issues. They're centered around Nokia. If you look back at 2010, Nokia probably represented about 65% of Sound Solutions business. As Nokia has suffered over the last couple of quarters with market share loss and as we have pretty quickly transitioned to bringing new customers on as we entered the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, our expectation for 2012, now this is a transition over a 2-year period, but our expectation for 2012 is that our business with Nokia actually may only represent about 35% to 40% of our total. The bulk of this transition to new customers is actually taking place here in the second half of this year. So if you get beyond some of the ramp-up cost and customer conversion cost that we're going to eat mostly here in the third quarter, a little bit of it flowing into the fourth quarter, and you look at 2012 as a steady run rate, the EBITDA target that we shared with you folks about 6 or 8 months ago on the initial call, high 20s, we fully expect to have Sound Solutions at that high 20 EBITDA rate in the second half of next year. How early in the first half is going to depend upon some of the customer transitions that we make over the next couple of quarters. With respect to Knowles, I don't think you should model continuing margin expansion at Knowles. You may see a little bit of noise and perturbation from quarter-to-quarter but that's going to depend upon product mix and customer mix, but this business operates at quite high operating margins today. And I would tell you that our focus here for the next couple of years is not to expand the margins but to expand the market."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Following a great first half of the year, we delivered strong growth in both revenue and earnings and a seasonably solid book to bill of 0.96 for the third quarter. These res",557,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Following a great first half of the year, we delivered strong growth in both revenue and earnings and a seasonably solid book to bill of 0.96 for the third quarter. These results were once again broad-based and led by the continued strong demand in our energy and handset markets. In total, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance.
The majority of our businesses continue to see strong market activity, with organic bookings up 11%. As we discussed last quarter, we do anticipate revenue growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, due in part to semicon and solar markets. However, for the full year, I remain quite confident we are on track to deliver 20% revenue growth.
All segments achieved significant revenue and earnings growth in the quarter, absent the impact of onetime charges in connection with the acquisition of Sound Solutions. Segment margin was 16.9%. Orders were up 23%, and revenue increased 22%. The strong performance enabled Dover to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.20, a 25% improvement over last year.
Although it's too early to provide specific guidance, I fully expect our Energy businesses and Knowles to continue to expand going into 2012. I also like our leading positions and expanding opportunities in Refrigeration Equipment, Product ID and Fluid Solutions.
We made several important strides in our strategic initiatives in the third quarter. Sound Solutions is off to a great start and is performing at the high end of our expectations. We have been and are still adding significant capacity in China to support strong demand for new customers. As we said last quarter, we expect the pace of shipments to accelerate into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we reported on our MEMS capacity expansion program in Malaysia. I'm happy to say we shipped over 8 million microphones in September in only the second month of operations. This capacity expansion is a key part of Knowles' customer service and growth initiatives for the second half of this year and the first half of next year. 
We also continued with our investments in the energy space, part of which was the recently announced acquisition of oil. It expands our presence in the progressive cavity pump market and enables us to increase our product offerings in the attractive artificial space. Late in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of Paladin and Crenlo. These divestitures are an important step in our continued efforts to focus on our higher-margin growth spaces. We received roughly $300 million in proceeds, which we intend to redeploy in acquisitions.
Going forward, we will continue to review the performance and pursue opportunities that improve our business mix.
Our pipeline continues to be very active as we work on a number of potential deals that provide synergies with existing businesses. I am confident we will announce additional acquisitions before year end. 
In summary, I was very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We executed very well in Engineered Systems and saw strong growth in Fluid Management and industrial products. Electronic Technologies continued to benefit from its strong position with smartphone and handset OEMs. Aside from normal seasonality, we expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter.
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,141519374,175286,"Dover Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.20, a 25%",1791,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.20, a 25% improvement over an adjusted prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.9%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. After adjusting for onetime costs associated with the Sound Solutions acquisition, segment margin was 17.5%.
Our solid margin performance was again led by strong results at Fluid Management. Bookings increased 23% over last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting growth in all segments and platforms. Book to bill finished at a solid 0.96, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical trends. Backlog grew 27% to $1.6 billion.
For the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $316 million or 14.4% of revenue. We remain on target for full year free cash flow to be 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. Third quarter revenue growth of 22% was comprised of 10% organic growth, 9% from acquisitions and 3% FX. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Fluid Management and industrial Products, achieving 23% and 16% growth respectively. Engineered Systems grew 4%. Electronic Technologies posted modest growth of 2% whereby solid communication components growth of 7% was largely offset by weakness in semicon markets.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Electronic Technologies and Fluid Management where acquisitions contributed 24% and 15% respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. Total revenue increased 7% over the second quarter. Electronic Technologies grew 19% sequentially, driven by Sound Solutions. Fluid Management grew sequentially revenue 9% on the strength of expanding energy markets. Engineered Systems grew 4% while Industrial Products declined 1%. Bookings increased slightly from the second quarter of 2011. Of note, bookings were up 22% at Electronic Technologies on the addition of Sound Solutions. In Industrial Products, bookings moderated from an unusually strong second quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $459 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 18% respectively. Industrial Products' operating margin was 14%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix and, as expected, continued lower volume in the refuse vehicle market.
Bookings were $447 million, an increase of 20% resulting in a book to bill of 0.97. This growth continues to be influenced by strong downstream energy orders and steady growth in our infrastructure-related businesses.
Now with respect to our Material Handling platform. Sales increased 34% to $182 million while earnings increased 39%. Strong top line results continue to be driven by increased activity across the majority of end markets. In total, Material Handling margins improved 70 basis points, largely reflecting solid volume leverage. For the quarter, bookings were $171 million, an increase of 23%, yielding a book to bill of 0.94. 
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $278 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix and continued softness in the refuse vehicle market. Bookings increased 17% to $274 million and book to bill finished at 0.99.
Turning to Slide 9 -- Slide 7. at Engineered Systems, sales were $670 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and earnings increased 12% to $103 million. These results were all-time records, eclipsing the records set last quarter. Operating margin was 15.3%, an increase of 60 basis points, reflecting strong performance in Engineered Products. Bookings were $617 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year. Book to bill ended at 0.92. 
With respect to our product identification platform, second quarter sales were $246 million, an increase of 11%, which included 6% FX. Year-over-year earnings increased 6%. Although margin decreased 100 basis points year-over-year, they increased 60 basis points sequentially. This performance improvement is reflective of the positive response to the new product releases at Markem-Imaje. Bookings increased 14% to $249 million, resulting in a book to bill of 1.01. 
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $423 million, an increase of 6% and earnings increased 17%, resulting in margin expansion of 150 basis points. This favorable margin performance was driven by very strong execution at Hill PHOENIX and volume leverage. Engineered Product bookings were $369 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year, resulting in a book to bill of 0.87.
As previously shared, while we still anticipate normal seasonality in the refrigeration market in the fourth quarter, Hill PHOENIX remains very well positioned.
Moving to Slide 8. Fluid Management produced another great quarter. Revenue increased 40% to $585 million while earnings increased 42% to $144 million. Acquisitions accounted for 15 points of the growth. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis point improvement from last year. This positive margin performance was achieved while covering increased acquisition amortization and $4 million of deal costs in the quarter. Bookings were $582 million, an increase of 42% from the prior year, resulting in a book to bill of 0.99.
With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 67% to $368 million while earnings increased 70% on rising U.S. rig counts, fairly stable energy prices and our recent acquisitions. Margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to see strong fundamentals in the served markets and anticipate continued strong results in this platform. Quarterly bookings increased 68% to $359 million. Book to bill ended at 0.98.
Now moving to Fluid Solutions. Revenue in this platform increased 10% to $217 million and earnings improved 6%. We continue to invest in international expansion initiatives and are making strong progress. These investments impacted margin, resulting in an 80 basis point decline. Bookings increased 14% year-over-year to $223 million and book to bill was 1.03. 
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $492 million, an increase of 29%. Bookings were $479 million, up 19% from last year. Both results were largely driven by Sound Solutions and strong demand for MEMS microphones, partially offset by weaker sales in orders in the semicon market. Sound Solutions accounted for 24 points of the revenue growth. Earnings decreased 14% to $60 million. Operating margin declined 610 basis points to 12.2% largely reflecting the impact of Sound Solutions, including onetime costs. Adjusting for these costs, earnings increased 8% and margin was 15.3%.
Another way to look at it, the core electronics business, when fully excluding Sound Solutions, grew margin 20 basis points to 18.5%. Book to bill ended at 0.97.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test group saw a revenue decline 4% from the prior year. Comparing this group's third quarter revenue with the prior year, sales increased in solar as we continue to work through our backlog. Electronic assembly sales were stable and semicon-related revenue was down approximately 30%. Sequentially into the fourth quarter, we expect this group's solar sales to decline due to weak order levels and semicon revenue to remain stable to slightly down albeit at a low level. Further, we anticipated the current dynamics in the solar and semicon markets to continue in the near term. 
Lastly, our communications components companies, revenue increased 53% on the strength of Knowles and the addition of Sound Solutions. Sound Solutions sales of $92 million accounted for 41 points of the growth in communications components. 
Now going to Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was $30 million, an increase of $4 million over last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense was $34 million, essentially flat with the prior year and also in line with expectations. With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was 25.6%. This rate was positively impacted by a $0.01 discrete tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the third quarter rate would have been 26.4%. This lower rate was influenced by the sale of businesses in the quarter. We now expect the full year normalized effective rate to be approximately 27% going forward.
Turning to slide 11. Our revenue growth forecast of 20% remains largely unchanged from last quarter, with some changes in business mix. Organic growth is estimated to be around 13%, and acquisition growth is expected to contribute 7%. 
Breaking down organic growth by segment. We now expect Electronic Technologies to be in the range of 8% to 9%, down around 5 points from the previous forecast driven by weak semi and solar order rates. Engineered Systems remain largely unchanged from our previous forecast and should be in a range of 8% to 9%. Industrial Products is now forecasted to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase of about 2 points from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluid Management's revenue growth is now forecasted to be in the range of 20% to 21%, up about 5 points. This significant increase is driven by broad-based growth in their end markets. 
With respect to acquisition growth, Fluid Management should increase 14%, 1 point improvement from our prior forecast. In total, Fluid Management's revenues should increased 34% to 35%, whereas Electronic Technologies acquisitions will add 15%, a 1 point improvement from our prior forecast for the full year growth of 23% to 24%. Lastly, Industrial Products acquisitions should add around 1%. Corporate expense and interest expense are unchanged from our previous guidance. CapEx should now be at the high end of our forecast, 3% of full year revenue. 
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume mix and price now stand at $0.60 to $0.65 for the full year while net productivity is essentially unchanged at $0.26 to $0.28. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.07 to $0.08, an increase of $0.01 from our previous guidance. We continue to make investments in our growth spaces, with the impact of $0.14 to $0.17. Interest expense is unchanged at $0.03. Lastly, our improved normalized tax rate and discrete tax benefits will add $0.25 for the full year, up $0.02 from the last forecast. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.50.
Let's turn to Slide 13, which reconciles our current guidance with our prior guidance. On the last earnings call, we provided guidance of $4.50 to $4.60. After adjusting for $0.14, representing the full year forecasted 2011 operating earnings of Paladin and Crenlo, our full year adjusted guidance was $4.36 to $4.46. We then add $0.04 for performance and $0.02 for the third quarter tax benefits. The result is increased guidance of $0.06 at the midpoint and a new guidance range of $4.45 to $4.50., representing an increase of 20% from last year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

Let's take some confusion out of this group of companies here. Let me share some data with you. First off, 2010 revenue for these 3 equipment companies in electronics, 2010 revenue, almost $600 million in sales. And electronic assembly, there's really 3 parts of the market that we'd play in within this group. Electronic assembly, last year 2010, about 55% of the total. Semicon test was about 40% of the total and solar was about 5% of the total. Now let me bring it forward to 2011, and I'm going to try to do an apples-and-apples comparison, so I'm going to give you numbers that we think we're going to end up with the year, not through the third quarter but for the year. So 2011 revenue in this group, approximately $650 million. Electronic assembly has been rather stable. It's about 52% of our total this year. Semicon test has dropped a bit. It'll be about 31% of our total. Solar, we've had a good year. Well, let me put it this way. We've had a good first 3 quarters. And solar, we'll end up being about 70% of the total. So that gives you some size on the spaces, and I think the other part of your question was our outlook going into 2012, is that right, John?"

But don't lose sight of the fact that the largest piece in this group of companies is actually our electronic assembly. And John, it's not just been stable '10 to '11. It's actually rather amazing how stable this part of the business has been sequentially through 2011, and we see that fact pattern continuing into 2012 as well. Different dynamics. But tell you, and we've got a strong recurring part, strong recurring revenue in electronic assembly. And what we have noticed over the last couple of years that the fact patterns of market cycles the market dynamics are a bit different between semicon test and electronic assembly, at least for us. Because today, the bulk -- and I'm not going to give you a percentage, but I'm going to tell you it's rather significant, that the bulk of our activity in electronic assembly is around the smartphone and handset markets.

And I would say the same thing with respect to what Bob said on the semi is that we don't see solar recovery really at this point until maybe the back half of next year. So one way to think about it is we love the Solar business. It's ramped up dramatically in the first half. Second half has been weak. That'll continue a little bit into the early parts of '12 and hopefully recover after that as we start to see some of those businesses."

So it's still -- it's used to be a bigger problem for Dover 10 years ago. It's a lot smaller now, but it's still -- it kind distracts I think from these core kind of growth spaces that you've build.

We're going through a little bit of a gyration in the polls right now, but we happen to believe that solar is going to be a good market for us to play in.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Following a great first half of the year, we delivered strong growth in both revenue and earnings and a seasonably solid book to bill of 0.96 for the third quarter. These res",560,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Following a great first half of the year, we delivered strong growth in both revenue and earnings and a seasonably solid book to bill of 0.96 for the third quarter. These results were once again broad-based and led by the continued strong demand in our energy and handset markets. In total, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance.
The majority of our businesses continue to see strong market activity, with organic bookings up 11%. As we discussed last quarter, we do anticipate revenue growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, due in part to semicon and solar markets. However, for the full year, I remain quite confident we are on track to deliver 20% revenue growth.
All segments achieved significant revenue and earnings growth in the quarter, absent the impact of onetime charges in connection with the acquisition of Sound Solutions. Segment margin was 16.9%. Orders were up 23%, and revenue increased 22%. The strong performance enabled Dover to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.20, a 25% improvement over last year. Although it's too early to provide specific guidance, I fully expect our Energy businesses and Knowles to continue to expand going into 2012. I also like our leading positions and expanding opportunities in Refrigeration equipment, Product ID and Fluid Solutions.
We made several important strides in our strategic initiatives in the third quarter. Sound Solutions is off to a great start and is performing at the high end of our expectations. We have been and are still adding significant capacity in China to support strong demand for new customers. As we said last quarter, we expect the pace of shipments to accelerate into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we reported on our MEMS capacity expansion program in Malaysia. I'm happy to say we shipped over 8 million microphones in September in only the second month of operation. This capacity expansion is a key part of Knowles' customer service and growth initiatives for the second half of this year and the first half of next year. 
We also continued with our investments in the energy space, part of which was the recently announced acquisition of Oil Lift. Oil Lift expands our presence in the progressive cavity pump market and enables us to increase our product offerings in the attractive artificial lift space. Late in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of Paladin and Crenlo. These divestitures are an important step in our continued efforts to focus on our higher-margin growth spaces. We received roughly $300 million in proceeds, which we intend to redeploy in acquisitions. 
Going forward, we will continue to review the portfolio and pursue opportunities that improve our business mix. Our pipeline continues to be very active as we work on a number of potential deals that provide synergies with existing businesses. I am confident we will announce additional acquisitions before year end. 
In summary, I was very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We executed very well in Engineered Systems and saw strong growth in Fluid Management and industrial Products. Electronic Technologies continued to benefit from its strong position with smartphone and handset OEMs. Aside from normal seasonality, we expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter.
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,141519374,175390,"Dover Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.20, a 25%",1771,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.20, a 25% improvement over an adjusted prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.9%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. After adjusting for onetime costs associated with the Sound Solutions acquisition, segment margin was 17.5%.
Our solid margin performance was again led by strong results at Fluid Management. Bookings increased 23% over last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting growth in all segments and platforms. Book-to-bill finished at a solid 0.96, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical trends. Backlog grew 27% to $1.6 billion. For the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $316 million or 14.4% of revenue. We remain on target for full year free cash flow to be 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. Third quarter revenue growth of 22% was comprised of 10% organic growth, 9% from acquisitions and 3% FX. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Fluid Management and Industrial Products, achieving 23% and 16% growth respectively. Engineered Systems grew 4%. Electronic Technologies posted modest growth of 2%, whereby solid communication components growth of 7% was largely offset by weakness in semicon markets. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Electronic Technologies and Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 24% and 15% respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. Total revenue increased 7% over the second quarter. Electronic Technologies grew 19% sequentially, driven by Sound Solutions. Fluid Management grew sequentially revenue 9% on the strength of expanding energy markets. Engineered Systems grew 4% while Industrial Products declined 1%. Bookings increased slightly from the second quarter of 2011. Of note, bookings were up 22% at Electronic Technologies on the addition of Sound Solutions. In Industrial Products, bookings moderated from an unusually strong second quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $459 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 18% respectively. Industrial Products' operating margin was 14%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix and, as expected, continued lower volume in the refuse vehicle market. Bookings were $447 million, an increase of 20%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97. This growth continues to be influenced by strong downstream energy orders and steady growth in our infrastructure-related businesses.
Now with respect to our Material Handling platform. Sales increased 34% to $182 million while earnings increased 39%. Strong top line results continue to be driven by increased activity across the majority of end markets. In total, Material Handling margins improved 70 basis points, largely reflecting solid volume leverage. For the quarter, bookings were $171 million, an increase of 23%, yielding a book-to-bill of 0.94. 
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $278 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix and continued softness in the refuse vehicle market. Bookings increased 17% to $274 million and book-to-bill finished at 0.99.
Turning to Slide 9 -- to Slide 7, I'm sorry. At Engineered Systems, sales were $670 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and earnings increased 12% to $103 million. These results were all-time records, eclipsing the records set last quarter. Operating margin was 15.3%, an increase of 60 basis points, reflecting strong performance in Engineered Products. Bookings were $617 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.92. 
With respect to our Product Identification platform, second quarter sales were $246 million, an increase of 11%, which included 6% FX. Year-over-year earnings increased 6%. Although margin decreased 100 basis points year-over-year, they increased 60 basis points sequentially. This performance improvement is reflective of the positive response to the new product releases at Markem-Imaje. Bookings increased 14% to $249 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.01. 
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $423 million, an increase of 6% and earnings increased 17%, resulting in margin expansion of 150 basis points. This favorable margin performance was driven by very strong execution at Hill PHOENIX and volume leverage. Engineered Product bookings were $369 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.87. As previously shared, while we still anticipate normal seasonality in the refrigeration market in the fourth quarter, Hill PHOENIX remains very well positioned.
Moving to Slide 8. Fluid Management produced another great quarter. Revenue increased 40% to $585 million while earnings increased 42% to $144 million. Acquisitions accounted for 15 points of the growth. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis point improvement from last year. This positive margin performance was achieved while covering increased acquisition amortization and $4 million of deal cost in the quarter. Bookings were $582 million, an increase of 42% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.99.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 67% to $368 million while earnings increased 70% on rising U.S. rig counts, fairly stable energy prices and our recent acquisitions. Margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to see strong fundamentals in the served markets and anticipate continued strong results in this platform. Quarterly bookings increased 68% to $359 million. Book-to-bill ended at 0.98.
Now moving to Fluid Solutions. Revenue in this platform increased 10% to $217 million and earnings improved 6%. We continue to invest in international expansion initiatives and are making strong progress. These investments impacted margin, resulting in an 80 basis point decline. Bookings increased 14% year-over-year to $223 million and book-to-bill was 1.03. 
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $492 million, an increase of 29%. Bookings were $479 million, up 19% from last year. Both results were largely driven by Sound Solutions and strong demand for MEMS microphones, partially offset by weaker sales in orders in the semicon market. Sound Solutions accounted for 24 points of the revenue growth. Earnings decreased 14% to $60 million. Operating margin declined 610 basis points to 12.2%, largely reflecting the impact of Sound Solutions, including onetime costs. Adjusting for these costs, earnings increased 8% and margin was 15.3%. Another way to look at it, the core Electronics business, when fully excluding Sound Solutions, grew margin 20 basis points to 18.5%. Book-to-bill ended at 0.97.
Our electronic assembly equipment and test group saw revenue decline 4% from the prior year. Comparing this group's third quarter revenue with the prior year, sales increased in solar as we continue to work through our backlog. Electronic assembly sales were stable and semicon-related revenue was down approximately 30%. Sequentially into the fourth quarter, we expect this group's solar sales to decline due to weak order levels and semicon revenue to remain stable to slightly down albeit at a low level. Further, we anticipated the current dynamics in the solar and semicon markets to continue in the near term. Lastly, our communications components companies, revenue increased 53% on the strength of Knowles and the addition of Sound Solutions. Sound Solutions sales of $92 million accounted for 41 points of the growth in communications components. 
Now going to Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was $30 million, an increase of $4 million over last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense was $34 million, essentially flat with the prior year and also in line with expectations. With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was 25.6%. This rate was positively impacted by a $0.01 discrete tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the third quarter rate would have been 26.4%. This lower rate was influenced by the sale of businesses in the quarter. We now expect the full year normalized effective rate to be approximately 27% going forward.
Turning to Slide 11. Our revenue growth forecast of 20% remains largely unchanged from last quarter, with some changes in business mix. Organic growth is estimated to be around 13%, and acquisition growth is expected to contribute 7%. 
Breaking down organic growth by segment. We now expect Electronic Technologies to be in the range of 8% to 9%, down around 5 points from the previous forecast driven by weak semi and solar order rates. Engineered Systems remain largely unchanged from our previous forecast and should be in a range of 8% to 9%. Industrial Products is now forecasted to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase of about 2 points from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluid Management's revenue growth is now forecasted to be in the range of 20% to 21%, up about 5 points. This significant increase is driven by broad-based growth in their end markets. 
With respect to acquisition growth, Fluid Management should increase 14%, 1 point improvement from our prior forecast. In total, Fluid Management's revenues should increased 34% to 35%, whereas Electronic Technologies acquisitions will add 15%, a 1 point improvement from our prior forecast for the full year growth of 23% to 24%. Lastly, Industrial Products acquisitions should add around 1%. Corporate expense and interest expense are unchanged from our previous guidance. CapEx should now be at the high end of our forecast, 3% of full year revenue. 
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume mix and price now stand at $0.60 to $0.65 for the full year while net productivity is essentially unchanged at $0.26 to $0.28. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.07 to $0.08, an increase of $0.01 from our previous guidance. We continue to make investments in our growth spaces, with the impact of $0.14 to $0.17. Interest expense is unchanged at $0.03. Lastly, our improved normalized tax rate and discrete tax benefits will add $0.25 for the full year, up $0.02 from the last forecast. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.50.
Let's turn to Slide 13, which reconciles our current guidance with our prior guidance. On the last earnings call, we provided guidance of $4.50 to $4.60. After adjusting for $0.14, representing the full year forecasted 2011 operating earnings of Paladin and Crenlo, our full year adjusted guidance was $4.36 to $4.46. We then add $0.04 for performance and $0.02 for the third quarter tax benefits. The result is increased guidance of $0.06 at the midpoint and a new guidance range of $4.45 to $4.50, representing an increase of 20% from last year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As you can see, we had a strong quarter as well as an active year so far with acquisitions and divestitures. As we enter the fourth quarter, I am pleased by the strong market activity that most of our businesses are seeing. This activity, supported by our continuing investments in geographic expansion and product innovation, give me great confidence we will deliver a full year revenue growth of 20%.
The portfolio of changes we've made this year have resulted in a better group of companies than we've ever had before. We are very well positioned in our 5 growth spaces and poised for further investment in growth. Accordingly, I expect Dover to perform better than before in both strong and modest markets. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees, customers and suppliers around the world for all their efforts in making the third quarter a success.  Now Paul, let's take some questions."

Let's take some confusion out of this group of companies here. Let me share some data with you. First off, 2010 revenue for these 3 equipment companies in electronics, 2010 revenue, almost $600 million in sales. And electronic assembly, there's really 3 parts of the market that we'd play in within this group. Electronic assembly, last year 2010, about 55% of the total. Semicon test was about 40% of the total and solar was about 5% of the total. Now let me bring it forward to 2011, and I'm going to try to do an apples-and-apples comparison here. So I'm going to give you numbers that we think we're going to end up with the year on, not through the third quarter but for the year. So 2011 revenue in this group, approximately $650 million. Electronic assembly has been rather stable. It's about 52% of our total this year. Semicon test has dropped a bit. It'll be about 31% of our total. Solar, we've had a good year.

But don't lose sight of the fact that the largest piece in this group of companies is actually our electronic assembly. And John, it's not just been stable '10 to '11. It's actually rather amazing how stable this part of the business has been sequentially through 2011. And we see that fact pattern continuing into 2012 as well. Different dynamics. To tell you -- and we've got a strong recurring part, strong recurring revenue in electronic assembly. And what we have noticed over the last couple of years, that the fact patterns of market cycles and market dynamics are a bit different between semicon test and electronic assembly, at least for us. Because today, the bulk -- and I'm not going to give you a percentage, but I'm going to tell you it's rather significant, that the bulk of our activity in electronic assembly is around the smartphone and handset markets.

So one way to think about it is we love the Solar business. It's ramped up dramatically in the first half. Second half has been weak.

The majority of our businesses continue to see strong market activity, with organic bookings up 11%. As we discussed last quarter, we do anticipate revenue growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, due in part to semicon and solar markets. However, for the full year, I remain quite confident we are on track to deliver 20% revenue growth.
All segments achieved significant revenue and earnings growth in the quarter, absent the impact of onetime charges in connection with the acquisition of Sound Solutions. Segment margin was 16.9%. Orders were up 23%, and revenue increased 22%. This strong performance enabled Dover to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.20, a 25% improvement over last year. Although it's too early to provide specific guidance, I fully expect our Energy businesses and Knowles to continue to expand going into 2012. I also like our leading positions and expanding opportunities in Refrigeration equipment, Product ID and Fluid Solutions.
We made several important strides in our strategic initiatives in the third quarter. Sound Solutions is off to a great start and is performing at the high end of our expectations. We have been and are still adding significant capacity in China to support strong demand for new customers. As we said last quarter, we expect the pace of shipments to accelerate into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we reported on our MEMS capacity expansion program in Malaysia. I'm happy to say we shipped over eight million microphones in September in only the second month of operation. This capacity expansion is a key part of Knowles' customer service and growth initiatives for the second half of this year and the first half of next year. 
We also continued with our investments in the energy space, part of which was the recently announced acquisition of Oil Lift. Oil Lift expands our presence in the progressive cavity pump market and enables us to increase our product offerings in the attractive artificial lift space. Late in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of Paladin and Crenlo. These divestitures are an important step in our continued efforts to focus on our higher-margin growth spaces. We received roughly $300 million in proceeds, which we intend to redeploy in acquisitions. 
Going forward, we will continue to review the portfolio and pursue opportunities that improve our business mix. Our pipeline continues to be very active as we work on a number of potential deals that provide synergies with existing businesses. I am confident we will announce additional acquisitions before year end. 
In summary, I was very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We executed very well in Engineered Systems and saw strong growth in Fluid Management and Industrial Products. Electronic Technologies continued to benefit from its strong position with smartphone and handset OEMs. Aside from normal seasonality, we expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter.
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,141519374,175741,"Dover Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.20, a 25%",1772,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21. After adjusting for discrete tax benefits, EPS was $1.20, a 25% improvement over an adjusted prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.9%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. After adjusting for onetime costs associated with the Sound Solutions acquisition, segment margin was 17.5%.
Our solid margin performance was again led by strong results at Fluid Management. Bookings increased 23% over last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting growth in all segments and platforms. Book-to-bill finished at a solid 0.96, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical trends. Backlog grew 27% to $1.6 billion. For the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $316 million or 14.4% of revenue. We remain on target for full year free cash flow to be 10% to 11% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 4. Third quarter revenue growth of 22% was comprised of 10% organic growth, 9% from acquisitions and 3% FX. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Fluid Management and Industrial Products, achieving 23% and 16% growth respectively. Engineered Systems grew 4%. Electronic Technologies posted modest growth of 2%, whereby solid communication components growth of 7% was largely offset by weakness in semicon markets. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Electronic Technologies and Fluid Management, where acquisitions contributed 24% and 15% respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our sequential growth. Total revenue increased 7% over the second quarter. Electronic Technologies grew 19% sequentially, driven by Sound Solutions. Fluid Management grew sequentially revenue 9% on the strength of expanding energy markets. Engineered Systems grew 4% while Industrial Products declined 1%. Bookings increased slightly from the second quarter of 2011. Of note, bookings were up 22% at Electronic Technologies on the addition of Sound Solutions. In Industrial Products, bookings moderated from an unusually strong second quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $459 million and $64 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 18% respectively. Industrial Products' operating margin was 14%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix and, as expected, continued lower volume in the refuse vehicle market. Bookings were $447 million, an increase of 20%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97. This growth continues to be influenced by strong downstream energy orders and steady growth in our infrastructure-related businesses.
Now with respect to our Material Handling platform. Sales increased 34% to $182 million while earnings increased 39%. Strong top line results continue to be driven by increased activity across the majority of end markets. In total, Material Handling margins improved 70 basis points, largely reflecting solid volume leverage. For the quarter, bookings were $171 million, an increase of 23%, yielding a book-to-bill of 0.94. 
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $278 million, an increase of 11%. Earnings were up 4%. Margins decreased 100 basis points, primarily reflecting changes in product mix and continued softness in the refuse vehicle market. Bookings increased 17% to $274 million and book-to-bill finished at 0.99.
Turning to Slide 9 -- to Slide 7, I'm sorry. At Engineered Systems, sales were $670 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and earnings increased 12% to $103 million. These results were all-time records, eclipsing the records set last quarter. Operating margin was 15.3%, an increase of 60 basis points, reflecting strong performance in Engineered Products. Bookings were $617 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year. Book-to-bill ended at 0.92. 
With respect to our Product Identification platform, second quarter sales were $246 million, an increase of 11%, which included 6% FX. Year-over-year earnings increased 6%. Although margin decreased 100 basis points year-over-year, they increased 60 basis points sequentially. This performance improvement is reflective of the positive response to the new product releases at Markem-Imaje. Bookings increased 14% to $249 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.01. 
Moving to Engineered Products. Sales were $423 million, an increase of 6% and earnings increased 17%, resulting in margin expansion of 150 basis points. This favorable margin performance was driven by very strong execution at Hill PHOENIX and volume leverage. Engineered Product bookings were $369 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.87. As previously shared, while we still anticipate normal seasonality in the refrigeration market in the fourth quarter, Hill PHOENIX remains very well positioned.
Moving to Slide 8. Fluid Management produced another great quarter. Revenue increased 40% to $585 million while earnings increased 42% to $144 million. Acquisitions accounted for 15 points of the growth. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis point improvement from last year. This positive margin performance was achieved while covering increased acquisition amortization and $4 million of deal cost in the quarter. Bookings were $582 million, an increase of 42% from the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.99.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 67% to $368 million while earnings increased 70% on rising U.S. rig counts, fairly stable energy prices and our recent acquisitions. Margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to see strong fundamentals in the served markets and anticipate continued strong results in this platform. Quarterly bookings increased 68% to $359 million. Book-to-bill ended at 0.98.
Now moving to Fluid Solutions. Revenue in this platform increased 10% to $217 million and earnings improved 6%. We continue to invest in international expansion initiatives and are making strong progress. These investments impacted margin, resulting in an 80 basis point decline. Bookings increased 14% year-over-year to $223 million and book-to-bill was 1.03. 
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $492 million, an increase of 29%. Bookings were $479 million, up 19% from last year. Both results were largely driven by Sound Solutions and strong demand for MEMS microphones, partially offset by weaker sales in orders in the semicon market. Sound Solutions accounted for 24 points of the revenue growth. Earnings decreased 14% to $60 million. Operating margin declined 610 basis points to 12.2%, largely reflecting the impact of Sound Solutions, including onetime costs. Adjusting for these costs, earnings increased 8% and margin was 15.3%. Another way to look at it, the core Electronics business, when fully excluding Sound Solutions, grew margin 20 basis points to 18.5%. Book-to-bill ended at 0.97.
Our Electronic Assembly equipment and test group saw revenue decline 4% from the prior year. Comparing this group's third quarter revenue with the prior year, sales increased in solar as we continue to work through our backlog. Electronic Assembly sales were stable and semicon-related revenue was down approximately 30%. Sequentially into the fourth quarter, we expect this group's solar sales to decline due to weak order levels and semicon revenue to remain stable to slightly down, albeit at a low level. Further, we anticipated the current dynamics in the solar and semicon markets to continue in the near term. 
Lastly, our communications components companies. Revenue increased 53% on the strength of Knowles and the addition of Sound Solutions. Sound Solutions sales of $92 million accounted for 41 points of the growth in communications components. 
Now going to Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was $30 million, an increase of $4 million over last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense was $34 million, essentially flat with the prior year and also in line with expectations. With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was 25.6%. This rate was positively impacted by a $0.01 discrete tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the third quarter rate would have been 26.4%. This lower rate was influenced by the sale of businesses in the quarter. We now expect the full year normalized effective rate to be approximately 27% going forward.
Turning to Slide 11. Our revenue growth forecast of 20% remains largely unchanged from last quarter, with some changes in business mix. Organic growth is estimated to be around 13%, and acquisition growth is expected to contribute 7%. 
Breaking down organic growth by segment. We now expect Electronic Technologies to be in the range of 8% to 9%, down around five points from the previous forecast driven by weak semi and solar order rates. Engineered Systems remain largely unchanged from our previous forecast and should be in a range of 8% to 9%. Industrial Products is now forecasted to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase of about two points from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluid Management's revenue growth is now forecasted to be in the range of 20% to 21%, up about five points. This significant increase is driven by broad-based growth in their end markets. 
With respect to acquisition growth, Fluid Management should increase 14%, a one point improvement from our prior forecast. In total, Fluid Management's revenues should increased 34% to 35%, whereas Electronic Technologies acquisitions will add 15%, a one point improvement from our prior forecast for the full year growth of 23% to 24%. Lastly, Industrial Products acquisitions should add around 1%. Corporate expense and interest expense are unchanged from our previous guidance. CapEx should now be at the high end of our forecast, 3% of full year revenue. 
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume mix and price now stand at $0.60 to $0.65 for the full year while net productivity is essentially unchanged at $0.26 to $0.28. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver $0.07 to $0.08, an increase of $0.01 from our previous guidance. We continue to make investments in our growth spaces, with the impact of $0.14 to $0.17. Interest expense is unchanged at $0.03. Lastly, our improved normalized tax rate and discrete tax benefits will add $0.25 for the full year, up $0.02 from the last forecast. In total, we are now forecasting full year EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.50.
Let's turn to Slide 13, which reconciles our current guidance with our prior guidance. On the last earnings call, we provided guidance of $4.50 to $4.60. After adjusting for $0.14, representing the full year forecasted 2011 operating earnings of Paladin and Crenlo, our full year adjusted guidance was $4.36 to $4.46. We then add $0.04 for performance and $0.02 for the third quarter tax benefits. The result is increased guidance of $0.06 at the midpoint and a new guidance range of $4.45 to $4.50, representing an increase of 20% from last year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

The portfolio of changes we've made this year have resulted in a better group of companies than we've ever had before. We are very well positioned in our five growth spaces and poised for further investment in growth. Accordingly, I expect Dover to perform better than before in both strong and modest markets.

For sure, in the first quarter, we're probably being a little bit cautious in saying it's probably not going to mean much of a change in the first half. But don't lose sight of the fact that the largest piece in this group of companies is actually our Electronic Assembly. And John, it's not just been stable '10 to '11. It's actually rather amazing how stable this part of the business has been sequentially through 2011. And we see that fact pattern continuing into 2012 as well. Different dynamics. To tell you -- and we've got a strong recurring part, strong recurring revenue in Electronic Assembly. And what we have noticed over the last couple of years, that the fact patterns of market cycles and market dynamics are a bit different between semicon test and Electronic Assembly, at least for us. Because today, the bulk -- and I'm not going to give you a percentage, but I'm going to tell you it's rather significant, that the bulk of our activity in Electronic Assembly is around the smartphone and handset markets. Now maybe Brad wants to add something else."

As I commented on earlier, we're really working down backlog at this point, John, because the order rate intake is very, very slow. So sequentially, solar actually drops from third to fourth by almost 50% in terms of sales. And I would say the same thing with respect to what Bob said on the semi is that we don't see solar recovery really at this point until maybe the back half of next year. So one way to think about it is we love the solar business. It's ramped up dramatically in the first half. Second half has been weak. That'll continue a little bit into the early parts of '12 and hopefully recover after that as we start to see some of those businesses pop back."

And Bob, your comment suggests that you didn't really see much of a change. I guess, the question comes down to really just the trajectory, though. I mean, the trajectory seems to be somewhat unsustainable based on rig count. And that may not be true. I'm just curious as to your thoughts around the trajectory. And then really, the other part of this is as you mix internationally, like I know you opened a plant in the Middle East, as you mix internationally over time, do those international revenues come at a lower profit margin?

We see rig count deployment continuing to grow here in the fourth quarter. And John, what I'll tell you, all of the customers that we're talking to and all the data that we're looking at calls for a further rig count deployment again, growth in it next year. And again, that correlates with about 70% of our business. The 30% that's not highly correlated with rig count has more to do with downstream distribution and power gen. And the growth rates in that part of our business are actually expanding. I would label that as prep, part of the late cycle part of our Energy portfolio.

So kind of down 30% in the first half, flat in the second half, if we want to assume that, down 15% for the total. I think your run rate comments on solar would assume kind of down 45% or 50% next year. You're talking about EA being pretty stable.

We're going through a little bit of a gyration and a pause right now. But we happen to believe that solar is going to be a good market for us to play in. And as we move into 2012, actually more of our attention moves on solar to making sure we're prepared even better than we have been this past year to support solar production and consumption in China. The solar part of the business, you'll see us continue to make investments in people and product development."

And I just think maybe there's more to do potentially in this space that would be a lot clearer for your story going forward even though it's a small piece. That's what happens. Little pieces like this become bigger focus points. Despite, like what you said, I mean, your five growth spaces are driving the company, yet that's, for some reason, not what we end up talking about, right? So that's all I was saying. Can I get a question also? Just in terms of Knowles, when you think about some of the timing, there's been a little noise quarter-to-quarter on some things around timing of cell phone launches. Has that been impacting you guys with some of the big players that are out there?"

And folks, I've got to tell you, Hill PHOENIX has had a remarkable year. In an overall market that's probably down 6% to 8%, they've actually grown top line five percentage points, and have expanded their margins for the year by about 100 basis points. And they're quite well positioned. But you're specifically asking about order rates, and let me give you a number or let me help you with a little bit of color here. If you were to remove the Hill PHOENIX from the Engineered Systems numbers for the third quarter, book-to-bill for both Engineered Products as well as Product ID would have been greater than 1.0. So what we're seeing in the book-to-bill for Engineered Products in the third quarter is the impact of the seasonality that we've been talking about and sharing with you for three years now of just the change between third quarter full production and fourth quarter slowdown seasonality and transition into the new year. But again, absent Hill PHOENIX, the entire segment and both individual platforms, and Engineered Systems would have had a positive book-to-bill."
