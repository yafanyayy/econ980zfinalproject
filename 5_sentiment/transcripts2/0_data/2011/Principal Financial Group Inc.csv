And finally, I'll talk about t",1548,"Thanks, John and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll comment on three areas. First, I want to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2010 results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital management plans. And finally, I'll talk about the longer-term opportunities of our strategy. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments. As we talked about at our Investor Day December, we remain well positioned for the unprecedented opportunities for long-term growth, both in the U.S. and in key emerging international markets. We remain convinced that our strategies are the right ones that capitalize on these opportunities and fourth quarter results validate that based on the continued signs of growth across our businesses. As to the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the operating earnings given the accounting noise that Terry will discuss and we see same momentum in sales inflows as we mentioned on the last call. Items of note for the quarter are: record total company assets under management of $319 billion, including record assets under management and record net cash flows for Principal International; record sales for Principal Funds and strong full service accumulation sales results, with good momentum heading into 2011; and double-digit earnings growth on a combined basis for our high-growth segments, retirement and Investor Services accumulation businesses, Principal Global Investors and Principal International. These results come in spite of an economic recovery that remains challenged, especially for the small and medium business sector, with slow employment growth and constrained credit conditions. Our broad distribution footprint, best in class solutions and operational discipline have allowed us to return to something closer to a normal operating environment despite the economic challenges. I'd like to discuss full-year results in more detail as they better highlight key trends, as well as indicators of what to expect going forward. Let me first discuss the sales and growth metrics for 2010. 
First, as mentioned earlier, record total company assets under management of $319 billion, which gives us positive momentum heading into 2011. Full Service Accumulation sales of $6.6 billion, up 32% and net cash flow of $600 million against an industry still in outflow. Record mutual funds sales of $9.3 billion, up 21% from 2009, Principal International deposits of $25.8 billion helped generate record net cash flow of $4.7 billion, driving assets under management to a record $45.8 billion. Fee revenue for Principal Global Investors of $467 million, up 9% over 2009, with solid investment performance across all asset classes; individualized sales, up 21% over 2009, driven by an 81% increase in life insurance solutions focused on the SMB and business owner market. 
In short, we saw momentum building across the growth metrics for our businesses during 2010, with a strong finish in fourth quarter, giving us an optimistic tone as we move into 2011. 
Next, let me discuss operating earnings results for our businesses in 2010. Total company operating earnings were $845 million, a 15% increase over 2009. This reflects the growth metrics beginning to come through, along with our continuing expense discipline, which creates operational leverage. Full service accumulation earnings of $301 million, up 19% over 2009. Mutual fund earnings of $40 million, up 70% over 2009. Record individual annuity operating earnings of $119 million, up 18% over 2009. Record earnings from Principal International of $137 million, up 15% over 2009 despite the negative impact of the reduced ownership in Brasilprev, our Brazilian joint venture as of June 2010. Principal Global Investors operating earnings of $59 million, up 53% over 2009. U.S. insurance solutions operating earnings of $194 million, down 5% from 2009 but continuing to provide solid diversification to our earnings streams. 
So, as we look back at 2010 and think about how that positions us for 2011, we see a tightly integrated set of businesses. Our hybrid business model of asset management and risk products in U.S. and emerging international markets is performing well, as good momentum and exceptional long-term growth prospects even in an economy that continues to be challenged. 
Now, let me move on to capital management starting with our investment portfolio. Our portfolio performed well in 2010, with losses coming in lower than our beginning of the year expectations due to ongoing recovery in corporate credit and commercial real estate. Regarding CMBS, as we said at Investor Day, we expect delinquencies to continue to rise in 2011. However, our accounting processes require that we impair the securities whenever losses are anticipated, which is often 12 to 18 months before the actual bond losses occur. We monitor this portfolio closely and the losses continue to be within our expected range overall. We expect CMBS-related impairments to be approximately $25 million after tax lower in 2011 than in 2010. In short, this is an improving picture. 
Now, let me touch on capital. As of year end, we have approximately $1.6 billion in excess capital, which we are defining as capital above that needed for our 350% risk-based capital ratio. As we mentioned in the last call, regulators continue to review capital standards and reserving methods coming out of the financial crisis, so we've been cautious in expressing a timeframe for deploying the excess capital. Just before year end, the NAIC released their capital requirements for CMBS portfolios using Blackrock's model. This change reduced excess capital by approximately $250 million in the short term. In the longer term, we continue to believe that our portfolio will performed to our expectations and that our earnings and net income will remain strong. Therefore, we still expect to be able to deploy approximately $700 million of capital over the next 12 months for appropriate merger and acquisition and share buyback, while still retaining our desired capital cushion. We will be disciplined as we deploy this, as well as continue to keep our eyes open, looking for further accounting or regulatory changes that could have an impact. 
Let me close by reiterating a few key points from our Investor Day, as well as discuss the longer-term opportunities that we continue to make good progress with. First, as we mentioned in Investor Day, we have taken a number of steps to further derisk our businesses, including getting out of the CMBS securitization business, winding down our Medical business and reducing our Investment Only business. These decisions not only create a remaining set of transparent and integrated businesses but they create meaningfully larger amounts of free cash flow and higher return on equity over time. With our current business profile, we expect that approximately 65% of operating earnings can be used for merger and acquisition or return to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve 50 to 80 basis points improvement in overall company return on equity annually, growing to a return on equity above 15% over time. This is the power of our hybrid business model with purposeful diversification. 2010 was another year of good success in implementing our long-term global strategy, with an example being our entry into the mutual fund markets in Thailand and Indonesia. 
The need for U.S. workers to safeguard their retirement is real and the growth of the middle income class of investors in emerging markets over the next 25 years is undeniable. Thus, we see continuing growth and improved operating earnings from our key growth engines, Retirement and Investor Services Accumulation businesses, Principal International and Principal Global Investors, on a sustained basis for decades. This is the right strategy for long-term success and the fact that we have had this strategy in place for over 10 years gives us a substantial lead over others who have now begun to focus on these opportunities. I'm proud of our effort and accomplishments in 2010 and I'm excited about the long-term value for shareholders that we are creating. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out three nice recognitions for this quarter. The Principal was ranked number 159 on Newsweek's Green Rankings, an exclusive list of America's 500 largest companies assessed on their environmental impact and reputation among environmental experts. This is the second year that Principal has made the list. I'm very proud of this recognition of our sustainability efforts. As another example of our efforts, Principal Real Estate Investors continues to gain recognition as a leader in the development of green real estate. Additionally this quarter, Principal Global Investors became a signatory for the United Nations-backed Principals for Responsible Investment. Signatories commit to considering the six principles of responsible investment related to environmental, social and corporate governance issues in the course of doing business. It is the Principal way to conduct business with integrity so our signatory status is a natural extension of our core values and further reflects our commitment to responsible global citizenship. And finally, I want to mention the recognition that Principal funds received from Barron's over the weekend. Principal funds finished third in the rankings of Best Fund Families for 2010 and also finished as the seventh best fund family for the past 10 years. These are powerful recognitions for Principal Funds and are the result of their asset management discipline and retirement expertise. This recognition will provide even further momentum on top of the strong year that Principal Funds had in 2010. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus on operating earnings for the quarter and full year, including continued strong expense management, net income including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio; and the strength of the capital position and strong balance sheet as we enter 2011. We view the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 as a continuation of an improving picture that began earlier in 2010. We continue to see positive trends in our businesses, and as Larry said, we're excited about their growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. Starting with total company results, most notably for the year, we finished 2010 with a record assets under management. At $319 billion, our assets under management exceed our pre-crisis high, through positive net cash flows despite volatile investment performance. Total company earnings improved 15% to $845 million for 2010, on 14% higher average assets under management. There were a number of items influencing comparability between the full-year periods. Some of the bigger items include the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture as of June 1, the sale back of our Investment Only business and the impact of the equity markets on Deferred Acquisition Cost amortization expense and the assumption changes on net GAAP reserves. On an adjusted basis, full-year earnings were up 27% on a 14% increase in average assets under management compared to 2009, a very solid result reflecting strong operational leverage. Fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings were up 5% to $214 million or $0.66 per share compared to a year ago. This result was negatively impacted by $0.04 due to an increase in net reserves in individual life following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. Adjusting for this item, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.70. DAC amortization expense benefited from the favorable equity markets during the quarter, but these benefits were offset by the impact of lower future fees in our Mexican pension business. 
Now, let me discuss the business year end results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings were up 21% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year 2010 compared to their respective periods in 2009. Full year 2009 results benefited from $17 million in additional after-tax fee income from the opportunistic early settlement of Investment Only liabilities. Adjusting for this, operating earnings for 2010 are up 18% on 10% higher average account values, again reflecting strong expense management. The accumulation businesses had a record account values of $160 billion at year end. Full service accumulation's fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 13% from a year-ago quarter on a 10% increase in average account values. Sales in the fourth quarter were very strong at $3.2 billion, which put total full service accumulation sales for the year at $6.6 billion, a 32% increase over prior year. As Larry mentioned earlier, we ended the year with positive net cash flows of $600 million compared to the negative cash flows projected for the industry by Cerulli. In the fourth quarter, we satisfied all the withdrawal requests in the Principal U.S. property separate account, causing our plan count to decline by more than 1,400. In addition, there were several economic factors contributing to the negative plan as we've seen over the last few years. The economic pressures that small to medium-size businesses are facing play a big part in the overall decline. We saw 50% fewer startups, which is consistent with the industry and 20% higher planned terminations, as employers eliminate their retirement plans. We continue to maintain pricing discipline to protect margins. We have taken additional steps over the last several quarters to offset this negative trend in plan count, including enhanced internal processes to better identify, predict and retain at risk clients and intensified focus on unbundled solutions through third party administrator distribution platforms to attract and retain business. This complements our total retirement suite bundled solutions; and choice pricing rollout allowing clients the ability to tailor service models and pricing to better meet their unique needs. And though overall plan count is down, full service accumulation average account values, which drives revenue growth is up 16% over 2009. Principal Funds continues to demonstrate its strong growth potential. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were up 24% to $11 million on a 15% increase in average account values. Principal Funds also delivered record sales of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and a record $1.6 billion in net cash flow for the year, helping drive account values to $36 billion at year end. We continue to see success through all of our distribution channels in a broad array of fund offerings. Individual annuity earnings were $33 million for the fourth quarter, up 37% compared to the year-ago quarter on 7% higher average account values. This primarily reflects strong investment income performance in the quarter, including higher asset prepayment fee income. Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 51% for the quarter to $19 million and 53% for the full year to $59 million compared to their respective periods in 2009. The improvement reflects higher average assets under management, strong expense management and an increase in transaction fees, which continue to trend up. Solid investment performance resulted in higher performance fees as well. Principal Global Investors lost a loan-only sector equity mandate of $1.3 billion, contributing to unaffiliate outflows of $900 million for the fourth quarter. This was offset by more than $900 million in new real estate mandates in the quarter. Though we are disappointed in the loss, the fees from the mandate were low. Since new inflows to real estate and international equities are a much higher fee, we saw increased revenue from fourth quarter flows. 
Investment performance continues to be good. More than 90% of our asset allocation options rank in the top half of their peer group on a one-year basis. We continue to be optimistic as we look into 2011 and see increased searches in specialized investment options where we have expertise, such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings were down 22% to $31 million for the quarter and up 15% to a record $137 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. Fourth quarter and full year 2009 results include higher economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev. Fourth quarter 2010 results were also reduced by the impact of DAC amortization adjustments for lower future fees in our Mexican pension business. Adjusting for these items, inflation in Latin America and foreign exchange, operating earnings were up 18% this quarter over a year-ago quarter. Principal International finished the year with a record reported assets under management of $46 billion, up $11 billion or 32% from year end 2009 on record net cash flow of $4.7 billion for the full year. A reminder that our assets under management of our Chinese asset management joint venture were up 15% during 2010 to $6.9 billion and are not included in the reported assets under management. Our partnership with Banco do Brasil continues to prosper, as we see growth in assets under management and cash flows in this business in excess of 35% annually. U.S. insurance solution operating earnings decreased 7% to $52 million for the quarter and were down 5% to $194 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. Individual life had operating earnings of $22 million compared to $31 million in the year-ago quarter. The shortfall primarily reflects a one-time increase in net reserves following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. Other impacts, such as a strong equity market performance, offset some of the decline. On a combined basis, run rate earnings were reduced by $11 million after tax. The run rate for individual life operating earnings remains at $30 million to $32 million per quarter. 
Turning to special benefits, operating earnings were $30 million for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $26 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase was largely due to better claims experience and improved investment income. Overall, sales were good for the quarter, up 50% over the year-ago quarter, due to increases across all products, particularly in the group lines, which faced intense headwinds in fourth quarter 2009. We saw growth in membership, particularly in the second half of the year, with in group membership up in the fourth quarter for the first time since first quarter 2008 and overall membership up for the second straight quarter. Premium and fees also grew for the third straight quarter. The Corporate segment had operating losses of $39 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $30 million in the year-ago quarter. As a reminder, corporate expenses include corporate debt, preferred stock dividends and overhead previously allocated to the Health division. As we manage down corporate overhead expenses over the next 12 to 18 months, we anticipate the corporate operating losses to decrease over time. We expect full year 2011 operating losses for the Corporate segment to be approximately $120 million. Total company net income was up 40% this quarter to $199 million and up 13% to $666 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. After tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $37 million in fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit-related losses. We also continue to see sequential improvement in commercial mortgage home loan losses while CMBS losses continue to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. 
Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share, excluding NOCI, ended the quarter at a record $27.82, up 6% from a year-ago quarter. At $900 million in net unrealized capital gains, we were up $2.3 billion from fourth quarter 2009 and down $600 million from last quarter. During the quarter, we had a $600 million gain due to the tightening of credit spreads, offset by $1.2 billion of losses from the impact of rising interest rates. Let me remind you that the change in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement does not have an economic impact because of our strong asset liability management. Additionally, our debt to capital ratio is 15%. The strength of our balance sheet reflects the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. 
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 420%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total excess capital, split roughly even between the life company and the holding company. Total excess capital in the quarter was impacted by our dividend payout and the NAIC year end review of CMBS portfolios. The year end RBC ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 25 points due to this change. Our moderate risk scenario reflects the improvement in the CMBS market and our expected losses have actually improved. However, the negative impact of the RBC ratio is one of the reasons we are committed to holding a higher component of excess capital as cushion to absorb some of these capital changes. We have a very strong enterprise risk management framework and are focused on the future as we examine potential regulatory and accounting proposals. 
As we said at Investor Day, even with our additional capital cushion, we still plan to deploy approximately $700 million of capital over the next 12 months for appropriate M&A and share buybacks. Our hybrid business model gives us the opportunity to continue to generate deployable free cash flow throughout the year. All four of the rating agencies now have the life insurance industry on stable outlook. With improving market fundamentals, a business model that requires less capital to support organic growth and our ability to generate free cash flow, we have enhanced our ability to increase shareholder value overtime through strategic capital redeployment. We are excited about the financial flexibility our balance sheet gives us in 2011 and beyond. We are very pleased with our results in 2010. While many of the challenges of the slow economic recovery persists, we are building momentum and are excited about the increasing signs of growth in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

Certainly, as we had said, we think there's somewhere around $700 million over the next 12 months that's deployable relative to M&A and our return, or do share buybacks. Having said that, we also commented that we're a little bit cautious relative to what seems to be an ongoing parade, sort of capital regulatory and accounting changes. And we certainly have seen this in the banking sector and we started to see it in the insurance sector, albeit there's a bit less of it than there has been. So I think that common sense would indicate that while I think some level of usage of that $700 million could start in the first half of the year, I also think it's likely that we'll want to be slightly cautious and conservative. So we certainly wouldn't plan to have all of that or necessarily even the majority of that in the first half of the year. It's likely to be more towards the back half as hopefully the economic picture improves. I'll have Julia talk a bit about why our portfolio was impacted a little bit more."

The other point I would just make on this is that that is a snapshot as of 12/31 and we've already started to see some of the pricing in the marketplace improve fairly substantially on those securities.

But as we have seen in prior quarters, when the S&P is up substantially during the quarter, it always tends to put pressure on net cash flows. And just as a reminder, we saw the S&P up 10% in the third quarter. We saw the S&P up 12% in the fourth quarter. So the nature of that where contract withdrawals tend to be processed toward the end of the quarter, if not the actual end of the quarter date. You'll get the full reflection of that on the payout side and you don't necessarily have that on the deposit side. Just kind of understanding that in theory when the market is up substantially, it will pinch net cash flow and obviously, the reverse when the market goes the other way. Having said that, we don't think there's a systemic problem in FSA. I'll let Dan talk a little more about that and then we'll shift to Jim for the PGI question."

When we look at those withdrawals, we've dug into the gory details and it's around our emerging and dynamic segments. It's not our institutional division. We've identified specific clients and some of it is a little bit of a hangover from the recent Q, with both the advisor communities, as well as with some of those clients. We've also been very aggressive rolling out our KPI solution for those clients who want local third-party administrative services. And then if you take it down more level of detail, you'll find that there were a couple of Defined Benefit cases that had terminated and one ESOP that went out of existence. Those three cases were fairly significant impact on the withdrawals. As it relates to your question on fee disclosure and fiduciary standards, we're on it and we've been in active conversations in the debate with the Department of Labor. As you know, this summer, there'll be disclosure requirements for plan sponsors. That's still frankly in flex and no final decisions are yet made. And then the participant fees comes at year end. We are fully prepared to do that. We're making the necessary systems adjustments. It does level the playing field. There's no one that's going to be held out as uncompetitive. And I would tell you, given the fact we've got our group annuity contract, as well as our registered product, we probably have as much flexibility as any 401(k) provider out there and I would also pile on top of that to say, about 65% of our business is Total Retirement Solutions. So it really is a more consultative discussion around their DB, their DC, they're not qualified, they're ESOP. The other issue that's open right now is around fiduciary standard. Today, we do help our plan sponsors in giving them choices for their investment options. The question becomes will they have to be more self served on that score and we're working closely with their advisor and their advisor becomes in fact the fiduciary to the plan and help them in picking and choosing of those investment options. And again I would tell you that we have active conversations going on in Washington to debate the merits and the extent by which these fiduciary standards are going to be levied across 401(k) service providers."

It had performed in accordance with what they wanted. They were happy. But they decided to move away from that sector in terms of a broad exposure. As far as we're concerned, it was only on a 15 basis point fee, as befits such a very large mandate. It's one of those interesting things in the institutional business. Institutional asset managers tend to have, on average, something like 40 to 45 basis points is their average fee. But we're seeing with the changing mix of business quite a lot of range around that. And obviously, a 15 basis point fee even over $1 billion is a lot less attractive than the type of business that Terry referred to in real estate and international equities where the typical fees are more like 50, 60, 70 basis points. It's that change of mix, modest change of mix which is why the flows in the quarter, even though they saw a capital outflow, actually saw incremental revenue so far as we're concerned. And I think that looking forward, obviously we don't want to lose assets. We want to gain assets too. But it's more important that we gain revenues."

And I think out of sort of 10 names that were in there, there was about four insurance companies. We began an active dialogue on two fronts, not to take you through all the gory detail, but one is to begin or to at least consider how we can have more interaction with sort of the folks at NYU since it appears that they are working under some arrangement with FSOC, to have more dialogue with them to sort of explain methodologies that we think make more sense. That would be one point. Second point would be that as it sits right now, I think there's something like 13 members under Dodd Frank on FSOC, and three of those if you will are allocated to the insurance side of the business. Unfortunately today, only one of those three is actually named and the seat and actually taking part in the discussions. Two of those have not yet filled. And so we're also working hard to make sure that we get those two seats filled so that the discussion going forward can actually involve a greater level of expertise from the insurance industry relative to what systematically important really means.

The 1,400 accounts that impact not only the case count but impacted withdrawals as well. We've looked closely. We feel we've got a systemic issue. The competition's out there but a number of things that we're doing to address competition. One is to be more aggressive in rolling out that TPA strategy. If we look at assets retained and new business with our TPA strategy in 2010, that number was $900 million. That's a significant increase from where it's been in the past. We've also designed a model to go out there and look at where some of these clients are at risk and working with the advisers more closely to try to anticipate if they might move. I will tell you that the significant improvement that we've seen in our investment performance that Jim's manufacturing for us is also helping us go out and make a very strong argument that the proprietary in the boutique investment strategies that we have here at Principal are viable. And what probably gives me some confidence around the stemming of the tide on these withdrawals is just the sheer strength that we have right now going into Q1 on sales. If you look at Q4, you had a lines to have more than $100 million in sales compared to $7 million in 2009. And if you also look closely, you'll find that we've been able to hold up our margins fairly well. So we are losing perhaps some of the lower margin, non-TRS small 401(k) account balances. And that's something we'll just have to continue to adjust our model to reflect."

What we are talking about here, what we've been talking about here last couple of questions around withdrawals is essentially, and again to your point, we need to be again perhaps more specific but these have been, what we've been talking about have been what we call contract withdrawals. So those are situations where an employer in association with their advisor decides to move a plan from Principal to and pick another provider. Much as we get plans coming the other way from Fidelity to Principal or from Tero to Principal or whatever happens to be. So we're discussing sort of these contracts plan to plan kinds of transfers. To your point on participant withdrawals, participant withdrawals, we continue to see about 50% to 52% retention of those participants withdrawals and that trend has stayed very, very consistent quarter by quarter and year by year and there's been certainly no deterioration in that. So again, this increase, which I will argue is still primarily associated one with the, two with the strong equity market performance, which tends to push net cash flow. But again, these are contract withdrawals more in the smaller and sort of midsized plan count areas."

We are seeing quite a lot of investment institutions with large mandates, for example, in core equities or in the case of the one we lost last quarter, sector equities. And they're moving to essentially passive exposure to the sector. And that is affecting those who, for example, manage a lot of large mandates in U.S. equities. And I think that probably will continue because you're seeing long-term relatively limited added value for most managers in those types of mandates. And of course, that won't help us because we're not offering passive management in the institutional market. Having said that, it's kind of a core satellite thing. The more they put into these larger more passive or enhanced index mandates, the more appetite they have for the higher added value mandates, which range through international equities and real estate and some of the high-yielding sectors that we're very good at. So it would tend to be negative to us if it continues, which it might. It would tend to be negative for us in terms of the asset count. But it should actually ultimately be quite positive on the revenues given that we have a strong focus on those satellite high added value mandates."

Second, I'll provide an update on our capital management plans. And finally, I'll talk about the longer-term opportunities of our strategy. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments. As we talked about at our Investor Day in December, we remain well positioned for the unprecedented opportunities for long-term growth, both in the U.S. and in key emerging international markets. We remain convinced that our strategies are the right ones that capitalize on these opportunities, and fourth quarter results validate that based on the continued signs of growth across our businesses. As to the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the operating earnings, given the accounting noise that Terry will discuss, and we see the same momentum in sales and flows as we mentioned on the last call. 
Items of note for the quarter are: record total company assets under management of $319 billion, including record assets under management and record net cash flows for Principal International; record sales for Principal Funds and strong full service accumulation sales results, with good momentum heading into 2011; and double-digit earnings growth on a combined basis for our high-growth segments, retirement and Investor Services accumulation businesses, Principal Global Investors and Principal International. These results come in spite of an economic recovery that remains challenged, especially for the small, medium business sector, with slow employment growth and constrained credit conditions. Our broad distribution footprint, best in class solutions and operational discipline have allowed us to return to something closer to a normal operating environment despite the economic challenges. I'd like to discuss full year results in more detail as they better highlight key trends, as well as indicators of what to expect going forward. 
Let me first discuss the sales and growth metrics for 2010.  First, as mentioned earlier, record total company assets under management of $319 billion, which gives us positive momentum heading into 2011. Full Service Accumulation sales of $6.6 billion, up 32% and net cash flow of $600 million against an industry still in outflow. Record mutual funds sales of $9.3 billion, up 21% from 2009, Principal International deposits of $25.8 billion helped generate record net cash flow of $4.7 billion, driving assets under management to a record $45.8 billion. Fee revenue for Principal Global Investors of $467 million, up 9% over 2009, with solid investment performance across all asset classes; individualized sales, up 21% over 2009, driven by an 81% increase in Life Insurance Solutions focused on the SMB and business-owner market.  In short, we saw momentum building across the growth metrics for our businesses during 2010, with a strong finish in fourth quarter, giving us an optimistic tone as we move into 2011. 
Next, let me discuss operating earnings results for our businesses in 2010. Total company operating earnings were $845 million, a 15% increase over 2009. This reflects the growth metrics beginning to come through, along with our continuing expense discipline, which creates operational leverage. Full service accumulation earnings of $301 million, up 19% over 2009. Mutual fund earnings of $40 million, up 70% over 2009. Record individual annuity operating earnings of $119 million, up 18% over 2009. Record earnings from Principal International of $137 million, up 15% over 2009 despite the negative impact of the reduced ownership in Brasilprev, our Brazilian joint venture as of June 2010; Principal Global Investors operating earnings of $59 million, up 53% over 2009; U.S. insurance solutions operating earnings of $194 million, down 5% from 2009, but continuing to provide solid diversification to our earnings streams.  So as we look back at 2010 and think about how that positions us for 2011, we see a tightly integrated set of businesses. Our hybrid business model of asset management and risk products in U.S. and emerging international markets is performing well, as good momentum and exceptional long-term growth prospects even in an economy that continues to be challenged. 
Now let me move on to capital management starting with our investment portfolio. Our portfolio performed well in 2010, with losses coming in lower than our beginning of the year expectations due to ongoing recovery in corporate credit and commercial real estate. Regarding CMBS, as we said at Investor Day, we expect delinquencies to continue to rise in 2011. However, our accounting processes require that we impair the securities whenever losses are anticipated, which is often 12 to 18 months before the actual bond losses occur. We monitor this portfolio closely and the losses continue to be within our expected range overall. We expect CMBS-related impairments to be approximately $25 million after tax lower in 2011 than 2010. In short, this is an improving picture. 
Now let me touch on capital. As of year end, we have approximately $1.6 billion in excess capital, which we are defining as capital above that needed for our 350% risk-based capital ratio. As we mentioned in the last call, regulators continue to review capital standards and reserving methods coming out of the financial crisis, so we've been cautious in expressing a timeframe for deploying the excess capital. Just before year end, the NAIC released their capital requirements for CMBS portfolios using BlackRock's model. This change reduced excess capital by approximately $250 million in the short term. In the longer term, we continue to believe that our portfolio will perform to our expectations, and that our earnings and net income will remain strong. Therefore, we still expect to be able to deploy approximately $700 million of capital over the next 12 months for appropriate merger and acquisition and share buyback, while still retaining our desired capital cushion. We will be disciplined as we deploy this, as well as continue to keep our eyes open, looking for further accounting or regulatory changes that could have an impact. 
Let me close by reiterating a few key points from our Investor Day, as well as discuss the longer-term opportunities that we continue to make good progress with. First, as we mentioned in Investor Day, we have taken a number of steps to further de-risk our businesses, including getting out of the CMBS securitization business, winding down our Medical business and reducing our Investment Only business. These decisions not only create a remaining set of transparent and integrated businesses, but they create meaningfully larger amounts of free cash flow and higher return on equity over time. With our current business profile, we expect that approximately 65% of operating earnings can be used for merger and acquisition or return to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve 50 to 80 basis points improvement in overall company return on equity annually, growing to a return on equity above 15% over time. This is the power of our hybrid business model with purposeful diversification. 2010 was another year of good success in implementing our long-term global strategy, with an example being our entry into the mutual fund markets in Thailand and Indonesia.  
The need for U.S. workers to save for their retirement is real, and the growth of a middle income class of investors in emerging markets over the next 25 years is undeniable. Thus, we see continuing growth and improved operating earnings from our key growth engines, Retirement and Investor Services Accumulation businesses, Principal International and Principal Global Investors, on a sustained basis for decades. This is the right strategy for long-term success, and the fact that we have had this strategy in place for over 10 years gives us a substantial lead over others who have now begun to focus on these opportunities. I'm proud of our effort and accomplishments in 2010, and I'm excited about the long-term value for shareholders that we are creating. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out three nice recognitions for this quarter. The Principal was ranked number 159 on Newsweek's Green Rankings, an exclusive list of America's 500 largest companies assessed on their environmental impact and reputation among environmental experts. This is the second year that Principal has made the list. I'm very proud of this recognition of our sustainability efforts. As another example of our efforts, Principal Real Estate Investors continues to gain recognition as a leader in the development of green real estate. Additionally this quarter, Principal Global Investors became a signatory for the United Nations-backed Principal for Responsible Investment. Signatories commit to considering the six principles of responsible investment related to environmental, social and corporate governance issues in the course of doing business. It is the Principal way to conduct business with integrity, so our signatory status is a natural extension of our core values, and further reflects our commitment to responsible global citizenship. 
And finally, I want to mention the recognition that Principal funds received from Barron's over the weekend. Principal funds finished third in the rankings of Best Fund Families for 2010, and also finished as the seventh best fund family for the past 10 years. These are powerful recognitions for Principal Funds, and are the result of their asset management discipline and retirement expertise. This recognition will provide even further momentum on top of the strong year that Principal Funds had in 2010. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus on operating earnings for the quarter and full year, including continued strong expense management, net income including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio, and the strength of our capital position and strong balance sheet as we enter 2011. We view the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 as a continuation of an improving picture that began earlier in 2010. We continue to see positive trends in our businesses and as Larry said, we're excited about the growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. Starting with total company results, most notably for the year, we finished 2010 with a record assets under management. At $319 billion, our assets under management exceed our pre-crisis high, through positive net cash flows despite volatile investment performance. Total company earnings improved 15% to $845 million for 2010, on 14% higher average assets under management. There were a number of items influencing comparability between the full year periods. Some of the bigger items include the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture as of June 1, the scale back of our Investment Only business, and the impact of the equity markets on deferred acquisition cost amortization expense and the assumption changes on net GAAP reserves. 
On an adjusted basis, full-year earnings were up 27% on a 14% increase in average assets under management compared to 2009, a very solid result, reflecting strong operational leverage. Fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings were up 5% to $214 million or $0.66 per share compared to a year ago. This result was negatively impacted by $0.04 due to an increase in net reserves in individual life, following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. Adjusting for this item, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.70. DAC amortization expense benefited from the favorable equity markets during the quarter, but these benefits were offset by the impact of lower future fees in our Mexican pension business. 
Now let me discuss the business year results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings were up 21% in the fourth quarter, and 14% for the full year 2010 compared to their respective periods in 2009. Full year 2009 results benefited from $17 million in additional after-tax fee income from the opportunistic early settlement of Investment Only liabilities. Adjusting for this, operating earnings for 2010 are up 18% on 10% higher average account values, again reflecting strong expense management. The Accumulation businesses had a record account values of $160 billion at year end. Full Service Accumulation's fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 13% from a year-ago quarter on a 10% increase in average account values. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were very strong at $3.2 billion, which put total Full Service Accumulation sales for the year at $6.6 billion, a 32% increase over prior year. As Larry mentioned earlier, we ended the year with positive net cash flows of $600 million compared to the negative cash flows projected for the industry by Cerulli. In the fourth quarter, we satisfied all the withdrawal requests in the Principal U.S. Property Separate Account, causing our plan count to decline by more than 1,400. 
In addition, there were several economic factors contributing to the negative plan count trend, as we've seen over the last two years. The economic pressures that small to medium-size businesses are facing play a big part in the overall decline. We saw 50% fewer startups, which is consistent with the industry, and 20% higher planned terminations, as employers eliminate their retirement plans. We continue to maintain pricing discipline to protect margins, and we have taken additional steps over the last several quarters to offset this negative trend in plan count, including enhanced internal processes to better identify, predict and retain at-risk clients, and intensified focus on unbundled solutions through third party administrator distribution platforms to attract and retain business. This complements our Total Retirement Suite bundled solutions and choice pricing rollout, allowing clients the ability to tailor service models and pricing to better meet their unique needs. And though overall plan count is down, Full Service Accumulation average account values, which drives revenue growth, is up 16% over 2009. 
Principal Funds continues to demonstrate its strong growth potential. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were up 24% to $11 million on a 15% increase in average account values. Principal Funds also delivered record sales of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and a record $1.6 billion in net cash flow for the year, helping drive account values to $36 billion at year end. We continue to see success through all of our distribution channels in a broad array of fund offerings. Individual annuity earnings were $33 million for the fourth quarter, up 37% compared to the year-ago quarter on 7% higher average account values. This primarily reflects strong investment income performance in the quarter, including higher asset prepayment fee income. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 51% for the quarter to $19 million and 53% for the full year to $59 million compared to the respective periods in 2009. The improvement reflects higher average assets under management, strong expense management and an increase in transaction fees, which continue to trend up. Solid investment performance resulted in higher performance fees as well. Principal Global Investors lost a loan-only sector equity mandate of $1.3 billion, contributing to unaffiliate outflows of $900 million for the fourth quarter. This was offset by more than $900 million in new real estate mandates in the quarter. Though we are disappointed in the loss, the fees from the mandate were low. Since new inflows to real estate and international equities are on a much higher fees, we saw increased revenue from fourth quarter flows. 
Investment performance continues to be good. More than 90% of our asset allocation options rank in the top half of their peer group on a one-year basis. We continue to be optimistic as we look into 2011, and see increased searches in specialized investment options where we have expertise, such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings were down 22% to $31 million for the quarter and up 15% to a record $137 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. Fourth quarter and full year 2009 results include higher economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev. Fourth quarter 2010 results were also reduced by the impact of DAC amortization adjustments for lower future fees in our Mexican Pension business. Adjusting for these items, inflation in Latin America and foreign exchange, operating earnings were up 18% this quarter over a year-ago quarter. Principal International finished the year with a record reported assets under management of $46 billion, up $11 billion or 32% from year end 2009 on record net cash flow of $4.7 billion for the full year. A reminder, that our assets under management of our Chinese asset management joint venture were up 15% during 2010 to $6.9 billion, and are not included in the reported assets under management. 
Our partnership with Banco do Brasil continues to prosper, as we see growth in assets under management and cash flows in this business in excess of 35% annually. U.S. Insurance Solution operating earnings decreased 7% to $52 million for the quarter, and were down 5% to $194 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. Individual life had operating earnings of $22 million compared to $31 million in the year-ago quarter. The shortfall primarily reflects a one-time increase in net reserves, following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. Other impacts, such as a strong equity market performance, offset some of the decline. On a combined basis, run rate earnings were reduced by $11 million after tax. The run rate for individual life operating earnings remains at $30 million to $32 million per quarter. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings were $30 million for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $26 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase was largely due to better claims experience and improved investment income. Overall, sales were good for the quarter, up 50% over the year-ago quarter, due to increases across all products, particularly in the group lines, which faced intense headwinds in the fourth quarter of 2009. We saw growth in membership, particularly in the second half of the year, with in group membership up in the fourth quarter for the first time since first quarter 2008, and overall membership up for the second straight quarter. 
Premium and fees also grew for the third straight quarter. The Corporate segment had operating losses of $39 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $30 million in the year-ago quarter. As a reminder, corporate expenses include corporate debt, preferred stock dividends and overhead previously allocated to the Health division. As we manage down corporate overhead expenses over the next 12 to 18 months, we anticipate the corporate operating losses to decrease over time. We expect full year 2011 operating losses for the Corporate segment to be approximately $120 million. Total company net income was up 40% this quarter to $199 million, and up 13% to $666 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. After tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $37 million in fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit-related losses. We also continue to see sequential improvement in commercial mortgage for loan losses, while CMBS losses continue to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. 
Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share, excluding AOCI, ended the quarter at a record $27.82, up 6% from a year-ago quarter. At $900 million in net unrealized capital gains, we were up $2.3 billion from fourth quarter 2009, and down $600 million from last quarter. During the quarter, we had $600 million gain due to the tightening of credit spreads, offset by $1.2 billion of losses from the impact of rising interest rates. Let me remind you that the change in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement does not have an economic impact because of our strong asset liability management. Additionally, our debt to capital ratio is 15%. The strength of our balance sheet reflects the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. 
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 420%, relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total excess capital, split roughly even between the life company and the holding company. Total excess capital in the quarter was impacted by our dividend payout and the NAIC year end review of CMBS portfolios. The year end RBC ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 25 points due to this change. Our moderate risk scenario reflects the improvement in the CMBS market, and our expected losses have actually improved. However, the negative impact of the RBC ratio is one of the reasons we are committed to holding a higher component of excess capital as cushion to absorb some of these capital changes. We have a very strong enterprise risk management framework, and are focused on the future as we examine potential regulatory and accounting proposals. 
As we said at Investor Day, even with our additional capital cushion, we still plan to deploy approximately $700 million of capital over the next 12 months for appropriate M&A and share buybacks. Our hybrid business model gives us the opportunity to continue to generate deployable free cash flow throughout the year. All four of the rating agencies now have the life insurance industry on stable outlook. With improving market fundamentals, a business model that requires less capital to support organic growth and our ability to generate free cash flow, we have enhanced our ability to increase shareholder value overtime through strategic capital redeployment. We're excited about the financial flexibility our balance sheet gives us in 2011 and beyond. We are very pleased with the results in 2010. While many of the challenges of the slow economic recovery persist, we are building momentum and are excited about the increasing signs of growth in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

But as we have seen in prior quarters, when the S&P is up substantially during the quarter, it always tends to put pressure on net cash flows. And just as a reminder, we saw the S&P up 10% in the third quarter, and we saw the S&P up 12% in the fourth quarter. So the nature of that where contract withdrawals tend to be processed toward the end of the quarter, if not, on the actual end of the quarter date, you'll get the full reflection of that on the payout side, and you don't necessarily have that on the deposit side. So just kind of understanding that in periods when the market is up substantially, it will pinch net cash flow and obviously, the reverse when the market goes the other way.

When we look at those withdrawals, we've dug into the gory details, and it's around our emerging and dynamic segments. It's not our Institutional division. We've identified specific clients, and some of it is a little bit of a hangover from ERISA Q, with both the advisor communities, as well as with some of those clients. We've also been very aggressive rolling out our TPA solution for those clients who want local Third-party Administrative services. And then if you take it down in more level of detail, you'll find out that there were a couple of Defined Benefit cases that had terminated, and one ESOP that flat out, went out of the existence, and those three cases were fairly significant impact on the withdrawals. As it relates to your question on fee disclosure and fiduciary standards, we're on it, and we've been in active conversations in the debate with the Department of Labor. As you know, this summer, there'll be a disclosure requirements for plan sponsors. That's still frankly in flex, and no final decisions are yet made. And then the participant piece comes at year end. We are fully prepared to do that. We're making the necessary systems adjustments. It does level the playing field. There's no one that's going to be held out as uncompetitive. And I would tell you, given the fact we've got our group annuity contract, as well as our registered product, we probably have as much flexibility as any 401(k) provider out there, and I would also pile on top of that to say, as you know, about 65% of our business is Total Retirement Solutions. So it really is a more consultative discussion around their DB, their DC, they're not qualified, and they're ESOP. The other issue that's open right now is around fiduciary standard. Today, we do help our plan sponsors in giving them choices for their investment options. The question becomes, will they have to be more self served on that score, and work more closely with their advisor, and their advisor becomes, in fact, the fiduciary to the plan, and helping to the picking and the choosing of those investment options. And again, I would tell you that we have active conversations going on in Washington to debate the merits, and the extent by which these fiduciary standards are going to be levied across 401(k) service providers."

As far as we're concerned, it was only on a 15 basis point fee, as befits such a very large mandate. It's one of those interesting things in the Institutional business. Institutional asset managers tend to have, on average, something like 40 to 45 basis points of their average fee. What we're seeing with the changing mix of business quite a lot of range around that. And obviously, a 15 basis point fee even in over $1 billion is a lot less attractive than the type of business move that Terry referred to in real estate and international equities, where the typical fees are more like 50, 60, 70 basis points. It's that change of mix, modest change of mix which is why the flows in the quarter, even though they saw a capital outflow, actually saw incremental revenue so far as we're concerned.

As you know, they have begun a rule-making process to further flesh out what would be so-called systemically important financial institutions. And they've mentioned that, I think, there are approximately six criteria that they use in that determination. There has been also been the NYU study that was done. And I think out of sort of 10 names that were in there, there was about four -- there were insurance companies. We've began an active dialogue on two fronts, not to take you through all the gory details, but one is to begin or to at least consider how we can have more interaction with sort of the folks at NYU, since it appears that they're working under some arrangement with FSOC, to have more dialogue with them, to sort of explain methodologies that we think make more sense. That would be one point. The second point would be that as it sits right now, I think there's something like 13 members under Dodd-Frank on FSOC, and three of those, if you will, are allocated to the insurance side of the business. Unfortunately, today, only one of those three is actually named and in the seat, and actually taking part in the discussions. Two of those have not yet been filled, and so we're also working hard to make sure that we get those two seats filled, so that the discussion going forward can actually involve a greater level of expertise from the insurance industry relative to what systematically important really means. So again, a lot more to come. It is one of the reasons we're a little bit cautious. We're not only just watching it very carefully, but we're very, very fully engaged in that discussion, and we're going to do everything we can along with the industry to guide that going forward."

The reason you've heard us talk a little more recently about some of the activities around TPA, and unbundling is because that has more implications relative to case count. So as people have talked about case count and what you're doing around case count, part of the answer to that has been the TPA.

We washed out the 1,400 ERISA accounts that would impact not only the case count, but impacted withdrawals as well. We've looked closely at it. We do not feel we've got a systemic issue. The competition's out there, but a number of things that we're doing to address competition. One is to be more aggressive in rolling out that TPA strategy. If we look at assets retained and new business with our TPA strategy in 2010, that number was $900 million. That's a significant increase from where it's been in the past. We've also designed a model to go out there and look at where some of these clients are at risk, and working with the advisers more closely to try to anticipate if they might move. I will tell you that the significant improvement that we've seen in our investment performance, that Jim's manufacturing for us, is also helping us go out, make a very strong argument that the proprietary in the boutique investment strategies that we have here in Principal are viable. And what probably gives me some confidence around the stemming of the tide on these withdrawals is just the sheer strength that we have right now going into Q1 on sales. If you looked at Q4, you had a twelve alliance firms that have more than $100 million in sales compared to $7 million in 2009. And if you also look closely, you'll find that we've been able to hold up our margins fairly well. So we are losing perhaps some of the lower margin, non-TRS, small 401(k) account balances. And that's something we'll just have to continue to adjust our model to reflect. Hopefully, that helps, Colin."

We're seeing quite a lot of investment institutions with large mandates, for example, in core equities or in the case of the one we lost last quarter, sector equities. And they're moving to essentially passive exposures to the sector. And that is affecting those who, for example, manage a lot of large mandates in U.S. equities. And I think that probably will continue, because you're seeing long-term relatively limited added value for most managers in those types of mandates. And of course, that won't help us, because we're not offering passive management in the institutional market. Having said that, it's kind of a core satellite thing. The more they put into these larger more passive or enhanced index mandates, the more appetite they have for the higher added value mandates, which range through international equities and real estate and some of the high-yielding sectors that we're very good at. So it would tend to be negative to us if it continues, which it might. It would tend to be negative for us in terms of the asset count. But it should actually ultimately be quite positive on the revenues, given that we have a strong focus on those satellite or high added-value mandates."

One is that we saw strong improvement in the equity markets, and had bump up in interest rates, which reduced some of the Defined Benefit funding that would've otherwise had come in for Q4. There was a little bit of noise, just lumpiness from one quarter to the next throughout 2010 on reoccurring deposits, and we had some true-ups there. But if you were to just focus on the real drivers to reoccurring deposits, the good news is that both in the case of deferrals and the case that matched, they were both positive and upward. And so again, I think that in large part, as we see the economy continue to improve, we start seeing salary increases, we start seeing reinstituted matches, we see profiteering contributions. Perhaps, in the first quarter of 2010, we'll see these reoccurring deposits turn around again. Of the things we worry about, we think we've got this one calibrated quite well."

Second, I'll provide an update on our capital management plans. And finally, I'll talk about the longer-term opportunities of our strategy. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments. As we talked about at our Investor Day in December, we remain well positioned for the unprecedented opportunities for long-term growth, both in the U.S. and in key emerging international markets. We remain convinced that our strategies are the right ones to capitalize on these opportunities, and fourth quarter results validate that based on the continued signs of growth across our businesses. As to the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the operating earnings, given the accounting noise that Terry will discuss, and we see the same momentum in sales and flows as we mentioned on the last call. 
Items of note for the quarter are: record total company assets under management of $319 billion, including record assets under management and record net cash flows for Principal International; record sales for Principal Funds and strong full service accumulation sales results, with good momentum heading into 2011; and double-digit earnings growth on a combined basis for our high-growth segments, Retirement and Investor Services accumulation businesses, Principal Global Investors and Principal International. These results come in spite of an economic recovery that remains challenged, especially for the small, medium business sector, with slow employment growth and constrained credit conditions. Our broad distribution footprint, best in class solutions and operational discipline have allowed us to return to something closer to a normal operating environment despite the economic challenges. I'd like to discuss full year results in more detail as they better highlight key trends, as well as indicators of what to expect going forward. 
Let me first discuss the sales and growth metrics for 2010.  First, as mentioned earlier, record total company assets under management of $319 billion, which gives us positive momentum heading into 2011. Full Service Accumulation sales of $6.6 billion, up 32% and net cash flow of $600 million against an industry still in outflow. Record mutual funds sales of $9.3 billion, up 21% from 2009, Principal International deposits of $25.8 billion helped generate record net cash flow of $4.7 billion, driving assets under management to a record $45.8 billion. Fee revenue for Principal Global Investors of $467 million, up 9% over 2009, with solid investment performance across all asset classes; individualized sales, up 21% over 2009, driven by an 81% increase in Life Insurance Solutions focused on the SMB and business-owner market.  In short, we saw momentum building across the growth metrics for our businesses during 2010, with a strong finish in fourth quarter, giving us an optimistic tone as we move into 2011. 
Next, let me discuss operating earnings results for our businesses in 2010. Total company operating earnings were $845 million, a 15% increase over 2009. This reflects the growth metrics beginning to come through, along with our continuing expense discipline, which creates operational leverage. Full service accumulation earnings of $301 million, up 19% over 2009. Mutual fund earnings of $40 million, up 70% over 2009. Record individual annuity operating earnings of $119 million, up 18% over 2009. Record earnings from Principal International of $137 million, up 15% over 2009 despite the negative impact of the reduced ownership in Brasilprev, our Brazilian joint venture as of June 2010; Principal Global Investors operating earnings of $59 million, up 53% over 2009; U.S. insurance solutions operating earnings of $194 million, down 5% from 2009, but continuing to provide solid diversification to our earnings streams.  So as we look back at 2010 and think about how that positions us for 2011, we see a tightly integrated set of businesses. Our hybrid business model of asset management and risk products in U.S. and emerging international markets is performing well, as good momentum and exceptional long-term growth prospects even in an economy that continues to be challenged. 
Now let me move on to capital management starting with our investment portfolio. Our portfolio performed well in 2010, with losses coming in lower than our beginning of the year expectations due to ongoing recovery in corporate credit and commercial real estate. Regarding CMBS, as we said at Investor Day, we expect delinquencies to continue to rise in 2011. However, our accounting processes require that we impair the securities whenever losses are anticipated, which is often 12 to 18 months before the actual bond losses occur. We monitor this portfolio closely and the losses continue to be within our expected range overall. We expect CMBS-related impairments to be approximately $25 million after tax lower in 2011 than 2010. In short, this is an improving picture. 
Now let me touch on capital. As of year end, we have approximately $1.6 billion in excess capital, which we are defining as capital above that needed for our 350% risk-based capital ratio. As we mentioned in the last call, regulators continue to review capital standards and reserving methods coming out of the financial crisis, so we've been cautious in expressing a timeframe for deploying the excess capital. Just before year end, the NAIC released their capital requirements for CMBS portfolios using BlackRock's model. This change reduced excess capital by approximately $250 million in the short term. In the longer term, we continue to believe that our portfolio will perform to our expectations, and that our earnings and net income will remain strong. Therefore, we still expect to be able to deploy approximately $700 million of capital over the next 12 months for appropriate merger and acquisition and share buyback, while still retaining our desired capital cushion. We will be disciplined as we deploy this, as well as continue to keep our eyes open, looking for further accounting or regulatory changes that could have an impact. 
Let me close by reiterating a few key points from our Investor Day, as well as discuss the longer-term opportunities that we continue to make good progress with. First, as we mentioned in Investor Day, we have taken a number of steps to further de-risk our businesses, including getting out of the CMBS securitization business, winding down our Medical business and reducing our Investment Only business. These decisions not only create a remaining set of transparent and integrated businesses, but they create meaningfully larger amounts of free cash flow and higher return on equity over time. With our current business profile, we expect that approximately 65% of operating earnings can be used for merger and acquisition or return to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve 50 to 80 basis points improvement in overall company return on equity annually, growing to a return on equity above 15% over time. This is the power of our hybrid business model with purposeful diversification. 2010 was another year of good success in implementing our long-term global strategy, with an example being our entry into the mutual fund markets in Thailand and Indonesia.  
The need for U.S. workers to save for their retirement is real, and the growth of a middle income class of investors in emerging markets over the next 25 years is undeniable. Thus, we see continuing growth and improved operating earnings from our key growth engines, Retirement and Investor Services Accumulation businesses, Principal International and Principal Global Investors, on a sustained basis for decades. This is the right strategy for long-term success, and the fact that we have had this strategy in place for over 10 years gives us a substantial lead over others who have now begun to focus on these opportunities. I'm proud of our effort and accomplishments in 2010, and I'm excited about the long-term value for shareholders that we are creating. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out three nice recognitions for this quarter. The Principal was ranked number 159 on Newsweek's Green Rankings, an exclusive list of America's 500 largest companies assessed on their environmental impact and reputation among environmental experts. This is the second year the Principal has made the list. I'm very proud of this recognition of our sustainability efforts. As another example of our efforts, Principal Real Estate Investors continues to gain recognition as a leader in the development of green real estate. Additionally this quarter, Principal Global Investors became a signatory for the United Nations-backed Principal for Responsible Investment. Signatories commit to considering the six principles of responsible investment related to environmental, social and corporate governance issues in the course of doing business. It is the Principal way to conduct business with integrity, so our signatory status is a natural extension of our core values, and further reflects our commitment to responsible global citizenship. 
And finally, I want to mention the recognition that Principal funds received from Barron's over the weekend. Principal funds finished third in the rankings of Best Fund Families for 2010, and also finished as the seventh Best Fund Family for the past 10 years. These are powerful recognitions for Principal Funds, and are the result of their asset management discipline and retirement expertise. This recognition will provide even further momentum on top of the strong year that Principal Funds had in 2010. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus on operating earnings for the quarter and full year, including continued strong expense management, net income including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio, and the strength of our capital posit",2059,"Thanks, Larry. This morning, I'll focus on operating earnings for the quarter and full year, including continued strong expense management, net income including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio, and the strength of our capital position and strong balance sheet as we enter 2011. We view the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 as a continuation of an improving picture that began earlier in 2010. We continue to see positive trends in our businesses and as Larry said, we're excited about the growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. Starting with total company results, most notably for the year, we finished 2010 with a record assets under management. At $319 billion, our assets under management exceed our pre-crisis high, through positive net cash flows despite volatile investment performance. Total company earnings improved 15% to $845 million for 2010, on 14% higher average assets under management. There were a number of items influencing comparability between the full year periods. Some of the bigger items include the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture as of June 1, the scale back of our Investment Only business, and the impact of the equity markets on deferred acquisition cost amortization expense, and the assumption changes on net GAAP reserves. 
On an adjusted basis, full-year earnings were up 27% on a 14% increase in average assets under management compared to 2009, a very solid result, reflecting strong operational leverage. Fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings were up 5% to $214 million or $0.66 per share compared to a year ago. This result was negatively impacted by $0.04 due to an increase in net reserves in individual life, following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. Adjusting for this item, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.70. DAC amortization expense benefited from the favorable equity markets during the quarter, but these benefits were offset by the impact of lower future fees in our Mexican Pension business. 
Now let me discuss the business units results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings were up 21% in the fourth quarter, and 14% for the full year 2010 compared to their respective periods of 2009. Full year 2009 results benefited from $17 million in additional after-tax fee income from the opportunistic early settlement of Investment Only liabilities. Adjusting for this, operating earnings for 2010 are up 18% on 10% higher average account values, again reflecting strong expense management. The Accumulation businesses had a record account values of $160 billion at year end. Full Service Accumulation's fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 13% from a year-ago quarter on a 10% increase in average account values. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were very strong at $3.2 billion, which put total Full Service Accumulation sales for the year at $6.6 billion, a 32% increase over prior year. As Larry mentioned earlier, we ended the year with positive net cash flows of $600 million compared to the negative cash flows projected for the industry by Cerulli. In the fourth quarter, we satisfied all the withdrawal requests in the Principal U.S. Property Separate Account, causing our plan count to decline by more than 1,400. 
In addition, there were several economic factors contributing to the negative plan count trend, as we've seen over the last two years. The economic pressures that small to medium-size businesses are facing play a big part in the overall decline. We saw 50% fewer startups, which is consistent with the industry, and 20% higher planned terminations, as employers eliminate their retirement plans. We continue to maintain pricing discipline to protect margins, and we have taken additional steps over the last several quarters to offset this negative trend in plan count, including enhanced internal processes to better identify, predict and retain at-risk clients, and intensified focus on unbundled solutions through third-party administrator distribution platforms to attract and retain business. This complements our Total Retirement Suite bundled solution, and choice pricing rollout, allowing clients the ability to tailor service models and pricing to better meet their unique needs. And though overall plan count is down, Full Service Accumulation average account values, which drives revenue growth, is up 16% over 2009. 
Principal Funds continues to demonstrate its strong growth potential. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were up 24% to $11 million on a 15% increase in average account values. Principal Funds also delivered record sales of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and a record $1.6 billion in net cash flow for the year, helping drive account values to $36 billion at year end. We continue to see success through all of our distribution channels in a broad array of fund offerings. Individual annuity earnings were up [ph] $33 million for the fourth quarter, up 37% compared to the year-ago quarter on 7% higher average account values. This primarily reflects strong investment income performance in the quarter, including higher asset prepayment fee income. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 51% for the quarter to $19 million and 53% for the full year to $59 million compared to the respective periods in 2009. The improvement reflects higher average assets under management, strong expense management and an increase in transaction fees, which continue to trend up. Solid investment performance resulted in higher performance fees as well. Principal Global Investors lost a long-only sector equity mandate of $1.3 billion, contributing to unaffiliated outflows of $900 million for the fourth quarter. This was offset by more than $900 million in new real estate mandates in the quarter. Though we were disappointed in the loss, the fees from the mandate were low. Since new inflows to real estate and international equities are on a much higher fees, we saw increased revenue from fourth quarter flows. 
Investment performance continues to be good. More than 90% of our asset allocation options rank in the top half of their peer group on a one-year basis. We continue to be optimistic as we look into 2011, and see increased searches in specialized investment options where we have expertise, such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings were down 22% to $31 million for the quarter and up 15% to a record $137 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. Fourth quarter and full year 2009 results include higher economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev. Fourth quarter 2010 results were also reduced by the impact of DAC amortization adjustments for lower future fees in our Mexican Pension business. Adjusting for these items, inflation in Latin America and foreign exchange, operating earnings were up 18% this quarter over a year-ago quarter. Principal International finished the year with a record reported assets under management of $46 billion, up $11 billion or 32% from year end 2009 on record net cash flow of $4.7 billion for the full year. A reminder, that our assets under management of our Chinese asset management joint venture were up 15% during 2010 to $6.9 billion, and are not included in the reported assets under management. 
Our partnership with Banco do Brasil continues to prosper, as we see growth in assets under management and cash flows in this business in excess of 35% annually. U.S. Insurance Solution operating earnings decreased 7% to $52 million for the quarter, and were down 5% to $194 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. Individual life had operating earnings of $22 million compared to $31 million in the year-ago quarter. The shortfall primarily reflects a one-time increase in net reserves, following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. Other impacts, such as a strong equity market performance, offset some of the decline. On a combined basis, run rate earnings were reduced by $11 million after tax. The run rate for individual life operating earnings remains at $30 million to $32 million per quarter. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings were $30 million for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $26 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase was largely due to better claims experience and improved investment income. Overall, sales were good for the quarter, up 50% over the year-ago quarter, due to increases across all products, particularly in the group lines, which faced intense headwinds in the fourth quarter of 2009. We saw growth in membership, particularly in the second half of the year, with in group membership up in the fourth quarter for the first time since first quarter 2008, and overall membership up for the second straight quarter. 
Premium and fees also grew for the third straight quarter. The Corporate segment had operating losses of $39 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $30 million in the year-ago quarter. As a reminder, corporate expenses include corporate debt, preferred stock dividends and overhead previously allocated to the Health division. As we manage down corporate overhead expenses over the next 12 to 18 months, we anticipate the corporate operating losses to decrease over time. We expect full year 2011 operating losses for the Corporate segment to be approximately $120 million. Total company net income was up 40% this quarter to $199 million, and up 13% to $666 million for the year compared to their respective periods in 2009. After tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $37 million in fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit-related losses. We also continue to see sequential improvement in commercial mortgage whole  loan losses, while CMBS losses continue to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. 
Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share, excluding AOCI, ended the quarter at a record $27.82, up 6% from a year-ago quarter. At $900 million in net unrealized capital gains, we were up $2.3 billion from fourth quarter 2009, and down $600 million from last quarter. During the quarter, we had $600 million gain due to the tightening of credit spreads, offset by $1.2 billion of losses from the impact of rising interest rates. Let me remind you that the change in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement does not have an economic impact because of our strong asset liability management. Additionally, our debt to capital ratio is 15%. The strength of our balance sheet reflects the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. 
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 420%, relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total excess capital, split roughly even between the life company and the holding company. Total excess capital in the quarter was impacted by our dividend payout and the NAIC year end review of CMBS portfolios. The year-end RBC ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 25 points due to this change. Our moderate risk scenario reflects the improvement in the CMBS market, and our expected losses have actually improved. However, the negative impact of the RBC ratio is one of the reasons we are committed to holding a higher component of excess capital as cushion to absorb some of these capital changes. We have a very strong enterprise risk management framework, and are focused on the future as we examine potential regulatory and accounting proposals. 
As we said at Investor Day, even with our additional capital cushion, we still plan to deploy approximately $700 million of capital over the next 12 months for appropriate M&A and share buybacks. Our hybrid business model gives us the opportunity to continue to generate deployable free cash flow throughout the year. All four of the rating agencies now have the life insurance industry on stable outlook. With improving market fundamentals, a business model that requires less capital to support organic growth and our ability to generate free cash flow, we have enhanced our ability to increase shareholder value overtime through strategic capital redeployment. We're excited about the financial flexibility our balance sheet gives us in 2011 and beyond. We are very pleased with the results in 2010. While many of the challenges of the slow economic recovery persist, we are building momentum and are excited about the increasing signs of growth in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

But as we have seen in prior quarters, when the S&P is up substantially during the quarter, it always tends to put pressure on net cash flows. And just as a reminder, we saw the S&P up 10% in the third quarter, and we saw the S&P up 12% in the fourth quarter. So the nature of that where contract withdrawals tend to be processed toward the end of the quarter, if not, on the actual end of the quarter date, you'll get the full reflection of that on the payout side, and you don't necessarily have that on the deposit side. So just kind of understanding that in periods when the market is up substantially, it will pinch net cash flow and obviously, the reverse when the market goes the other way. Having said that, we don't think there's a systemic problem in FSA. I'll let Dan talk a little more about that, and then we'll shift to Jim for the PGI question."

When we look at those withdrawals, we've dug into the gory details, and it's around our emerging and dynamic segments. It's not our Institutional division. We've identified specific clients, and some of it is a little bit of a hangover from ERISA Q, with both the advisor communities, as well as with some of those clients. We've also been very aggressive rolling out our TPA solution for those clients who want local Third-party Administrative services. And then if you take it down in more level of detail, you'll find out that there were a couple of Defined Benefit cases that had terminated, and one ESOP that flat out, went out of the existence, and those three cases were fairly significant impact on the withdrawals. As it relates to your question on fee disclosure and fiduciary standards, we're on it, and we've been in active conversations in the debate with the Department of Labor. As you know, this summer, there'll be a disclosure requirements for plan sponsors. That's still frankly in flex, and no final decisions are yet made. And then the participant piece comes at year end. We are fully prepared to do that. We're making the necessary systems adjustments. It does level the playing field. There's no one that's going to be held out as uncompetitive. And I would tell you, given the fact we've got our group annuity contract, as well as our registered product, we probably have as much flexibility as any 401(k) provider out there, and I would also pile on top of that to say, as you know, about 65% of our business is Total Retirement Solutions. So it really is a more consultative discussion around their DB, their DC, their not qualified, and their ESOP. The other issue that's open right now is around fiduciary standard. Today, we do help our plan sponsors in giving them choices for their investment options. The question becomes, will they have to be more self served on that score, and work more closely with their advisor, and their advisor becomes, in fact, the fiduciary to the plan, and the helping ,  the picking and the choosing of those investment options. And again, I would tell you that we have active conversations going on in Washington to debate the merits, and the extent by which these fiduciary standards are going to be levied across 401(k) service providers."

It had performed in accordance with what they wanted. They were happy. But they decided to move away from that sector in terms of a broad exposure. As far as we're concerned, it was only on a 15 basis point fee, as befits such a very large mandate. It's one of those interesting things in the Institutional business. Institutional asset managers tend to have, on average, something like 40 to 45 basis points of their average fee. What we're seeing with the changing mix of business quite a lot of range around that. And obviously, a 15 basis point fee even in over $1 billion is a lot less attractive than the type of business move that Terry referred to in real estate and international equities, where the typical fees are more like 50, 60, 70 basis points. It's that change of mix, modest change of mix which is why the flows in the quarter, even though they saw a capital outflow, actually saw incremental revenue so far as we're concerned.

We've began an active dialogue on two fronts, not to take you through all the gory details, but one is to begin or to at least consider how we can have more interaction with sort of the folks at NYU, since it appears that they're working under some arrangement with FSOC, to have more dialogue with them, to sort of explain methodologies that we think make more sense. That would be one point. The second point would be that as it sits right now, I think there's something like 13 members under Dodd-Frank on FSOC, and three of those, if you will, are allocated to the insurance side of the business. Unfortunately, today, only one of those three is actually named and in the seat, and actually taking part in the discussions. Two of those have not yet been filled, and so we're also working hard to make sure that we get those two seats filled, so that the discussion going forward can actually involve a greater level of expertise from the insurance industry relative to what systematically important really means.

I think that ends up being more in the banking industry, and in some of the Wall Street securities firms, I think, tend to have much higher levels of interconnectedness than the insurance industry. So that would be my feeling at this point."

TRS tends to be a concept that has more appeal across the sort of middle size and larger-sized clients. So we have profile, and continue to talk about TRS. And again in the fourth quarter, I think 69% of our sales, that $3.1 billion, were on TRS. So what TRS does is it drives assets. The reason you've heard us talk a little more recently about some of the activities around TPA, and unbundling is because that has more implications relative to case count. So as people have talked about case count and what you're doing around case count, part of the answer to that has been the TPA. So it's a little bit of a question of for what metric are you talking about. So that's sort of my take, and I'll let Dan comment further."

We washed out the 1,400 ERISA accounts that would impact not only the case count, but impacted withdrawals as well. We've looked closely at it. We do not feel we've got a systemic issue. The competition's out there, but a number of things that we're doing to address competition. One is to be more aggressive in rolling out that TPA strategy. If we look at assets retained and new business with our TPA strategy in 2010, that number was $900 million. That's a significant increase from where it's been in the past. We've also designed a model to go out there and look at where some of these clients are at risk, and working with the advisers more closely to try to anticipate if they might move. I will tell you that the significant improvement that we've seen in our investment performance, that Jim's manufacturing for us, is also helping us go out, make a very strong argument that the proprietary in the boutique investment strategies that we have here in Principal are viable. And what probably gives me some confidence around the stemming of the tide on these withdrawals is just the sheer strength that we have right now going into Q1 on sales. If you looked at Q4, you had a twelve alliance firms that have more than $100 million in sales compared to $7 million in 2009. And if you also look closely, you'll find that we've been able to hold up our margins fairly well. So we are losing perhaps some of the lower margin, non-TRS, small 401(k) account balances. And that's something we'll just have to continue to adjust our model to reflect. Hopefully, that helps, Colin."

So we're discussing sort of these contract plan-to-plan kinds of transfers. To your point on participant withdrawals, participant withdrawals, we continue to see about 50% to 52% retention of those participants withdrawals, and that trend has stayed very, very consistent quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year, and there's been certainly no deterioration in that.

We're seeing quite a lot of investment institutions with large mandates, for example, in core equities or in the case of the one we lost last quarter, sector equities. And they're moving to essentially passive exposures to the sector. And that is affecting those who, for example, manage a lot of large mandates in U.S. equities. And I think that probably will continue, because you're seeing long-term relatively limited added value for most managers in those types of mandates. And of course, that won't help us, because we're not offering passive management in the institutional market. Having said that, it's kind of a core satellite thing. The more they put into these larger more passive or enhanced index mandates, the more appetite they have for the higher added value mandates, which range through international equities and real estate and some of the high-yielding sectors that we're very good at. So it would tend to be negative to us if it continues, which it might. It would tend to be negative for us in terms of the asset count. But it should actually ultimately be quite positive on the revenues, given that we have a strong focus on those satellite or high added-value mandates."

As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I will briefly discuss first quarter 2011 results. Second, I'll discussed the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the long-term potential of that strategy and I'll close with some comments about our financial position and our outlook for the rest of 2011. Then Terry will cover the financial results in more detail. 
Review our first quarter financial results as very solid. Total company operating earnings are up on a nominal basis, 8% over fourth quarter 2010 and 5% over the year-ago quarter. On a normalized basis, adjusting for the ownership change of our Brazil joint venture and our decision to scale back our Investment Only business, our operating earnings were up 18% over the year-ago quarter while average assets under management increased 12%. We've mentioned in the last of earnings calls that we have begun to see increasing signs of growth across our businesses. That trend picked up further momentum in first quarter and review our growth metrics as being very positive. 
Let me highlight some of those growth metrics. Full Service Accumulation sales of $2 billion were very solid and when combined with the fourth quarter sales of $3 billion, our total sales of $5 billion in the past 2 quarters is the highest consecutive quarterly sales total since early 2008. We had another record quarter for mutual fund sales of nearly $3 billion. Strong net cash flow with $870 million for Full Service Accumulation, $620 million for Principal Funds and $1.3 billion for Principal International.
First quarter mandates awarded a Principal Global Investors were $2.1 million as compared to $2 billion for all of 2010. While Principal Global Investors on affiliated flows were negative due to the loss of our large core fixed income mandate, the new mandates bode well for unaffiliated flows in the next few quarters. Individual Life sales, up 35% from a year ago with the business market representing 70% of life sales compared to 54% in first quarter 2010. Record sales for our Specialty Benefits business is this quarter with loss ratio staying well within our targeted range. First quarter sales are up 56% from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we saw a good growth across our business portfolio driving company assets under management to $327 billion, which is a company record. Assets under management are a good leading indicator for revenue and profitability for the rest of 2011. While we're pleased by these signs of improving growth, we know that the recovery is still fragile. But we are seeing early signs of employee growth in our employer-sponsored businesses with participation and participants salary deferrals showing small improvements.
We expect the ongoing recovery to be slow but we do believe it is sustainable and is gaining momentum. 
Now let me move to some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy in its long-term potential. We know that 30% to 40% of the Retirement business is sold on an unbundled basis involving a third-party administrator platform as compared to a bundled offering. Several years ago, we began initiatives to capture an increasing share of the third-party administrator market as well as continuing our leadership within the bundled portion of the market. The third-party administrator initiative has begun to gain real traction with record sales this quarter along with strong sales using our Total Retirement Suite platform, which remains best in class among retirement providers. Our investment performance remains very competitive and 70% of funds above median for the one-year period. These performance was recognized by Barron's annual rankings of best Fund Families by naming Principal Funds as the third Best Fund Family for investment performance across all asset classes for the one-year ranking and the seventh Best Fund Family for the past 10 years. Our focus on the emerging middle class in key developing economies of the world continues to fuel growth for Principal International. 2 examples of this, we saw a new sales within our Brasilprev joint venture increased 75% and net cash flows increased by 92% both over first quarter 2010. In short, we believe we have exactly the right strategy involving a hybrid model of asset accumulation, asset management and risk businesses positioned in the best markets in the U.S. and developing countries to drive consistent growth over many years. This hybrid model will produce increasing amounts of free cash flow that will allow us to continue to build our businesses over time as well as return capital to investors while maintaining a strong financial position.
The highlights of our ongoing strategy implementation in first quarter were the announcement of our acquisition of HSBC's Mexican AFORE pension company and the acquisition of majority stake in Finisterre Capital, an emerging market fixed income specialist in London. As we have said for several years, our priorities for deploying capital are to first add mass or scale to an existing business or second, to add new capabilities, which we believe will provide substantial growth opportunities in the future.
The HSBC acquisition gives us the scale to be a leader in the Mexico AFORE business. We will the number 4 in a number of customers and number 6 in assets under management. We expect to close the deal in the third quarter and it will be immediately accretive to earnings. With the acquisition, we also gained the exclusive right to distribute AFORE products through the 1,100 HSBC branches for the next 5 years, which is the fourth largest bank network in Mexico. The AFORE business compliments our mutual funds and voluntary pension savings businesses in Mexico, adding further growth to our existing businesses. Finally, as the regulators in Mexico begin to allow AFORE asset to be invested outside Mexico, it will create an opportunity for Principal Global Investors to provide the needed Global Asset Management expertise. We expect the same trend to occur in other emerging markets including China, Brazil, India, which will create increasing synergy between Principal International and Principal Global Investors. 
Now, a few comments on Finisterre Capital. They're an emerging market, fixed income specialist based in London with a strong track record. While we already have a substantial position in managing emerging market investments with Principal International and Principal Global Investors, managing a combined $67 billion, the interest in the emerging market securities is enormous. Finisterre Capital adds to this capability with their unique improvement approach and we expect substantial growth for Finisterre as we help them build through our global distribution platform. 
Now let me close with some comments on our financial position and our outlook for 2011. In terms of financial position, our book value per share was at another record level this quarter with book value, excluding AOCI, increasing to $28.38, up 6% over first quarter and book value including AOCI at $30.02 up 20% over a year ago. Total common equity stood at $9.6 billion, another company record. In short, we are the strongest financial position in our 132-year history. As mentioned previously, we expect that we will have approximately $700 million in deployable capital in 2011. With the HSBC and Finisterre acquisitions, we still have approximately $400 million of deployable capital for the remainder of 2011 for a combination of acquisition and return of capital to shareholders. As always, we'll be disciplined in our capital deployment, stay mindful of accounting or regulatory changes that could impact our capital position. 
Looking forward, we are pleased with our first quarter results and are excited about the rest of 2011. Our general account investment portfolio continues to perform well. Our competitive position remains strong and our employees are excited about our future. In the past 2 months, I've attended sales conferences in the U.S., Latin America and Asia. And I have never seen the enthusiasm as high as it is today. It is clear than ever that aging populations, global competition among employers to attract and retain top-notch employees and financially constrained governments together drive an unprecedented need for our businesses. We're in the right businesses, in the right markets with employees that have proven their ability to deliver. Before I turn the call over to Terry, let me comment briefly on our new branding and educational effort called Dream Again with the Principal. educational effort provides the tools of advisors need to help employers and individuals consider their dreams and rebuild their financial futures. The early indicators say this message continues the positive response to our integrated America rebuilds campaign as people move on from the financial crisis. In fact, The Principal was recently named Investment Brand of The Year and the 2011 Harris Poll EquiTrend Study. Terry?"
201105,129301460,121064,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 03, 2011",2011-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. We start off 2011 where we left off 2010 with strong diversified earnings, good sales momentum across-the-board and flexible capital position. First quarter results reflect the continued momentum that started to build in the second half of",1832,"Thanks, Larry. We start off 2011 where we left off 2010 with strong diversified earnings, good sales momentum across-the-board and flexible capital position. First quarter results reflect the continued momentum that started to build in the second half of 2010. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including the continued solid performance of our investment portfolio and the strength and flexibility of our capital position and continued implementation of our capital management strategy. Starting with total company results. Once again, we ended the quarter with record assets under management now of $327 billion. Total company earnings of $232 million are up 5% from a year ago quarter on 12% higher average assets under management. There are 3 main items influencing comparability between the first quarter 2011 and first quarter 2010. The reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture that began on June 1, 2010, the fees due to opportunistic early retirement of Investment Only liabilities and associated recovery of the receivable in the year-ago quarter, and variances between the periods for the recognition of deferred acquisition costs amortization expense and dividends received deduction. Adjusting for these items, first quarter 2011 earnings were up 18% on a 12% increase in average assets under management compared to first quarter 2010. A very solid result reflecting strong operational leverage. Let me quickly identify the items impacting first quarter 2011 reported earnings per share of $0.71. A prior-year dividend received deduction accrual true-up and stronger than expected DAC amortization true-up negatively impacted Full Service Accumulation by $0.02. Stronger-than-expected net investment income benefited Individual Annuities by $0.01, amortization expense true-up for rising interest rates in Mexico negatively impacted Principal International by $0.01. And favorable mortality experience benefited Individual Life by $0.01. 
On an adjusted basis, we consider the EPS run rate for this quarter to be $0.72. This continues the steady trend of normalize EPS improvement. Now let me discuss the business unit results. Retirement and Investor Services, earnings of $159 million in the first quarter or the segment's third highest quarterly earnings. The segment had record account values of $185 billion at quarter end. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $76 million were flat with the year-ago quarter on a 13% increase in average account values. As I mentioned, the current quarter was negatively impacted by a lower dividend received deduction accrual true-up than in the year-ago quarter and higher DAC amortization from experience true-ups. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings are in line with the 13% growth in average account values. Full Service Accumulation sales in the first quarter were very strong at $2 billion, up 60% over first quarter 2010 as we continue to see an increase in proposal activity and improvement in our close ratios. Contract withdrawals moderated from fourth quarter 2010 as we expected. Combined, these items drove net cash flows of $870 million contributing to record account values of $113 billion at quarter end. 
In addition, our pipeline continues to build giving us momentum for strong full year sales, which we expect to be 15% to 20% higher than full year 2010. Principal Funds continues to deliver a series of excellent quarters. Operating earnings at $12 million in the first quarter were up 18% over a year ago quarter on a 19% increase in average account values. Principal funds delivered record sales $3 billion in first quarter and strong net cash flows of $620 million, the second highest quarterly net cash flow. During the past 3 quarters combined, Principal Funds has achieved nearly $2 billion in positive net cash flows. We continue to benefit from the strength of our multi-channel distribution model with strong growth across our national, proprietary and Defined Contribution Investment Only channels. Continued strong investment performance also contributed to the results. As of quarter end, 87% of our asset allocation funds were in the top half of a 1-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. Individual Annuities achieved record operating earnings this quarter of $37 million driven by strong net investment income and record account values of $19 billion. The stronger-than-expected net investment income for the current quarter benefited from prepayments and gains on sales of assets. Bank and trust services had operating earnings of $9 million and net income of $7 million for the quarter. On the near term, go-forward basis, we expect bank and trust services to deliver quarterly net income of $2 million to $4 million, which is better than previous estimates due to the improving fundamentals and continued paydown in the overall improvement in the home equity portfolio. Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $17 million improved 38% from a year-ago quarter on a 6% improvement in average assets under management. This reflects the improving fees were actively managed funds, increase real estate mandates and strong operating leverage. Of the $3 billion net outflows of unaffiliated assets under management at Principal Global Investors this quarter, $2.1 billion was due to the state of Florida rotating from a core-plus fixed income mandate to an internally managed passive account. This asset allocation decision was part of the reallocation of millions of dollars away from multiple core plus managers. The state of Florida remains a client of Principal Global Investors and other asset categories. We are optimistic about revenue growth and net cash flows in Principal Global Investors for the remainder of the year. Mandates awarded in the first quarter 2011 were greater than full year 2010 and we see an increase in searches and personalized investment strategies where we have expertise such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
As Larry mentioned, we're excited about the growth potential that our acquisition of a majority stake at Finisterre Capital brings us. Assuming a third quarter close, we expect the transaction to be EPS neutral in 2011 and accretive in 2012. Combining our global distribution platform with the expertise of Finisterre Capital and capitalizing on anticipated synergies, we expect Finisterre's assets under management to grow 3x to 5x over the next 5 years. This level of growth is consistent with that achieved following our acquisition of other boutique managers such as Columbus Circle Investors and Specter Asset Management. 
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings at $29 million were down 25% from first quarter 2010. Adjusting for the lower economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev, and an amortization true-up in Mexico, earnings were up 20% over the prior-year quarter. Our run rate for the current period earnings is $32 million to $33 million. Principal International finished the quarter with record under management of $49 billion driven by strong net cash flows of $1.3 billion. Given the rapidly growing middle-class populations, we're excited about the organic growth opportunities for defined contribution pensions and mutual funds in the merging markets where we already have a presence. The acquisition of the HSBC AFORE in Mexico is a perfect example. This is the fourth AFORE transaction. We have proven success in efficiently merging these acquisitions and quickly gaining synergies. We've seen a compounded annual growth rate in assets under management of 33% from the 3 previous acquisitions. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive as we add HSBC's assets under management to our existing infrastructure. Assuming this transaction closes in early third quarter of this year, we expect an increase of earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2011 and $0.06 to $0.08 in 2012. This deal is projected to have an ROA of between 70 to 80 basis points, which is consistent with our existing Mexican AFORE business. 
U.S. Insurance Solution's operating earnings of $60 million is an increase of 35% compared to first quarter 2010. Driven by favorable claims experience and increasing momentum in the underlying businesses. Individual Life had operating earnings of $37 million, up 20% over the prior-year quarter due to improved mortality experience. The business market accounted for 70% of the total sales in the first quarter 2011, highlighting our success in serving the needs of business owners and key executives. Reflecting growth in the business, the run rate for individual life operating earnings is in the range of $31 million to $33 million per quarter. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings of $23 million were up 69% over the year-ago quarter, driven by an investment performance and improved loss ratio that remains comfortably within our targeted range. The decline in the sequential earnings is due to a normal seasonality in dental claims. Specialty benefits had record sales of $113 million this quarter, up 56% over a challenging first quarter 2010. Metrics such as premium, in-force lives and existing case membership continues to build momentum. Shifting to total company net income. We delivered $196 million this quarter, up 3% over first quarter 2010. After-tax net realized capital losses of $53 million are lower than a year-ago quarter. We continue to see improvement in corporate credit related and commercial mortgage home loan losses. CMBS losses also improved and continue to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. The strength of our balance sheet reflects the ongoing improvement in the credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. At $1.2 billion in net unrealized capital gains, we were up $300 million from fourth quarter 2010. During the quarter, we had $700 million gain due to tightening of credit spreads offset by a $400 million loss from the impact of rising interest rates. Let me remind you that because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gains or loss due to interest rate did not result in an economic impact. 
Moving to capital adequacy as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 425%. This improvement from year-end 2010 reflects current period statutory net income and a $200 million distribution from the Life company to the holding company in the first quarter. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total excess capital. $1.1 billion of excess capital is at the Holding company with $280 million committed to our recent acquisitions that we expect to fund in the third quarter. 
In addition to our capital cushion, we still have more than $400 million left to deploy in 2011 for appropriate acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders. As we continue to shift to a more fee-based business model, less capital is needed to support organic growth, which results in enhanced stability to generate free cash flow. This furthers our ability to increase shareholder value over time through strategic capital redeployment. The strength of our balance sheet gives us good financial flexibility and we look for opportunities to grow the enterprise in 2011 and beyond. Again, we're very pleased with the financial results of our businesses this quarter. Momentum continues to build as thus our long term growth potential. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

As we said in the earlier comments on the script, if we look at just case count, it's up 29% through our TPA model. We hit $384 million in sales in the first quarter. You can roll back a few years ago and that would have been an annual sort of number. So again 23% improvement in case count sales from the first quarter of '11 from the fourth quarter of '10. If you look at first quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of '10, it's up actually 29% from 640 plans, day 28.

That is a large core of very low fee mandate, 10 or 11 basis points is typical for that sort of mandate. And you'll recall that we lost 1 of these large loan fee mandate last quarter as well.
I think it's systematic of the fact that institutional buying behavior is somewhat changing and we're seeing a lot of institutions move to passive and in some cases liability-driven investing for their large core mandates. That is obviously, negative for our flows. However, at the same time, they are committing to high added value satellite mandates in a number of areas. You've seen more of a bifurcation of buying behavior. And we are seeing a loss of interest because of our multi-boutique structure in these higher added value mandates. This would include high yields and other niche fixed income, international including emerging equities, as Terry mentioned, real estate. So we're extremely well placed to supply these higher added value at smaller mandates. And do bear in mind that the mandate we lost this time would have been a very low fee. This soft like mandate is more like 50, 60, 70 basis points or in some unusual cases performance fees that can be 1 and 20 or even 2 and 20. So I think what I would sum it up by saying is I have become more optimistic if anything about revenues even as the asset potential looks less than I thought it was maybe 6 months ago when we talk to the investor day. So I think this change in buying behavior is actually we'll have to see how it goes. But it does make me quite confident about the revenue outlook. Larry and Terry both alluded to the fact that our sales activity are awarded mandates has picked up very strongly in the first quarter. It's been a long-time coming. It's kind of very sophisticated institutions seem to have taken longer to get their confidence back in a way than many of the defined contribution investors. But I can tell you it is happening. Our pipeline is looking very buoyant right now. I hope that hopes."

Again, when you look out comparison to a year ago, as Dan said, there were some a little bit of noise in what was recurring deposits a year ago because we have some ESOP plans who will occasionally do some pre-funding and we have a little bit of that going on in first quarter '10.

We're seeing matches up. So again, we're optimistic about that going forward. In terms of capital management Colin, certainly again we have been clear that we believe we have approximately $700 million to deploy in capital during the entire year 2011. I think it's always been true that it never, we'd expect that to be a mix. We expect that to be a mix of acquisitions as well as some sort of return of capital to shareholders. And we knew a quarter ago, of course, we knew that we were highly likely to be closing the acquisition that we announced. So it would be reasonable that we couldn't be in the market doing any sort of share repurchase if we knew we were on the verge of closing a couple of acquisitions. As we go forward again, we continue to look for appropriate acquisitions and we'll always do that but we also recognized it's unlikely that there's probably that level of acquisition out there but we also need to be cognizant about some of the carrying and regulatory changes. But I do expect over time, we will have enough capital to distribute both in the form of acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders. And I expect that to happen during 2011."

So it's very hard to know how much of our active core is liable to move in that direction. Having said that, with the investment performance we've talked about, we are certainly not the first target when most of those clients increased their passive element. They will tend to arc with the weakest performing core mandates. And I think that there are a lot of other asset managers and you're seeing some with very large institutional outflows. I don't know how they're explaining it but I think what's happening to them in industry terms is that the weaker core mandates had been transferred rather more aggressively to passive. So our exposure, I think should be modest. By this stage in the quarter, we would probably know if we're going to lose another big 1 this quarter. As of now, I'm not aware of 1. So I think that the sort of phenomenon with 1 large mandate that happened last quarter is pretty unlikely this quarter.

We rolled out a very comprehensive automated form 5500 solution not only to our full-service platform but also to our TPA so they got that upgrade I won't go into more details today but suffice it to say it's a very robust tool. We still make that are secure available for our local sales and service offices, which as you know is the workplace, enrollment and cross-sell initiative to drive assets to the platforms over to our securities available for TPA. Local service is available if they choose to have it, which again is a differential relative to competition and then lastly, I would tell you that our investment line-up resonates to strong proprietary competitively priced investment line-up you heard in the script, some favorable comments about our Barron's ranking. That boil down to price. I wonder talking about TPA and again our sales people and service people barely stood and recognized what it is advisor to compete in a marketplace. Hopefully that helps."

It will be a couple before we know that. But the second 1 is exactly what your question is talking about which is can we still drive that 65% to 70% of TPA assets into the proprietary platform.

Second, I'll discussed the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the long-term potential of that strategy, and I'll close with some comments about our financial position and our outlook for the rest of 2011. Then, Terry will cover the financial results in more detail. 
We view our first quarter financial results as very solid. Total company operating earnings are up on a nominal basis, 8% over fourth quarter 2010 and 5% over the year-ago quarter. On a normalized basis, adjusting for the ownership change of our Brazil joint venture and our decision to scale back our Investment Only business, our operating earnings were up 18% over the year-ago quarter while average assets under management increased 12%. 
We've mentioned in the last 2 earnings calls that we have begun to see increasing signs of growth across our businesses. That trend picked up further momentum in first quarter and we view our growth metrics as being very positive. Let me highlight some of those growth metrics. 
Full Service Accumulation sales of $2 billion were very solid. And when combined with the fourth quarter sales of $3 billion, our total sales of $5 billion in the past 2 quarters is the highest consecutive quarterly sales total since early 2008. We had another record quarter for mutual fund sales of nearly $3 billion. Strong net cash flow with $870 million for Full Service Accumulation, $620 million for Principal Funds and $1.3 billion for Principal International.
First quarter mandates awarded the Principal Global Investors with $2.1 billion as compared to $2 billion for all of 2010. While Principal Global Investors unaffiliated flows were negative due to the loss of a large core fixed income mandate, the new mandates bode well for unaffiliated flows in the next few quarters. Individual Life sales, up 35% from a year ago with the business market representing 70% of Life sales compared to 54% in first quarter 2010. Record sales for our Specialty Benefits businesses this quarter with loss ratio staying well within our targeted range. First quarter sales are up 56% from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we saw a good growth across our business portfolio, driving company assets under management to $327 billion, which is a company record. Assets under management are a good leading indicator for revenue and profitability for the rest of 2011. While we're pleased by these signs of improving growth, we know that the recovery is still fragile. But we are seeing early signs of employee growth in our employer-sponsored businesses with participation and participants salary deferrals showing small improvements. We expect the ongoing recovery to be slow but we do believe it is sustainable and is gaining momentum. 
Now let me move to some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy and its long-term potential. We know that 30% to 40% of the Retirement business is sold on an unbundled basis involving a third-party administrator platform as compared to a bundled offering. Several years ago, we began initiatives to capture an increasing share of the third-party administrator market as well as continuing our leadership within the bundled portion of the market. The third-party administrator initiative has begun to gain real traction with record sales this quarter along with strong sales using our Total Retirement Suite platform, which remains best-in-class among retirement providers. 
Our investment performance remains very competitive with 70% of funds above median for the one-year period. This performance was recognized by Barron's annual rankings of best fund families by naming Principal Funds as the third best fund family for investment performance across all asset classes with a one-year ranking and the seventh best fund family for the past 10 years. Our focus on the emerging middle class in key developing economies of the world continues to fuel growth for Principal International. 2 examples of this, we saw new sales within our Brasilprev joint venture increase 75% and net cash flows increase by 92%, both over first quarter 2010. 
In short, we believe we have exactly the right strategy involving a hybrid model of asset accumulation, asset management and risk businesses positioned in the best markets in the U.S. and developing countries to drive consistent growth over many years. This hybrid model will produce increasing amounts of free cash flow that will allow us to continue to build our businesses over time as well as return capital to investors while maintaining a strong financial position. 
The highlights of our ongoing strategy implementation in first quarter were the announcements of our acquisition of HSBC's Mexican AFORE pension company and the acquisition of a majority stake in Finisterre Capital, an emerging market fixed income specialist in London. As we have said for several years, our priorities for deploying capital are to first, add mass or scale to an existing business or second, to add new capabilities, which we believe will provide substantial growth opportunities in the future.
The HSBC acquisition gives us the scale to be a leader in the Mexico AFORE business. We will be the #4 in number of customers and #6 in assets under management. We expect to close the deal in the third quarter, and it will be immediately accretive to earnings. With the acquisition, we also gain the exclusive right to distribute AFORE products through the 1,100 HSBC branches for the next 5 years, which is the fourth largest bank network in Mexico. The AFORE business compliments our mutual fund and voluntary pension savings businesses in Mexico, adding further growth to our existing businesses. 
Finally, as the regulators in Mexico begin to allow AFORE assets to be invested outside Mexico, it will create an opportunity for Principal Global Investors to provide the needed Global Asset Management expertise. We expect the same trend to occur in other emerging markets including China, Brazil, India, which will create increasing synergy between Principal International and Principal Global Investors. 
Now, a few comments on Finisterre Capital. They are an emerging market fixed income specialist based in London with a strong track record. While we already have a substantial position in managing emerging market investments with Principal International and Principal Global Investors managing a combined $67 billion, the interest in emerging market securities is enormous. Finisterre Capital adds to this capability with their unique and proven approach, and we expect substantial growth for Finisterre as we help them build through our global distribution platform. 
Now let me close with some comments on our financial position and our outlook for 2011. In terms of financial position, our book value per share was at another record level this quarter with book value, excluding AOCI, increasing to $28.38, up 6% over first quarter and book value, including AOCI, at $30.02, up 20% over a year ago. Total common equity stood at $9.6 billion, another company record. In short, we are at the strongest financial position in our 132-year history. 
As mentioned previously, we expect that we will have approximately $700 million in deployable capital in 2011. With the HSBC and Finisterre acquisitions, we still have approximately $400 million of deployable capital for the remainder of 2011 for a combination of acquisition and return of capital to shareholders. As always, we'll be disciplined in our capital deployment, staying mindful of accounting or regulatory changes that could impact our capital position. 
Looking forward, we are pleased with our first quarter results and are excited about the rest of 2011. Our general account investment portfolio continues to perform well. Our competitive position remains strong, and our employees are excited about our future. In the past 2 months, I've attended sales conferences in the U.S., Latin America and Asia, and I have never seen the enthusiasm as high as it is today. It is clear than ever that aging populations, global competition among employers to attract and retain top-notch employees and financially constrained governments, together drive an unprecedented need for our businesses. We're in the right businesses in the right markets with employees that have proven their ability to deliver. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, let me comment briefly on our new branding and educational effort called Dream Again with the Principal. Our educational effort provides the tools advisors need to help employers and individuals consider their dreams and rebuild their financial futures. The early indicators say this message continues the positive response to our integrated America rebuilds campaign as people move on from the financial crisis. In fact, the Principal was recently named Investment Brand of The Year in the 2011 Harris Poll EquiTrend study. Terry?"
201105,129301460,121317,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 03, 2011",2011-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. We start out 2011 where we left off 2010 with strong diversified earnings, good sales momentum across the board and flexible capital position. First quarter results reflect the continued momentum that started to build in the second half of",1841,"Thanks, Larry. We start out 2011 where we left off 2010 with strong diversified earnings, good sales momentum across the board and flexible capital position. First quarter results reflect the continued momentum that started to build in the second half of 2010. 
This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including the continued solid performance of our investment portfolio and the strength and flexibility of our capital position and continued implementation of our capital management strategy. 
Starting with total company results. Once again, we ended the quarter with record assets under management now at $327 billion. Total company earnings of $232 million are up 5% from a year ago quarter on 12% higher average assets under management. 
There are 3 main items influencing comparability between the first quarter 2011 and first quarter 2010: the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture that began on June 1, 2010; the fees due to the opportunistic early retirement of Investment Only liabilities and associated recovery of the receivable in the year-ago quarter; and variances between the periods for the recognition of deferred acquisition cost amortization expense and dividends received deduction. Adjusting for these items, first quarter 2011 earnings were up 18% on a 12% increase in average assets under management compared to first quarter 2010, a very solid result reflecting strong operational leverage. 
Let me quickly identify the items impacting first quarter 2011 reported earnings per share of $0.71. A prior year dividend received deduction accrual true-up and stronger than expected DAC amortization true-up negatively impacted Full Service Accumulation by $0.02. Stronger-than-expected net investment income benefited Individual Annuities by $0.01, amortization expense true-up for rising interest rates in Mexico negatively impacted Principal International by $0.01 and favorable mortality experience benefited Individual Life by $0.01. On an adjusted basis, we consider the EPS run rate for this quarter to be $0.72. This continues the steady trend of normalized EPS improvement. 
Now let me discuss the business unit results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings of $159 million in the first quarter are the segment's third highest quarterly earnings. The segment had record account values of $185 billion at quarter end. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $76 million were flat with the year-ago quarter on a 13% increase in average account values. As I mentioned, the current quarter was negatively impacted by a lower dividend received deduction accrual true-up than in the year-ago quarter and higher DAC amortization from experience true-ups. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings are in line with the 13% growth in average account values. Full Service Accumulation sales in the first quarter were very strong at $2 billion, up 60% over first quarter 2010 as we continue to see an increase in proposal activity and improvement in our close ratios. 
Contract withdrawals moderated from fourth quarter 2010 as we expected. Combined, these items drove net cash flows of $870 million, contributing to record account values of $113 billion at quarter end. In addition, our pipeline continues to build, giving us momentum for strong full year sales, which we expect to be 15% to 20% higher than full year 2010. Principal Funds continues to deliver a series of excellent quarters. Operating earnings at $12 million in the first quarter were up 18% over a year ago quarter on a 19% increase in average account values. Principal funds delivered record sales of nearly $3 billion in first quarter and strong net cash flows of $620 million, the second highest quarterly net cash flow. 
During the past 3 quarters combined, Principal Funds has achieved nearly $2 billion in positive net cash flows. We continue to benefit from the strength of our multi-channel distribution model, with strong growth across our national, proprietary and defined contribution Investment Only channels. Continued strong investment performance also contributed to the results. As of quarter end, 87% of our asset allocation funds were in the top half on a one-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. 
Individual Annuities achieved record operating earnings this quarter of $37 million, driven by strong net investment income and record account values of $19 billion. The stronger-than-expected net investment income for the current quarter benefited from prepayments and gains on sales of assets. Bank and trust services had operating earnings of $9 million and net income of $7 million for the quarter. On a near term, go-forward basis, we expect bank and trust services to deliver quarterly net income of $2 million to $4 million, which is better than previous estimates due to the improving fundamentals and continued paydown in overall improvement in the home equity portfolio. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $17 million improved 38% from a year-ago quarter on a 6% improvement in average assets under management. This reflects the improving fees were actively managed funds, increased real estate mandates and strong operating leverage. Of the $3 billion net outflows of unaffiliated assets under management at Principal Global Investors this quarter, $2.1 billion was due to the state of Florida rotating from a core-plus fixed income mandate to an internally managed passive account. This asset allocation decision was part of the reallocation of billions of dollars away from multiple core-plus managers. The state of Florida remains a client of Principal Global Investors and other asset categories. 
We are optimistic about revenue growth and net cash flows in Principal Global Investors for the remainder of the year. Mandates awarded in the first quarter 2011 were greater than full year 2010, and we see an increase in searches and specialized investment strategies where we have expertise such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
As Larry mentioned, we're excited about the growth potential that our acquisition of a majority stake in Finisterre Capital brings us. Assuming a third quarter close, we expect the transaction to be EPS neutral in 2011 and accretive in 2012. Combining our global distribution platform with the expertise of Finisterre Capital and capitalizing on anticipated synergies, we expect Finisterre's assets under management to grow 3 to 5x over the next 5 years. This level of growth is consistent with that achieved following our acquisition of other boutique managers such as Columbus Circle Investors and Spectrum Asset Management. 
Moving to Principal International. Operating earnings at $29 million were down 25% from first quarter 2010. Adjusting for the lower economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev, and an amortization true-up in Mexico, earnings were up 20% over the prior year quarter. Our run rate for the current period earnings is $32 million to $33 million. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $49 billion, driven by strong net cash flows of $1.3 billion. Given the rapidly growing middle-class populations, we're excited about the organic growth opportunities for defined contribution pensions and mutual funds in the emerging markets where we already have a presence. 
The acquisition of the HSBC AFORE in Mexico is a perfect example. This is the fourth AFORE transaction. We have proven success in efficiently merging these acquisitions and quickly gaining synergies. We've seen a compounded annual growth rate in assets under management of 33% from the 3 previous acquisitions. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive as we add HSBC's assets under management to our existing infrastructure. Assuming this transaction closes in early third quarter of this year, we expect an increase of earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2011 and $0.06 to $0.08 in 2012. This deal is projected to have an ROA of between 70 to 80 basis points, which is consistent with our existing Mexican AFORE business. 
U.S. Insurance Solutions operating earnings of $60 million is an increase of 35% compared to first quarter 2010, driven by favorable claims experience and increasing momentum in the underlying businesses. Individual Life had operating earnings of $37 million, up 20% over the prior year quarter due to improved mortality experience. The business market accounted for 70% of the total sales in the first quarter 2011, highlighting our success in serving the needs of business owners and key executives. Reflecting growth in the business, the run rate for Individual Life operating earnings is in the range of $31 million to $33 million per quarter. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits. Operating earnings of $23 million were up 69% over the year-ago quarter, driven by investment performance and an improved loss ratio that remains comfortably within our targeted range. The decline in the sequential earnings is due to a normal seasonality in dental claims. Specialty benefits had record sales of $113 million this quarter, up 56% over a challenging first quarter 2010. Metrics such as premium, in-force lives and existing case membership continues to build momentum. 
Shifting to total company net income. We delivered $196 million this quarter, up 3% over first quarter 2010. After-tax net realized capital losses of $53 million are lower than a year-ago quarter. We continue to see improvement in corporate credit-related and commercial mortgage whole loan losses. CMBS losses also improved and continue to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. The strength of our balance sheet reflects the ongoing improvement in the credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. At $1.2 billion in net unrealized capital gains, we were up $300 million from fourth quarter 2010. During the quarter, we had a $700 million gain due to tightening of credit spreads offset by a $400 million loss from the impact of rising interest rates. Let me remind you that because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gains  or loss due to interest rate movement did not result in an economic impact. 
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 425%. This improvement from year-end 2010 reflects current period statutory net income and a $200 million distribution from the life company to the holding company in the first quarter. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total excess capital. $1.1 billion of excess capital is at the holding company, with $280 million committed to our recent acquisitions that we expect to fund in the third quarter. 
In addition to our capital cushion, we still have more than $400 million left to deploy in 2011 for appropriate acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders. As we continue to shift to a more fee-based business model, less capital is needed to support organic growth, which results in an enhanced stability to generate free cash flow. This furthers our ability to increase shareholder value over time through strategic capital redeployment. The strength of our balance sheet gives us good financial flexibility and we look for opportunities to just grow the enterprise in 2011 and beyond. Again, we're very pleased with the financial results of our businesses this quarter. Momentum continues to build as thus our long-term growth potential. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

I would say that the fourth quarter sales -- the first quarter sales didn't quite turn into deposits of that same 65% rate, but these are all within the normal variations. Let me see if Dan's got any more new ones to add on that."

And as Larry pointed out, there's fewer start-ups, which is the largest contributor in the under-100 life market. As we said in the earlier comments on the script, if we look at just case counts, it's up 29% through our TPA model. We hit $384 million in sales in the first quarter. You can roll back a few years ago and that would have been an annual sort of number. So again, 23% improvement in case count sales from the first quarter of '11 from the fourth quarter of '10. If we look at first quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of '10, it's up actually 29% from 640 plans, day 28. So the momentum is coming back in terms of the small group marketplace where we're focusing our sales force in addition to the TPA strategy.

So they can use DB, DC nonqualified deferred comp and ESOP along with a third-party administrator, which is unique in the marketplace. Larry, I'll turn it back to you."

Thanks for the questions, Jimmy.  I think the point to make really here is that this quarter, the loss of the large mandate for Florida, $2 billion, that is a large core, very low fee mandate. 10 or 11 basis point is typical for that sort of mandate.",390,"Yes. Thanks for the questions, Jimmy.  I think the point to make really here is that this quarter, the loss of the large mandate for Florida, $2 billion, that is a large core, very low fee mandate. 10 or 11 basis point is typical for that sort of mandate. And you'll recall that we lost one of these large loan low fee mandate last quarter as well.
I think it's symptomatic of the fact that institutional buying behavior is somewhat changing, and we're seeing a lot of institutions move to passive and in some cases liability-driven investing for their large core mandates. That is obviously negative for our flows. However, at the same time, they are committing to high added value satellite mandates in a number of areas. You've seen more of a bifurcation of buying behavior. And we are seeing a loss of interest because of our multi-boutique structure in these high added value mandates. This would include high yields and other niche-fixed income; international, including emerging equities, as Terry mentioned; real estate. So we're extremely well-placed to supply in these higher added value at smaller mandates. And do bear in mind that the mandate we lost this time would have been a very low fee. This satellite mandates are more like 50, 60, 70 basis points. Or in some unusual cases, with performance fees, they can be 1 and 20 or even 2 and 20. So I think what I would sum it up by saying is I have become more optimistic if anything about revenues even as the asset potential looks less than I thought it was maybe 6 months ago when we talked at the investor day. So I think this change in buying behavior is -- if actually, we'll have to see how it goes. But it does make me quite confident about the revenue outlook. Larry and Terry both alluded to the fact that our sales activity, our awarded mandates has picked up very strongly in the first quarter. It's been a long time coming. It's kind of odd but the very sophisticated institutions seem to have taken longer to get their confidence back in a way than many of the defined contribution investors. But I can tell you it is happening. Our pipeline is looking very buoyant right now. I hope that helps."

Again, when you look out comparison to a year ago, as Dan said, there was some a little bit of noise in what was recurring deposits a year ago because we have some ESOP plans who will occasionally do some pre-funding, and we had a little bit of that going on in first quarter '10. It's actually a positive sign relative to the economy picking up in 2010. But it makes the comparison in 2011 recurring deposits a little more challenging. As I said, we are seeing deferrals up. We're seeing matches up. So again, we're optimistic about that going forward. In terms of capital management, Colin, certainly again we have been clear that we believe we have approximately $700 million to deploy in capital during the entire year of 2011. I think it's always been true that it never -- we'd expect that to be a mix. We expect that to be a mix of acquisitions as well as some sort of return of capital to shareholders. And we knew a quarter ago, of course, we knew that we were highly likely to be closing the acquisitions that we announced. So it would be reasonable that we couldn't be in the market doing any sort of share repurchase if we knew we were on the verge of closing a couple of acquisitions. Now as we go forward, again, we continue to look for appropriate acquisitions and we'll always do that. But we also recognized it's unlikely that there's probably that level of acquisition out there. But we also need to be cognizant about some of the carrying and regulatory changes. But I do expect, over time, we will have enough capital to distribute both in the form of acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders. And I expect that to happen during 2011."

And I think that there are -- a lot of other asset managers and you're seeing some with very large institutional outflows, I don't know how they're explaining it but I think what's happening to them in industry terms is that the weaker core mandates are being transferred rather more aggressively to passive so our exposure, I think, should be modest. By this stage in the quarter, we would probably know if we're going to lose another big one this quarter. As of now, I'm not aware of one. So I think that the sort of phenomenon with one large mandate that happened last quarter is pretty unlikely this quarter.

We still make retire secure available through our local sales and service offices, which as you know with the workplace, enrollment and cross-sell initiative to drive assets to the platforms, so retire secure is available for TPA. Local service is available if they choose to have it, which again is a differentiator relative to the competition.

I would again say, if you look at our investment performance were 78% of our entire platform is above median and 87% of our asset allocation funds are above median, that gives us a strong opportunity to drive those proprietary assets.

So when you look at it over a 4 to 6 quarter period, you would see reasonable proportions going in all 3 tranches. We knew a quarter ago. We knew a quarter ago, we had the earnings call that we were very, very close on some possible acquisitions that we're strategically very important to us. And the good news is, is that we were able to do those deals. So consequently, in terms of the prioritization, that takes priority. Now as we sit here today, of course, it doesn't mean that environment is isn't still allowing us to do our acquisitions. It is but obviously, we've now closed those. So now it's more likely that again it would be a blend of something involving acquisition or some sort of return to shareholders. So again, it's going to be a blend over time.

But as long as we're on that topic, something worth at least mentioning in the call today, if you go back and look at just FSA sales on a trailing 12-month basis through the month of January, through 2011, that number is $6.91 billion. If you look at that same trailing month period of time through 1/31/10, that number was just short of $4 billion. We've seen a $3 billion increase on a trailing 12-month basis through those 2 January periods, which is a 76% increase during that time. So I don't think there's any question that the momentum continues. And again, with the increase in pipeline of roughly 30% and we're seeing improvement in closed ratios and we did come out with a relatively strong, very strong Q4 of 2010 and a decent first quarter of 2011, we think the momentum is definitely in our favor at this point as it relates to FSA.

As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I will briefly discuss first quarter 2011 results. Second, I'll discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the long-term potential of that strategy, and I'll close with some comments about our financial position and our outlook for the rest of 2011. Then, Terry will cover the financial results in more detail. 
We view our first quarter financial results as very solid. Total company operating earnings are up on a nominal basis, 8% over fourth quarter 2010 and 5% over the year-ago quarter. On a normalized basis, adjusting for the ownership change of our Brazil joint venture and our decision to scale back our Investment Only business, our operating earnings were up 18% over the year-ago quarter while average assets under management increased 12%. 
We've mentioned in the last 2 earnings calls that we have begun to see increasing signs of growth across our businesses. That trend picked up further momentum in first quarter and we view our growth metrics as being very positive. Let me highlight some of those growth metrics. 
Full Service Accumulation sales of $2 billion were very solid. And when combined with the fourth quarter sales of $3 billion, our total sales of $5 billion in the past 2 quarters is the highest consecutive quarterly sales total since early 2008. We had another record quarter for mutual fund sales of nearly $3 billion. Strong net cash flow with $870 million for Full Service Accumulation, $620 million for Principal Funds and $1.3 billion for Principal International.
First quarter mandates awarded to Principal Global Investors were $2.1 billion as compared to $2 billion for all of 2010. While Principal Global Investors unaffiliated flows were negative due to the loss of a large core fixed income mandate, the new mandates bode well for unaffiliated flows in the next few quarters. Individual Life sales, up 35% from a year ago with the business market representing 70% of Life sales compared to 54% in first quarter 2010. Record sales for our Specialty Benefits businesses this quarter with loss ratio staying well within our targeted range. First quarter sales are up 56% from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we saw a good growth across our business portfolio, driving company assets under management to $327 billion, which is a company record. Assets under management are a good leading indicator for revenue and profitability for the rest of 2011. While we're pleased by these signs of improving growth, we know that the recovery is still fragile. But we are seeing early signs of employee growth in our employer-sponsored businesses with participation and participants salary deferrals showing small improvements. We expect the ongoing recovery to be slow but we do believe it is sustainable and is gaining momentum. 
Now let me move to some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy and its long-term potential. We know that 30% to 40% of the Retirement business is sold on an unbundled basis involving a third-party administrator platform as compared to a bundled offering. Several years ago, we began initiatives to capture an increasing share of the third-party administrator market as well as continuing our leadership within the bundled portion of the market. The third-party administrator initiative has begun to gain real traction with record sales this quarter along with strong sales using our Total Retirement Suite platform, which remains best-in-class among retirement providers. 
Our investment performance remains very competitive with 78% of funds above median for the one-year period. This performance was recognized by Barron's annual rankings of best fund families by naming Principal Funds as the third best fund family for investment performance across all asset classes for the one-year ranking and the seventh best fund family for the past 10 years. Our focus on the emerging middle class in key developing economies of the world continues to fuel growth for Principal International. Two examples of this, we saw new sales within our Brasilprev joint venture increase 75% and net cash flows increase by 92%, both over first quarter 2010. 
In short, we believe we have exactly the right strategy involving a hybrid model of asset accumulation, asset management and risk businesses positioned in the best markets in the U.S. and developing countries to drive consistent growth over many years. This hybrid model will produce increasing amounts of free cash flow that will allow us to continue to build our businesses over time as well as return capital to investors while maintaining a strong financial position. 
The highlights of our ongoing strategy implementation in first quarter were the announcements of our acquisition of HSBC's Mexican AFORE pension company and the acquisition of a majority stake in Finisterre Capital, an emerging market fixed income specialist in London. As we have said for several years, our priorities for deploying capital are to first, add mass or scale to an existing business or second, to add new capabilities, which we believe will provide substantial growth opportunities in the future.
The HSBC acquisition gives us the scale to be a leader in the Mexico AFORE business. We will be the #4 in number of customers and #6 in assets under management. We expect to close the deal in the third quarter, and it will be immediately accretive to earnings. With the acquisition, we also gain the exclusive right to distribute AFORE products through the 1,100 HSBC branches for the next 5 years, which is the fourth largest bank network in Mexico. The AFORE business compliments our mutual fund and voluntary pension savings businesses in Mexico, adding further growth to our existing businesses. 
Finally, as the regulators in Mexico begin to allow AFORE assets to be invested outside Mexico, it will create an opportunity for Principal Global Investors to provide the needed Global Asset Management expertise. We expect the same trend to occur in other emerging markets including China, Brazil and India, which will create increasing synergy between Principal International and Principal Global Investors. 
Now, a few comments on Finisterre Capital. They are an emerging market fixed income specialist based in London with a strong track record. While we already have a substantial position in managing emerging market investments with Principal International and Principal Global Investors managing a combined $67 billion, the interest in emerging market securities is enormous. Finisterre Capital adds to this capability with their unique and proven approach, and we expect substantial growth for Finisterre as we help them build through our global distribution platform. 
Now let me close with some comments on our financial position and our outlook for 2011. In terms of financial position, our book value per share was at another record level this quarter with book value, excluding AOCI, increasing to $28.38, up 6% over first quarter and book value, including AOCI, at $30.02, up 20% over a year ago. Total common equity stood at $9.6 billion, another company record. In short, we are at the strongest financial position in our 132-year history. 
As mentioned previously, we expect that we will have approximately $700 million in deployable capital in 2011. With the HSBC and Finisterre acquisitions, we still have approximately $400 million of deployable capital for the remainder of 2011 for a combination of acquisition and return of capital to shareholders. As always, we'll be disciplined in our capital deployment, staying mindful of accounting or regulatory changes that could impact our capital position. 
Looking forward, we are pleased with our first quarter results and are excited about the rest of 2011. Our general account investment portfolio continues to perform well. Our competitive position remains strong, and our employees are excited about our future. In the past 2 months, I've attended sales conferences in the U.S., Latin America and Asia, and I have never seen the enthusiasm as high as it is today. It is clearer than ever that aging populations, global competition among employers to attract and retain top-notch employees and financially constrained governments, together drive an unprecedented need for our businesses. We're in the right businesses in the right markets with employees that have proven their ability to deliver. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, let me comment briefly on our new branding and educational effort called Dream Again with the Principal. Our educational effort provides the tools advisors need to help employers and individuals consider their dreams and rebuild their financial futures. The early indicators say this message continues the positive response to our integrated America Rebuilds campaign as people move on from the financial crisis. In fact, the Principal was recently named Investment Brand of The Year in the 2011 Harris Poll EquiTrend study. Terry?"
201105,129301460,121382,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 03, 2011",2011-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. We start out 2011 where we left off 2010 with strong diversified earnings, good sales momentum across the board and flexible capital position. First quarter results reflect the continued momentum that started to build in the second half of",1843,"Thanks, Larry. We start out 2011 where we left off 2010 with strong diversified earnings, good sales momentum across the board and flexible capital position. First quarter results reflect the continued momentum that started to build in the second half of 2010. 
This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including the continued solid performance of our investment portfolio and the strength and flexibility of our capital position and continued implementation of our capital management strategy. 
Starting with total company results. Once again, we ended the quarter with record assets under management now at $327 billion. Total company earnings of $232 million are up 5% from a year ago quarter on 12% higher average assets under management. 
There are 3 main items influencing comparability between the first quarter 2011 and first quarter 2010: the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture that began on June 1, 2010; the fees due to the opportunistic early retirement of Investment Only liabilities and associated recovery of the receivable in the year-ago quarter; and variances between the periods for the recognition of deferred acquisition cost amortization expense and dividends received deduction. Adjusting for these items, first quarter 2011 earnings were up 18% on a 12% increase in average assets under management compared to first quarter 2010, a very solid result reflecting strong operational leverage. 
Let me quickly identify the items impacting first quarter 2011 reported earnings per share of $0.71. A prior year dividend received deduction accrual true-up and stronger than expected DAC amortization true-up negatively impacted Full Service Accumulation by $0.02. Stronger than expected net investment income benefited Individual Annuities by $0.01, amortization expense true-up for rising interest rates in Mexico negatively impacted Principal International by $0.01 and favorable mortality experience benefited Individual Life by $0.01. On an adjusted basis, we consider the EPS run rate for this quarter to be $0.72. This continues the steady trend of normalized EPS improvement. 
Now let me discuss the business unit results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings of $159 million in the first quarter are the segment's third highest quarterly earnings. The segment had record account values of $185 billion at quarter end. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $76 million were flat with the year-ago quarter on a 13% increase in average account values. As I mentioned, the current quarter was negatively impacted by a lower dividend received deduction accrual true-up than in the year-ago quarter and higher DAC amortization from experience true-ups. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings are in line with the 13% growth in average account values. Full Service Accumulation sales in the first quarter were very strong at $2 billion, up 16% over first quarter 2010 as we continue to see an increase in proposal activity and improvement in our close ratios. 
Contract withdrawals moderated from fourth quarter 2010 as we expected. Combined, these items drove net cash flows of $870 million, contributing to record account values of $113 billion at quarter end. In addition, our pipeline continues to build, giving us momentum for strong full year sales, which we expect to be 15% to 20% higher than full year 2010. Principal Funds continues to deliver a series of excellent quarters. Operating earnings at $12 million in the first quarter were up 18% over a year ago quarter on a 19% increase in average account values. Principal funds delivered record sales of nearly $3 billion in first quarter and strong net cash flows of $620 million, the second highest quarterly net cash flow. 
During the past 3 quarters combined, Principal Funds has achieved nearly $2 billion in positive net cash flows. We continue to benefit from the strength of our multi-channel distribution model, with strong growth across our national, proprietary and defined contribution Investment Only channels. Continued strong investment performance also contributed to the results. As of quarter end, 87% of our asset allocation funds were in the top half on a one-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. 
Individual Annuities achieved record operating earnings this quarter of $37 million, driven by strong net investment income and record account values of $19 billion. The stronger-than-expected net investment income for the current quarter benefited from prepayments and gains on sales of assets. Bank and trust services had operating earnings of $9 million and net income of $7 million for the quarter. On a near term, go-forward basis, we expect bank and trust services to deliver quarterly net income of $2 million to $4 million, which is better than previous estimates due to the improving fundamentals and continued paydown and overall improvement in the home equity portfolio. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $17 million improved 38% from a year-ago quarter on a 6% improvement in average assets under management. This reflects the improving fees for an actively managed funds, increased real estate mandates and strong operating leverage. Of the $3 billion net outflows of unaffiliated assets under management at Principal Global Investors this quarter, $2.1 billion was due to the state of Florida rotating from a core-plus fixed income mandate to an internally managed passive account. This asset allocation decision was part of the reallocation of billions of dollars away from multiple core-plus managers. The state of Florida remains a client of Principal Global Investors and other asset categories. 
We are optimistic about revenue growth and net cash flows in Principal Global Investors for the remainder of the year. Mandates awarded in the first quarter 2011 were greater than full year 2010, and we see an increase in searches and specialized investment strategies where we have expertise such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
As Larry mentioned, we're excited about the growth potential that our acquisition of a majority stake in Finisterre Capital brings us. Assuming a third quarter close, we expect the transaction to be EPS neutral in 2011 and accretive in 2012. Combining our global distribution platform with the expertise of Finisterre Capital and capitalizing on anticipated synergies, we expect Finisterre's assets under management to grow 3 to 5x over the next 5 years. This level of growth is consistent with that achieved following our acquisition of other boutique managers such as Columbus Circle Investors and Spectrum Asset Management. 
Moving to Principal International. Operating earnings at $29 million were down 25% from first quarter 2010. Adjusting for the lower economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev, and an amortization true-up in Mexico, earnings were up 20% over the prior year quarter. Our run rate for the current period earnings is $32 million to $33 million. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $49 billion, driven by strong net cash flows of $1.3 billion. Given the rapidly growing middle-class populations, we're excited about the organic growth opportunities for defined contribution pensions and mutual funds in the emerging markets where we already have a presence. 
The acquisition of the HSBC AFORE in Mexico is a perfect example. This is the fourth AFORE transaction. We have proven success in efficiently merging these acquisitions and quickly gaining synergies. We've seen a compounded annual growth rate in assets under management of 33% from the 3 previous acquisitions. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive as we add HSBC's assets under management to our existing infrastructure. Assuming this transaction closes in early third quarter of this year, we expect an increase of earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2011 and $0.06 to $0.08 in 2012. This deal is projected to have an ROA of between 70 to 80 basis points, which is consistent with our existing Mexican AFORE business. 
U.S. Insurance solutions operating earnings of $60 million is an increase of 35% compared to first quarter 2010, driven by favorable claims experience and increasing momentum in the underlying businesses. Individual Life had operating earnings of $37 million, up 20% over the prior year quarter due to improved mortality experience. The business market accounted for 70% of the total sales in the first quarter 2011, highlighting our success in serving the needs of business owners and key executives. Reflecting growth in the business, the run rate for Individual Life operating earnings is in the range of $31 million to $33 million per quarter. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits. Operating earnings of $23 million were up 69% over the year-ago quarter, driven by investment performance and an improved loss ratio that remains comfortably within our targeted range. The decline in the sequential earnings is due to a normal seasonality in dental claims. Specialty benefits had record sales of $113 million this quarter, up 56% over a challenging first quarter 2010. Metrics such as premium, in-force lives and existing case membership continues to build momentum. 
Shifting to total company net income, we delivered $196 million this quarter, up 3% over first quarter 2010. After-tax net realized capital losses of $53 million are lower than a year-ago quarter. We continue to see improvement in corporate credit-related and commercial mortgage whole loan losses. CMBS losses also improved and continue to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. The strength of our balance sheet reflects the ongoing improvement in the credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. At $1.2 billion in net unrealized capital gains, we were up $300 million from fourth quarter 2010. During the quarter, we had a $700 million gain due to tightening of credit spreads offset by a $400 million loss from the impact of rising interest rates. Let me remind you that because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement did not result in an economic impact. 
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 425%. This improvement from year-end 2010 reflects current period statutory net income and a $200 million distribution from the life company to the holding company in the first quarter. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total excess capital. $1.1 billion of excess capital is at the holding company, with $280 million committed to our recent acquisitions that we expect to fund in the third quarter. 
In addition to our capital cushion, we still have more than $400 million left to deploy in 2011 for appropriate acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders. As we continue to shift to a more fee-based business model, less capital is needed to support organic growth, which results in an enhanced stability to generate free cash flow. This furthers our ability to increase shareholder value over time through strategic capital redeployment. The strength of our balance sheet gives us good financial flexibility and we look for opportunities to grow the enterprise in 2011 and beyond. Again, we're very pleased with the financial results of our businesses this quarter. Momentum continues to build as does our long-term growth potential. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

And as Larry pointed out, there's fewer start-ups, which is the largest contributor in the under-100 life market. As we said in the earlier comments on the script, if we look at just case counts, it's up 29% through our TPA model. We hit $384 million in sales in the first quarter. You can roll back a few years ago and that would have been an annual sort of number. So again, 23% improvement in case count sales from the first quarter of '11 from the fourth quarter of '10. If we look at first quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of '10, it's up actually 29% from 640 plans, day 28. So the momentum is coming back in terms of the small group marketplace where we're focusing our sales force in addition to the TPA strategy. And I would just make one closing comment, we're one of the very few TPA solutions out there that actually is inclusive of our TRS model. So they can use DB, DC nonqualified deferred comp and ESOP along with a third-party administrator, which is unique in the marketplace. Larry, I'll turn it back to you."

Thanks for the questions, Jimmy.  I think the point to make really here is that this quarter, the loss of the large mandate for Florida, $2 billion, that is a large core, very low fee mandate. 10 or 11 basis point is typical for that sort of mandate.",388,"Yes. Thanks for the questions, Jimmy.  I think the point to make really here is that this quarter, the loss of the large mandate for Florida, $2 billion, that is a large core, very low fee mandate. 10 or 11 basis point is typical for that sort of mandate. And you'll recall that we lost one of these large loan low fee mandate last quarter as well.
I think it's symptomatic of the fact that institutional buying behavior is somewhat changing, and we're seeing a lot of institutions move to passive and in some cases liability-driven investing for their large core mandates. That is obviously negative for our flows. However, at the same time, they are committing to high added value satellite mandates in a number of areas. You've seen more of a bifurcation of buying behavior. And we are seeing a lot of interest because of our multi-boutique structure in these high added value mandates. This would include high yields and other niche-fixed income; international, including emerging equities, as Terry mentioned; real estate. So we're extremely well-placed to supply in these higher added value at smaller mandates. And do bear in mind that the mandate we lost this time would have been a very low fee. This satellite mandates are more like 50, 60, 70 basis points. Or in some unusual cases, with performance fees, they can be 1 and 20 or even 2 and 20. So I think what I would sum it up by saying is, I have become more optimistic, if anything, about revenues even as the asset potential looks less than I thought it was maybe 6 months ago when we talked at Investor Day. So I think this changed buying behavior is -- is actually, we'll have to see how it goes. But it does make me quite confident about the revenue outlook. Larry and Terry both alluded to the fact that our sales activity, our awarded mandates has picked up very strongly in the first quarter. It's been a long time coming. It's kind of odd that the very sophisticated institutions seem to have taken longer to get their confidence back in a way than many of the defined contribution investors. But I can tell you it is happening. Our pipeline is looking very buoyant right now. I hope that helps."

Again, when you look out comparison to a year ago, as Dan said, there was some -- a little bit of noise in what was recurring deposits a year ago because we have some ESOP plans who will occasionally do some pre-funding, and we had a little bit of that going on in first quarter '10. That's actually a positive sign relative to the economy picking up in 2010. But it makes the comparison in 2011 recurring deposits a little more challenging. As I said, we are seeing deferrals up. We're seeing matches up. So again, we're optimistic about that going forward. In terms of capital management, Colin, certainly again we have been clear that we believe we'll have approximately $700 million to deploy in capital during the entire year of 2011. I think it's always been true that it never -- we'd expect that to be a mix. We expect that to be a mix of acquisitions as well as some sort of return of capital to shareholders. And we knew a quarter ago, of course, we knew that we were highly likely to be closing the acquisitions that we announced. So it would be reasonable that we couldn't be in the market doing any sort of share repurchase if we knew we were on the verge of closing a couple of acquisitions. Now as we go forward, again, we continue to look for appropriate acquisitions and we'll always do that. But we also recognize it's unlikely that there's probably that level of acquisition out there. But we also need to be cognizant about some of the carrying and regulatory changes. But I do expect, over time, we will have enough capital to distribute both in the form of acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders. And I expect that to happen during 2011."

Having said that, with the investment performance we've talked about, we are certainly not the first target when most of those clients increase their passive element.

And so I think that there are a lot of other asset managers and you're seeing some with very large institutional outflows, I don't know how they're explaining it but I think what's happening to them in industry terms is that the weaker core mandates are being transferred rather more aggressively to passive. So our exposure, I think, should be modest. By this stage in the quarter, we would probably know if we're going to lose another big one this quarter. As of now, I'm not aware of one. So I think that the sort of phenomenon with one large mandate that happened last quarter is pretty unlikely this quarter. But you know, anybody who's got a lot of core mandates when there is a cyclical moved towards passive has a certain degree of vulnerability. I just think where we are in the lead tables insulates us somewhat.

Our technology is very refined, very custom. As you know, we have a proprietary platform. We rolled out a very comprehensive automated Form 5500 solution, not only to our full service platform but also to our TPA so they've got that upgrade. Again, I won't go into gory details today but it suffices to say it's a very robust tool. We still make retire secure available through our local sales and service offices, which, as you know, is the workplace, enrollment and cross-sell initiative to drive assets to the platforms, so retire secure is available for TPA. Local service is available if they choose to have it, which again is a differentiator relative to the competition.

I would again say, if you look at our investment performance where 78% of our entire platform is above median and 87% of our asset allocation funds are above median, that gives us a strong opportunity to drive those proprietary assets.

So when you look at it over a 4 to 6 quarter period, you would see reasonable proportions going into all 3 tranches. We knew a quarter ago. We knew a quarter ago, when we had the earnings call that we were very, very close on some possible acquisitions that we're strategically very important to us. And the good news is, is that we were able to do those deals. So consequently, in terms of the prioritization, that takes priority. Now as we sit here today, of course, it doesn't mean that environment is isn't still allowing us to do our acquisitions. It is but obviously, we've now closed those. So now it's more likely that again it would be a blend of something involving acquisition or some sort of return to shareholders. So again, it's going to be a blend over time.

But as long as we're on that topic, something worth at least mentioning in the call today, if you go back and look at just FSA sales on a trailing 12-month basis through the month of January, through 2011, that number is $6.91 billion. If you look at that same trailing month period of time through 1/31/10, that number was just short of $4 billion. We've seen a $3 billion increase on a trailing 12-month basis through those 2 January periods, which is a 76% increase during that time. So I don't think there's any question that the momentum continues. And again, with the increase in pipeline of roughly 30% and we're seeing improvement in close ratios and we did come out with a relatively strong, very strong Q4 of 2010 and a decent first quarter of 2011, we think the momentum is definitely in our favor at this point as it relates to FSA.

First, I'll briefly discussed second quarter and year-to-date results. Second, I'll discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy and its long-term potential and I'll close with some comments about our strong financial flexibility and an update on capital deployment. And Terry will cover the financial results in more detail. We view second quarter results as very good. Total company operating earnings for the quarter are up 25% over the year-ago quarter on 15% higher average assets under management. With 14% earnings growth on a year-to-date basis, we've had a strong first-half of 2011. Second quarter continued the trend of increasing momentum in our businesses. Let me highlight some of the growth metrics that speak to the strength of our competitive position and success in attracting and retaining business. At the end of the second quarter, total company assets under management stood at $336 billion, a company record and an increase of $8 billion or 3% over first quarter and up 18% over the year-ago quarter. With 60% of our operating earnings now coming from fee-based businesses, assets under management is the single best leading indicator for future revenue and operating earnings. Full-service accumulation produced very strong sales growth through the first 6 months of the year, up 40% over 2010. With the active pipeline of 13% and all ratios improving, we now expect to grow full-year sales by at least 20% over full year 2010 sales. Principal Funds continues to drive strong sales improving 29% over the prior year on a year-to-date basis. Strong quarterly net cash flows from the Retirement and Investor Services accumulation businesses with net inflows of $1.4 billion as compared to $160 million of net outflows in the year-ago quarter. Principal Global Investors had positive unaffiliated net cash flows $400 million in the second quarter, reflecting 27% growth in the deposits from the year-ago quarter. Deposit this quarter include strong flows of $180 million in the Dublin Series Fund, our global platform for non-US investors. Total mandates won by Principal Global Investors and the affiliated boutiques are of $5.3 billion year-to-date. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $53 billion driven by strong net cash flows of $1.8 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International had record net cash flows of $5.9 billion. Momentum continues to build in U.S. Insurance Solutions. Individual Life sales are up 21% year-to-date, with 62% of the sales coming from the business market. Additionally, specialty benefits continue to see strong growth with premium up 6% and sales up 42% over prior year on a year-to-date basis. With our focus on small-to-medium-sized businesses in the U.S., the elevated unemployment rate continues to put pressure on the pace of economic recovery and on the growth of our U.S. businesses. Despite that, we continue to see growth across our businesses, which reflects the competitiveness of our product solutions and our strong alliances with key distribution platforms in the U.S. market. So while the economic recovery continues to be fragile, we remain optimistic about our growth continuing in the second half of 2011. 
Now let me move to some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy and how that positions us over the longer term. We remain a leader in the U.S. retirement market. Our Principal Total Retirement Suite strategy continues to be a differentiator that captures asset and drive cash flows. Total Retirement Suite close ratios are double the close ratios for single-product retirement sales and we see significantly better persistency in this block. Sponsors and advisors like the breadth of best in class products have Total Retirement Suite offers as well as the ability to seamlessly integrate these retirement products. Since launching the strategy in 2004, 50% of all full-service accumulation asset are now from our Total Retirement Suite block. Additionally and consistent with historical results, Total Retirement Suite sales accounted for 66% of total full-service accumulation sales in the second quarter, demonstrating the ongoing power of this strategy. We also recognized that about 1/3 of the smaller plan retirement market prefers a third-party administrator or TPA arrangement. We've intensified  our commitment to this market by expanding our array of flexible solutions that meet the needs of TPAs in order to effectively capture market share. Our ability to work with TPAs grows our advisor base by giving us access to advisors that prefer the solution and creates the opportunity for even greater success over the longer term as we execute our multichannel distribution strategy. 
Year-to-date, TPA sales were $350 million, up 52% over the prior year. This powerful combination of both bundled and unbundled solutions will allow us to extend our market leadership. Investment performance is solid and longer-term performance continues to improve, particularly in areas where plan sponsors and advisors focus such as in fixed income and domestic equities. This bodes well for sales and retention going forward. In a recent survey of retirement plan sponsors conducted by Cogent Research, The Principal receives a top ranking and plan provider brand equity. Equally as important in the same survey, Principal Global Investors is among the top defined contribution investment managers that garnered favorable impression scores from its clients. According to the survey, attributes were Principal Global Investors excels include outstanding service and support, a strong understanding of global markets, and understanding of the defined contribution market. This recognition, combined with our recent recognition as Investment Bank of the Year in the 2011 Harris Poll Equitrends Study, further demonstrates our position as a leading retirement plan provider in asset manager.
This recognition provides strong affirmation of The Principal leadership in the retirement industry and we remain very optimistic about our growth opportunities in the retirement market. While our U.S. retirement leadership is reasonably well-known, we continue to successfully implement our International Retirement and Global Asset Management strategies. We will strengthen our multi-boutique platform in Principal Global Investors with acquisition of a majority stake in two asset managers based in London, Finisterre Capital and Origin Asset Management. The Finisterre acquisition closed as expected on July 1 and we expect the Origin deal to closed in October. These two asset managers have great track records and increase our investment capabilities in emerging market debt and in global equities where additional high-quality investment capacity is in high demand but in relatively short supply. As the further expansion of our Global Asset Management business, we also recently opened representative office in the Netherlands and are in the process of opening one in Dubai. Further expanding our global distribution footprint. Institutional investor recent annual rankings of the top 300 asset managers reaffirmed Principal Global Investors at number 29. The recently announced acquisitions and global expansion contribute to our ability to grow even further. 
We continue to see exceptional growth from Principal International as we execute our international retirement strategy. The announced acquisition of HSBC's mandatory retirement business in Mexico reflects our strategy to go deeper in the countries we're already in. This deal, which we announced in April and expect to closed in August will be immediately accretive to earnings as we add scale to Principal International, one of our higher margin, higher growth businesses. In short, I'm extremely pleased with our strategy limitation as we continue to build two significant growth businesses, Principal Global Investors and Principal International, alongside our U.S. retirement leadership. No other company is better position than The Principal for the opportunities created by aging population all over the world and the need for private market solutions. This is the strategy to drive consistent growth over many years. 
Now let me close with some comments on our capital deployment strategy and our financial position. Given our original goal to deploy $700 million in capital in 2011, I am pleased with the actions we've taken so far. In addition to the strategic acquisitions, which increased our earnings power going forward, we also reinstated our share buyback program in May. In early July, we completed the $250 million authorization, repurchasing 8.4 million shares in total. These actions fuel both near and longer term earnings per share growth as we continue to focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders. As we have said many times, our hybrid business model, which includes 60% of our operating earnings from high-growth, low-capital intensive businesses, continues to generate increasing amounts of free cash flow as operating earnings post the financial crisis. This allows us to invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders while still maintaining a strong financial position. Given the strong operating earnings year-to-date, along with the improvement in credit characteristics of our general account portfolio, we now have up to $1 billion of available capital for deployment in 2011. This is a $300 million increase to the original full year estimate of $700 million. Year-to-date, we have announced acquisitions and a share repurchase totaling $600 million, giving us up to $400 million of capital available for deployment in the second half of 2011. This is in addition, to capital we expect to use for our annual common stock dividend, which we will announce in pay in the fourth quarter. Of course, given the uncertainties in the markets, we will be prudent as we proceed with this deployment. Our financial position remains at its strongest point in our 132-year history, with $10.7 billion of stockholders equity. Book value per share, excluding AOCI increased 7% to $29.20 and book value per share including AOCI rose 20% to $31.43, which are both record levels. This includes $2.1 billion of excess capital as of midyear and a risk-based capital ratio of 445% for the life company, which Terry will discuss in more detail. Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to mention some additional recognition we received this quarter that I am extremely proud of. 
First, The Principal received a 2011 Freedom Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Group, a Department of Defense agency. The freedom award is the Department of Defense highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support for their employees serving in the guard and reserve. The principal was one of only 15 companies to receive the award out of more than 4,000 nominations. Additionally, The Principal was recently named a best place to work in Information Technology by IDG's Computerworld magazine, which marks a decade of consistent appearances on this list for The Principal. We have an exceptionally talented and committed group of employees and I am very proud of the work they do every day. Terry?"
201105,136816966,150722,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. In second quarter 2011, we continue to create momentum across our businesses. This momentum resulted in very good growth in the second quarter and more importantly, will carry forward as we move into the second half of the year. This includ",2106,"Thanks, Larry. In second quarter 2011, we continue to create momentum across our businesses. This momentum resulted in very good growth in the second quarter and more importantly, will carry forward as we move into the second half of the year. This includes strong, diversified earnings and building sales momentum across multiple products as well as a strong balance sheet, with tremendous flexibility. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including the continued solid performance of the investment portfolio and some additional detail on our 2011 capital position and deployment strategy. Starting with total company results, once again we ended up quarter with record assets under management now at $336 billion. Total company earnings of $237 million are up by 25% from a year-ago quarter on 15% higher average assets under management. There were a few items influencing comparability between second quarter 2011 and second quarter 2010. Second quarter 2010 had a higher economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture for 2 of the 3 months. Reserve and amortization changes negatively impacted second quarter 2010 and model and assumption changes negatively impacted individual life in second quarter 2011. Adjusting for these items, second quarter 2011 earnings were up 21% on a 15% increase in average assets under management compared to second quarter 2010, a very good result reflecting continued operational leverage. There can be volotility for many reasons on a quarter-by-quarter basis, which levels out when you look at longer time frame. Therefore, when we look at the first half of 2011, operating earnings were up 19% over 2010 when we adjust for the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture. This improvement in earnings reflects ongoing momentum of our businesses. 
Let me quickly comment on the items impacting second quarter 2011 reported earnings per share of $0.73. Principal International benefited in second quarter 2011 from gains on the sale of bonds on our Brazilian joint venture. Individual Life was negatively impacted by model and assumption changes and a favorable mortality. The net impact of these items was negative $0.01 in the second quarter 2011. On an adjusted basis, we considered EPS run rate for this quarter to be $0.74. This continues a steady trend of EPS improvement quarter-over-quarter. Now let me discuss business units results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings of $161 million in the second quarter were driven by record account values of $187 billion at quarter end. Full-service accumulation operating earnings at $83 million were up 22% from a year ago quarter on an 18% increase in average account values. On a trailing 12-month basis Full Service Accumulation return on assets was 30 basis points. We maintained at the long-term run rate for return on assets for this business is 30 to 32 basis points, though there will be volatility around this target as market conditions fluctuate. In addition, we continue to invest in our businesses to take advantage of future growth opportunities, such as building out our TPA infrastructure and other technology enhancements. Full Service Accumulation sales in the second quarter were very strong at $1.7 billion, our highest second quarter ever and nearly double that of second quarter 2010. As we continue to see an increase in proposal activity and improvement in our close ratios. Strong transfer deposits and favorable retention drove net cash flows of nearly $1 billion contributing to the record account values of $115 billion at quarter end. As Larry mentioned, we continue to see our sales pipeline build across all market sizes and all distribution channels giving us momentum for strong full-year sales which we expect to be at least 20% higher the full year 2010. 
Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating leverage come operating earnings at $30 million in the second quarter were up 28% over the year-ago quarter on a 24% increase in average account values. Principal funds delivered strong sales of $2.6 billion dollars in the second quarter and strong net cash flows of $530 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal Funds delivered $11 billion in deposits, demonstrating a strength of our multiproduct and multichannel distribution model. Competitive investment performance also contributed to the result. This includes particular strength in asset allocation were at quarter end, 84% of our target date and target risk runs were in the top half on 1-year basis. 78% on a 2-year basis and 77% on a 5-year basis. Individual annuities and bank and trust services achieved solid operating earnings this quarter. Both divisions finished the quarter with strong account values contributing to record overall account values for the Retirement Investor Services accumulation businesses. Earnings from Principal Global Investors of $21 million improved 69% from a year-ago quarter on a 9% improvement in average assets under management as pretax margins expanded to 25%. The strong operating leverage result was driven by improving fees for actively managed funds and increasing real estate mandates. Principal Global Investors year-to-date mandates awarded grew to $5.3 billion. As of quarter end, approximately $3 billion of these mandates are funded. In addition, since quarter end, our large Latin American Central bank mandates has funded giving a strong start to third quarter deposits. We are pleased with the improvement from a year ago quarter and sequentially in both deposits and redemption and look for flows to continue to improve over coming quarters. As Larry mentioned, our acquisition of Finisterre Capital in emerging market debt manager closed on July 1 as expected. Integration teams are in place and the transition is going as planned. We were also excited about the growth of potential of our announced acquisition of Origin Asset Management, a global equity manager, which is expected to closed October 2011. We expect both of these transactions to be neutral to earnings per share in 2011 and accretive in 2012.
Combining our global distribution platform with expertise of these asset managers, we expect the assets under management for both firms to grow 3 to 5 times over the next 5 years. This growth is consistent with that achieved along the acquisition of other boutique managers such as Columbus Circle Investors and spectrum asset management. These acquisition, again, demonstrate our commitment to reinvest in capital on a high margin, high-growth businesses with strong strategic fit. Moving to Principal International, operating earnings of $38 million are up 7% from the second quarter 2010 despite a lower economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev. Adjusting for the lower economic interest and for a $2 million benefit in second quarter 2011 from gains on the sales of bonds and Brasilprev, earnings growth is in line with the 38% growth in average assets under management. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $53 billion, driven by strong net cash flow of $1.8 billion. The total exceeds $60 billion if you add the assets of our Chinese joint venture, which are not included in reported assets under management. We expect to closed HSBC retirement unit acquisition in early August. This transaction will increase our scale in the mandatory retirement business in Mexico. We reaffirm that we expect an immediate $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share accretion in the second half of 2011 and $0.06 to $0.08 per full year 2012. This acquisition aligns with our existing platform. We anticipate minimal integration risk and expect to capitalize on significant synergies. 
U.S. Insurance Solution is operating earnings were $50 million for the quarter, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Life operating earnings were $24 million. Current quarter results were dampened by a $7 million reflecting two items. First, a $3 million shortfall due to a favorable mortality expense in the quarter, second the remaining $4 million was due to model an assumption changes. During the second quarter, we performed review of our integrated live reserve model and assumptions, which create a volatility within certain income statement line items that essentially offset each other. We believe the run rate for Individual Life operating earnings remains in the range of $31 million to $33 million per quarter with expected volatility in anyone quarter. The favorable mortality experience that we saw in  the first quarter of 2011 was offset by current quarter as unfavorable mortality experience. With the exception of the model and assumption changes, we feel that the first 6 months earnings are on track to meet full year expectations. 
Turning to Specialty benefits, operating earnings improved 8% from a year ago to $26 million driven by membership growth and stable loss ratio results, which are key drivers of profitability. Special benefits head sales of $6 million this quarter, up 23% over second quarter 2010. Additionally, the wind down following our decision to exit the insured medical business is progressing well and continues on plan. Shifting to total company net income, we delivered to $258 million this quarter, our best quarter of net income since before the financial crisis and nearly double that of the second quarter 2010. With credit-related investment losses of $39 million after-tax, we continue to see improvement in corporate credit and commercial mortgage home-loan losses. CMBS losses also improved and continues to be manageable. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. The evolution of our hybrid business model creates a blend of less capital intensive businesses as we derisk the organization over time. It also helps us whether the current low interest rate environment. Of our $57 billion of principal lives generally and guaranteed 7 account assets, $19 billion or 33% includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate and only $6 billion or 11% is currently at those minimums. For the remaining portion not yet at minimums, we have an average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. Given our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to lower interest rate environment. In the quarter end interest rate environment persists, we would expect less than 1% impact on our 2011 and 2012 earnings. 
Moving to our balance sheet, streets reflects ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. And at $1.6 billion, our net unrealized capital gains position increased $300 million from first quarter 2011 as a $500 million gain from the impact of decreasing interest rates was partially offset by widening spreads. As a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest-rate movement did not result in an economic impact. Now moving to capital adequacy at quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 445% after a distribution of $300 million this quarter from the life company up to the holding company. This follows the $200 million distribution in first quarter. 
Relative to 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.1 billion in total excess capital as of the end of the second quarter. $1.1 billion of the excess capital is at the holding company. Of the $700 million we originally identified for acquisition and share repurchased in 2011, year-to-date we have committed a total of $350 million towards acquisition and $250 million has been used for share repurchase. We still have $100 million available to deploy in the second half of 2011. However, due to improvement in our earnings and in the credit characteristics of their general account portfolio, our available capital position has improved. As Harry said, we now have up to an additional $300 million to deploy for strategic acquisitions and additional share repurchases during the second half of 2011. This is in addition to the deployable capital for our annual common stock dividend. We are pleased with the  financial flexibility our business model provides as we generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow quarter after quarter. 
A couple of announcements before I close. First, we announced a few weeks ago that we will host a Principal International Workshop on September 16 in New York City. At this event, we will provide greater detail about international businesses and show why it is a tremendous growth opportunity for The Principal. Additional detail around the key drivers in metrics will also be provided. We'll provide more information as the event gets closer. Second, our third quarter earnings call will be held Friday, October 28. To capitalize on efficiencies gained on our financial process, we will be moving up our earnings call to an earlier date starting next quarter. Again, we are very pleased with the strong financial results of our businesses this quarter. Momentum continues to build as is our long-term growth potential. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

Our alliance relationship were up roughly 37%, TRF continues to be the lead offering from TFG. So across-the-board, TPA Allianz, large and small, we had a really, really strong year.

The other comment I would make is we did not lose a single institutional case, which speaks to our favorable contract retention for the period."

They remind you in the first quarter this year, we had the large withdrawal $2.1 billion from fixed income by the State Board of Florida. I think I'm safe in mentioning that because it was widely covered in the trade press at the time and they allocated away from all of their core fixed income. They remain a client for a real estate and for International equities so they remain, if anything, a more important client than they were a year or two ago when we have that mandate. This is very characteristic of what we're seeing in the industry which is core mandates are attending to be rebalance away from with clients moving to passive and reliability driven investing. In the fourth quarter last year with the similar one with a mandate over $1 billion and other a very low fee core mandate that we lost. This quarter was mercifully free of that. So what you're seeing is some degree of allocation by clients but the merits of our high-added value strategy that really suits the tendency the clients have to move towards satellite and higher added value mandates. And that's contributing both to the positive flows and to the richer revenues we're seeing. As we sit right now, we don't see any core mandates that are really a critical danger and we're pretty optimistic for flows given the investment performance that's been referred to and the change in client banking behavior that really suits our multi-boutique structure."

There are still uncertainty around the whole issue of but having said that, I guess I would personally have kind of an intuitive feeling of whatever the probability might have been at the start of the year, that we would have fallen into that bucket. I would say that my feeling today is the probability is lower than it was at the start of the year. And I say that for several reasons. Number one, it seems a little bit your that the f-stop financials committee oversight Council it seems now more likely to want to have a relatively smaller number of institutions in that designation than perhaps I might have thought six months ago. So I think that helps us. Two, I think they're starting to understand the insurance industry better. As you may know, they confirmed this week the insurance member to the FSOC so we think that will add further education and understanding to that. The last thing I guess I would say around that is that we have made efforts. First of all, our financial flexibility is high and our capital position is strong. And we made our best attempts to convert, if you will, our current capital ratios over to what they would be if we try to apply sort of the banking interpretations to those. And when we do that, assuming again, we've done that in a correct way and that's a bit of an assumption because there's a translation that's needed, we would find ourselves already with capital ratios that would be at or above the level that Basel III would require. So again, we think as long as we're able to maintain a sort of high capital ratios and financial taxability we have, we don't see that as having a significant impact going forward. But again there's more to come on that but that's our feeling today."

And so to your point, if you look at relative to a year ago, if you look at over the last few years, there has been sort of a steady lessening interest on the part of plan participants for, if you will, guarantee-type options, which is the spread-based earnings or the spread-based revenue that you're talking about and that makes perfect sense when you're talking about interest rates that are essentially 0 or something in the order of 1%. So if you look at relative to a year ago, that share, the percentage share that's in the general account guaranteed options down about 2% and so that alone is going to speak about 1 basis point decline in revenue. So to your point, there is a shift going on from higher ROA, more capital-intensive options to lower ROA, higher capital flow options, which again we view, quite frankly as a positive.

And during the financial crisis, I really with 2009 but not down to 15%. We're currently running at about 25%, which I regard as the partial recovery of our long-term target, which would be a little bit over 30% pretax margin. So what I'm really saying is over the next two or three years, absent another financial crisis, like 2008 and '09, absent that, we should be able to build back to margin over our little bit 30% together with the accretion from the couple of acquisitions we've already done plus the acquisitions that we're hoping to do over the next year or two. So if you put it all together, you're recall that I put a fairly aggressive look aggressive at that time projection for Principal Global Investors in the investor day last December, the way I would put we are ahead of schedule and moving towards that 30% margin I talked about in December. And with what we've said on flows and what Larry and Terry said on flows, we're feeling pretty optimistic about that. So I hope that was the current run rate in the context."

But the other comment I would make there is that as you well know, there are some other pieces in their primarily again issues around C1 credited that could add or subtract if you will, in terms of cash flow and we can use for other purposes. So over the course of last couple of years, we've incurred a fair bit of negative credit drift and this is really the first quarter where we started to see just a very slight turnaround in that. It's probably too early to forecast that of any sizable magnitude given the problems with the U.S. and the potential downgrade of U.S. credit but that's just something to kind of keep your eye on as we go forward we should be some positive trend around credit drift.

First, I'll briefly discuss second quarter and year-to-date results. Second, I'll discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy and its long-term potential and I'll close with some comments about our strong financial flexibility and an update on capital deployment. And Terry will cover the financial results in more detail. We view second quarter results as very good. Total company operating earnings for the quarter are up 25% over the year-ago quarter on 15% higher average assets under management. With 14% earnings growth on a year-to-date basis, we've had a strong first-half of 2011. 
Second quarter continued the trend of increasing momentum in our businesses. Let me highlight some of the growth metrics that speak to the strength of our competitive position and success in attracting and retaining business. At the end of the second quarter, total company assets under management stood at $336 billion, a company record, and an increase of $8 billion or 3% over first quarter and up 18% over the year-ago quarter. With 60% of our operating earnings now coming from fee-based businesses, assets under management is the single best leading indicator for future revenue and operating earnings. Full-service accumulation produced very strong sales growth through the first 6 months of the year, up 40% over 2010. With the active pipeline of 13% and all close ratios improving, we now expect to grow full-year sales by at least 20% over full year 2010 sales. 
Principal Funds continues to drive strong sales, improving 29% over the prior year on a year-to-date basis. Strong quarterly net cash flows from our Retirement and Investor Services Accumulation businesses with net inflows of $1.4 billion as compared to $160 million of net outflows in the year-ago quarter. Principal Global Investors had positive unaffiliated net cash flows $400 million in the second quarter, reflecting 27% growth in the deposits from the year-ago quarter. Deposits this quarter include strong flows of $180 million in the Dublin Series funds, our global platform for non-US investors. Total mandates won by Principal Global Investors and the affiliated boutiques are of $5.3 billion year-to-date. 
Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $53 billion driven by strong net cash flows of $1.8 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International had record net cash flows of $5.9 billion. Momentum continues to build in U.S. Insurance Solutions. Individual Life sales are up 21% year-to-date, with 62% of the sales coming from the business market. Additionally, Specialty Benefits continues to see strong growth with premium up 6% and sales up 42% over prior year on a year-to-date basis. 
With our focus on small-to-medium-sized businesses in the U.S., the elevated unemployment rate continues to put pressure on the pace of the economic recovery and on the growth of our U.S. businesses. Despite that, we continue to see growth across our businesses, which reflects the competitiveness of our product solutions and our strong alliances with key distribution platforms in the U.S. market. So while the economic recovery continues to be fragile, we remain optimistic about our growth continuing in the second half of 2011. 
Now let me move to some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy and how that positions us over the longer term. We remain a leader in the U.S. retirement market. Our Principal Total Retirement Suite strategy continues to be a differentiator that captures assets and drives cash flows. Total Retirement Suite close ratios are double the close ratios for single-product retirement sales and we see significantly better persistency in this block. Plan sponsors and advisors like the breadth of best in class products that Total Retirement Suite offers, as well as the ability to seamlessly integrate these retirement products. 
Since launching this strategy in 2004, 50% of all Full Service Accumulation asset are now from our Total Retirement Suite block. Additionally and consistent with historical results, Total Retirement Suite sales accounted for 66% of total Full Service Accumulation sales in the second quarter, demonstrating the ongoing power of this strategy. We also recognize that about 1/3 of the smaller plan retirement market prefers a third-party administrator or TPA arrangement. We've intensified  our commitment to this market by expanding our array of flexible solutions that meet the needs of TPAs in order to effectively capture market share. Our ability to work with TPAs grows our advisor base by giving us access to advisors that prefer the solution and creates the opportunity for even greater success over the longer term as we execute our multichannel distribution strategy. 
Year-to-date, TPA sales were $350 million, up 52% over the prior year. This powerful combination of both bundled and unbundled solutions will allow us to extend our market leadership. Investment performance is solid and longer-term performance continues to improve, particularly in areas where plan sponsors and advisors focused, such as in fixed income and domestic equities. This bodes well for sales and retention going forward. 
In a recent survey of retirement plan sponsors conducted by Cogent Research, The Principal received a top ranking in plan provider brand equity. Equally as important, in the same survey, Principal Global Investors is among the top defined contribution investment managers that garnered favorable impression scores from its clients. According to the survey, attributes for Principal Global Investors excels include outstanding service and support, a strong understanding of global markets, and understanding of the defined contribution market. 
This recognition, combined with our recent recognition as Investment Brand of the Year in the 2011 Harris Poll EquiTrend study, further demonstrates our position as a leading retirement plan provider in asset manager.
These recognitions provide strong affirmation of The Principal leadership in the retirement industry and we remain very optimistic about our growth opportunities in the retirement market. While our U.S. retirement leadership is reasonably well-known, we continue to successfully implement our International Retirement and Global Asset Management strategies. We will strengthen our multi-boutique platform in Principal Global Investors with acquisition of a majority stake in two asset managers based in London, Finisterre Capital and Origin Asset Management. The Finisterre acquisition closed as expected on July 1 and we expect the Origin deal to close in October. These two asset managers have great track records and increase our investment capabilities in emerging market debt and in global equities where additional high-quality investment capacity is in high demand but in relatively short supply. 
As a further expansion of our Global Asset Management business, we also recently opened representative office in the Netherlands and are in the process of opening one in Dubai, further expanding our global distribution footprint. Institutional Investor recent annual rankings of the top 300 asset managers reaffirmed Principal Global Investors at number 29. The recently announced acquisitions and global expansion contribute to our ability to grow even further. 
We continue to see exceptional growth from Principal International as we execute our international retirement strategy. The announced acquisition of HSBC's mandatory retirement business in Mexico reflects our strategy to go deeper in the countries we're already in. This deal, which we announced in April and expect to close in August, will be immediately accretive to earnings as we add scale to Principal International, one of our higher margin, higher growth businesses. In short, I'm extremely pleased with our strategy implementation as we continue to build 2 significant growth businesses, Principal Global Investors and Principal International, alongside our U.S. retirement leadership. No other company is better positioned than The Principal for the opportunities created by aging populations all over the world and the need for private market solutions. This is the strategy to drive consistent growth over many years. 
Now let me close with some comments on our capital deployment strategy and our financial position. Given our original goal to deploy $700 million in capital in 2011, I am pleased with the actions we've taken so far. In addition to the strategic acquisitions, which increased our earnings power going forward, we also reinstated our share buyback program in May. In early July, we completed the $250 million authorization, repurchasing 8.4 million shares in total. These actions fuel both near and longer term earnings per share growth as we continue to focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders. As we have said many times, our hybrid business model, which includes 60% of our operating earnings from high-growth, low-capital intensive businesses, continues to generate increasing amounts of free cash flow as operating earnings post the financial crisis. This allows us to invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders while still maintaining a strong financial position. 
Given the strong operating earnings year-to-date, along with the improvement in credit characteristics of our general account portfolio, we now have up to $1 billion available capital for deployment in 2011. This is a $300 million increase to the original full year estimate of $700 million. Year-to-date, we have announced acquisitions and a share repurchase totaling $600 million, giving us up to $400 million of capital available for deployment in the second half of 2011. This is in addition, to capital we expect to use for our annual common stock dividend, which we will announce in pay in the fourth quarter. Of course, given the uncertainties in the markets, we will be prudent as we proceed with this deployment. 
Our financial position remains at its strongest point in our 132-year history, with $10.7 billion of stockholders' equity. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 7% to $29.20 and book value per share including AOCI rose 20% to $31.43, which are both record levels. This includes $2.1 billion of excess capital as of midyear and a risk-based capital ratio of 445% for the life company, which Terry will discuss in more detail. Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to mention some additional recognition we received this quarter that I am extremely proud of. 
First, The Principal received a 2011 Freedom Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Group, a Department of Defense agency. The freedom award is the Department of Defense's highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support of their employees serving in the guard and reserve. The Principal was one of only 15 companies to receive the award out of more than 4,000 nominations. Additionally, The Principal was recently named a best place to work in Information Technology by IDG's Computerworld magazine, which marks a decade of consistent appearances on this list for The Principal. 
We have an exceptionally talented and committed group of employees and I am very proud of the work they do every day. Terry?"
201105,136816966,150993,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. In second quarter 2011, we continued to create momentum across our businesses.

In second quarter 2011, we continued to create momentum across our businesses. This momentum resulted in very good growth in the second quarter and more importantly, will carry forward as we move into the second half of the year. This includes strong, diversified earnings and building sales momentum across multiple products as well as a strong balance sheet with tremendous flexibility. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including the continued solid performance of the investment portfolio; and some additional detail on our 2011 capital position and deployment strategy. 
Starting with total company results, once again, we ended up quarter with record assets under management now at $336 billion. Total company earnings of $237 million are up 25% from a year-ago quarter on 15% higher average assets under management. There were a few items influencing comparability between second quarter 2011 and second quarter 2010. Second quarter 2010 had a higher economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture for 2 of the 3 months. Reserve and amortization changes negatively impacted second quarter 2010 and model and assumption changes negatively impacted individual life in second quarter 2011. 
Adjusting for these items, second quarter 2011 earnings were up 21% on a 15% increase in average assets under management compared to second quarter 2010, a very good result reflecting continued operational leverage. There can be volatility for many reasons on a quarter-by-quarter basis, which levels out when you look at a longer time frame. Therefore, when we look at the first half of 2011, operating earnings are up 19% over 2010 when we adjust for the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture. This improvement in earnings reflects ongoing momentum of our businesses.
Let me quickly comment on the items impacting second quarter 2011 reported earnings per share of $0.73. Principal International benefited in second quarter 2011 from gains on the sale of bonds in our Brazilian joint venture. Individual Life was negatively impacted by model and assumption changes and a favorable mortality. The net impact of these items was negative $0.01 in the second quarter 2011. On an adjusted basis, we consider the EPS run rate for this quarter to be $0.74. This continues a steady trend of EPS improvement quarter-over-quarter. 
Now let me discuss business units results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings of $161 million in the second quarter were driven by record account values of $187 billion at quarter end. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $83 million were up 22% from a year ago quarter on an 18% increase in average account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, Full Service Accumulation return on assets was 30 basis points. We maintain that the long-term run rate for return on assets for this business is 30 to 32 basis points, though there will be volatility around this target as market conditions fluctuate. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our businesses to take advantage of future growth opportunities, such as building out our TPA infrastructure and other technology enhancements. Full Service Accumulation sales in the second quarter were very strong at $1.7 billion, our highest second quarter ever and nearly double that of second quarter 2010, as we continue to see an increase in proposal activity and improvement in our close ratios. 
Strong transfer deposits and favorable retention drove net cash flows of nearly $1 billion contributing to the record account values of $115 billion at quarter end. As Larry mentioned, we continue to see our sales pipeline build across all market sizes and all distribution channels giving us momentum for strong full-year sales which we expect to be at least 20% higher the full year 2010. 
Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating leverage come operating earnings at $30 million in the second quarter were up 28% over the year-ago quarter on a 24% increase in average account values. Principal Funds delivered strong sales of $2.6 billion dollars in the second quarter and strong net cash flows of $530 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal Funds delivered $11 billion in deposits, demonstrating the strength of our multiproduct and multichannel distribution model. 
Competitive investment performance also contributed to the result. This includes particular strength in asset allocation were at quarter end, 84% of our target date and target risk runs were in the top half on 1-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 77% on a 5-year basis. Individual Annuities and Bank and Trust Services achieved solid operating earnings this quarter. Both divisions finished the quarter with strong account values contributing to record overall account values for the Retirement Investor Services Accumulation Businesses. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $21 million improved 69% from the year-ago quarter on a 9% improvement in average assets under management as pretax margins expanded to 25%. The strong operating leverage result was driven by improving fees for actively managed funds and increasing real estate mandates. Principal Global Investors year-to-date mandates awarded grew to $5.3 billion. As of quarter end, approximately $3 billion of these mandates had funded. 
In addition, since quarter end, a large Latin American Central bank mandate has funded, giving a strong start to third quarter deposits. We are pleased with improvement from the year ago quarter and sequentially in both deposits and redemption and look for flows to continue to improve over coming quarters. 
As Larry mentioned, our acquisition of Finisterre Capital, an emerging market debt manager, closed on July 1 as expected. Integration teams are in place and the transition is going as planned. We were also excited about the growth and potential of our announced acquisition of Origin Asset Management, a global equity manager which is expected to close October 2011. We expect both of these transactions to be neutral to earnings per share in 2011 and accretive in 2012.
Combining our global distribution platform with the expertise of these asset managers, we expect the assets under management for both firms to grow 3 to 5 times over the next 5 years. This growth is consistent with that achieved following the acquisition of other boutique managers such as Columbus Circle Investors and Spectrum Asset Management. These acquisitions, again, demonstrate our commitment to reinvested capital in our high-margin, high-growth businesses with strong strategic fit.
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings of $38 million are up 7% from the second quarter 2010 despite a lower economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev. Adjusting for the lower economic interest and for a $2 million benefit in second quarter 2011 from gains on the sales of bonds in Brasilprev, earnings growth is in line with the 38% growth in average assets under management. 
Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $53 billion, driven by strong net cash flow of $1.8 billion. The total exceeds $60 billion if you add the assets of our Chinese joint venture, which are not included in reported assets under management. We expect to closed HSBC retirement unit acquisition in early August. This transaction will increase our scale in the mandatory retirement business in Mexico. We reaffirm that we expect an immediate $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share accretion in the second half of 2011 and $0.06 to $0.08 per for full year 2012. This acquisition aligns with our existing platform. We anticipate minimal integration risk and expect to capitalize on significant synergies. 
U.S. Insurance Solutions' operating earnings were $50 million for the quarter, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Life operating earnings were $24 million. Current quarter results were dampened by $7 million reflecting two items. First, a $3 million shortfall was due to unfavorable mortality experience in the quarter, second the remaining $4 million was due to model an assumption changes. During the second quarter, we performed a review of our integrated live reserve model and assumptions, which created volatility within certain income statement line items that essentially offset each other. 
We believe the run rate for Individual Life operating earnings remains in the range of $31 million to $33 million per quarter with expected volatility in any one quarter. The favorable mortality experience that we saw in  the first quarter of 2011 was offset by current quarter's unfavorable mortality experience. With the exception of the model and assumption changes, we feel that the first 6 months earnings are on track to meet full year expectations. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings improved 8% from a year ago to $26 million driven by membership growth and stable loss ratio results, which are key drivers of profitability. Special benefits had sales of $60 million this quarter, up 23% over second quarter 2010. Additionally, the wind down following our decision to exit the Insured Medical business is progressing well and continues on plan. 
Shifting to total company net income, we delivered to $258 million this quarter, our best quarter of net income since before the financial crisis and nearly double that of second quarter 2010. With credit-related investment losses of $39 million after-tax, we continue to see improvement in corporate credit and commercial mortgage home-loan losses. CMBS losses also improved and continues to be manageable. 
Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. The evolution of our hybrid business model creates a blend of less capital-intensive businesses as we derisk the organization over time. It also helps us weather the current low interest rate environment. Of our $57 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate account assets, $19 billion or 33% includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate and only $6 billion or 11% is currently at those minimums. For the remaining portion not yet at minimums, we have an average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. 
Given our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to the low interest rate environment. If the quarter end interest rate environment persists, we would expect less than 1% impact on our 2011 and 2012 earnings. 
Moving to our balance sheet, in street reflects the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. And at $1.6 billion, our net unrealized capital gains position increased $300 million from first quarter 2011 as a $500 million gain from the impact of decreasing interest rates was partially offset by widening spreads. As a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest-rate movement did not result in an economic impact. 
Now moving to capital adequacy. As of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 445% after a distribution of $300 million this quarter from the Life company up to the holding company. This follows the $200 million distribution in first quarter. 
Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.1 billion in total excess capital as of the end of the second quarter. $1.1 billion of the excess capital is at the holding company. Of the $700 million we originally identified for acquisition and share repurchase in 2011, year-to-date, we have committed a total of $350 million towards acquisition and $250 million has been used for share repurchase. We still have $100 million available to deploy in the second half of 2011. 
However, due to improvement in our earnings and in the credit characteristics of their general account portfolio, our available capital position has improved. As Larry said, we now have up to an additional $300 million to deploy for strategic acquisitions and additional share repurchases during the second half of 2011. This is in addition to the deployable capital for our annual common stock dividend. We're pleased with the  financial flexibility our business model provides as we generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow quarter after quarter. 
A couple of announcements before I close. First, we announced a few weeks ago that we will host a Principal International workshop on September 16 in New York City. At this event, we will provide greater detail about international businesses and show why it is a tremendous growth opportunity for The Principal. Additional detail around the key drivers and metrics will also be provided. We'll provide more information as the event gets closer. Second, our third quarter earnings call will be held Friday, October 28. To capitalize on efficiencies gained on our financial close process, we will be moving up our earnings call to an earlier date starting next quarter. 
Again, we are very pleased with the strong financial results of our businesses this quarter. Momentum continues to build as is our long-term growth potential. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

Our alliance relationship were up roughly 37%, TRS continues to be the lead offering from PFG. So across-the-board, TPA Allianz, large and small, we had a really, really strong year. And we're fortunate not to have all that falling in any one category. The other comment I would make is we did not lose a single institutional case, which speaks to our favorable contract retention for the period."

I'd remind you in the first quarter of this year, we had a large withdrawal of $2.1 billion from pure [ph] fixed income by the State Board of Florida. I think I'm safe in mentioning that because it was widely covered in the trade press at the time and they allocated away from all of their core fixed income. They remain a client for real estate and for international equities so actually, they remain, if anything, a more important client than they were a year or two ago when we had that mandate. This is very characteristic of what we're seeing in the industry, which is core mandates are tending to be rebalanced away from, with clients moving to passive and liability-driven investing. In the fourth quarter last year we had a similar one with a mandate over $1 billion, another a very low fee core mandate that we lost. This quarter was mercifully free of that. So what you're seeing is some degree of reallocation by clients. But the merits of our high-added value strategy that really suits the tendency that clients have to move towards satellite and higher added value mandates. And that's contributing both to the positive flows and to the richer revenues we're seeing. As we sit right now, we don't see any core mandates that are really a critical danger and we're pretty optimistic for flows given the investment performance that's been referred to and the change in client buying behavior that really suits our multi-boutique structure."

Just maybe a few comments on that. There's still uncertainty around the whole issue of SFIs. But having said that, I guess I would personally have kind of an intuitive feeling that whatever the probability might have been at the start of the year, that we would have fallen into that bucket. I would say that my feeling today is the probability is lower than it was at the start of the year. And I say that for several reasons. Number 1, it seems a little bit clear that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, it seems now more likely to want to have a relatively smaller number of institutions in that designation than perhaps I might have thought six months ago. So I think that helps us. Two, I think they're starting to understand the insurance industry better. As you may know, they confirmed this week the insurance member to the FSOC so we think that will add further education and understanding to that. So the last thing I guess I would say around that is that we have made efforts. First of all, our financial flexibility is high and our capital position is strong. And we made our best attempts to convert, if you will, our current capital ratios over to what they would be if we try to apply sort of the banking interpretations to those. And when we do that, assuming again, we've done that in a correct way and that's a bit of an assumption because there's a translation that's needed, we would find ourselves already with capital ratios that would be at or above the level that Basel III would require. So again, we think as long as we're able to maintain the sort of high capital ratios and financial flexibility we have, we don't see that as having a significant impact going forward. But again there's more to come on that. But that's the feeling today."

I guess the question I have about the driver of FSA ROA. If you were to be below your 30 basis-point target on a sustained basis, what's the chance that, that would come from the spread-based portion of FSA versus the fee-based. Everyone's focused on sort of the pressure on fees but you look at this quarter and I think you have pressure on the ROA because of the spread business. So that's the first question."

I think we've commented in every earnings call for I don't know how long, that you can't look at one single component of this and draw a conclusion. And so to your point, if you look at relative to a year ago, if you look at over the last few years, there has been sort of a steady lessening interest on the part of plan participants for, if you will, guaranteed-type options, which is the spread-based earnings, the spread-based revenue that you're talking about and that makes perfect sense when you're talking about interest rates that are essentially 0 or something in the order of 1%. So if you look at relative to a year ago, that share, that percentage share that's in the general account guaranteed options down about 2% and so that alone is going to speak to about 1 basis point decline in revenue. So to your point, there is a shift going on from higher ROA, more capital-intensive options to lower ROA, higher capital flow options, which again we view, quite frankly, as a positive. So it's very, very important not to overrate one quarter, it's very, very important not to overrate one metric like revenue.

Having said that, I think the way to think about your question is actually to look at pretax margins, which is how -- the return on revenue, which is how most asset managers would look at it. And during the financial crisis, our really bad year was 2009 when that measure went down to 15%. We're currently running at about 25%, which I regard as a partial recovery of our long-term target, which would be a little bit over 30% pretax margin. So what I'm really saying is over the next two or three years, absent another financial crisis, like 2008, '09, absent that, we should be able to build back to margins over, or a little bit 30%, together with the accretion from the couple of acquisitions we've already done plus the acquisitions that we're hoping to do over the next year or 2. So if you put it all together, you're recall that I put a fairly aggressive, or looked aggressive at that time, projections for Principal Global Investors earnings at the Investor Day last December. The way I would put it is, we are ahead of schedule and moving towards that 30% margin I talked about in December. And with what we've said on flows, what Larry and Terry said on flows, we're feeling pretty optimistic about that. So I hope that puts the current run rate into context."

So I would say, in rough terms, we would be in position again forecasting a little bit forward here. But next year, we probably need somewhere around 30% and 35% of our operating earnings to support the organic growth of our business. So somewhere between 65% and 70% of our earnings would be available for free cash flow. But the other comment I would make there is that, as you well know, there are some other pieces in there. Primarily, again, issues around C1  [ph] credit that could add or subtract, if you will, in terms of cash flow and we can use for other purposes. So over the course of the last couple of years, we've incurred a fair bit of negative credit drift and this is really the first quarter where we started to see just a very slight turnaround in that. It's probably too early to forecast that of any sizable magnitude given the problems with the U.S. and the potential downgrade of U.S. credit.

First, I'll briefly discuss second quarter and year-to-date results. Second, I'll discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy and its long-term potential, and I'll close with some comments about our strong financial flexibility and an update on capital deployment. Then Terry will cover the financial results in more detail. We view second quarter results as very good. Total company operating earnings for the quarter are up 25% over the year-ago quarter on 15% higher average assets under management. With 14% earnings growth on a year-to-date basis, we've had a strong first-half of 2011. 
Second quarter continued the trend of increasing momentum in our businesses. Let me highlight some of the growth metrics that speak to the strength of our competitive position and success in attracting and retaining business. At the end of the second quarter, total company assets under management stood at $336 billion, a company record, and an increase of $8 billion or 3% over first quarter and up 18% over the year-ago quarter. With 60% of our operating earnings now coming from fee-based businesses, assets under management is the single best leading indicator for future revenue and operating earnings. Full-service accumulation produced very strong sales growth through the first 6 months of the year, up 40% over 2010. With the active pipeline up 13% and close ratios improving, we now expect to grow full-year sales by at least 20% over full year 2010 sales. 
Principal Funds continues to drive strong sales, improving 29% over the prior year on a year-to-date basis. Strong quarterly net cash flows from the Retirement and Investor Services Accumulation businesses with net inflows of $1.4 billion as compared to $160 million of net outflows in the year-ago quarter. Principal Global Investors had positive unaffiliated net cash flows of $400 million in the second quarter, reflecting 27% growth in deposits from the year-ago quarter. Deposits this quarter include strong flows of $180 million in the Dublin Series funds, a global platform for non-U.S. investors. Total mandates won by Principal Global Investors and the affiliated boutiques are $5.3 billion year-to-date. 
Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $53 billion driven by strong net cash flows of $1.8 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International had record net cash flows of $5.9 billion. Momentum continues to build in U.S. Insurance Solutions. Individual Life sales are up 21% year-to-date, with 62% of the sales coming from the business market. Additionally, Specialty Benefits continues to see strong growth with premium up 6% and sales up 42% over prior year on a year-to-date basis. 
With our focus on small-to-medium-sized businesses in the U.S., the elevated unemployment rate continues to put pressure on the pace of the economic recovery and on the growth of our U.S. businesses. Despite that, we continued to see growth across our businesses, which reflects the competitiveness of our product solutions and our strong alliances with key distribution platforms in the U.S. market. So while the economic recovery continues to be fragile, we remain optimistic about our growth continuing in the second half of 2011. 
Now let me move to some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy and how that positions us over the longer term. We remain a leader in the U.S. retirement market. Our Principal Total Retirement Suite strategy continues to be a differentiator that captures assets and drives cash flows. Total Retirement Suite close ratios are double the close ratios for single-product retirement sales, and we see significantly better persistency in this block. Plan sponsors and advisors like the breadth of best in class products that Total Retirement Suite offers, as well as the ability to seamlessly integrate these retirement products. 
Since launching this strategy in 2004, 50% of all Full Service Accumulation assets are now from our Total Retirement Suite block. Additionally and consistent with historical results, Total Retirement Suite sales accounted for 66% of total Full Service Accumulation sales in the second quarter, demonstrating the ongoing power of this strategy. We also recognize that about 1/3 of the smaller plan retirement market prefers a third-party administrator or TPA arrangement. We've intensified our commitment to this market by expanding our array of flexible solutions that meet the needs of TPAs in order to effectively capture market share. Our ability to work with TPAs grows our advisor base by giving us access to advisors that prefer this solution and creates the opportunity for even greater success over the longer term as we execute our multichannel distribution strategy. 
Year-to-date, TPA sales were $350 million, up 52% over the prior year. This powerful combination of both bundled and unbundled solutions will allow us to extend our market leadership. Investment performance is solid, and longer-term performance continues to improve, particularly in areas where plan sponsors and advisors focus, such as in fixed income and domestic equities. This bodes well for sales and retention going forward. 
In a recent survey of retirement plan sponsors conducted by Cogent Research, The Principal received a top ranking in plan provider brand equity. Equally as important, in the same survey, Principal Global Investors is among the top defined contribution investment managers that garnered favorable impression scores from its clients. According to the survey, attributes where Principal Global Investors excels include outstanding service and support, a strong understanding of global markets, and understanding of the defined contribution market. 
This recognition, combined with our recent recognition as Investment Brand of the Year in the 2011 Harris Poll EquiTrend study, further demonstrates our position as a leading retirement plan provider and asset manager.
These recognitions provide strong affirmation of The Principal’s leadership in the retirement industry, and we remain very optimistic about our growth opportunities in the retirement market. While our U.S. retirement leadership is reasonably well-known, we continue to successfully implement our International Retirement and Global Asset Management strategies. We will strengthen our multi-boutique platform in Principal Global Investors with the acquisition of a majority stake in 2 asset managers based in London, Finisterre Capital and Origin Asset Management. The Finisterre acquisition closed as expected on July 1, and we expect the Origin deal to close in October. These 2 asset managers have great track records and increase our investment capabilities in emerging market debt and in global equities where additional high-quality investment capacity is in high demand but in relatively short supply. 
As a further expansion of our Global Asset Management business, we also recently opened a representative office in the Netherlands and are in the process of opening one in Dubai, further expanding our global distribution footprint. Institutional Investor’s recent annual rankings of the top 300 asset managers reaffirmed Principal Global Investors at number 29. The recently announced acquisitions and global expansion contribute to our ability to grow even further. 
We continue to see exceptional growth from Principal International as we execute our international retirement strategy. The announced acquisition of HSBC's mandatory retirement business in Mexico reflects our strategy to go deeper in the countries we're already in. This deal, which we announced in April and expect to close in August, will be immediately accretive to earnings as we add scale to Principal International, one of our higher margin, higher growth businesses. In short, I am extremely pleased with our strategy implementation as we continue to build 2 significant growth businesses, Principal Global Investors and Principal International, alongside our U.S. retirement leadership. No other company is better positioned than The Principal for the opportunities created by aging populations all over the world and the need for private market solutions. This is the strategy to drive consistent growth over many years. 
Now let me close with some comments on our capital deployment strategy and our financial position. Given our original goal to deploy $700 million in capital in 2011, I am pleased with the actions we've taken so far. In addition to the strategic acquisitions, which increase our earnings power going forward, we also reinstated our share buyback program in May. In early July, we completed the $250 million authorization, repurchasing 8.4 million shares in total. These actions fuel both near and longer term earnings per share growth as we continue to focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders. As we have said many times, our hybrid business model, which includes 60% of our operating earnings from high-growth, low-capital intensive businesses, continues to generate increasing amounts of free cash flow as operating earnings recover post the financial crisis. This allows us to invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders while still maintaining a strong financial position. 
Given the strong operating earnings year-to-date, along improvement in credit characteristics of our general account portfolio, we now have up to $1 billion available capital for deployment in 2011. This is a $300 million increase to the original full year estimate of $700 million. Year-to-date, we have announced acquisitions and a share repurchase totaling $600 million, giving us up to $400 million of capital available for deployment in the second half of 2011. This is in addition to capital we expect to use for our annual common stock dividend, which we will announce in pay in the fourth quarter. Of course, given the uncertainties in the markets, we will be prudent as we proceed with this deployment. 
Our financial position remains at its strongest point in our 132-year history with $10.7 billion of stockholders' equity. Book value per share excluding AOCI increased 7% to $29.20, and book value per share including AOCI rose 20% to $31.43, which are both record levels. This includes $2.1 billion of excess capital as of midyear and a risk-based capital ratio of 445% for the life company, which Terry will discuss in more detail. Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to mention some additional recognition we received this quarter that I am extremely proud of. 
First, The Principal received a 2011 Freedom Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Group, a Department of Defense agency. The Freedom Award is the Department of Defense's highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support of their employees serving in the guard and reserve. The Principal was one of only 15 companies to receive the award out of more than 4,000 nominations. Additionally, The Principal was recently named a Best Place to Work in Information Technology by IDG's Computerworld magazine, which marks a decade of consistent appearances on this list for The Principal. 
We have an exceptionally talented and committed group of employees, and I am very proud of the work they do every day. Terry?"
201105,136816966,151014,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. In second quarter 2011, we continued to create momentum across our businesses. This momentum resulted in very good growth in the second quarter and, more importantly, will carry forward as we move into the second half of the year. This incl",2104,"Thanks, Larry. In second quarter 2011, we continued to create momentum across our businesses. This momentum resulted in very good growth in the second quarter and, more importantly, will carry forward as we move into the second half of the year. This includes strong, diversified earnings and building sales momentum across multiple products as well as a strong balance sheet with tremendous flexibility. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including the continued solid performance of the investment portfolio; and some additional detail on our 2011 capital position and deployment strategy. 
Starting with total company results, once again, we ended the quarter with record assets under management now at $336 billion. Total company earnings of $237 million are up 25% from a year-ago quarter on 15% higher average assets under management. There were a few items influencing comparability between second quarter 2011 and second quarter 2010. Second quarter 2010 had a higher economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture for 2 of the 3 months. Reserve and amortization changes negatively impacted second quarter 2010, and model and assumption changes negatively impacted Individual Life in second quarter 2011. 
Adjusting for these items, second quarter 2011 earnings were up 21% on a 15% increase in average assets under management compared to second quarter 2010, a very good result reflecting continued operational leverage. There can be volatility for many reasons on a quarter-by-quarter basis, which levels out when you look at a longer time frame. Therefore, when we look at the first half of 2011, operating earnings are up 19% over 2010 when we adjust for the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture. This improvement in earnings reflects ongoing momentum of our businesses.
Let me quickly comment on the items impacting second quarter 2011 reported earnings per share of $0.73. Principal International benefited in second quarter 2011 from gains on the sale of bonds in our Brazilian joint venture. Individual Life was negatively impacted by model and assumption changes and unfavorable mortality. The net impact of these items was negative $0.01 in second quarter 2011. On an adjusted basis, we consider the EPS run rate for this quarter to be $0.74. This continues the steady trend of EPS improvement quarter-over-quarter. 
Now let me discuss business unit results. Retirement and Investor Services earnings of $161 million in the second quarter were driven by record account values of $187 billion at quarter end. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $83 million were up 22% from a year ago quarter on an 18% increase in average account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, Full Service Accumulation return on assets was 30 basis points. We maintain that the long-term run rate for return on assets for this business is 30 to 32 basis points, though there will be volatility around this target as market conditions fluctuate. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our businesses to take advantage of future growth opportunities, such as building out our TPA infrastructure and other technology enhancements. Full Service Accumulation sales in the second quarter were very strong at $1.7 billion, our highest second quarter ever and nearly double that of second quarter 2010, as we continue to see an increase in proposal activity and improvement in our close ratios. 
Strong transfer deposits and favorable retention drove net cash flows of nearly $1 billion contributing to the record account values of $115 billion at quarter end. As Larry mentioned, we continue to see our sales pipeline build across all market sizes and all distribution channels, giving us momentum for strong full-year sales, which we expect to be at least 20% higher than full year 2010. 
Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating leverage. Operating earnings at $13 million in the second quarter were up 28% over the year-ago quarter on a 24% increase in average account values. Principal Funds delivered strong sales of $2.6 billion dollars in the second quarter and strong net cash flows of $530 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal Funds delivered $11 billion in deposits, demonstrating the strength of our multiproduct and multichannel distribution model. 
Competitive investment performance also contributed to the result. This includes particular strength in asset allocation where, at quarter end, 84% of our target date and target risk runs were in the top half on 1-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 77% on a 5-year basis. Individual Annuities and Bank and Trust Services achieved solid operating earnings this quarter. Both divisions finished the quarter with strong account values contributing to record overall account values for the Retirement Investor Services Accumulation Businesses. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $21 million improved 69% from the year-ago quarter on a 9% improvement in average assets under management as pretax margins expanded to 25%. This strong operating leverage result was driven by improving fees for actively managed funds and increasing real estate mandates. Principal Global Investors year-to-date mandates awarded grew to $5.3 billion. As of quarter end, approximately $3 billion of these mandates had funded. 
In addition, since quarter end, a large Latin American Central bank mandate has funded, giving a strong start to third quarter deposits. We are pleased with improvement from the year ago quarter and sequentially in both deposits and redemption and look for flows to continue to improve over coming quarters. 
As Larry mentioned, our acquisition of Finisterre Capital, an emerging market debt manager, closed on July 1 as expected. Integration teams are in place, and the transition is going as planned. We were also excited about the growth and potential of our announced acquisition of Origin Asset Management, a global equity manager which is expected to close October 2011. We expect both of these transactions to be neutral to earnings per share in 2011 and accretive in 2012.
Combining our global distribution platform with the expertise of these asset managers, we expect the assets under management for both firms to grow 3 to 5 times over the next 5 years. This growth is consistent with that achieved following the acquisition of other boutique managers such as Columbus Circle Investors and Spectrum Asset Management. These acquisitions, again, demonstrate our commitment to reinvesting capital in our high-margin, high-growth businesses with strong strategic fit.
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings of $38 million are up 7% from the second quarter 2010 despite a lower economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture, Brasilprev. Adjusting for the lower economic interest and for a $2 million benefit in second quarter 2011 from gains on the sales of bonds in Brasilprev, earnings growth is in line with the 38% growth in average assets under management. 
Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $53 billion, driven by strong net cash flow of $1.8 billion. The total exceeds $60 billion if you add the assets of our Chinese joint venture, which are not included in reported assets under management. We expect to close HSBC retirement unit acquisition in early August. This transaction will increase our scale in the mandatory retirement business in Mexico. We reaffirm that we expect an immediate $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share accretion in the second half of 2011 and $0.06 to $0.08 for full year 2012. This acquisition aligns with our existing platform. We anticipate minimal integration risk and expect to capitalize on significant synergies. 
U.S. Insurance Solutions' operating earnings were $50 million for the quarter, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Life operating earnings were $24 million. Current quarter results were dampened by $7 million reflecting 2 items. First, a $3 million shortfall was due to unfavorable mortality experience in the quarter. Second, the remaining $4 million was due to model and assumption changes. During the second quarter, we performed a review of our integrated life reserve model and assumptions, which created volatility within certain income statement line items that essentially offset each other. 
We believe the run rate for Individual Life operating earnings remains in the range of $31 million to $33 million per quarter with expected volatility in any one quarter. The favorable mortality experience that we saw in the first quarter of 2011 was offset by current quarter's unfavorable mortality experience. With the exception of the model and assumption changes, we feel that the first 6 months’ earnings are on track to meet full year expectations. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings improved 8% from a year ago to $26 million driven by membership growth and stable loss ratio results, which are key drivers of profitability. Specialty Benefits had sales of $60 million this quarter, up 23% over second quarter 2010. Additionally, the wind-down following our decision to exit the Insured Medical business is progressing well and continues on plan. 
Shifting to total company net income, we delivered $258 million this quarter, our best quarter of net income since before the financial crisis and nearly double that of second quarter 2010. With credit-related investment losses of $39 million after-tax, we continue to see improvement in corporate credit and commercial mortgage whole loan losses. CMBS losses also improve and continue to be manageable. 
Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification. The evolution of our hybrid business model creates a blend of less capital-intensive businesses as we derisk the organization over time. It also helps us weather the current low interest rate environment. Of our $57 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate account assets, $19 billion or 33% includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate, and only $6 billion or 11% is currently at those minimums. For the remaining portion not yet at minimums, we have an average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. 
Given our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to the low interest rate environment. If the quarter end interest rate environment persists, we would expect less than 1% impact on our 2011 and 2012 earnings. 
Moving to our balance sheet, in [ph] street reflects the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. And at $1.6 billion, our net unrealized capital gains position increased $300 million from first quarter 2011 as a $500 million gain from the impact of decreasing interest rates was partially offset by widening spreads. As a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest-rate movement do not result in an economic impact. 
Now moving to capital adequacy. As of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 445% after a distribution of $300 million this quarter from the Life company up to the holding company. This follows the $200 million distribution in first quarter. 
Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.1 billion in total excess capital as of the end of the second quarter. $1.1 billion of the excess capital is at the holding company. Of the $700 million we originally identified for acquisition and share repurchase in 2011, year-to-date, we have committed a total of $350 million towards acquisition, and $250 million has been used for share repurchase. We still have $100 million available to deploy in the second half of 2011. 
However, due to improvement in our earnings and in the credit characteristics of their general account portfolio, our available capital position has improved. As Larry said, we now have up to an additional $300 million to deploy for strategic acquisitions and additional share repurchases during the second half of 2011. This is in addition to the deployable capital for our annual common stock dividend. We're pleased with the financial flexibility our business model provides as we generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow quarter after quarter. 
A couple announcements before I close. First, we announced a few weeks ago that we will host a Principal International workshop on September 16 in New York City. At this event, we will provide greater detail about our international businesses and show why it is a tremendous growth opportunity for The Principal. Additional detail around the key drivers and metrics will also be provided. We'll provide more information as the event gets closer. Second, our third quarter earnings call will be held Friday, October 28. To capitalize on efficiencies gained in our financial close process, we will be moving up our earnings call to an earlier date starting next quarter. 
Again, we are very pleased with the strong financial results of our businesses this quarter. Momentum continues to build as does our long-term growth potential. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

So you saw nice increase in large wins, but at the same time, it doesn't tell the whole story because across our emerging and dynamic space, we had really strong sales. TPA sales were up 52%. Our Allianz relationships were up roughly 37%, TRS continues to be the lead offering from PFG. So across-the-board, TPA, Allianz, large and small, we had a really, really strong year.

I'd remind you in the first quarter of this year, we had the large withdrawal of $2.1 billion from core fixed income by the State Board of Florida. I think I'm safe in mentioning that because it was widely covered in the trade press at the time, and they allocated away from all of their core fixed income. They remain a client for real estate and for international equities, so actually, they remain, if anything, a more important client than they were a year or 2 ago when we had that mandate. This is very characteristic of what we're seeing in the industry, which is core mandates are tending to be rebalanced away from, with clients moving to passive and liability-driven investing. In the fourth quarter last year we had a similar one with a mandate over $1 billion, another a very low fee core mandate that we lost. This quarter was mercifully free of that. So what you're seeing is some degree of reallocation by clients. But the merits of our high-added value strategy that really suits the tendency that clients have to move towards satellite and higher added value mandates. And that's contributing both to the positive flows and to the richer revenues we're seeing. As we sit right now, we don't see any core mandates that are really at critical danger, and we're pretty optimistic for flows given the investment performance that's been referred to and the change in client buying behavior that really suits our multi-boutique structure."

Just maybe a few comments on that. There's still uncertainty around the whole issue of SFIs. But having said that, I guess I would personally have kind of an intuitive feeling that whatever the probability might have been at the start of the year that we would have fallen into that bucket, I would say that my feeling today is the probability is lower than it was at the start of the year. And I say that for several reasons. Number 1, it seems a little bit clearer that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, it seems now more likely to want to have a relatively smaller number of institutions in that designation than perhaps I might have thought 6 months ago. So I think that helps us. Two, I think they're starting to understand the insurance industry better. As you may know, they confirmed this week the insurance member to the FSOC, so we think that will add further education and understanding to that. So the last thing I guess I would say around that is that we have made efforts. First of all, our financial flexibility is high, and our capital position is strong. And we’ve made our best attempts to convert, if you will, our current capital ratios over to what they would be if we tried to apply sort of the banking interpretations to those. And when we do that, assuming again, we've done that in a correct way, and that's a bit of an assumption because there's a translation that's needed, we would find ourselves already with capital ratios that would be at or above the level that Basel III would require. So again, we think as long as we're able to maintain the sort of high capital ratios and financial flexibility we have, we don't see that as having a significant impact going forward. But again, there's more to come on that. But that's the feeling today."

And so to your point, if you look at relative to a year ago, if you look at over the last few years, there has been sort of a steady lessening interest on the part of plan participants for, if you will, guaranteed-type options, which is the spread-based earnings, the spread-based revenue that you're talking about, and that makes perfect sense when you're talking about interest rates that are essentially 0 or something in the order of 1%. So if you look at relative to a year ago, that share, that percentage share that's in the general account guaranteed options down about 2%, and so that alone is going to speak to about 1 basis point decline in revenue. So to your point, there is a shift going on from higher ROA, more capital-intensive options to lower ROA, higher capital flow options, which again we view, quite frankly, as a positive.

Having said that, I think the way to think about your question is actually to look at pretax margins, which is how -- the return on revenue, which is how most asset managers would look at it. And during the financial crisis, our really bad year was 2009 when that measure went down to 15%. We're currently running at about 25%, which I regard as a partial recovery to our long-term target, which would be a little bit over 30% pretax margin. So what I'm really saying is over the next 2 or 3 years, absent another financial crisis, like 2008, '09, absent that, we should be able to build back to margins over, or a little bit over, 30% together with the accretion from the couple of acquisitions we've already done plus the acquisitions that we're hoping to do over the next year or 2. So if you put it all together, you're recall that I put a fairly aggressive, or it looked aggressive at that time, projection for Principal Global Investors earnings at the Investor Day last December. The way I would put it is we are ahead of schedule and moving towards that 30% margin I talked about in December.

So over the course of the last couple of years, we've incurred a fair bit of negative credit drift, and this is really the first quarter where we started to see just a very slight turnaround in that. It's probably too early to forecast that of any sizable magnitude given the problems with the U.S. and the potential downgrade of U.S. credit. But that's just something to kind of keep your eye on as we go forward, which could be some positive trends around credit drifts. So I'll have Terry talk about the corporate and other."

It does -- 2/3 of the net income is going towards free cash flow, as we don't need as much to support the organic growth. As terms of overhead that we are now seeing in the corporate segment, we said at the beginning of the year that would be about $8 million per quarter. And as we progress through the year, we've reduced that amount, and it is getting lower, currently around $6 million in the current quarter. Other businesses are growing into that overhead. We're reducing some expenses as well. So we are managing that, and we're in line to remove that overhead over the 18 to 24 months that we'd mentioned last fall."

My personal belief would be is that between now and election in November 2012, it'd be highly unlikely that we would get into a debate that's going to be as confrontational as that one is. I think if the election in 2012 provided some clarity either way, relative to political party, then there's maybe some possibility of that in, say, 2013. So that -- my point is, it would be a ways out there if there was going to be any discussion, and it would be very much dependent on the election. Having said that, we are, of course, much less, if you will, life insurance than many of our peers. So if inside buildup is an issue, that's a little bit less of an issue for us.

We've leveraged those Allianz relationships, not only to include Full Service but mutual funds and annuities. So again, it's a very comprehensive view.

So it's not that there are more -- that there's more interest by advisors or by plan sponsors in TPA.

As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll discuss financial results. Third quarter had more than the usual amount of noise associated with marketing events that may mask underlying growth which remains strong. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful implementation and execution of our strategy. And I'll close with some comments on the regulatory environment as well as other items that demonstrate the growing strength of the Principal. Then Terry will cover the financial results in more detail and discuss the long-term impact of low interest rates and impacts of the 2012 results from the new deferred acquisition costs guidance. 
Overall, while third quarter financial results were impacted by external market factors which I'll discussed briefly, we are pleased with the continuing momentum of our businesses. That momentum has been building throughout 2011 and has reflected in strong year-to-date results in all of our businesses.
Despite the economic and market headwinds, we remain optimistic that the ongoing momentum and strong underlying fundamentals of our business will carry on onto fourth quarter. 
Let's look at the third quarter financial results in more detail. As Terry will discuss, we incurred approximately $22 million, or $0.07 per share, of market-related deferred acquisition cost impacts caused by the 14% decline in the S&P 500 for the quarter. In addition, we saw the variable condition income of excess capital held at the holding company be reduced by $12 million or $0.04 per share due to negative marks caused by a widening of credit spreads during the quarter. Despite the impact of these on our quarterly financial results, the growth metrics of sales and net cash flow continue to be outstanding for the quarter, including Full Service Accumulation sales of $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 72% over third quarter 2010, driving net cash flows to $350 million compared to negative net cash flows of $200 million in third quarter 2010.
Principal Funds' third quarter sales $2.6 billion grow $180 million of net cash flows this quarter. Principal Global Investors unaffiliated net cash flows were $1.2 billion this quarter as a result of strong sales and $5.6 million in deposits. 
And Principal International net cash flows of $700 million in third quarter 2011 were down slightly from third quarter 2010 caused by slower growth in Asia. Importantly, pipelines remain strong across the businesses although continuing economic uncertainty may have an impact over time. Because quarterly financial results are often impacted by short-term economic and market events, it is more constructive to look at year-to-date results for both sales and financial results to see the health of the businesses. 
Full Service Accumulation sales are $5.2 billion year-to-date and year-to-date net cash flow is $2.2 billion.
For full-year 2011, we expect Full Service Accumulation sales to increase 20% to 25% over 2010 sales. Principal Funds' year-to-date sales are up 20% and year-to-date net cash flows have increased 29% over 2010. For the full year, we expect Funds' sales to be up approximately 15% and net cash flows to be approximately 5% of beginning account value. 
Principal Global Investors' operating revenues are 14% year-to-date and operating earnings are up 44%. Investment performance remains solid and our unaffiliated pipeline continues to be strong. 
Principal International continues to have another solid year with $3.8 billion of net cash flow year-to-date which are up 32% over 2010, and record assets under management of $55 million which are up 29% over 2010.
In U.S. Insurance Solutions, individualized sales are up 14% year-to-date. Premiums and deposits are up 11% year-to-date, driven by sales in the nonqualified and business owner market which now account for 58% of Individual Life sales.
Specialty Benefits sales are up 29% year-to-date, driving premium and fees up 6% year to date. Importantly, we have now have 5 consecutive quarters of growth with new sales premium exceeding client lapses. This momentum across our business positions up for continuing growth in the U.S. and the international markets where we operate. 
We also benefit from the overall diversification in the sources of our revenues and operating earnings where 60% of operating earnings coming from fee-based businesses. Next, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy. 
The key differentiator for Full Service Accumulation continues to be our Principal Total Retirement Suite, with 51% of sales on the Total Retirement Suite platform. Total Retirement Suite close ratios continue to be double those of single retirement product sales. Persistency is better for this block as well with a 20% improvement in last rates compared to non-Total Retirement Suite plans. Our focus on the headlines distribution channel continues to drive strong Full Service Accumulation sales with year-to-date sales of 46% over the prior year. We continue to gain traction with third-party administrator sales as well. Our increased focus on this market gives us access to a broader base of advisors and helps us capture additional market share. 
Moving now to Principal Funds. Sales results are driven by good investment performance and demand for our innovative products such as the Principal Global Diversified income fund. To further meet the growing retirement income solutions, this month, we launched the Global Multi-strategy Fund which seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation with an emphasis on positive total returns and relatively low volatility. 
A couple of quick comments about the execution of our their boutique strategy in Principal Global Investors. We successfully closed our acquisition of a majority stake in Origin and a London-based global equity specialist on October 3. Origin's strong performance track record combined with our global distribution network provides us additional capacity in international equities. 
The onboarding of Finisterre, an emerging market fixed income boutique, also based in London, has been very successful as well. We've had tremendous support from Finisterre's key consultants and have retained all of their clients during this transition. Finisterre's impressive track record combined with our distribution network sets the stage to attract a significant flow in the future as investors see opportunities for diversification in emerging markets. 
We continue to see increasing demand for higher yield products as well as other areas where we have expertise such as preferred securities, real estate and emerging markets which generate higher revenue and higher margins.
As we said at the Principal International workshop, the carefully selected emerging markets in Asia and Latin America which we are operating in today, have tremendous growth in middle-class populations and privatization of retirement systems is rapidly taking hold.
Our strategy is to export a retirement and investment management expertise to these key emerging markets to work with marquis distribution partners in these countries, and to go deeper into these markets for organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions. Our focused execution has resulted in rapid growth of the businesses. We were early entrants into these markets and we continue to see growth in operating earnings of 15% to 20%. We are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in these markets as we move forward. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the continued execution for strategy across the businesses. With a strategy that is focused on long-term growth, our outlook remains positive despite market volatility and continued choppy economic recovery.
Let me quickly comment on the impact of an extended period of low interest rates. The evolution of our business model towards fee-based businesses creates a blend of less capital intensive businesses to help us weather the current low interest rate environment. Terry will go into more detail on the impact if low interest rates persist over time, but let me simply say that the current low interest rates would have to continue for an extended period, at least 3 years, before they would have a meaningful impact on our operating earnings.
Moving now to some comments on the strength and flexibility of our financial position, I'm very pleased with the capital deployment actions we've taken in 2011 which reflect execution of 2 acquisitions, 2 share repurchase programs, and as we announced yesterday, a 27% increase in our annual common stock dividend which will be paid in early December. 
Our shift to a more fee-based business model means we need less cash to support organic growth and enables us to deploy more capital towards strategic acquisitions and return more capital to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have $1.8 billion of excess capital.
This gives us a continuing capital flexibility in what remains an uncertain environment. 
Let me move to some positive regulatory developments. Based on recent updates, it appears unlikely that we'll be named a systemically important financial institution or be considered a major slop participant. Therefore, I remain confident in our ability to continue with our current successful business model. 
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize a significant milestone for the company. Last Sunday was the 10th anniversary of our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a public company set the stage for a decade of growth as the Principal continued its evolution from a one's largely insurance based organization to its status today as an investment management leader. The Principal was named Investment Brand of the Year in the 2011 Harris Poll Equitrends Study which further demonstrates the transformation of our business model over the last 10 years.
As the first U.S. company to go public after 9/11, we recognized the significance of moving forward while never forgetting the tragic events of that day. In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of our in 9/11 we'll be making charitable gifts to several programs in support of families of New York City police and firefighters and deployed service personnel. As further recognition of our commitment to those that serve in the military, the Principal was 1 of the only 15 companies out of more than 4,000 nominations to receive a 2011 Freedom Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve group, a Department of Defense agency. It's the highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support of their employees serving in the guard and reserve.

The trend as strong business fundamentals continued in the third quarter. This morning, I'll focus on my comments on operating earnings and net income for the quarter, more detail around our modest exposure to a sustaining below-interest rate environment, an update on our capital position and deployment strategy and an overview over the projected impact of new deferred acquisition cost guidance starting in 2012. 
Starting with total company results, operating earnings of $192 million were down 12% from a year ago quarter on 11% higher average assets under management. There were few items impacting third quarter 2011 operating earnings. 2 of the major items were: Third quarter 2011 had negative DAC amortization due to the equity market performance which impacted Full Service Accumulation, Individual Annuities and Individual Life by $0.07 in total. And in third quarter 2011, the Corporate segment was impacted by $0.04 from lower variable interest income on excess capital held at the holding company due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads. Adjusting for these items, we consider the earnings-per-share run rate for the third quarter to be $0.72 and third quarter 2011 earnings up 12% on an 11% increase in average assets under management compared to adjusted third quarter 2010. 
Now let me discuss business unit results. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings of $71 million were down 12% from a year ago quarter on a 12% increase in average account values as a result of higher DAC amortization from negative equity market returns. With the recent market volatility, looking over an extended period of time provides a more normalized view. On a year-to-date basis, adjusting for the equity market impact, 2011 operating earnings are in line with the increase in average account values as compared to 2010. We continue to see our Full Service Accumulation sales pipeline built across market sizes and distribution channels and close ratios that are true to precrisis levels. This will help drive full-year net cash flow results that we now expect to be approximately 3% of beginning account values.
Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating leverage. Operating earnings at $13 million in the third quarter were up 47% over a year-ago quarter on a 16% increase in average account values. Though the retail industry experienced outflows this quarter as investors pulled back a bit, our innovative product solutions and multichannel distribution models continue to generate strong sales growth and positive flows. Competitive investment performance also contributed to strong fund sales. This includes particular strength in asset allocation, where at quarter end, 84% for target date and target risk funds were in the top half on a 1-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. 
Individual Annuities' operating earnings at $15 million were lower because of higher DAC amortization due to negative equity market returns in the quarter, while a year ago quarter saw a positive equity market returns and had positive true ups. Adjusting for this, earnings were comparable between the 2 periods. Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $19 million improved 27% from the year-ago quarter on a 6% increase in average assets under management, reflecting the operating leverage in this business. 
Client search activity continues despite current market volatility, and because of this, we remain optimistic about flows over the next few quarters. 
Moving to the Principal International, operating earnings of $37 million were up 11% from third quarter 2010. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $55 billion, $62 billion when including China despite recently strengthening dollar. This growth was driven by organic net cash flows of $700 million and $3.1 billion of operations acquired with the HSBC Mexican AFORE business. We closed this transaction in early August and fully integrated the companies in September. This transaction increases our scale on a mandatory retirement business in Mexico. 
Since this acquisition leverages our existing infrastructure, it was immediately accretive in the third quarter. The benefit of the third quarter was partially offset by acquisition cost. We expect the benefit of $5 million to $6 million per quarter to be fully realized in the fourth quarter.
Individual Life on operating earnings were $26 million. Current quarter results were adversely affected by higher DAC amortization due to negative equity market returns and slightly unfavorable mortality experience. After adjusting for these items, operating earnings remain in line with previously communicated expectations. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings declined 12% from a year-ago quarter to $22 million, reflecting quarterly volatility in claims experience. While third quarter 2010 loss ratios were at the low end of our 65% to 71% targeted range, third quarter 2011 loss ratios were on the higher end of that range. However, the year-to-date loss ratio comparison between the 2 periods is equal, and year-to-date earnings were up 14% on 6% higher premiums. Corporate reported operating loss of $40 million driven by approximately $12 million earnings shortfall from lower variable investment income on excess capital held at the holding company due to negative marks by cost by margin widening credit spreads. We view the quarterly run rate earnings for corporate to be a $30 million operating loss with some volatility around this result. 
Total company net income of $64 million this quarter was impacted by a court ruling regarding some uncertain tax positions and the estimated obligation associated with New York State Department's liquidation plan for the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York.
We also experienced $38 billion of credit-related investment losses during the quarter. While the credit environment remains choppy, the losses remain manageable and we continue to see improvement in our portfolio reflecting the benefit of broad asset diversification. 
As Larry mentioned, with the evolution of our business model, we now have much higher portion of earnings coming from less capital intensive businesses. Of our $57 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate account assets, $19 billion or 34% includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate, and only $7 million or 12% is currently at those minimums. For the remaining portion not at the minimums, we have an average of 70 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. Given our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to low interest environment. If the quarter end low-interest rate environment persists, we would a 1% to 2% impact on our expected 2012 earnings, growing to 3% to 8% impact if conditions persist beyond that. If the low interest rate period were to persist for an extended period of time, it may result in a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption used to model deferred acquisition costs and related actual Royal balances. If we were to lower our long-term interest rate assumption by 25 basis points for every segment across the company, it may result in an additional one-time $25 million to $35 million after-tax reduction to operating earnings. And as part of our periodic review of assumptions we monitor the interest rate environment and do not expect an immediate need to lower our long-term interest rate assumption. Moving to our balance sheet.
Our net unrealized gain position of $1.6 billion  was unchanged from second quarter 2011. Our $1.2 billion gain from impact of decreasing interest rate was offset by widening credit spreads. And as a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in an economic impact, and it does not force us to sell assets. 
Now moving to capital adequacy. As of quarter-end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 455%. Relative to a 550% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.8 billion of total excess capital as of the end of the third quarter with $700 million of the excess capital at the holding company. Including the Origin acquisition that closed on October 3, the we have deployed $350 million for strategic acquisition environment and $450 million for share repurchase.
Additionally, we have announced a $0.70 per share common stock dividend, a 27% increase over last year's $0.55 per share common stock dividend. This brings our total capital deployed year-to-date to $1 billion and reflects the improvement in the free cash flow generation of our business model that is more fee-based, and the long-term commitment that we made to turn excess capital to shareholders.
As always, we'll continue to evaluate additional capital deployment opportunities. I'd now like to take a moment to provide an overview of the expected impact of the new deferred acquisition cost guidance on our businesses and starting in 2012.
In October 2010, the FAS B issued an update that narrows the definition of acquisition costs that can be capitalized and deferred by insurance companies. Starting in January 2012, only incremental direct cost of contract acquisitions can be deferred. All other costs are to be expensed as incurred. We expect to apply this guidance retrospectively. This will result in less capitalization of acquisition cost, resulting in increased current period expenses. It will also result in a reduction of our deferred acquisition costs assets as well as eliminate any future amortization associated with deferred cost assets written off as of beginning of the year. For growing companies like the Principal, the reduction in first year cost that could be capitalized could be greater than the reduction of the annual amortization of the Lord heard cost acquisition asset.
Consequently, near-term operating earnings will be lower than the current methodology. However, this is a change in timing of earnings recognition and economic earnings of the underlying businesses remain unchanged. We are still evaluating full impact implementing this guidance, but we currently estimate that our adoption will result in a reduction in the opening balance of retained earnings $550 million to $750 million at January 1, 2012.
We also currently estimate that adopting this new guidance will result in a net $35 million to $45 million full-year reduction to 2012 operating earnings. These estimates are based upon our current operating assumptions and current interpretations of the guidance and are subject to change. The majority of this impact will be in Full Service Accumulation an Individual Life with much smaller impacts on Individual Annuities, Principal International and Specialty Benefits division. On a positive note, going forward, we will have less earnings volatility in Full Service Accumulation since there'll be a lower acquisition cost assets subject to true ups from equity markets, returns and experience adjustments.
Before I close, I'd like to also announce that on December 1, we will provide our 2012 EPS guidance and an update on our capital deployment strategy. We'll provide more details as the event gets closer.
In closing, we are very pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals of the businesses as we look into the 2012 and beyond. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

When we look at just startup plans, if you go back to the era of '05, '06 and '07 there were 1,500 to 1,800 startup plans. If we look at where we're at year-to-date, start-up plans was about 820.

If we look at where we're at year-to-date, start-up plans was about 820. If you annual it, you kind of get to that 1,100 or so plans for full year 2011. So in terms of just contributing to positive case count growth, we're only running about 65% or 70% of where we had historically, we've been running for those startup plans. The second negative impact that you have on plan counts are just the plan terminations. Again, we talked about this on previous calls, but it's businesses that have gone out of business, and therefore they've terminated the plan. When we look at the ongoing flow of new cases relative to those that we've lost, we've had 6 consecutive positive quarters now of growth for case count. So again, I think this has far more to do with the external environment about the lack of startup plans and plan terminations due to going out of business than anything else. In terms of deferrals and matches and participation, participation is about where it has historically run, recognizing there's a little bit of downside. There's a little bit of a positive upside on participation due to some of the plans having auto-enroll, auto-escalate and those kind of come in that 25% to 30% range. If we look at average deferrals, it's up a little bit which is a very positive component when you think about the number of new people that might be -- being added at the low end of the range. Hardship withdrawals were flat and then if we look at loans, loans are up about 5% relative to a year ago, but those loans, again, as a percentage of the total assets that's still a relatively small number. So again, the fundamentals of the business both from case count participation, deferrals look good. My closing comment would be around matching contributions. We've said in previous calls that about 80% of our plans are discretionary, about 20% are stated matches and of those stated matches that someone has previously made a change in either decreasing or suspending their match, about 1/3 of those individuals or those corporations are now -- put their match back in place either at the same level or increased it. Hope that helps, Jimmy."

This year has been a very good year for us in the ESOP area. About 23% of our new case sales have had an ESOP component.

A couple of years ago, we determined that we'd like to earn more than cash return on a portion of of that excess capital before that excess capital got deployed. So PGR manages a credit strategy and that simply they purchase investment grade bonds, they hedge out the interest rate risk and then they more actively trade that credit. And you know the PGI fixed income has the skill set at that. Because the strategy is more actively traded, then the rest of our portfolio, all of that return, including the marks run through net investment income. The strategy works very well for us, simply sectioned, through third quarter, so concluding this quarter. And that has returned about 9%. So clearly better than cash. So third quarter's performance was clearly an underperformance relative to our expectations and the expectation, again, for any kind of action strategy is tough, but we would expect that to be in that $3 million to $4 million range per quarter rather than the negative $7 million we had this quarter.

We're going to continue to be strong capital generators.

What was the remainder? Was that just derivatives or was that on the commercial mortgage book?

First of all, the bank has been a net contributor to profitability over time. And for example, in the current quarter, it was a contributor in the range of sort of $3 million to $4 million positive for the current quarter. So it has been a positive contributor. We obviously wouldn't -- we wouldn't have a banking business if it wasn't profitable. We don't believe in loss leaders, that's just not part of our make up. So it's a given that the bank is going to have to perform at an acceptable level, acceptably profitable level, and has done that. Now in terms of the strategic rationale for the bank, I would say the strategic rationale for the bank is really in 2 areas: one is job changers, and the second is retirees. The reality is is that the most commonly understood financial products by the sort of middle-income population or banking products. And so the ability to use banking products as a receptacle as a roll over iris sort of receptacle for job changers have been very powerful. And as you know, we've had a lot of success with asset retention for job changers. We stay right in that sort of low 50% range, and frankly having the bank is one critical component of that. I think the emerging opportunity for the bank at which, frankly, we have yet to capitalize on, is we need to do a better job, we need to position the bank strategically to be that income management receptacle for people as they enter into retirement. So people today, retirees in particular, quite mobile and I think the opportunity around an internet bank so they can get access to funds no matter where they are in the U.S. or internationally, something that's very powerful. But we have to do a little more work to build that out, but I think the strategic rationale of the bank is actually very solid. Obviously, we have to match that up against whatever other elements there may be to having a bank we're obviously very well aware of all those items and we'll continue to monitor all of that and see where we come out. But from a strategic perspective, let me be very clear, the bank does have, in place today, a very, very meaningful role. So let me have Julia comment on the credit losses and then Dan can comment 401 k fees."

And I don't know that's changed in the 27 years I've been around the topic. Fees have been probably taken a higher priority in the last couple of years due to small-, medium-sized businesses having pressure on their cost of running their businesses. So what have we done to respond to that? Part of it's à la cart pricing, eliminating services that our customers don't value and unwilling pay for. We're also managing our own expenses here, we're taking advantage of our scale. We've also tried to make sure that we're emphasizing the value of Total Retirement Suite which is a different value proposition than just standalone 401 k. Customers put a lot of value on our retire , our ability to go out there and educate our -- those plan participants small to medium-size businesses. And we also do a fair amount of consulting if around deferred comp and ESOP and Defined Benefit. And the comment maybe I would make is on all plans greater than $5 million, which you if look at that based on assets, it's probably 2/3 of our assets.

As I think it's into the question, there's been quite a lot of change in client buying behavior over last 4 or 5 years. What we are seeing is a strong client appetite across many different types of client for income-based products. So our high-yield, preferreds, mortgages and emerging market debt are all seeing very good receptions from clients. And that speaks, by the way, into what Larry and Terry said about the strong growth in principal mutual fund sales because the retail clients in the U.S. likes those income-based products. And secondly, we've seen very strong demand for specialty equity products including emerging markets. But of course, by principal, Global Investors working with Principal International, we have Principal of a very strong footprint in emerging markets. And that's been a big positive in terms of the client reception of our investment products. And then certainly, real estate which is a very long-established specialty of principle, but one that's come very much into focus in the last year or two. So if you add these up, that's why we have seen such a strong performance in the last quarter, and actually masked by a few large core client redemptions for several quarters now and why we've expressed some optimism about the pipeline and then these products that I've mentioned, these capabilities that are appealing to clients, the strong performance is also fed into the asset allocation performance that Terry described in the prepared remarks. So I think all of this is really playing well into the growth of our fee-based business as across the Principal platform. Principal Mutual Funds, Dan mentioned the importance of investment performance and capabilities for Full Service Accumulation. We are quietly pretty confident about how that whole investment platform is developing from the benefit of our fee-based businesses."

As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll discuss financial results. Third quarter had more than the usual amount of noise associated with market events that may mask underlying growth, which remains strong. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful implementation and execution of our strategy. And I'll close with some comments on the regulatory environment, as well as other items that demonstrate the growing strength of the Principal. Then Terry will cover the financial results in more detail and discuss the long-term impact of low interest rates and impacts to the 2012 results from the new deferred acquisition cost guidance. 
Overall, while third quarter financial results were impacted by external market factors, which I'll discussed briefly, we are pleased with the continuing momentum of our businesses. That momentum has been building throughout 2011 and has reflected in strong year-to-date results in all of our businesses.
Despite the economic and market headwinds, we remain optimistic that the ongoing momentum and strong underlying fundamentals of our business will carry on into fourth quarter. 
Let's look at the third quarter financial results in more detail. As Terry will discuss, we incurred approximately $22 million or $0.07 per share of market-related deferred acquisition cost impacts caused by the 14% decline in the S&P 500 for the quarter. In addition, we saw the variable investment income on excess capital held at the holding company be reduced by $12 million or $0.04 per share due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads during the quarter. Despite the impact of these on our quarterly financial results, the growth metrics of sales and net cash flow continue to be outstanding for the quarter, including Full Service Accumulation sales of $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 72% over third quarter 2010, driving net cash flows to $350 million compared to negative net cash flows of $200 million in third quarter 2010.
Principal Funds' third quarter sales of $2.6 billion grow $180 million of net cash flows this quarter. Principal Global Investors unaffiliated net cash flows were $1.2 billion this quarter as a result of strong sales and $5.6 billion in deposits. And Principal International net cash flows of $700 million in third quarter 2011 were down slightly from third quarter 2010, caused by slower growth in Asia. 
Importantly, pipelines remain strong across our businesses, although continuing economic uncertainty may have an impact over time. Because quarterly financial results are often impacted by short-term economic and market events, it is more constructive to look at year-to-date results for both sales and financial results to see the health of the businesses. 
Full Service Accumulation sales are $5.2 billion year-to-date, and year-to-date net cash flow is $2.2 billion. For our full-year 2011, we expect Full Service Accumulation sales to increase 20% to 25% over 2010 sales. Principal Funds' year-to-date sales are up 20%, and year-to-date net cash flows have increased 29% over 2010. For the full year, we expect Funds' sales to be up approximately 15% and net cash flows to be approximately 5% of beginning account value. 
Principal Global Investors' operating revenues are up 14% year-to-date, and operating earnings are up 44%. Investment performance remains solid, and our unaffiliated pipeline continues to be strong. 
Principal International continues to have another solid year, with $3.8 billion of net cash flows year-to-date, which are up 32% over 2010, and record assets under management of $55 billion, which are up 29% over 2010.
In U.S. Insurance Solutions, individualized sales are up 14% year-to-date. Premiums and deposits are up 11% year-to-date, driven by sales in the nonqualified and business owner market, which now account for 58% of Individual Life sales.
Specialty Benefits sales are up 29% year-to-date, driving premium and fees up 6% year-to-date. Importantly, we have now had 5 consecutive quarters of growth, with new sales premium exceeding client lapses. This momentum across our businesses positions us for continuing growth in the U.S. and the international markets where we operate. 
We also benefit from the overall diversification in the sources of our revenues and operating earnings, where 60% of operating earnings coming from fee-based businesses. Next, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy. 
The key differentiator for our Full Service Accumulation continues to be our Principal Total Retirement Suite, with 51% of sales on the Total Retirement Suite platform. Total Retirement Suite close ratios continue to be double those of single retirement product sales. Persistency is better for this block as well, with a 20% improvement in last rates compared to non-Total Retirement Suite plans. 
Our focus on the Allianz distribution channel continues to drive strong Full Service Accumulation sales, with year-to-date Allianz sales up 46% over the prior year. We continue to gain traction with third-party administrator sales as well. Our increased focus on this market gives us access to a broader base of advisors and helps us capture additional market share. 
Moving now to Principal Funds. Sales results are driven by good investment performance and demand for our innovative products, such as the Principal Global Diversified Income Fund. To further meet the growing need for retirement income solutions, this month, we launched the Global Multi-Strategy Fund, which seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation, with an emphasis on positive total returns and relatively low volatility. 
A couple of quick comments about the execution of our boutique strategy in Principal Global Investors. We successfully closed on the acquisition of a majority stake in Origin, a London-based global equity specialist, on October 3. Origin's strong performance track record, combined with our global distribution network, provides us additional capacity in international equities. 
The onboarding of Finisterre, an emerging market fixed income boutique, also based in London, has been very successful as well. We've had tremendous support from Finisterre's key consultants and have retained all of their clients during this transition. Finisterre's impressive track record, combined with our distribution network, sets the stage to attract a significant flow in the future, as investors see opportunities for diversification in emerging markets. 
We continue to see increasing demand for higher yield products, as well as other areas where we have expertise, such as preferred securities, real estate and emerging markets, which generate higher revenue and higher margins.
As we said at the Principal International workshop, the carefully-selected emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, which we are operating in today, have tremendous growth in middle-class populations. And privatization of retirement systems is rapidly taking hold.
Our strategy is to export a retirement and investment management expertise to these key emerging markets to work with marquis distribution partners in these countries and to go deeper into these markets through organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions. Our focused execution has resulted in rapid growth of the businesses. We were early entrants into these markets, and we continue to see growth in operating earnings of 15% to 20%. We are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in these markets as we move forward. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the continued execution of our strategy across the businesses. With a strategy that is focused on long-term growth, our outlook remains positive, despite market volatility and continued choppy economic recovery.
Let me quickly comment on the impact of an extended period of low interest rates. The evolution of our business model towards fee-based businesses creates a blend of less capital-intensive businesses that helps us weather the current low interest rate environment. Terry will go into more detail on the impact if low interest rates persist over time, but let me simply say that the current low interest rates would have to continue for an extended period, at least 3 years, before they would have a meaningful impact on our operating earnings.
Moving now to some comments on the strength and flexibility of our financial position. I'm very pleased with the capital deployment actions we've taken in 2011, which reflect execution of 3 acquisitions, 2 share repurchase programs, and as we announced yesterday, a 27% increase in our annual common stock dividend, which will be paid in early December. 
Our shift to a more fee-based business model means we need less cash to support organic growth and enables us to deploy more capital towards strategic acquisitions and return more capital to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have $1.8 billion of excess capital. This gives us continuing capital flexibility in what remains an uncertain environment. 
Let me move to some positive regulatory developments. Based on recent updates, it appears unlikely that we'll be named a systemically-important financial institution or be considered a major slop participant. Therefore, I remain confident in our ability to continue with our current successful business model. 
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize a significant milestone for the company. Last Sunday was the 10th anniversary of our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a public company set the stage for a decade of growth, as the Principal continued its evolution from a once-largely insurance-based organization to its status today as an investment management leader. The Principal was named Investment Brand of the Year in the 2011 Harris Poll Equitrend study, which further demonstrates the transformation of our business model over the last 10 years.
As the first U.S. company to go public after 9/11, we recognized the significance of moving forward, while never forgetting the tragic events of that day. In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of our IPO in 9/11, we'll be making charitable gifts to several programs in support of families of New York City police and firefighters and deployed service personnel. As further recognition of our commitment to those that serve in the military, the Principal was 1 of only 15 companies, out of more than 4,000 nominations, to receive a 2011 Freedom Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve group, a Department of Defense agency. It's the highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support of their employees serving in the guard and reserve.

The trend of strong business fundamentals continued in the third quarter. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings and net income for the quarter, more detail around our modest exposure to a sustaining low interest rate environment, an update on our capital position and deployment strategy and an overview over the projected impact of new deferred acquisition cost guidance starting in 2012. 
Starting with total company results, operating earnings of $192 million were down 12% from a year-ago quarter, on 11% higher average assets under management. There were a few items impacting third quarter 2011 operating earnings. 2 of the major items were: third quarter 2011 had negative DAC amortization true-ups due to the equity market performance, which impacted Full Service Accumulation, Individual Annuities and Individual Life by $0.07 in total; and in third quarter 2011, the Corporate segment was impacted by $0.04 from lower variable interest income on excess capital held at the holding company due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads. Adjusting for these items, we consider the earnings-per-share run rate for the third quarter to be $0.72, and third quarter 2011 earnings up 12%, on an 11% increase in average assets under management compared to an adjusted third quarter 2010. 
Now let me discuss business unit results. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $71 million were down 12% from a year-ago quarter, on a 12% increase in average account values as a result of higher DAC amortization from negative equity market returns. With the recent market volatility, looking over an extended period of time provides a more normalized view. On a year-to-date basis, adjusting for the equity market impact, 2011 operating earnings are in line with the increase in average account values as compared to 2010. We continue to see our Full Service Accumulation sales pipeline build across market sizes and distribution channels and close ratios that returned to precrisis levels. This will help drive full-year net cash flow results that we now expect to be approximately 3% of beginning account values.
Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating leverage. Operating earnings at $13 million in the third quarter were up 47% over a year-ago quarter, on a 16% increase in average account values. Though the retail industry experienced outflows this quarter as investors pulled back a bit, our innovative product solutions and multichannel distribution model continue to generate strong sales growth and positive flows. 
Competitive investment performance also contributed strong fund sales. This includes particular strength in asset allocation, where at quarter end, 84% of target date and target risk funds were in the top half on a 1-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. 
Individual Annuities' operating earnings at $15 million were lower because of higher DAC amortization due to negative equity market returns in the quarter, while a year-ago quarter saw a positive equity market returns and had positive true-ups. Adjusting for this, earnings are comparable between the 2 periods. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $19 million improved 27% from a year-ago quarter, on a 6% increase in average assets under management, reflecting the operating leverage in this business. 
Client search activity continues despite current market volatility, and because of this, we remain optimistic about flows over the next few quarters. 
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings at $37 million were up 11% from the third quarter 2010. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $55 billion, $62 billion when including China despite recently strengthening dollar. This growth was driven by organic net cash flows of $700 million and $3.1 billion of operations acquired with the HSBC Mexican AFORE business. We closed this transaction in early August and fully integrated the companies in September. This transaction increases our scale in the mandatory retirement business in Mexico. 
Since this acquisition leverages our existing infrastructure, it was immediately accretive in the third quarter. The benefit of the third quarter was partially offset by acquisition costs. We expect the benefit of $5 million to $6 million per quarter to be fully realized in the fourth quarter.
Individual Life operating earnings were $26 million. Current quarter results were adversely impacted by higher DAC amortization due to negative equity market returns and slightly unfavorable mortality experience. After adjusting for these items, operating earnings remain in line with previously-communicated expectations. 
Turning to Specialty Benefit, operating earnings declined 12% from the year-ago quarter to $22 million, reflecting quarterly volatility in claims experience. 
While third quarter 2010 loss ratios were at the low end of our 65% to 71% targeted range, third quarter 2011 loss ratios were on the higher end of that range. However, the year-to-date loss ratio comparison between the 2 periods is equal, and year-to-date operating earnings are up 14%, on 6% higher premiums. 
Corporate reported operating loss of $40 million, driven by approximately $12 million earnings shortfall from lower variable investment income on excess capital held at the holding company due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads. We view the quarterly run rate earnings for Corporate to be a $30 million operating loss, with some volatility around this result. 
Total company net income of $64 million this quarter was impacted by a court ruling regarding some uncertain tax positions and the estimated obligation associated with the New York State Insurance Department's liquidation plan for the Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York.
We also experienced $38 million of credit-related investment losses during the quarter. While the credit environment remains choppy, the losses remain manageable, and we continue to see improvement in our portfolio, reflecting the benefit of broad asset diversification. 
As Larry mentioned, with the evolution of our business model, we now have much higher portion of earnings coming from less capital intensive businesses. Of our $57 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate account assets, $19 billion or 34% includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate, and only $7 billion or 12% is currently at those minimums. For the remaining portion not at the minimums, we have an average of 70 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. Given our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to low interest environment. 
If the quarter-end low interest rate environment persists, we would a 1% to 2% impact on our expected 2012 earnings, growing to 3% to 8% impact if conditions persist beyond that. If the low interest rate period were to persist for an extended period of time, it may result in a reduction in our long-term interest rate assumption used to model deferred acquisition costs and related actuarial balances. If we were to lower our long-term interest rate assumption by 25 basis points for every segment across the company, it may result in an additional onetime $25 million to $35 million after-tax reduction to operating earnings. As part of our periodic review of assumptions, we monitor the interest rate environment and do not expect an immediate need to lower our long-term interest rate assumption. 
Moving to our balance sheet. Our net unrealized gain position of $1.6 billion was unchanged from second quarter 2011. Our $1.2 billion gain from impact of decreasing interest rates was offset by widening credit spreads. And as a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in an economic impact, and it does not force us to sell assets. 
Now moving to capital adequacy. As of quarter-end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 455%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.8 billion of total excess capital as of the end of the third quarter, with $700 million of the excess capital at the holding company. Including the Origin acquisition that closed on October 3, we have deployed $350 million for strategic acquisition and $450 million for share repurchase.
Additionally, we have announced a $0.70 per share common stock dividend, a 27% increase over last year's $0.55 per share common stock dividend. This brings our total capital deployed year-to-date to $1 billion and reflects the improvement in the free cash flow generation of our business model that is more fee-based, and the long-term commitment that we made to turn excess capital to shareholders. As always, we'll continue to evaluate additional capital deployment opportunities. 
 
I'd now like to take a moment to provide an overview of the expected impact of the new deferred acquisition cost guidance on our businesses and starting in 2012. In October 2010, the FASB issued an update that narrows the definition of acquisition costs that can be capitalized and deferred by insurance companies. Starting in January 2012, only incremental direct cost of contract acquisitions can be deferred. All other costs are to be expensed as incurred. We expect to apply this guidance retrospectively. This will result in less capitalization of acquisition costs, resulting in increased current period expenses. It will also result in a reduction of our deferred acquisition cost asset, as well as eliminate any future amortization associated with deferred acquisition cost assets written off as of the beginning of the year. For growing companies like the Principal, the reduction in first year cost that can be capitalized could be greater than the reduction in the annual amortization of the lower deferred acquisition cost asset.
Consequently, near-term operating earnings will be lower than under the current methodology. However, this is a change in timing of earnings recognition, and the economic earnings of the underlying businesses remain unchanged. We are still evaluating the full impacts of implementing this guidance, but we currently estimate that our adoption will result in a reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings between $550 million to $750 million at January 1, 2012.
We also currently estimate that adopting this new guidance will result in a net $35 million to $45 million full-year reduction to 2012 operating earnings. These estimates are based upon our current operating assumptions and current interpretation of the guidance and are subject to change. The majority of this impact will be in Full Service Accumulation an Individual Life, with much smaller impacts on Individual Annuities, Principal International and Specialty Benefits division. 
On a positive note, going forward, we will have less earnings volatility in Full Service Accumulation since there will be a lower deferred acquisition cost asset subject to true-ups from equity market, returns and experience adjustments.
Before I close, I'd like to also announce that on December 1, we will provide our 2012 EPS guidance and an update on our capital deployment strategy. We'll provide more details as the event gets closer.
In closing, we are very pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals of the businesses as we look into 2012 and beyond. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

When we just look at just startup plans, if you go back to the era of '05, '06 and '07, there were 1,500 to 1,800 startup plans.

When we just look at just startup plans, if you go back to the era of '05, '06 and '07, there were 1,500 to 1,800 startup plans. If we look at where we're at year-to-date, startup plans was about 820. If you annualize it, you kind of get to that 1,100 or so plans for our full-year 2011. So in terms of just contributing to positive case count growth, we're only running about 65% or 70% of where we had historically been running for those startup plans. The second negative impact that you have on plan counts are just the plan terminations. Again, we've talked about this on previous calls. But it's businesses that have gone out of business, and therefore they've terminated the plan. When we look at the ongoing flow of new cases relative to those that we've lost, we've had 6 consecutive positive quarters now of growth for case count. So again, I think this has far more to do with the external environment about the lack of startup plans and plan terminations due to going out of business than anything else. In terms of deferrals and matches and participation, participation is about where it has historically run, recognizing there's a little bit of downside. There's a bit of a positive upside on participation due to some of the plans having auto-enroll, auto-escalate. And those kind of come in at 25% to 30% range. If we look at average deferrals, it's up a little bit, which is a very positive component when you think about the number of new people that might be -- being added at the low end of the range. Hardship withdrawals are flat. And then if we look at loans, loans are up about 5% relative to a year ago, but those loans, again, as a percentage of the total assets, is still a relatively small number. So again, the fundamentals of the business, both from case count participation, deferrals look good. My closing comment would be around matching contributions. We've said in previous calls that about 80% of our plans are discretionary, about 20% are stated matches. And of those stated matches that someone has previously made a change in either decreasing or suspending their match, about 1/3 of those individuals or those corporations have now put their match back in place either at the same level or increased it. Hopefully that helped, Jimmy."

And remember, in the absence of having that as part of our TRS strategy, we probably wouldn't have gotten the underlying 401(k) assets along with those.

It's a little richer in the small size case versus the upper end. But again, when you look at where we're coming in on these margins, this 28 to 32 range where -- which is where we've been these last 48 months or so, is still a very positive place to be relative to our competitors and allows us to be very street competitive today.

A couple of years ago, we determined that we'd like to earn more than cash return on a portion of that excess capital, before that excess capital got deployed. So PGI manages a credit strategy and that's very simply, they purchase investment grade bonds, they hedge out the interest rate risk and then they more actively trade that credit. And you know the PGI fixed income has a skill set at that. Because the strategy is more actively traded, then the rest of our portfolio, all of that return, including the marks, run through net investment income. The strategy worked very well for us since inception through third quarter, so including this quarter. And that has returned about 9%. So clearly better than cash. So third quarter's performance was clearly an underperformance relative to our expectation. And the expectation, again, for any kind of active strategy is tough, but we would expect that to be in that $3 million to $4 million range per quarter rather than the negative $7 million we had this quarter. Does that help?"

But again, I think we're going to take a close look at that over time and make some decisions about how much of that budget do we really want to spend in 2011 versus 2012. I would just say, again, one of the differentiating points, I think, for us was fee-based businesses now being 60% of the operating earnings of the company. We're going to continue to be strong capital generators. So I think that's really the key for investors over time, and it's much less, whether it's some incremental piece of that capital done in 4Q11 versus first quarter, second quarter '12. It's probably really less of an issue for us over the long term. We're going to be careful, prudent. We're going to work closely with the board as we always have."

I mean, if I look at the bank, really since you've come public, I'm not sure by the time we get to this year that even cumulatively, on a net basis, it's earned anything. And is there really any strategic reason to keeping this? Secondly, with respect to the realized capital gains and losses this quarter, you certainly highlighted in the press release what came from credit impairments, and again, the CMBS problem this quarter. What was the remainder? Was that just derivatives? Or was that on the commercial mortgage book? And then lastly for Dan. Could you talk about pressures on fees on 401(k) plans as you're doing renewals and stuff? Are you having to get fees down? Or is that more of a creation of the media?"

And first of all, the bank has been a net contributor to profitability over time. And for example, in the current quarter, it was a contributor in the range of sort of $3 million or $4 million positive for the current quarter. So it has been a positive contributor. We obviously wouldn't -- we wouldn't have a banking business if it wasn't profitable. We don't believe in loss leaders. That's just not part of our makeup. So it's a given that the bank is going to have to perform at an acceptable level, acceptably profitable level, and it's done that. Now in terms of the strategic rationale for the bank, I would say the strategic rationale for the bank is really in 2 areas. One is job changers, and the second is retirees. The reality is, is that the most commonly understood financial products by the sort of middle-income population or banking products. And so the ability to use banking products as a receptacle, as a rollover IRA sort of receptacle for job changers has been very powerful. And as you know, we've had a lot of success with asset retention for job changers. We stay right in that sort of low 50% range. And frankly, having the bank is one critical component of that. I think the emerging opportunity for the bank at which, frankly, we have yet to capitalize on, is we need to do a better job, we need to position the bank strategically to be that income management receptacle for people as they enter into retirement. So people today, retirees in particular, quite mobile. And I think the opportunity around an Internet bank so they can get access to funds no matter where they are in the U.S. or internationally is something that's very powerful. But we have to do a little more work to build that out. But I think the strategic rationale of the bank is actually very solid. And obviously, we have to match that up against whatever other elements there may be to having a bank, and we're obviously very well aware of all those items. And we'll continue to monitor all of that and see where we come out. But from a strategic perspective, let me be very clear, the bank does have, in place today, a very, very meaningful role. So let me have Julia comment on the credit losses, and then Dan can comment on 401(k) fees."

And I don't know that, that's changed in the 27 years I've been around the topic. Fees have probably taken a higher priority in the last couple of years due to small-, medium-sized businesses having pressure on their cost of running their businesses. So what have we done to respond to that? Part of it is à la carte pricing, eliminating services that our customers don't value and unwilling to pay for. We're also managing our own expenses here. We're taking advantage of our scale. We've also tried to make sure that we're emphasizing the value of Total Retirement Suite, which is a different value proposition than just standalone 401(k). Customers put a lot of value on our Retire Secure, our ability to go out there and educate our -- those plan participants from small- to medium-sized businesses. And we also do a fair amount of consulting, as you know, around deferred comp and ESOP and Defined Benefit. And the other comment maybe I would make is on all plans greater than $5 million, which if you look at that based on assets, it's probably 2/3 of our assets, there's a customized expense solution for every one of those clients. Here's the cost that we had in providing our services, and here's the charges that we need in order to reimburse ourselves accordingly. So it is a big part of every conversation.

What we are seeing is a strong client appetite across many different types of client for income-based products. So our high-yield, preferreds, mortgages and emerging market debt are all seeing very good receptions from clients. And that speaks, by the way, into what Larry and Terry said about the strong growth in principal mutual fund sales, because the retail clients in the U.S. like those income-based products. Secondly, we've seen very strong demand for specialty equity products, including emerging markets. But of course, by principal, Global Investors working with Principal International, we have principal of a very strong footprint in emerging markets. And that's been a big positive in terms of the client reception of our investment products, and then certainly real estate, which is a very long-established specialty of Principal, but one that's come very much into focus in the last year or 2. So if you add these up, that's why we have seen such a strong performance in the last quarter and actually masked by a few large core client redemptions for several quarters now, and why we've expressed some optimism about the pipeline. And then these products that I've mentioned, these capabilities that are appealing to clients, the strong performance is also fed into the asset allocation performance that Terry described in the prepared remarks. So I think all of this is really playing well into the growth of our fee-based businesses across the Principal platform. Principal Mutual Funds, Dan mentioned the importance of investment performance and capabilities for Full Service Accumulation. We are quietly pretty confident about how that whole investment platform is developing for the benefit of our fee-based businesses."

Obviously, the Life would be probably on the longer end and maybe some of the group disability products on the shorter end of that. Now that said, it's considerably higher than what we're currently investing in this environment. However, once again, we're looking at 40, 50, 60 or even longer in terms of some of those longer-term duration products. So what we do is we take into consideration where we are currently and then grade into that longer term over the life of the products. So hopefully that's helpful."

As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll discuss financial results. Third quarter had more than the usual amount of noise associated with market events that may mask underlying growth, which remains strong. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful implementation and execution of our strategy and I'll close with some comments on the regulatory environment, as well as other items that demonstrate the growing strength of the Principal. Then Terry will cover the financial results in more detail and discuss the long-term impact of low interest rates and impacts to the 2012 results from the new deferred acquisition cost guidance. 
Overall, while third quarter financial results were impacted by external market factors which I'll discussed briefly, we are pleased with the continuing momentum of our businesses. That momentum has been building throughout 2011 and is reflected in strong year-to-date results in all of our businesses.
Despite the economic and market headwinds, we remain optimistic that the ongoing momentum and strong underlying fundamentals of our business will carry on into fourth quarter.
 
Let's look at the third quarter financial results in more detail. As Terry will discuss, we incurred approximately $22 million or $0.07 per share of market-related deferred acquisition cost impacts caused by the 14% decline in the S&P 500 for the quarter. In addition, we saw the variable investment income on excess capital held at the holding company be reduced by $12 million or $0.04 per share due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads during the quarter. Despite the impact of these on our quarterly financial results, the growth metrics of sales and net cash flow continue to be outstanding for the quarter, including Full Service Accumulation sales of $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 72% over third quarter 2010, driving net cash flows to $350 million compared to negative net cash flows of $200 million in third quarter 2010.
Principal Funds' third quarter sales of $2.6 billion drove $180 million of net cash flows this quarter. Principal Global Investors' unaffiliated net cash flows were $1.2 billion this quarter as a result of strong sales and $5.6 billion in deposits. And Principal International net cash flows of $700 million in third quarter 2011 were down slightly from third quarter 2010, caused by slower growth in Asia. 
Importantly, pipelines remain strong across our businesses, although continuing economic uncertainty may have an impact over time. Because quarterly financial results are often impacted by short-term economic and market events, it is more constructive to look at year-to-date results for both sales and financial results to see the health of the businesses. 
Full Service Accumulation sales are $5.2 billion year-to-date, and year-to-date net cash flow is $2.2 billion. For full-year 2011, we expect Full Service Accumulation sales to increase 20% to 25% over 2010 sales. Principal Funds' year-to-date sales are up 20%, and year-to-date net cash flows have increased 29% over 2010. For the full year, we expect Funds' sales to be up approximately 15% and net cash flows to be approximately 5% of beginning account value. 
Principal Global Investors' operating revenues are up 14% year-to-date, and operating earnings are up 44%. Investment performance remains solid, and our unaffiliated pipeline continues to be strong. 
Principal International continues to have another solid year, with $3.8 billion of net cash flows year-to-date, which are up 32% over 2010 and record assets under management of $55 billion, which are up 29% over 2010.
In U.S. Insurance Solutions, individualized sales are up 14% year-to-date. Premiums and deposits are up 11% year-to-date, driven by sales in the nonqualified and business owner market, which now account for 58% of Individual Life sales.
Specialty Benefits sales are up 29% year-to-date, driving premium and fees up 6% year-to-date. Importantly, we have now had 5 consecutive quarters of growth with new sales premium exceeding client lapses. This momentum across our businesses positions us for continuing growth in the U.S. and the international markets where we operate. 
We also benefit from the overall diversification in the sources of our revenues and operating earnings, with 60% of operating earnings coming from fee-based businesses. Next I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy. 
The key differentiator for Full Service Accumulation continues to be our Principal Total Retirement Suite, with 51% of sales on the Total Retirement Suite platform. Total Retirement Suite close ratios continue to be double those of single retirement product sales. Persistency is better for this block as well, with a 20% improvement in last rates compared to non-Total Retirement Suite plans. 
Our focus on the Allianz distribution channel continues to drive strong Full Service Accumulation sales, with year-to-date Allianz sales up 46% over the prior year. We continue to gain traction with third-party administrator sales as well. Our increased focus on this market gives us access to a broader base of advisors and helps us capture additional market share. 
Moving now to Principal Funds. Sales results are driven by good investment performance and demand for our innovative products, such as the Principal Global Diversified Income Fund. To further meet the growing need for retirement income solutions, this month we launched the Global Multi-Strategy Fund, which seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation with an emphasis on positive total returns and relatively low volatility. 
A couple of quick comments about the execution of our boutique strategy in Principal Global Investors. We successfully closed on the acquisition of a majority stake in Origin, a London-based global equity specialist, on October 3. Origin's strong performance track record, combined with our global distribution network, provides us additional capacity in international equities. 
The onboarding of Finisterre, an emerging market fixed income boutique also based in London, has been very successful as well. We've had tremendous support from Finisterre's key consultants and have retained all of their clients during this transition. Finisterre's impressive track record combined with our distribution network, sets the stage to attract a significant flow in the future, as investors see opportunities for diversification in emerging markets. 
We continue to see increasing demand for higher yield products as well as other areas where we have expertise, such as preferred securities, real estate and emerging markets which generate higher revenue and higher margins.
As we said at the Principal International workshop, the carefully selected emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, which we are operating in today, have tremendous growth in middle-class populations and privatization of retirement systems is rapidly taking hold.
Our strategy is to export our retirement and investment management expertise to these key emerging markets to work with marquis distribution partners in these countries and to go deeper in these markets through organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions. Our focused execution has resulted in rapid growth of the businesses. We were early entrants into these markets, and we continue to see growth in operating earnings of 15% to 20%. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in these markets as we move forward. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the continued execution of our strategy across the businesses. With a strategy that is focused on long-term growth, our outlook remains positive despite market volatility and continued choppy economic recovery.
Let me quickly comment on the impact of extended period of low interest rates. The evolution of our business model towards fee-based businesses creates a blend of less capital-intensive businesses that helps us weather the current low interest rate environment. Terry will go into more detail on the impact if low interest rates persist over time, but let me simply say that the current low interest rates would have to continue for an extended period, at least 3 years, before they would have a meaningful impact on our operating earnings.
Moving now to some comments on the strength and flexibility of our financial position, I'm very pleased with the capital deployment actions we've taken in 2011, which reflect execution of 3 acquisitions, 2 share repurchase programs, and as we announced yesterday, a 27% increase in our annual common stock dividend, which will be paid in early December. 
Our shift to a more fee-based business model means we need less cash to support organic growth and enables us to deploy more capital towards strategic acquisitions and return more capital to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have $1.8 billion of excess capital. This gives us continuing capital flexibility in what remains an uncertain environment. 
Let me move to some positive regulatory developments. Based on recent updates, it appears unlikely that we'll be named a systemically important financial institution or be considered a major swap participant. Therefore, I remain confident in our ability to continue with our current successful business model. 
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize a significant milestone for the company. Last Sunday was the 10th anniversary of our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a public company set the stage for a decade of growth, as the Principal continued its evolution from a once-largely insurance-based organization to its status today as an investment management leader. The Principal was named Investment Brand of the Year in the 2011 Harris Poll Equitrend study, which further demonstrates the transformation of our business model over the last 10 years.
As the first U.S. company to go public after 9/11, we recognize the significance of moving forward, while never forgetting the tragic events of that day. In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of our IPO in 9/11, we'll be making charitable gifts to several programs in support of families of New York City police and firefighters and deployed service personnel. As further recognition of our commitment to those that serve in the military, the Principal was one of only 15 companies out of more than 4,000 nominations to receive a 2011 Freedom Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve group, a Department of Defense agency. It's the highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support of their employees serving in the guard and reserve.

The trend of strong business fundamentals continued in the third quarter. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings and net income for the quarter, more detail around our modest exposure to a sustaining low interest rate environment, an update on our capital position and deployment strategy and an overview over the projected impact of new deferred acquisition cost guidance starting in 2012. 
Starting with total company results, operating earnings of $192 million were down 12% from a year-ago quarter on 11% higher average assets under management. There were a few items impacting third quarter 2011 operating earnings. Two of the major items were: third quarter 2011 had negative DAC amortization true-ups due to the equity market performance which impacted Full Service Accumulation, Individual Annuities and Individual Life by $0.07 in total; and in third quarter 2011, the Corporate segment was impacted by $0.04 from lower variable interest income on excess capital held at the holding company due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads. Adjusting for these items, we consider the earnings-per-share run rate for the third quarter to be $0.72, and third quarter 2011 earnings up 12% on an 11% increase in average assets under management compared to an adjusted third quarter 2010. 
Now let me discuss business unit results. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $71 million were down 12% from a year-ago quarter on a 12% increase in average account values as a result of higher DAC amortization from negative equity market returns. With the recent market volatility, looking over an extended period of time provides a more normalized view. On a year-to-date basis, adjusting for the equity market impact, 2011 operating earnings are in line with the increase in average account values as compared to 2010. We continue to see our Full Service Accumulation sales pipeline build across market sizes and distribution channels and close ratios that returned to pre-crisis levels. This will help drive full-year net cash flow results that we now expect to be approximately 3% of beginning account values.
Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating leverage. Operating earnings at $13 million in the third quarter were up 47% over a year-ago quarter on a 16% increase in average account values. Though the retail industry experienced outflows this quarter as investors pulled back a bit, our innovative product solutions and multichannel distribution model continue to generate strong sales growth and positive flows. 
Competitive investment performance also contributed strong fund sales. This includes particular strength in asset allocation where at quarter end, 84% of target date and target risk funds were in the top half on a 1-year basis, 78% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. 
Individual Annuities' operating earnings at $15 million were lower because of higher DAC amortization due to negative equity market returns in the current quarter, while a year-ago quarter saw a positive equity market returns and had positive true-ups. Adjusting for this, earnings are comparable between the 2 periods. 
Earnings from Principal Global Investors at $19 million improved 27% from a year-ago quarter on a 6% increase in average assets under management, reflecting the operating leverage in this business. 
Client search activity continues despite current market volatility and because of this, we remain optimistic about flows over the next few quarters. 
Moving to Principal International, operating earnings at $37 million were up 11% from the third quarter 2010. Principal International finished the quarter with record assets under management of $55 billion, $62 billion when including China despite recently strengthening dollar. This growth was driven by organic net cash flows of $700 million and $3.1 billion of operations acquired with the HSBC Mexican AFORE business. We closed this transaction in early August and fully integrated the companies in September. This transaction increases our scale in the mandatory retirement business in Mexico. 
Since this acquisition leverages our existing infrastructure, it was immediately accretive in the third quarter. The benefit of the third quarter was partially offset by acquisition costs. We expect the benefit of $5 million to $6 million per quarter to be fully realized in the fourth quarter.
Individual Life operating earnings were $26 million. Current quarter results were adversely impacted by higher DAC amortization due to negative equity market returns and slightly unfavorable mortality experience. After adjusting for these items, operating earnings remain in line with previously communicated expectations. 
Turning to Specialty Benefit, operating earnings declined 12% from the year-ago quarter to $22 million, reflecting quarterly volatility in claims experience. 
While third quarter 2010 loss ratios were at the low end of our 65% to 71% targeted range, third quarter 2011 loss ratios were on the higher end of that range. However, the year-to-date loss ratio comparison between the 2 periods is equal, and year-to-date operating earnings are up 14% on 6% higher premiums. 
Corporate reported operating loss of $40 million, driven by approximately $12 million earnings shortfall from lower variable investment income on excess capital held at the holding company due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads. We view the quarterly run rate earnings for Corporate to be a $30 million operating loss, with some volatility around this result. 
Total company net income of $64 million this quarter was impacted by a court ruling regarding some uncertain tax positions and the estimated obligation associated with the New York State Insurance Department's liquidation plan for the Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York.
We also experienced $38 million of credit-related investment losses during the quarter. While the credit environment remains choppy, the losses remain manageable and we continue to see improvement in our portfolio, reflecting the benefit of broad asset diversification. 
As Larry mentioned, with the evolution of our business model, we now have much higher portion of earnings coming from less capital-intensive businesses. Of our $57 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate account assets, $19 billion or 34% includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate, and only $7 billion or 12% is currently at those minimums. For the remaining portion not at the minimums, we have an average of 70 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. Given our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to low interest environment. 
If the quarter-end low interest rate environment persists, we would a 1% to 2% impact on our expected 2012 earnings, growing to 3% to 8% impact if conditions persist beyond that. If the low interest rate period were to persist for an extended period of time, it may result in a reduction in our long-term interest rate assumption used to model deferred acquisition costs and related actuarial balances. If we were to lower our long-term interest rate assumption by 25 basis points for every segment across the company, it may result in an additional onetime $25 million to $35 million after-tax reduction to operating earnings. As part of our periodic review of assumptions, we monitor the interest rate environment and do not expect an immediate need to lower our long-term interest rate assumption. 
Moving to our balance sheet. Our net unrealized gain position of $1.6 billion was unchanged from second quarter 2011. Our $1.2 billion gain from impact of decreasing interest rates was offset by widening credit spreads. As a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in an economic impact, and it does not force us to sell assets. 
Now moving to capital adequacy. As of quarter-end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be 455%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.8 billion of total excess capital as of the end of the third quarter, with $700 million of the excess capital at the holding company. Including the Origin acquisition that closed on October 3, we have deployed $350 million for strategic acquisition and $450 million for share repurchase.
Additionally, we have announced a $0.70 per share common stock dividend, a 27% increase over last year's $0.55 per share common stock dividend. This brings our total capital deployed year-to-date to $1 billion and reflects the improvement in the free cash flow generation of our business model that is more fee-based, and the long-term commitment that we made to turn excess capital to shareholders. As always, we'll continue to evaluate additional capital deployment opportunities. 
 
I'd now like to take a moment to provide an overview of the expected impact of the new deferred acquisition cost guidance on our businesses and starting in 2012. In October 2010, the FASB issued an update that narrows the definition of acquisition costs that can be capitalized and deferred by insurance companies. Starting in January 2012, only incremental direct costs of contract acquisitions can be deferred. All other costs are to be expensed as incurred. We expect to apply this guidance retrospectively. This will result in less capitalization of acquisition costs, resulting in increased current period expenses. It will also result in a reduction of our deferred acquisition cost asset, as well as eliminate any future amortization associated with deferred acquisition cost assets written off as of the beginning of the year. For growing companies like the Principal, the reduction in first year costs that can be capitalized could be greater than the reduction in the annual amortization of the lower deferred acquisition cost asset.
Consequently, near-term operating earnings will be lower than under the current methodology. However, this is a change in timing of earnings recognition and the economic earnings of the underlying businesses remain unchanged. We are still evaluating the full impacts of implementing this guidance, but we currently estimate that our adoption will result in a reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings between $550 million to $750 million at January 1, 2012.
We also currently estimate that adopting this new guidance will result in a net $35 million to $45 million full-year reduction to 2012 operating earnings. These estimates are based upon our current operating assumptions and current interpretation of the guidance and are subject to change. The majority of this impact will be in Full Service Accumulation an Individual Life, with much smaller impacts on Individual Annuities, Principal International and Specialty Benefits division. 
On a positive note, going forward we will have less earnings volatility in Full Service Accumulation since there will be a lower deferred acquisition cost asset subject to true-ups from equity market, returns and experience adjustments.
Before I close, I'd like to also announce that on December 1 we will provide our 2012 EPS guidance and an update on our capital deployment strategy. We'll provide more details as the event gets closer.
In closing, we are very pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals of the businesses as we look into 2012 and beyond. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

When we just look at just startup plans, if you go back to the era of '05, '06 and '07, there were 1,500 to 1,800 startup plans.

When we just look at just startup plans, if you go back to the era of '05, '06 and '07, there were 1,500 to 1,800 startup plans. If we look at where we're at year-to-date, startup plans was about 820. If you annualize it, you kind of get to that 1,100 or so plans for our full-year 2011. So in terms of just contributing to positive case count growth, we're only running about 65% or 70% of where we had historically been running for those startup plans. The second negative impact that you have on plan counts are just the plan terminations. Again, we've talked about this on previous calls. But it's businesses that have gone out of business, and therefore they've terminated the plan. When we look at the ongoing flow of new cases relative to those that we've lost, we've had 6 consecutive positive quarters now of growth for case count. So again, I think this has far more to do with the external environment about the lack of startup plans and plan terminations due to going out of business than anything else. In terms of deferrals and matches and participation, participation is about where it has historically run, recognizing there's a little bit of downside. There's a bit of a positive upside on participation due to some of the plans having auto-enroll, auto-escalate and those kind of come in at 25% to 30% range. If we look at average deferrals it's up a little bit, which is a very positive component when you think about the number of new people that might be -- being added at the low end of the range. Hardship withdrawals are flat. And then if we look at loans, loans are up about 5% relative to a year ago but those loans, again as a percentage of the total assets, is still a relatively small number. So again the fundamentals of the business, both from case count participation, deferrals look good. My closing comment would be around matching contributions. We've said in previous calls that about 80% of our plans are discretionary, about 20% are stated matches. And of those stated matches that someone had previously made a change in either decreasing or suspending their match, about 1/3 of those individuals or those corporations have now put their match back in place either at the same level or increased it. Hopefully that helps, Jimmy."

And remember in the absence of having that as part of our TRS strategy, we probably wouldn't have gotten the underlying 401(k) assets along with those.

It's a little richer in the small size case versus the upper end. But again, when you look at where we're coming in on these margins, this 28 to 32 range where -- which is where we've been these last 48 months or so, is still a very positive place to be relative to our competitors and allows us to be very street competitive today.

But our approach tends to be a little bit different than some other companies in the sense that once we say we're going to do something, then we do it. We're not as -- frankly, we're not as comfortable with sort of the larger multi-year kind of multi-billion dollar. Even though I think our business model gives us that capability, I think we're just a little less. Maybe it's our kind of midwestern conservatism, John. I don't know. But I think we're a little less -- we're a lot less willing to make those kind of big, big type programs. So what you're going to see from us are going to be more incremental.

First Larry, I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the bank and your current thinking on that and certainly with the transition of fee-based businesses. I mean if I look at the bank, really since you've come public, I'm not sure by the time we get to this year that even cumulatively, on a net basis, it's earned anything. And is there really any strategic reason to keeping this? Secondly, with respect to the realized capital gains and losses this quarter, you certainly highlighted in the press release what came from credit impairments, and again the CMBS problem this quarter. What was the remainder? Was that just derivatives? Or was that on the commercial mortgage book? And then lastly for Dan, could you talk about pressures on fees on 401(k) plans as you're doing renewals and stuff? Are you having to get fees down? Or is that more of a creation of the media?"

Let me speak to the kind of the bank issue. And first of all, the bank has been a net contributor to profitability over time.

And first of all, the bank has been a net contributor to profitability over time. And for example, in the current quarter, it was a contributor in the range of sort of $3 million or $4 million positive for the current quarter. So it has been a positive contributor. We obviously wouldn't -- we wouldn't have a banking business if it wasn't profitable. We don't believe in loss leaders. That's just not part of our makeup. So it's a given that the bank is going to have to perform at an acceptable level, acceptably profitable level and it's done that. Now in terms of the strategic rationale for the bank, I would say the strategic rationale for the bank is really in 2 areas. One is job changers, and the second is retirees. The reality is, is that the most commonly understood financial products by the sort of middle-income population or banking products. And so the ability to use banking products as a receptacle, as a rollover IRA sort of receptacle for job changers has been very powerful. And as you know, we've had a lot of success with asset retention for job changers. We stay right in that sort of low 50% range. And frankly, having the bank is one critical component of that. I think the emerging opportunity for the bank at which, frankly, we have yet to capitalize on, is we need to do a better job, we need to position the bank strategically to be that income management receptacle for people as they enter into retirement. So people today, retirees in particular are quite mobile. And I think the opportunity around an Internet bank so they can get access to funds no matter where they are in the U.S. or internationally is something that's very powerful. But we have to do a little more work to build that out. But I think the strategic rationale of the bank is actually very solid. And obviously we have to match that up against whatever other elements there may be to having a bank, and we're obviously very well aware of all those items. And we'll continue to monitor all of that and see where we come out. But from a strategic perspective, let me be very clear, the bank does have and plays today a very, very meaningful role. So let me have Julia comment on the credit losses, and then Dan can comment on 401(k) fees."

One is going to be fees, the second is going to be the services for those fees and the last one's going to be your investment performance. And I don't know that that's changed in the 27 years I've been around the topic. Fees have probably taken a higher priority in the last couple of years due to small-, medium-sized businesses having pressure on their cost of running their businesses. So what have we done to respond to that? Part of it is à la carte pricing, eliminating services that our customers don't value and unwilling to pay for. We're also managing our own expenses here. We're taking advantage of our scale. We've also tried to make sure that we're emphasizing the value of Total Retirement Suite, which is a different value proposition than just standalone 401(k). Customers put a lot of value on our Retire Secure, our ability to go out there and educate our -- those plan participants from small- to medium-sized businesses. And we also do a fair amount of consulting, as you know, around deferred comp and ESOP and Defined Benefit. And the other comment maybe I would make is on all plans greater than $5 million, which if you look at that based on assets, it's probably 2/3 of our assets, there's a customized expense solution for every one of those clients. Here's the cost that we had in providing our services, and here's the charges that we need in order to reimburse ourselves accordingly. So it is a big part of every conversation. It's not going to go way. We, as you know, have already -- in the midstream of rolling out fee disclosure to the plan sponsors.

What we are seeing is a strong client appetite across many different types of client for income-based products. So our high-yield, preferreds, mortgages and emerging market debt are all seeing very good receptions from clients. And that speaks, by the way, into what Larry and Terry said about the strong growth in principal mutual fund sales, because the retail clients in the U.S. like those income-based products. Secondly, we've seen very strong demand for specialty equity products, including emerging markets. But of course by principal, Global Investors working with Principal International, we have principal of a very strong footprint in emerging markets. And that's been a big positive in terms of the client reception of our investment products. And then thirdly real estate, which is a very long-established specialty of Principal, but one that's come very much into focus in the last year or 2. So if you add these up, that's why we have seen such a strong performance in the last quarter and actually masked by a few large core client redemptions for several quarters now, and why we've expressed some optimism about the pipeline. And then these products that I've mentioned, these capabilities that are appealing to clients, the strong performance is also fed into the asset allocation performance that Terry described in the prepared remarks. So I think all of this is really playing well into the growth of our fee-based businesses across the Principal platform. Principal Mutual Funds, Dan mentioned the importance of investment performance and capabilities for Full Service Accumulation. We are quietly pretty confident about how that whole investment platform is developing for the benefit of our fee-based businesses."

As you can see sales are very good, and we're finally starting to see some good traction with that DCIO or the Defined Contribution Investment Only, where we don't provide recordkeeping administration.
