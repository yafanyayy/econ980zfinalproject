In the year, our procedure mix shifted in favor of gynecology, as it eclipsed neurology as the largest specialty we serve. We are making good progress in responding to the challenges inherent to our expanding business. 
In 2010, our focus was in four areas. First, driving the adoption of da Vinci surgery within the gynecology market. Second, enabling growth of new procedures within new specialties. Third, the expansion of our business internationally and fourth, rightsizing our various core teams within the company support the growth, most notably our sales organization. 
Looking back at the full year 2010, our operating highlights were as follows: Worldwide procedures grew by 35%, with international procedures growing by 42%. We sold 441 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 338. Total revenue grew to $1. 413 billion, up 34%. Recurring revenue grew to $753 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $673 million in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 42% from last year and GAAP net income grew to $382 million, up 64% year-over-year. 
Now turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew 35%. We sold 124 da Vinci Surgical Systems. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,752 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $389 million. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $151 million, up 33%.
Total recurring revenue, including service grew to $212 million, comprising 54% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $184 million in the quarter, before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 24% from the fourth quarter of last year, and GAAP net income grew to $121 million, up 56%. We ended the year with $1.609 billion in cash and investments, down $12 million from last quarter and up $437 million from last year. We received $141 million in cash during the year, from the exercise of stock options and invested $79 million in intellectual property, working capital, property plan and equipment and $199 million in stock repurchases for the year. Going forward, we will continue to look for stock repurchase opportunities. 
Gross cash from operations for the year were $573 million or $14.22 per fully diluted share and 150% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant non-cash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we believe that gross cash generated from operations remains the best measure of our financial performance.
In our adopting procedures in the U.S., the hysterectomy continued its strong growth, both in malignant and benign conditions growing 59% year-over-year. Cyclical myomectomy also continued to track their adoption curves. Urology also grew for the full year of 2010, through the continued adoption of and growth in the BP, the latter being focused in Europe. As benign conditions became a larger part of our procedure based in the U.S., we experienced increased exposure to seasonality and other patient treatment deferrals that are less common with cancer operations. We expect this exposure to be an ongoing part of our business. 
2010 was a strong year for emerging procedures. In fact, procedures falling outside the above-mentioned adopting procedures grew by 47% over 2009. Among procedures in new specialties of that purchase adoptions are da Vinci, da Vinci thoracic procedure and da Vinci Transoral Surgery procedure. Patient value in the specialties appears to be high and certain interest in early growth has been encouraging. I leave it to Aleks to provide more detail on our progress later in the call. 
We are pleased with our procedure adoptions in Europe in 2010, helped by growing debt and our European sales team. European procedures grew 48% year-over-year led by urology. We also saw the emergence of the da Vinci surgery for cancer and gynecologic surgery in Europe. 
2010 has been an investment year for products, with several of them in the mid-to-late stages of development. We believe these products will optimize existing producers and enable new ones. In Q4, we launched our da Vinci that's the stimulator which in combination with our dual console before searches more opportunity to train in da Vinci and track their progress.
Our single side product is in the late stages of regulatory review, in both the U.S. and Europe. We called it as product that is intended to facilitate da Vinci's single incision surgeries on existing Si systems. Our robotics stapling and invested products are in development and our progress with these products is encouraging. 
In imaging, our fluorescence imaging product is also in the late stages of the regulatory review progress in the U.S. and Europe. In 2010, we also connected the majority of our installed da Vinci systems to our da Vinci network that enable remote system, performance monitoring, as well as remote proctoring. We continue to invest in technologies that improve and enhance surgical imaging. Likewise, we also continuously invest in robotic technologies that simplify and enhance access to the body. 
Finally, as we've discussed on prior calls, we believe that the outset of 2010 that investments were required in our clinical sales force to support the continued expansion of gynecologic and emerging procedures in the U.S. We added 150 members to our clinical team through the year and have largely caught back up to the procedure to sales rep run rate that we believe supports our customers' needs during this period. Across the company, we added nearly 400 employees in 2010, ending the year with 1,660 people on our team. 
In closing, our priorities for 2011 are as follows: First, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology through outstanding execution in the field. Second, disciplined execution of our product development process through product launch. Third, driving deeper within the emerging procedures of colorectal surgery, thoracic surgery and TransOral surgery through procedure and product development with customers and fourth, strengthening our team both in the U.S. and in international markets to support the continued growth of the business. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Moore, our Chief Financial Officer to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."

Our fourth quarter revenue was $389 million, up 21% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter revenue details were as follows: Fourth qu",1355,"Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter revenue was $389 million, up 21% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010. 
Fourth quarter revenue details were as follows: Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $151 million, up 33% compared with $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 19% compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily driven by procedure growth of 35% year-over-year. The increase relative to the third quarter is primarily driven by procedure growth, as well as an increase in the amount of stocking orders and customer purchases of our new 8.5 millimeters scopes. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the fourth quarter of 2009 by approximately $20 and higher than the third quarter of 2010 by approximately $100. The changes in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflects changes and the impact of stocking orders. We expect the instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base.
Fourth quarter 2010 systems revenue of $178 million increased 10% compared with $162 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 and increased 11% compared with $160 million of systems revenue for the third quarter. Recently, we began delivering new Si systems for customers, as Mac systems versus completing as a to Si upgrade. In addition, the contract terms and economics for this Si or as trade-ins are now reflective of Si sales.
Accordingly, we have begun including as to Si upgrades in our systems comps. Inclusive of 9 as to Si, we sold 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. This compares to 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010. I would note that the prior period system count exclude 10 as to Si upgrade for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. 
Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and as to Si trade ins, but excluding upgrades was $1.41 million equal to the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of mix of products, including a reduction in the proportion of Si dual console sold in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase due to a greater number of systems sold to direct customers in Europe. 
Service revenue increased to $61 million, up 27% compared with $48 million last year and up 6% compared with $57 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and an increase in the mix of Si, which carry a higher annual service fee. 
Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $212 million, up 31% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 15% compared with the third quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represent 54% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 50% in the fourth quarter last year and 54% last quarter. 
Non-US revenue represented 25% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 17% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2010. Non-US procedures grew 42% on a year-to-year basis in a seasonally stronger quarter. DVP in Europe was the greatest driver in non-U.S. procedure growth, although we experienced growth in all procedure category. 
Instrument and accessory revenue grew at a rate similar to the procedure growth. We sold 38 systems outside the U.S. including two as to Si trade ins compared to the 30 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. I would note that there was one as to Si upgrade outside the U.S. in both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. 
Despite uncertainty surrounding European economies, we sold 28 systems in Europe this quarter compared to 16 in the third quarter and 21 last year. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. 
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 73% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 gross margin of 72% and compared with the third quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase over the prior year reflects lower manufacturing costs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. 
Fourth quarter 2010 operating expenses of $128 million were up 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter, and increased R&D prototype spending. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 54 employees in the sales and service organization, as we continue to expand our clinical sales force and 28 employees in operations.
Fourth quarter 2010 operating income was $154 million or 40% of sales, compared with $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the fourth quarter 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of this year. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 23% brought our annual tax rate to 33% compared to our 2009 rate of 41%. The reduction in rates between years reflects the implementation of our international tax structure and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. Our fourth quarter rate benefited from a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and from a reduction in nondeductible stock option expenses.
Our net income was $121 million or $3.02 per share compared with $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for 2010. Procedures grew by 35% to approximately 278,000. Total revenue for 2010 was $1.413 billion, up 34% compared with $1.052 billion last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 34% and an increase in systems revenue of 35%.
Operating income for 2010 was $555 million, up 47% compared with $377 million last year. Operating income included $118 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2010 compared with $97 million in 2009. Net income for 2010 was $382 million or $9.47 per share compared with $233 million or $5.93 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2010 with cash and investments of $1.609 billion, down $12 million compared with September 30, 2010. The decrease during the quarter reflects $125 million of cash flows from operations, plus $8 million from the exercise of stock options, more than offset by $140 million of stock buybacks and $9 million of capital and IT purchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we bought back 530,000 shares at an average price of $2.64 per share, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 742,000 shares at an average price of $2.68 per share. As of December 31, there was $101 million of the board authorized buybacks remain. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $247 million at December 31 from $208 million at September 30, reflecting increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $87 million at December 31 from $85 million at September 30. The increase reflects inventory necessary to support increased revenues. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the fourth quarter, we sold 124 da Vinci systems, 86 in the United States, 28 in Europe and 10 and the rest of world markets. As part of the 124 system sales, 24 standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems and 9 S systems were traded in for Si systems. We had a net 91 system additions to the install base during the quarter, which brings to 1,752 accumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1,285 in the U.S., 316 in Europe and 151 in Rest of World markets. 50 of the 124 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. The 38 system sales internationally was our strongest quarter-to-date and included 6 da Vinci systems into Italy, 5 into Germany and 3 to the countries of France and Korea. 
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, with GYN and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH for malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger, both in actual procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additionally, overall benign GYN procedures, which includes myomectomy and endometrial sections also exhibited strong sequential growth. Within this segment of urology, DBP, partial suspect to me were all up materially on a sequential basis. 
And finally, head neck, Colorado and thoracic receptions all distributeplayed a strong sequential growth. Our strong fourth quarter procedure growth was not limited to a specific geography. It was global in structure. On a year-over-year comparison, overall fourth quarter procedures grew by approximately 35%, which is consistent with our overall 2010 procedure growth, as well as our 2010 procedure guidance. 
On a global basis, we finished 2010 having completed approximately 278,000 total procedures, led by dVH representing approximately 110,000 and dVP representing approximately 98,000. Benign GYN procedures have become a significant catalyst for growth within our overall business. dVH, da Vinci Myomectomy and endometrial resections represent large business opportunities, both U.S. and internationally, and the period of data supporting da Vinci's role within these procedures is beginning to expand. 
A rapidly emerging benign GYN procedure, one we have not talked a great deal about is da Vinci Myomectomy. Myomectomy is a procedure to remove a uterine fibroid while preserving a patient's uterus. Currently, the gold standard operation for myomectomy includes a lower abdominal incision. Over the past few years, traditional that was go but have been performed regularly. However, due to the extensive suturing required for adequate closure, it is considered technically difficult and therefore limited in its clinical adoption. 
At the American Society reproductive medicine conference, a paper entitled robotic assistance and open myomectomy, a comparison of surgical outcomes was presented. The study was authored by a group of physicians representing the Cleveland clinic foundation and Case Western Reserve University. The study examined blood loss, length of stay and operating time for 575 patients within these 3 distinctive. The 3 groups were case matched with comparable myomas regarding size, number and location and adjusted for age and biomass index. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to open myomectomy, average surgical time did increase, but average blood loss was reduced significantly by 50% and the average hospitalization was reduced from 3 days to 1 day. When comparing da Vinci myomectomy to traditional laparoscopy, surgical time was reduced by an average of 22 minutes and blood loss was reduced by an average of 33%. 
In their conclusion, the authors wrote and I quote, robotic-assisted myomectomy is associated with decreased estimated blood loss and length of hospital compared to traditional laparoscopy and open myomectomy. Despite the robotic use is associated with longer OR time compared to open procedures, it is shorter than laparoscopic approach. It appears that robotic technology is able to convert more laboratory cases. 
Total GYN procedures represent nearly half about our overall procedure volume, with the overall the majority being comprised of procedures to treat benign conditions. We are pleased by the fact that our customers and patients are experiencing an enhanced clinical value within these large mainstream procedure categories. However, we do recognize that it makes procedure volumes more susceptible to general seasonality and macro economic pressures. This is due in large part to a patient's ability to postpone some treatments to a future date when it becomes more economically convenient for them. On the other end of the spectrum, we are experiencing a strong growth trajectories within the category that I will turn very complex procedures, procedures where volumes are seasonally affected, namely head and neck surgery, colon and rectal surgery, renal cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer and lung cancer procedures. While some of these procedures categories are potentially large, with steep growth trajectories, they also fairly young with respect to their adoption and therefore individually, their contribution is currently less impactful to our overall procedure number. 
The fastest-growing segment in 2010 was head and neck surgery. The category more than tripled in size during the year, and showed exceptional sequential growth in Q4. We are seeing more and more period literature describing da Vinci's role within this category. In the recent edition of the journal oncology, 3 surgeons from the Department of had neck surgery at the University of Texas and Cancer Center authored a comprehensive perspective paper entitled shifting paradigm or patients with head and neck cancer. While robotic surgery or. The paper reviewed the functional outcomes from various studies published by leading head and neck cancer centers such as the male clinic Rochester, University of Pennsylvania, the University of Alabama Birmingham and M.D. Anderson. The authors highlighted the initial study, which reported that 25 out of their first 27 patients undergoing a da Vinci procedure for carcinoma attained negative margins and the 2 patients with positive margins were later cleared. Local control was achieved in all 27 at a six months follow up. Next, the University of Alabama Birmingham evaluated 54 patients undergoing for us and found that only 5 required temporary with the cannulation or removal occurring at a mean of 8 days. Similar functional data was reported in a series by more agile at the male clinic. This group reported an average time of the cancellation of 7 days. This is a significant improvement for over conventional surgery where it is usually reported in weeks or months rather than days. These early evaluations of oncologic and functional outcomes of course illustrate a minimally invasive technique that permits resection of a tumor, while preserving patients willing. The M.D. Anderson group concluded their paper by stating and I quote the robotic surgery and head and neck oncology is an exciting innovation that provides significant advantages. Patients have and on the removal of their tumors via a minimally invasive surgery without a cervical incision while preserving function and potentially avoiding adjuvant radiation and its long-termWhile long-term oncologic functional data are needed to fully validate its use, early results are promising. That concludes my remarks and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. We continue to see strong growth in da Vinci hysterectomies in the U.S., dVPs in Europe and general growth across about during range of procedures at earlier stages of market adoption. We expect our 2011 total procedures to grow between 25% and 28% from a base of approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. Based on an increasing percentage of benign hysterectomies and other short-term elective procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
Moving to revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 16% and 20%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, as system placements may vary. We expect typical capital sale seasonality in 2011, with Q1 being a relatively lighter quarter and Q4 being the seasonally strongest. 
With regards to gross margin. We reported fourth quarter 2010 gross profit of 72.5% of sales. Looking forward into 2011, we anticipate maintaining our margins near the current level at a rate of between 72% and 73% of sales for the year. Gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geographical mix. 
Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to grow by approximately 16% to 20% and 2011, which is in line with our expected topline growth. Our 2011 operating expense growth will be driven by clinical sales resource additions in the field to support newly installed systems and drive procedure growth, investments in new and existing R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business and non-cash stock compensation expense growth of approximately 22%. 
We expect our non-cash stock option compensation charges to increase from $118 million recorded in 2010 to approximately $140 million to $145 million in 2011. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense is expected to increase from $16 million in 2010 to $17 million to $20 million in 2011. 
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income has been decreasing due to lower interest rates earned on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $17 million and $18 million in 2011, which is down slightly from approximately $19 million earned in 2010. With regard to income tax. In 2010, we reported income taxes at a rate of 33.3% of pretax income as some of the items that benefited 2010 will not carry forward, we anticipate recording 2011 income taxes at about 34% pretax income. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2011 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. Cash. Our cash balance as remained in the $1.6 billion range throughout the second half of 2010 as we have largely returned operating cash flows to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases including $140 million user purchase shares in Q4. Our repurchase program remains active and entering Q1 2011, we have approximately $101 million remaining, authorized by the board to buyback additional shares. We will communicate any future repurchase authorizations as they become effective. That concludes my comments. Now I will open the floor for your questions. And we'll first go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair."

I think we've got a very predictable trend over if you would just apply ago out of the last several quarters. It will be up, down, but I don't think there's anything material in the way we are behaving that would suggest that it's going to increase or decrease at a rapid rate quickly.

We given the value, facts a product that they payed for and used and now what a more advanced product and will continue to be focused on the customer's needs. In terms of a go forward projection.

Thank you. As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our teams remain sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I would like to share with you two brief examples of what this means in the life of our patients. 
The first patient is Sandra, who had her da Vinci procedure in Miami. Sandra reports quote on November 29, 2010, I received a diagnosis of the carcinoma of the lung. I've always been and as you may healthy person and a non-smoker, so you can imagine how shocking this diagnosis was for me. Being a nurse practitioner and a former OR nurse, I thought I knew what I was in for.
I have a friend who went through a traditional for the same diagnosis ten years previously. She spent two weeks in the hospital, 5 days in the ICU and was subjected to a broken rib and scapula in order to provide access to the lung. It was 3 months before she was able to return to work and she still has pain to this day. 
Fortunately, I was wrong. I have a friend who works to Intuitive Surgical. He was adamant that I meet with Mark Lucky, is out in Miami hospital. I did my research and learned that Doctor the Lucy is very experienced with the da Vinci robot, having done over 300 robotic-assisted surgeries. I met Dr. Debethizy on November 30, and knew immediately that he was my surgeon. His confidence was just the reassurance that I needed. On December 9, I was admitted to South Miami Hospital for robotic-assisted right lower lobotomy. My surgery took an hour and a half. I had minimal postoperative pain and was up and walking the next day. I was discharged to home on day 2 and stopped pain medication on day 6.
I returned to work 2 weeks after surgery and was back to the gym for a light workout 3 weeks after surgery. I have to say I feel blessed. My tumor was found early. My nodes are negative and I have an excellent prognosis. I am blessed to have caring friends. I'm blessed to have this brilliant surgeon and I am blessed that this amazing technology is available. I would encourage anyone who receives a diagnosis of lung cancer to find a surgeon and a hospital that offers the da Vinci robotic surgery. It saved me from agonizing postoperative pain and a long debilitating recovery. I traveled 125 miles south of Miami and I am so glad that I did it.
Our second patient is Linda who had completed in Reno, Nevada. She says quote, I had a hysterectomy 30 years ago, so when I was told I needed a cyclical prexy, all I could think about was the pain and long recovery. Needless to say, I was dreading this procedure. Doctor Asher assured me that the da Vinci procedure would be less invasive, less painful and I would feel better in less time. Thanks to this very talented surgeon and the da Vinci robot, the procedure and the recovery have exceeded all of my expectations. There was really no pain, only discomfort around 1 of the 5 incissions. I felt the need to use pain medication for the first 3 days. And after that, I leave work great at night to help me sleep. I was up and about early after the surgery and was totally amazed by the fact that I could stand up straight and walk without any pain or feeling like my stitches were pulling apart. I had to remind myself before doing things that I just had major surgery. Wow, what a difference between the surgery I had 30 years ago, when I was unable to stand up straight and barely able to shuffle around for the first couple of weeks than the one I just experienced with the da Vinci robot. Anyone who has the option to have this da Vinci procedure should take advantage of it. Compared to the other options, it is truly amazing.
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months time."

In the year, our procedure mix shifted in favor of gynecology, as it eclipsed urology as the largest specialty we serve. We are making good progress in responding to the challenges inherent in our expanding business. 
In 2010, our focus was in four areas: first, driving the adoption of da Vinci surgery within the gynecology market; second, enabling growth of new procedures within new specialties; third, the expansion of our business internationally; and fourth, rightsizing our various core teams within the company to support our growth, most notably our sales organization. 
Looking back at the full year 2010, our operating highlights were as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by 35%, with international procedures growing by 42%. We sold 441 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 338. Total revenue grew to $1.413 billion, up 34%. Recurring revenue grew to $753 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $673 million in operating profit before noncash stock compensation expense, up 42% from last year. And GAAP net income grew to $382 million, up 64% year-over-year. 
Now turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew 35%. We sold 124 da Vinci Surgical Systems. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,752 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $389 million. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $151 million, up 33%.
Total recurring revenue including service grew to $212 million, comprising 54% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $184 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, up 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. And GAAP net income grew to $121 million, up 56%. 
We ended the year with $1.609 billion in cash and investments, down $12 million from last quarter and up $437 million from last year. We received $141 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $79 million in intellectual property, working capital, property plan and equipment and $199 million in stock repurchases for the year. Going forward, we will continue to look for stock repurchase opportunities. 
Gross cash from operations for the year were $573 million, or $14.22 per fully diluted share and 150% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant noncash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we believe that gross cash generated from operations remains the best measure of our financial performance.
In our adopting procedures in the U.S., da Vinci Hysterectomy continued its strong growth, both in malignant and benign conditions, growing 59% year-over-year. Sacrocolpopexy and Myomectomy also continued to track their adoption curves. Urology also grew for the full year of 2010 through the continued adoption of Partial Nephrectomy and growth in dVP, the latter being focused in Europe. 
As benign conditions became a larger part of our procedure base in the U.S., we experienced increased exposure to seasonality and other patient treatment deferrals that are less common with cancer operations. We expect this exposure to be an ongoing part of our business. 
2010 was a strong year for emerging procedures. In fact, procedures falling outside the above-mentioned adopting procedures grew by 47% over 2009. Among procedures in new specialties that may emerge as adoptions are da Vinci colorectal procedures, da Vinci thoracic procedures and da Vinci transoral head and neck procedures. Patient value in these specialties appears to be high, and certain interest in early growth has been encouraging. I'll leave it to Aleks to provide more detail on our progress later in the call. 
We are pleased with our procedure adoption in Europe in 2010, helped by growing depths in our European sales team. European procedures grew 48% year-over-year led by urology. We also saw the emergence of da Vinci surgery for cancer indications and gynecologic surgery in Europe. 
2010 has been an investment year for products, with several of them in the mid to late stages of development. We believe these products will optimize existing producers and enable new ones. In Q4, we launched our da Vinci Si stimulator, which, in combination with our Dual Console, afford surgeons more opportunity to train on da Vinci and track their progress.
Our Single Site product is in the late stages of regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. Recall that this product is intended to facilitate da Vinci's single incision surgeries on existing Si systems. Our robotic stapling and vessel sealing products are in development, and our progress with these products is encouraging. 
In imaging, our fluorescence imaging product is also in the late stages of the regulatory review progress in the U.S. and Europe. In 2010, we also connected the majority of our installed da Vinci systems to a da Vinci network that enables remote system, performance monitoring as well as remote proctoring. We continue to invest in technologies that improve and enhance surgical imaging. Likewise, we also continuously invest in robotic technologies that simplify and enhance access to the body. 
Finally, as we've discussed on prior calls, we believe that the outset of 2010 that investments were required in our clinical sales force to support the continued expansion of gynecologic and emerging procedures in the U.S. We added 150 members to our clinical team through the year and have largely caught back up to the procedure to sales rep run rate that we believe supports our customers' needs during this period. Across the company, we added nearly 400 employees in 2010, ending the year with 1,660 people on our team. 
In closing, our priorities for 2011 are as follows; first, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our product development process through product launch; third, driving deeper within the emerging procedures of colorectal surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery through procedure and product development with leading customers; and fourth, strengthening our team both in the U.S. and in international markets to support the continued growth of the business. 
I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."

Our fourth quarter revenue was $389 million, up 21% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010. 
Fourth quarter revenue details were as follows. Fourth quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $151 million, up 33% compared with $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 19% compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily driven by procedure growth of 35% year-over-year. The increase relative to the third quarter is primarily driven by procedure growth, as well as an increase in the amount of stocking orders and customer purchases of our new 8.5 millimeters scopes. 
Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the fourth quarter of 2009 by approximately $20 and higher than the third quarter of 2010 by approximately $100. The changes in the instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in and the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base.
Fourth quarter 2010 Systems revenue of $178 million increased 10%, compared with $162 million of Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 and increased 11% compared with $160 million of Systems revenue for the third quarter. Recently, we began delivering new Si Systems for customers' S Systems versus completing as S to Si field upgrade. In addition, the contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-ins are now reflective of Si sales.  Accordingly, we have begun including S to Si upgrades in our systems counts. 
Inclusive of nine S to Si trade-ins, we sold 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. This compares to 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010. I would note that the prior-period system count exclude 10 S to Si upgrades for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. 
Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.41 million equal to the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of mix of products including a reduction in the proportion of Si Dual Console sold in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase due to a greater number of systems sold to direct customers in Europe. 
Service revenue increased to $61 million, up 27% compared with $48 million last year and up 6% compared with $57 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base and an increase in the mix of Si, which carry a higher annual service fee. 
Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $212 million, up 31% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 15% compared with the third quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represent 54% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 50% in the fourth quarter last year and 54% last quarter. 
Non-U.S. revenue represented 25% of our total revenue in the quarter, compared with 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 17% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2010. Non-U.S. procedures grew 42% on a year-to-year basis in a seasonally stronger quarter. dVP in Europe was the greatest driver in non-U.S. procedure growth, although we experienced growth in all procedure category. 
Instrument and accessory revenue grew at a rate similar to the procedure growth. We sold 38 systems outside the U.S. including two S to Si trade-in, compared with 30 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. I would note that there was one S to Si upgrade outside the U.S. in both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. 
Despite uncertainties surrounding European economies, we sold 28 systems in Europe this quarter, compared to 16 in the third quarter and 21 last year. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. 
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 73%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 gross margin of 72% and compared with the third quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase over the prior year reflects lower manufacturing costs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. 
Fourth quarter 2010 operating expenses of $128 million were up 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased R&D prototype spending. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 54 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force and 28 employees in operations.
Fourth quarter 2010 operating income was $154 million or 40% of sales, compared with $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter 2009 and $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the fourth quarter 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth in noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of this year. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter up 23% brought our annual tax rate to 33% compared to our 2009 rate of 41%. The reduction in rates between years reflects the implementation of our international tax structure and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. Our fourth quarter rate benefited from a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S., from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and from a reduction in nondeductible stock option expenses. Our net income was $121 million or $3.02 per share, compared with $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for 2010. Procedures grew by 35% to approximately $278,000. Total revenue for 2010 was $1.413 billion, up 34% compared with $1.052 billion last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 34% and an increase in Systems revenue of 35%.
Operating income for 2010 was $555 million, up 47% compared with $377 million last year. Operating income included $118 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2010 compared with $97 million in 2009. Net income for 2010 was $382 million or $9.47 per share, compared with $233 million or $5.93 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2010 with cash and investments of $1.609 billion, down $12 million compared with September 30, 2010. The decrease during the quarter reflects $125 million of cash flows from operations, plus $8 million from the exercise of stock options, more than offset by $140 million of stock buybacks and $9 million of capital and IT purchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we bought back 530,000 shares at an average price of $2.64 per share, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 742,000 shares at an average price of $2.68 per share. As of December 31, there was $101 million of the board authorized buybacks remain. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $247 million at December 31, from $208 million at September 30, reflecting increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $87 million at December 31 from $85 million at September 30. The increase reflects inventory necessary to support increased revenues. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the fourth quarter, we sold 124 da Vinci Systems: 86 in the United States, 28 in Europe and 10 into rest of world markets. As part of the 124 System sales, 24 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems, and nine S Systems were traded in for Si Systems. 
We had a net 91 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,752, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,285 in the U.S., 316 in Europe and 151 in rest of world markets. 50 of the 124 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. The 38 system sales internationally was our strongest quarter-to-date and included six da Vinci Systems into Italy, five into Germany and three to the countries of France and Korea. 
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, with GYN and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH for malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger both in actual procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additionally, overall benign GYN procedures, which included sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometrial  resections, also exhibited strong sequential growth. Within the segment of urology, dVP, Partial Nephrectomy and Cystectomy were all up materially on a sequential basis. And finally, head and neck, colorectal and thoracic resections all displayed strong sequential growth. 
Our strong fourth quarter procedure growth was not limited to a specific geography. It was global in structure. On a year-over-year comparison, overall fourth quarter procedures grew by approximately 35%, which is consistent with our overall 2010 procedure growth as well as our 2010 procedure guidance. 
On a global basis, we finished 2010 having completed approximately 278,000 total procedures led by dVH, representing approximately 110,000 and dVP, representing approximately 98,000. Benign GYN procedures have become a significant catalyst for growth within our overall business. dVH, da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, Myomectomy and endometrial resections represent large business opportunities, both U.S. and internationally. And the peer-reviewed data supporting da Vinci's role within these procedures is beginning to expand. 
A rapidly emerging benign GYN procedure, one we have not talked a great deal about is da Vinci Myomectomy. Myomectomy is a procedure to remove a uterine fibroid while preserving a patient's uterus. Currently, the gold standard operation for myomectomy includes a lower abdominal incision. Over the past few years, traditional laparoscopic myomectomies have been performed more regularly. However, due to the extensive suturing required for adequate closure, it is considered technically difficult and therefore, limited in its clinical adoption. 
At the American Society of Reproductive Medicine Conference, a paper entitled 'Robotic-assisted, Laparoscopic and Open Myomectomy; A Comparison of Surgical Outcomes' was presented. The study was authored by a group of physicians representing the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Case Western Reserve University. 
The study examined blood loss, length of stay and operating time for 575 patients within these three distinct cohorts. The three groups were case matched with comparable myomas regarding size, number and location and adjusted for age and body mass index. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to open myomectomy, average surgical time did increase. But average blood loss was reduced significantly by 50%, and the average hospitalization was reduced from three days to one day. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to traditional laparoscopy, surgical time was reduced by an average of 22 minutes and blood loss was reduced by an average of 33%. 
In their conclusion, the authors wrote, and I quote, ""robotic-assisted myomectomy is associated with decreased estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay compared to traditional laparoscopy and open myomectomy. Despite the robotic use is associated with longer OR time compared to open procedures, it is shorter than laparoscopic approach. It appears that robotic technology is able to convert more laparotomy cases.""
Total GYN procedures represent nearly half of our overall procedure volume, with the overwhelming majority being comprised of procedures to treat benign conditions. We are pleased by the fact that our customers and patients are experiencing an enhanced clinical value within these large mainstream procedure categories. 
However, we do recognize that it makes procedure volumes more susceptible to general seasonality and macroeconomic pressures. This is due in large part to a patient's ability to postpone some treatments to a future date when it becomes more economically convenient for them. 
On the other end of the spectrum, we have experienced strong growth trajectories within the category that I will term very complex procedures, procedures where volumes are less seasonally affected, namely, head and neck surgery, colon and rectal surgery, renal cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer and lung cancer procedures. While some of these procedure categories are potentially large with steep growth trajectories, they are also fairly young with respect to their adoption. And therefore, individually, their contribution is currently less impactful to our overall procedure number. 
The fastest growing segment in 2010 was head and neck surgery. The category more than tripled in size during the year and showed exceptional sequential growth in Q4. We are seeing more and more peer-reviewed literature describing da Vinci's role within this category. 
In the recent edition of the journal Oncology, three surgeons from the Department of Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center authored a comprehensive perspective paper entitled 'A Shifting Paradigm for Patients with Head and Neck Cancer: Transoral Robotic Surgery' or TORS. 
The paper reviewed the functional outcomes from various studies published by leading head and neck cancer centers such as the Mayo Clinic Rochester, University of Pennsylvania, the University of Alabama Birmingham and MD Anderson. The authors highlighted the initial study out of Penn, which reported that 25 out of their first 27 patients undergoing a da Vinci procedure for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma attained negative margins, and the two patients with positive margins were later cleared. Local control was achieved in all 27 at six months follow up. 
Next, the University of Alabama Birmingham evaluated 54 patients undergoing TORS and found that only five required a temporary tracheostomy with decannulation or removal occurring at a mean of eight days. Similar functional data was reported in a series by Moore, et al. at the Mayo Clinic. This group reported an average time to decannulation of seven days. This is a significant improvement for decannulation over conventional surgery, where it is usually reported in weeks or months rather than days. 
These early evaluations of oncologic and functional outcomes of TORS illustrate a minimally invasive technique that permits resection of a tumor en bloc while preserving patient swelling ability. The MD Anderson group concluded their paper by stating, and I quote, ""robotic surgery in head and neck oncology is an exciting innovation that provides significant advantages. Patients have an en bloc removal of their tumors via a minimally invasive surgery without a cervical incision, while preserving function and potentially avoiding adjuvant radiation and its long-term sequelae. While long-term oncologic functional data are needed to fully validate its use, early results are promising."" 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. We continue to see strong growth in da Vinci hysterectomies in the U.S., dVPs in Europe and general growth across a broadening range of procedures at earlier stages of market adoption. We expect our 2011 total procedures to grow between 25% and 28% from a base of approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. Based on an increasing percentage of benign hysterectomies and other short-term elective procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
Moving to revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 16% and 20%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. We expect typical capital sales seasonality in 2011, with Q1 being a relatively lighter quarter and Q4 being the seasonally strongest. 
With regards to gross margin, we reported fourth quarter 2010 gross profit of 72.5% of sales. Looking forward into 2011, we anticipate maintaining our margins near the current level at a rate of between 72% and 73% of sales for the year. Gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geographical mix. 
Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 16% to 20% in 2011, which is in line with our expected top line growth. Our 2011 operating expense growth will be driven by clinical sales resource additions in the field to support newly installed systems and drive procedure growth. Investments in new and existing R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business, and noncash stock compensation expense growth of approximately 22%. 
We expect our noncash stock option compensation charges to increase from $118 million recorded in 2010 to approximately $140 million to $145 million in 2011. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense, is expected to increase from $16 million in 2010 to $17 million to $20 million in 2011. 
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates earned on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $17 million and $18 million in 2011, which is down slightly from approximately $19 million earned in 2010. 
With regard to income tax. In 2010, we reported income taxes at a rate of 33.3% of pretax income. As some of the items that benefited 2010 will not carry forward, we anticipate recording 2011 income taxes at about 34% pretax income. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2011 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. 
Cash. Our cash balance has remained in the $1.6 billion range throughout the second half of 2010 as we have largely returned operating cash flows to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases, including $140 million used to repurchase shares in Q4. Our repurchase program remains active. And entering Q1 2011, we have approximately $101 million remaining authorized by the board to buyback additional shares. We will communicate any future repurchase authorizations as they become effective. 
That concludes my comments. Now I'll open the floor for your questions."

We saw it in prostatectomy with bipolar energy and the appropriate grasper to manage the tumor or the prostate, I should say. And you start to see procedure times come down, and you start to see case reports improving and so on and so forth. So we know the process of trying to optimize a procedure. And I think stapling becomes directionally a pretty important product, not just in colorectal, but perhaps in lung surgery and some of the other large sort of very complex procedures. So in terms of pent-up demand, I don't know that we even know how to call that. I would just say that it's a product launch, or I should say, a product development that should add value in a number of targets for us going forward."

I think that if you can integrate over many year period, the number of procedures to do will tell you how many systems you need to do that number of procedures. A couple of things that are interesting. Greenfields have a lag effect to bring those programs up to full capability. And then the one that's really hard to model is as robotic programs become multi-specialty, how many procedures they can get on a system while sharing it across multi-specialty, which is highly variable. And so as these emerging procedures come on, utilization trends start to move around a little bit. And so it's a very tough thing to model.
I think that was our last question. Thank you. As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our teams remain sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I would like to share with you two brief examples of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
The first patient is Sandra, who had her da Vinci procedure in Miami. Sandra reports, ""on November 29, 2010, I received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma carcinoma of the lung. I have always been an extremely healthy person and a nonsmoker, so you can imagine how shocking this diagnosis was for me. Being a nurse practitioner and a former OR nurse, I thought I knew what I was in for. 
I have a friend who went through a traditional lobectomy for the same diagnosis ten years previously. She spent two weeks in the hospital, five days in the ICU and was subjected to a broken rib and scapula in order to provide access to the lung. It was three months before she was able to return to work, and she still has pain to this day. 
Fortunately, I was wrong. I have a friend who works for Intuitive Surgical. He was adamant that I meet with Dr. Mark Dylewski at South Miami Hospital. I did my research and learned that Dr. Dylewski is very experienced with the da Vinci robot, having done over 300 robotic-assisted surgeries. I met Dr. Dylewski on November 30, and knew immediately that he was my surgeon. His confidence was just the reassurance that I needed. 
On December 9, I was admitted to South Miami Hospital for robotic-assisted right lower lobectomy. My surgery took an hour and a half. I had minimal postoperative pain and was up and walking the next day. I was discharged to home on day two and stopped pain medication on day six.
I returned to work two weeks after surgery and was back to the gym for a light workout three weeks after surgery. I have to say I feel blessed. My tumor was found early. My nodes are negative, and I have an excellent prognosis. I am blessed to have caring friends. I'm blessed to have found this brilliant surgeon. I am blessed that this amazing technology is available. 
I would encourage anyone who receives a diagnosis of lung cancer to find a surgeon and a hospital that offers the da Vinci robotic surgery. It saved me from agonizing postoperative pain and a long debilitating recovery. I traveled 125 miles south to Miami, and I am so glad that I did it.""
Our second patient is Linda, who had sacrocolpopexy completed in Reno, Nevada. She says, ""I had a hysterectomy 30 years ago. So when I was told I needed a sacrocolpopexy. all I can think about was the pain and long recovery. Needless to say, I was dreading this procedure. 
Dr. Macaskill [ph] assured to me that the da Vinci procedure would be less invasive, less painful and I would feel better in less time. Thanks to this very talented surgeon and the da Vinci robot, the procedure and the recovery have exceeded all of my expectations. There was really no pain, only discomfort around one of the five incisions. I felt the need to use pain medication for the first three days. And after that, I leave work late [ph] at night to help me sleep. 
I was up and about shortly after the surgery and was totally amazed by the fact that I could stand up straight and walk without any pain or feeling like my stitches were pulling apart. I had to remind myself before overdoing things that I just had major surgery. 
Wow, what a difference between the surgery I had 30 years ago, when I was unable to stand up straight and barely able to shuffle around for the first couple of weeks than the one I just experienced with the da Vinci robot. Anyone who has the option to have this da Vinci procedure should take advantage of it. Compared to the other options, it is truly amazing.""
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months time."

30239,118200816,93576,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2010 was a year with some broad challenges and encouraging trends.

In the year, our procedure mix shifted in favor of gynecology, as it eclipsed urology as the largest specialty we serve. We are making good progress in responding to the challenges inherent in our expanding business. 
In 2010, our focus was in four areas: first, driving the adoption of da Vinci surgery within the gynecology market; second, enabling growth of new procedures within new specialties; third, the expansion of our business internationally; and fourth, rightsizing our various core teams within the company to support our growth, most notably our sales organization. 
Looking back at the full year 2010, our operating highlights were as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by 35%, with international procedures growing by 42%. We sold 441 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 338. Total revenue grew to $1.413 billion, up 34%. Recurring revenue grew to $753 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $673 million in operating profit before noncash stock compensation expense, up 42% from last year. And GAAP net income grew to $382 million, up 64% year-over-year. 
Now turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew 35%. We sold 124 da Vinci Surgical Systems. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,752 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $389 million. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $151 million, up 33%.
Total recurring revenue including service grew to $212 million, comprising 54% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $184 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, up 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. And GAAP net income grew to $121 million, up 56%. 
We ended the year with $1.609 billion in cash and investments, down $12 million from last quarter and up $437 million from last year. We received $141 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $79 million in intellectual property, working capital, property plant and equipment and $199 million in stock repurchases for the year. Going forward, we will continue to look for stock repurchase opportunities. 
Gross cash from operations for the year were $573 million, or $14.22 per fully diluted share and 150% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant noncash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we believe that gross cash generated from operations remains the best measure of our financial performance.
In our adopting procedures in the U.S., da Vinci Hysterectomy continued its strong growth, both in malignant and benign conditions, growing 59% year-over-year. Sacrocolpopexy and Myomectomy also continued to track their adoption curves. Urology also grew for the full year of 2010 through the continued adoption of Partial Nephrectomy and growth in dVP, the latter being focused in Europe. 
As benign conditions became a larger part of our procedure base in the U.S., we experienced increased exposure to seasonality and other patient treatment deferrals that are less common with cancer operations. We expect this exposure to be an ongoing part of our business. 
2010 was a strong year for emerging procedures. In fact, procedures falling outside the above-mentioned adopting procedures grew by 47% over 2009. Among procedures in new specialties that may emerge as adoptions are da Vinci colorectal procedures, da Vinci thoracic procedures and da Vinci transoral head and neck procedures. Patient value in these specialties appears to be high, and surgeon interest and early growth has been encouraging. I'll leave it to Aleks to provide more detail on our progress later in the call. 
We are pleased with our procedure adoption in Europe in 2010, helped by growing depths in our European sales team. European procedures grew 48% year-over-year led by urology. We also saw the emergence of da Vinci surgery for cancer indications and gynecologic surgery in Europe. 
2010 has been an investment year for products, with several of them in the mid to late stages of development. We believe these products will optimize existing procedures and enable new ones. In Q4, we launched our da Vinci Si stimulator, which, in combination with our Dual Console, afford surgeons more opportunity to train on da Vinci and track their progress.
Our Single Site product is in the late stages of regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. Recall that this product is intended to facilitate da Vinci's single incision surgeries on existing Si systems. Our robotic stapling and vessel sealing products are in development, and our progress with these products is encouraging. 
In imaging, our fluorescence imaging product is also in the late stages of the regulatory review progress in the U.S. and Europe. In 2010, we also connected the majority of our installed da Vinci systems to a da Vinci network that enables remote system, performance monitoring as well as remote proctoring. We continue to invest in technologies that improve and enhance surgical imaging. Likewise, we also continuously invest in robotic technologies that simplify and enhance access to the body. 
Finally, as we've discussed on prior calls, we believed at the outset of 2010 that investments were required in our clinical sales force to support the continued expansion of gynecologic and emerging procedures in the U.S. We added 150 members to our clinical team through the year and have largely caught back up to the procedure to sales rep run rate that we believe supports our customers' needs during this period. Across the company, we added nearly 400 employees in 2010, ending the year with 1,660 people on our team. 
In closing, our priorities for 2011 are as follows: first, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our product development process through product launch; third, driving deeper within the emerging procedures of colorectal surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery through procedure and product development with leading customers; and fourth, strengthening our team both in the U.S. and in international markets to support the continued growth of the business. 
I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."

Our fourth quarter revenue was $389 million, up 21% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter revenue details were as follows. Fourth qu",1352,"Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter revenue was $389 million, up 21% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010. 
Fourth quarter revenue details were as follows. Fourth quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $151 million, up 33% compared with $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 19% compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily driven by procedure growth of 35% year-over-year. The increase relative to the third quarter is primarily driven by procedure growth, as well as an increase in the amount of stocking orders and customer purchases of our new 8.5 millimeters scopes. 
Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the fourth quarter of 2009 by approximately $20 and higher than the third quarter of 2010 by approximately $100. The changes in the instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in and the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base.
Fourth quarter 2010 Systems revenue of $178 million increased 10%, compared with $162 million of Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 and increased 11% compared with $160 million of Systems revenue for the third quarter. Recently, we began delivering new Si Systems for customers' S Systems versus completing as S to Si field upgrade. In addition, the contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-ins are now reflective of Si sales.  Accordingly, we have begun including S to Si upgrades in our systems counts. 
Inclusive of nine S to Si trade-ins, we sold 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. This compares to 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010. I would note that the prior-period system counts exclude 10 S to Si upgrades for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. 
Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.41 million equal to the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of mix of products including a reduction in the proportion of Si Dual Consoles sold in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase due to a greater number of systems sold to direct customers in Europe. 
Service revenue increased to $61 million, up 27% compared with $48 million last year and up 6% compared with $57 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and an increase in the mix of Si, which carry a higher annual service fee. 
Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $212 million, up 31% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 15% compared with the third quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represent 54% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 50% in the fourth quarter last year and 54% last quarter. 
Non-U.S. revenue represented 25% of our total revenue in the quarter, compared with 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 17% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2010. Non-U.S. procedures grew 42% on a year-to-year basis in a seasonally stronger quarter. dVP in Europe was the greatest driver in non-U.S. procedure growth, although we experienced growth in all procedure categories. 
Instrument and accessory revenue grew at a rate similar to the procedure growth. We sold 38 systems outside the U.S. including two S to Si trade-ins, compared with 30 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. I would note that there was one S to Si upgrade outside the U.S. in both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. 
Despite uncertainties surrounding European economies, we sold 28 systems in Europe this quarter, compared to 16 in the third quarter and 21 last year. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. 
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 73%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 gross margin of 72% and compared with the third quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase over the prior year reflects lower manufacturing costs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. 
Fourth quarter 2010 operating expenses of $128 million were up 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased R&D prototype spending. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 54 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force and 28 employees in operations.
Fourth quarter 2010 operating income was $154 million or 40% of sales, compared with $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter 2009 and $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the fourth quarter 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth in noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of this year. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 23% brought our annual tax rate to 33% compared to our 2009 rate of 41%. The reduction in rates between years reflects the implementation of our international tax structure and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. Our fourth quarter rate benefited from a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S., from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and from a reduction in nondeductible stock option expenses. Our net income was $121 million or $3.02 per share, compared with $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for 2010. Procedures grew by 35% to approximately 278,000. Total revenue for 2010 was $1.413 billion, up 34% compared with $1.052 billion last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 34% and an increase in Systems revenue of 35%.
Operating income for 2010 was $555 million, up 47% compared with $377 million last year. Operating income included $118 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2010 compared with $97 million in 2009. Net income for 2010 was $382 million or $9.47 per share, compared with $233 million or $5.93 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2010 with cash and investments of $1.609 billion, down $12 million compared with September 30, 2010. The decrease during the quarter reflects $125 million of cash flows from operations, plus $8 million from the exercise of stock options, more than offset by $140 million of stock buybacks and $9 million of capital and IT purchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we bought back 530,000 shares at an average price of $2.64 per share, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 742,000 shares at an average price of $2.68 per share. As of December 31, there was $101 million of the board authorized buybacks remain. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $247 million at December 31, from $208 million at September 30, reflecting increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $87 million at December 31 from $85 million at September 30. The increase reflects inventory necessary to support increased revenues. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

The 38 system sales internationally was our strongest quarter-to-date and included six da Vinci Systems into Italy, five into Germany and three into the countries of France and Korea. 
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, with GYN and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH for malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger both in actual procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additionally, overall benign GYN procedures, which included sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometrial  resections, also exhibited strong sequential growth. Within the segment of urology, dVP, Partial Nephrectomy and Cystectomy were all up materially on a sequential basis. And finally, head and neck, colorectal and thoracic resections all displayed strong sequential growth. 
Our strong fourth quarter procedure growth was not limited to a specific geography. It was global in structure. On a year-over-year comparison, overall fourth quarter procedures grew by approximately 35%, which is consistent with our overall 2010 procedure growth as well as our 2010 procedure guidance. 
On a global basis, we finished 2010 having completed approximately 278,000 total procedures led by dVH, representing approximately 110,000 and dVP, representing approximately 98,000. Benign GYN procedures have become a significant catalyst for growth within our overall business. dVH, da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, Myomectomy and endometrial resections represent large business opportunities, both U.S. and internationally. And the peer-reviewed data supporting da Vinci's role within these procedures is beginning to expand. 
A rapidly emerging benign GYN procedure, one we have not talked a great deal about is da Vinci Myomectomy. Myomectomy is a procedure to remove a uterine fibroid while preserving a patient's uterus. Currently, the gold standard operation for myomectomy includes a lower abdominal incision. Over the past few years, traditional laparoscopic myomectomies have been performed more regularly. However, due to the extensive suturing required for adequate closure, it is considered technically difficult and therefore, limited in its clinical adoption. 
At the American Society of Reproductive Medicine Conference, a paper entitled 'Robotic-Assisted, Laparoscopic, and Open Myomectomy: A Comparison of Surgical Outcomes' was presented. The study was authored by a group of physicians representing the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Case Western Reserve University. 
The study examined blood loss, length of stay and operating time for 575 patients within these three distinct cohorts. The three groups were case matched with comparable myomas regarding size, number and location and adjusted for age and body mass index. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to open myomectomy, average surgical time did increase. But average blood loss was reduced significantly by 50%, and the average hospitalization was reduced from three days to one day. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to traditional laparoscopy, surgical time was reduced by an average of 22 minutes and blood loss was reduced by an average of 33%. 
In their conclusion, the authors wrote, and I quote, ""robotic-assisted myomectomy is associated with decreased estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay compared to traditional laparoscopy and open myomectomy. Despite that robotic use is associated with longer OR time compared to open procedures, it is shorter than laparoscopic approach. It appears that robotic technology is able to convert more laparotomy cases.""
Total GYN procedures represent nearly half of our overall procedure volume, with the overwhelming majority being comprised of procedures to treat benign conditions. We are pleased by the fact that our customers and patients are experiencing an enhanced clinical value within these large mainstream procedure categories. 
However, we do recognize that it makes procedure volumes more susceptible to general seasonality and macroeconomic pressures. This is due in large part to a patient's ability to postpone some treatments to a future date when it becomes more economically convenient for them. 
On the other end of the spectrum, we have experienced strong growth trajectories within the category that I will term very complex procedures, procedures where volumes are less seasonally affected, namely, head and neck surgery, colon and rectal surgery, renal cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer and lung cancer procedures. While some of these procedure categories are potentially large with steep growth trajectories, they are also fairly young with respect to their adoption. And therefore, individually, their contribution is currently less impactful to our overall procedure number. 
The fastest growing segment in 2010 was head and neck surgery. The category more than tripled in size during the year and showed exceptional sequential growth in Q4. We are seeing more and more peer-reviewed literature describing da Vinci's role within this category. 
In a recent edition of the journal Oncology, three surgeons from the Department of Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center authored a comprehensive perspective paper entitled 'A Shifting Paradigm for Patients with Head and Neck Cancer: Transoral Robotic Surgery' or TORS. 
The paper reviewed the functional outcomes from various studies published by leading head and neck cancer centers such as the Mayo Clinic Rochester, University of Pennsylvania, the University of Alabama Birmingham and MD Anderson. The authors highlighted the initial study out of Penn, which reported that 25 out of their first 27 patients undergoing a da Vinci procedure for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma attained negative margins, and the two patients with positive margins were later cleared. Local control was achieved in all 27 at six months' follow up. 
Next, the University of Alabama Birmingham evaluated 54 patients undergoing TORS and found that only five required a temporary tracheostomy with decannulation or removal occurring at a mean of eight days. Similar functional data was reported in a series by Moore, et al. at the Mayo Clinic. His group reported an average time to decannulation of seven days. This is a significant improvement for decannulation over conventional surgery, where it is usually reported in weeks or months rather than days. 
These early evaluations of oncologic and functional outcomes of TORS illustrate a minimally invasive technique that permits resection of a tumor en bloc while preserving patient swallowing ability. The MD Anderson group concluded their paper by stating, and I quote, ""robotic surgery in head and neck oncology is an exciting innovation that provides significant advantages. Patients have an en bloc removal of their tumors via a minimally invasive surgery without a cervical incision, while preserving function and potentially avoiding adjuvant radiation and its long-term sequelae. While long-term oncologic functional data are needed to fully validate its use, early results are promising."" 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. We continue to see strong growth in da Vinci hysterectomies in the U.S., dVPs in Europe and general growth across a broadening range of procedures at earlier stages of market adoption. We expect our 2011 total procedures to grow between 25% and 28% from a base of approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. Based on an increasing percentage of benign hysterectomies and other short-term elective procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
Moving to revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 16% and 20%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. We expect typical capital sales seasonality in 2011, with Q1 being a relatively lighter quarter and Q4 being the seasonally strongest. 
With regards to gross margin, we reported fourth quarter 2010 gross profit of 72.5% of sales. Looking forward into 2011, we anticipate maintaining our margins near the current level at a rate of between 72% and 73% of sales for the year. Gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geographical mix. 
Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 16% to 20% in 2011, which is in line with our expected top line growth. Our 2011 operating expense growth will be driven by clinical sales resource additions in the field to support newly installed systems and drive procedure growth. Investments in new and existing R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business, and noncash stock compensation expense growth of approximately 22%. 
We expect our noncash stock compensation charges to increase from $118 million recorded in 2010 to approximately $140 million to $145 million in 2011. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense, is expected to increase from $16 million in 2010 to $17 million to $20 million in 2011. 
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates earned on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $17 million and $18 million in 2011, which is down slightly from approximately $19 million earned in 2010. 
With regard to income tax. In 2010, we reported income taxes at a rate of 33.3% of pretax income. As some of the items that benefited 2010 will not carry forward, we anticipate recording 2011 income taxes at about 34% of pretax income. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2011 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. 
Cash. Our cash balance has remained in the $1.6 billion range throughout the second half of 2010 as we have largely returned operating cash flows to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases, including $140 million used to repurchase shares in Q4. Our repurchase program remains active, and entering Q1 2011, we have approximately $101 million remaining authorized by the board to buyback additional shares. We will communicate any future repurchase authorizations as they become effective. 
That concludes my comments. Now I'll open the floor for your questions."

A second source of growth in the procedure domain will be urology in Europe, which is coming along nicely but a little lower on the curve.

So by focusing on the procedure, the capital systems continue to come.

And you started to see, let's say -- I don't want to oversell and say some critical mass, but you saw some strength, early strength in gynecologic cancer operation, dVH malignant, which is what we would have expected because we've got sort of a history, if you will, of starting in the most complex areas, showing value and then moving on beyond that.

I would like to share with you two brief examples of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
The first patient is Sandra, who had her da Vinci procedure in Miami. Sandra reports, ""on November 29, 2010, I received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung. I have always been an extremely healthy person and a nonsmoker, so you can imagine how shocking this diagnosis was for me. Being a nurse practitioner and a former OR nurse, I thought I knew what I was in for. 
I have a friend who underwent a traditional lobectomy for the same diagnosis ten years previously. She spent two weeks in the hospital, five days in the ICU and was subjected to a broken rib and scapula in order to provide access to the lung. It was three months before she was able to return to work, and she still has pain to this day. 
Fortunately, I was wrong. I have a friend who works for Intuitive Surgical. He was adamant that I meet with Dr. Mark Dylewski at South Miami Hospital. I did my research and learned that Dr. Dylewski is very experienced with the da Vinci robot, having done over 300 robotic-assisted surgeries. I met Dr. Dylewski on November 30, and knew immediately that he was my surgeon. His confidence was just the reassurance that I needed. 
On December 9, I was admitted to South Miami Hospital for robotic-assisted right lower lobectomy. My surgery took an hour and a half. I had minimal postoperative pain and was up and walking the next day. I was discharged to home on day two and stopped pain medication on day six.
I returned to work two weeks after surgery and was back to the gym for a light workout three weeks after surgery. I have to say I feel blessed. My tumor was found early. My nodes are negative, and I have an excellent prognosis. I am blessed to have caring friends. I'm blessed to have found this brilliant surgeon. I am blessed that this amazing technology is available. 
I would encourage anyone who receives a diagnosis of lung cancer to find a surgeon and a hospital that offers the da Vinci robotic surgery. It saved me from agonizing postoperative pain and a long debilitating recovery. I traveled 125 miles south to Miami, and I am so glad that I did it.""
Our second patient is Linda, who had sacrocolpopexy completed in Reno, Nevada. She says, ""I had a hysterectomy 30 years ago. So when I was told I needed a sacrocolpopexy, all I can think about was the pain and long recovery. Needless to say, I was dreading this procedure. 
Dr. Macaskill [ph] assured to me that the da Vinci procedure would be less invasive, less painful and I would feel better in less time. Thanks to this very talented surgeon and the da Vinci robot, the procedure and the recovery have exceeded all of my expectations. There was really no pain, only discomfort around one of the five incisions. I felt the need to use pain medication for the first three days. And after that, Aleve worked great at night to help me sleep. 
I was up and about shortly after the surgery and was totally amazed by the fact that I could stand up straight and walk without any pain or feeling like my stitches were pulling apart. I had to remind myself before overdoing things that I just had major surgery. 
Wow, what a difference between the surgery I had 30 years ago, when I was unable to stand up straight and barely able to shuffle around for the first couple of weeks than the one I just experienced with the da Vinci robot. Anyone who has the option to have this da Vinci procedure should take advantage of it. Compared to the other options, it is truly amazing.""
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months time."

30239,129513268,115712,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well, and we have had solid performance in procedures, system sales and the financial results of the following. For 2011, we are focused on the following. Extending the benefit",672,"Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well, and we have had solid performance in procedures, system sales and the financial results of the following. 
For 2011, we are focused on the following. Extending the benefits of the minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and neurology; expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; crisp execution in our part development efforts; and enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral and colorectal surgery. 
With regard to procedures, we grew in several specialties and geographies in the quarter. Myomectomy showed strong growth in the quarter led by continued adoption of GDP in Europe. And gynecology malignant Hysterectomy showed continued strength. Benign Hysterectomy showed earlier seasonality, particularly in January and February. Emerging procedures continue to experience growth in our early adopting centers, in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal procedures. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.
Turning to operating highlights for the first quarter, procedures grew 30% over the first quarter of 2010. We sold 120 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 104 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $388 million, up 18% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $157 million, up 28% over Q1 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $221 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue.  Net income was $104 million, up 22% over last year. 
We generated an operating profit of $180 million before noncash stock option expense, up 15% over the first quarter of last year and representing 46% of Q1 revenue. 
We ended the quarter with $1,757,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $12 million used in repurchasing stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $60 million from stock proceeds and $53 million used from working capital, we generated $168 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the first quarter.
As we have mentioned on past calls, we are making significant investments in progress in product development. In Q1, we received the CE Mark for our single site da Vinci instruments and accessories necessities. We have begun a stage rollout of single site and Europe focused on single site cholecystectomy. Our early clinical and product performance results there have been encouraging. 
In the U.S., the FDA has requested additional clinical data on our single site products. We are in the process of collecting this data in part from our European experience and will provide the FDA as needed. In the quarter we received FDA clearance for our da Vinci florescent Imaging System and have likewise begun a staged rollout in the U.S. whether a initial launch of single site in Europe and florescent imaging in the U.S., we are focused on an outstanding early customer experience in the development of clinical evidence supporting their use. 
We continue to make progress on both our da Vinci Vessel Sealing instrument and our da Vinci Stapler. Our Vessel Sealer has been submitted to the FDA and we are working through production readiness for this product. Our stapler is undergoing validation work and engineering refinement. We have not yet submitted the stapler for clearance.
Lastly, we introduced our da Vinci Surgical Simulator in Q4 of 2010 and shipped our first units and volume in the first quarter. We are working with leading centers on validating simulator tasks and on developing curricular for its use. 
As we enter new surgical markets and drive its new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanded partnerships in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference through robotic surgery. First quarter, we added 69 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,729 employees. 
I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,129513268,115712,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","You, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter revenues by product category we",1341,"You, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
First quarter revenues by product category were as follows: First quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $157 million, up 28% compared with $123 million for the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increases in instruments and accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the first quarter of 2010 by approximately $20 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2010.  Relative to the first quarter of 2010, the reduction reflects the lower impact of stocking orders over a larger base of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter, we had lower stocking orders which were offset by increased orders associated with customer buying patterns. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. 
First quarter 2011 systems revenue of $167 million increased 8% compared with $155 million of systems revenue for the first quarter of 2010, and decreased 6% compared with $178 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2010, we began delivering new S-systems for customers S-systems versus converting S-systems into Si systems via field upgrade. The contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-in are now more closely reflective of Si sales as a result of the change. Accordingly, we began reporting S to Si trade-ins as system sales. Inclusive of a 19 S to Si trade-ins, we sold 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. This compares to 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010 and 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. I would note that the first quarter of 2010 system count excluded 9 S to Si upgrade that were treated as upgrade revenue and the fourth quarter of 2010 system count included 10 S to Si trade-ins. 
Upgrade revenue for the first quarter 2011 was approximately $2 million compared to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades was $1.38 million, a decrease from the $1.45 million realized in the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter. The decrease in average sales price compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects an approximately $1.3 million of revenue associated with simulators that was deferred as the simulators were delivered after the end of the quarter.  An increase in the number of S to Si trade-ins for which we offer customer discounts for the return to S product and discounts offered in multi-system purchases. A decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects those factors outlined for the sequential-quarter comparison combined with the positive product and geographical mix in the first quarter of 2010.
Service revenue increased to $64 million, up 26% compared with $51 million last year and up 5% compared with $61 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base. 
Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessories and service revenue, increased to $221 million, up 28% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010.  Recurring revenue represented 57% of total first quarter revenue compared with 53% in the first quarter last year and 54% last quarter. 
International results were as follows: Outside the U.S., procedures grew 38% on a year-to-year basis, with dDP in Europe being the greatest driver. Although we experienced growth in our other target procedures including dVH in Europe. First quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $91 million, up 32% compared with revenue of $69 million in the first quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Instrument and accessory revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. We sold 31 systems outside the U.S. compared with 24 in the first quarter of 2010 to 38 last quarter. We sold 15 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 11 in the first quarter of 2010 and 28 last quarter. The fourth quarter has historically been the seasonally strongest quarter for system sales in Europe. Five of the systems sold in the first quarter were the Japanese customers. However, the tsunami and follow on issues are expected to curtail sales in Japan for the foreseeable future.  Aleks will provide some additional details of overseas system sales.
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter was 72% compared with the first quarter 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with fourth quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The decreased compared to prior periods primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. 
First quarter 2011 operating expenses of $131 million were up 18% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 2% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during quarter. We added 69 employees during the quarter, including 48 employees in our commercial operations organization and 18 employees in product operation.
First quarter 2011 operating income was $148 million or 38% of sales compared with $130 million or 39% of sales for the first quarter of 2010 and $154 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 operating income reflected $32 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $27 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth to noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made in February 15 this year.
Our effective tax rate for the first year -- for the first quarter of 32% were lower than our 2010 rate of 33%. The reduction in rates between years reflects the lower state taxes and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. The first quarter rate was also favorably impacted by the benefit stock option exercise.
Our net income was $104 million from $2.59 per share, compared with $85 million or $2.12 per share for the first quarter of 2011 and $121 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $1,757,000,000, up $148 million compared with December 31, 2010. The increase was driven by $100 million of cash flows from operations plus $60 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $12 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases. 
During the first quarter we bought back 36,000 shares at an average price of $323 per share. As of March 31, there wre $389 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. Our stock buyback program remains active, and we intend to utilize the authorization to offset dilution created by stock options. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $260 million at March 31 from $247 million at December 31, reflecting the timing of receivables and collections. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. Our inventory increased to $93 million at March 31 from $87 million at December 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies have tightened and have build a finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building in Sunnyvale at the end of the second quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the first quarter we sold 120 da Vinci systems, 89 in the United States, 15 in Europe and 16 in the rest of world markets. As part of the 120 system sales, 13 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems and 19 as systems were traded in for Si Systems. We had a net 88 system additions to the installed base during the quarter., which brings to 1,840 accumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide; 1,344 in the U.S., 330 in Europe and 166 in rest of world markets. 51 of the 120 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 110 of the 120 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 15 Dual Console systems. The 31 system sales internationally included five da Vinci systems into Japan, four into Australia and three  into the countries of Germany, France and Turkey. 
Clinically, we had a solid quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Neurology and thoracic showed particularly solid sequential strength. On a year-over-year basis, the categories of thoracic, head and neck, GYN, colorectal and general surgery displayed the strongest growth. 
As we previously discussed, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early year lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q1 2010 procedure trends, malignant dVH showed greater sequential strength than benign dVH during the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, benign dVH is growing at a faster rate than malignant dVH. The overall category of da Vinci GYN surgery grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis. We would expect to see normal dVH cycles resume for the remainder of the year.
Within urology, our dVP business remains strong and particularly so outside of the United States, specifically within Europe. France and Germany are coming up the curb nicely, and Italy remains strong. We described our U.S. dVP business as relatively flat over the past several quarters, however, on a sequential basis, it can fluctuate a bit. And in Q1, it showed sequential strength. Having said that, we believe the greatest opportunity for growth will continue to be fueled from the OUS markets.
At last year's European Association of Urology conference, da Vinci related presentations, abstracts and postgraduate courses dominated the agenda. And the live surgery presentations were projected into standing-room only audiences. And at next month's AUA conference, over 200 da Vinci related abstracts have already been accepted. In addition, 16 AUA postgraduate courses will include da Vinci. dVP growth and urology in general remains strong and certainly a catalyst for many of our OUS placements. 
Regarding Japan, as you can imagine, the catastrophic earthquake and subsequent tsunami have caused significant disruptions to the healthcare system and has placed a tremendous burden on all Japanese government resources. The five da Vinci sales in Japan had occurred prior to these tragic events. We would expect uncertainty within Japan to prevail for some time to come and we will share more as it becomes known.
During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were presented at various conferences and/or within peer review journals. But I'll take a moment to highlight just a few.  In the recent edition of the journal Gynecologic Oncology, Doctors Lynn and Kang et al. published a paper entitled a Comparative Detailed Analysis of the Learning Curve and Surgical Outcome for Robotic Hysterectomy with Lymphadnectomy versus Laparoscopic Hysterectomy with Lymphadnectomy: The Treatment of Endometrial Cancer, a case match control study of the first 122 patients. The goal was to determine the learning curve and surgical outcome for the first 122 robotic hysterectomy with lymphadnectomy patients in comparison to the first 122 patients who underwent the same procedure laparoscopically. The learning curve of the surgical procedure was determined by measuring operative time with respect to chronological order of each patient who had undergone their respective procedure. Number of lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, days of hospitalization and complications of all patients were also analyzed and compared. Data were analyzed by mean age, body mass index, operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node retrieval and complications for both surgical procedures. 
In their results, they reported the mean operated time was approximately 40 minutes shorter for the dVH cohort as compared to the traditional laparoscopic cohort. The mean estimated blood loss was statistically significant at 81 milliliters for da Vinci Hysterectomy compared to 207 milliliters for the laparoscopic approach. The days of hospitalization for the dVH patients was 1.5 days compared to 3.2 daysfor the laparoscopic group. The number of intraoperative complications in the dVH group was one as compared to seven within the lab group. 
The authors concluded by saying, and I quote, ""Robotic hysterectomy with lymphadnectomy has a faster learning curve in comparison to laparoscopic hysterectomy with lymphadnectomy. The adequacy of the surgical staging was comparable between the two surgical methods. Robotic hysterectomy is associated with shorter hospitalization, less blood loss and less intraoperative and major complications and lower rate of conversion to open procedure."" 
The interest in da Vinci from thoracic community is increasing rapidly. In addition to lobectomies, we're seeing interest in thoracic pull-through procedures such as media spinal mass recessions. While the procedure numbers may be relatively small, division value is potentially very high. In a recent edition of the European Journal of Cardiothoracic surgery, a paper out of the University of Antwerp in Belgium authored by Doctors Pedulic and Hendrix et al entitled Quality of Life After Anterior Meida Spinal Mass Reception: A Prospective Study Comparing Open with Robotic Assisted Thorascopic was published. The objective was to a prospective reevaluate quality of life evolution after robotic assisted thorascopic compared to open anterior media spinal tumor. The authors was invalidated European quality of life questionnaire. Quality of life was prospectively recorded in all patients undergoing surgery for media spinal tumors. A total of 36 patients underwent thorascopic recession using either the da Vinci robotic system or a sternotomy-based open recession. Questionnaires were administered before surgery and at one, three, six and 12 months postoperatively, with response rates of 100%, 86%, 94% and 75% respectively. The result was follows. 
Both approaches have comparable we operated patient characteristics and quality of life subskills. Open resection I sternotomy was characterized by a significant decrease in general functioning one month after surgery, both physical and social. Patients also complained of increased thoracic pain in the first three months post-surgery. Following a da Vinci robotic resection, quality of life scores approximated the baseline preoperative scores one month after surgery. In other words, there were no reduction in patient function scores at the first postoperative quality of life measurement.
The authors' conclusion, and I quote, ""Numerous techniques have been published with different degrees of invasiveness, generating the existing controversy as to which is the best surgical approach for anterior media spinal tumors. The high burden of decreased physical functioning reported after sternotomy is not seen after the da Vinci robotic assisted thorascopic resection. The initial experience and postoperative quality of life data are excellent, and therefore, the da Vinci robot will stay our future technique of choice for the treatment of resectable media spinal tumors measuring less than 4 centimeters.""
The patient value of a replacing large economies and/or sternotomies with a small minimally invasive incision is significant. Which is one of the reasons why surgery has become one of our fastest-growing specialties. 
In closing, I'll remind you that the second quarter marks the peak of our busy global conference season, with the AUA, ACAC, double ATS and the American Society of colorectal services taking place, to name a few. We will provide you with the clinical highlights from some of these conferences during next quarter's call. 
That concludes my remarks. So I'll turn the time over the Calvin."
30239,129513268,115712,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alex.

I will be providing you with an update our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates for significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures, our first quarter 2011 procedures grew approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. Based upon our latest projections and consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect our total procedures for 2011 to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year from approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010.
Moving on to revenues, our 2011 total revenue forecast also remains unchanged compared to our previous quarter's estimates. Our Q1 2011 revenues increased 18% compared to Q1 of last year. We continue to expect our full year 2011 revenue to grow approximately 16% to 20% for the year. 
With regard to gross margin, on our last call, we estimated our 2011 gross margin percentage to fall between 72% and 73% of revenue. Our first quarter 2011 gross profit margin of 71.8% was just below this range, as system ASPs and product margins were impacted by higher da Vinci S trade-in volume, a factor that we expect will continue going forward. We now anticipate our full year 2011 gross margin percentage to come in at the lower end of the 72% to 73% range forecast on our last call.
Moving to operating expense, we continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Consistent with our last call, we anticipate growing operating expenses between 16% and 20% in 2011 in line with our top line growth. In terms of noncash expenses, we continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $140 million and $145 million, up from $118 million reported in 2010.  And we continue to expect 2011 amortization of purchased intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million. 
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in at the higher end of the $17 million to $18 million range forecast on our last call.
With regard to income tax driven primarily by lower state income tax estimates, we are now reducing our tax rate forecast to 33% of pretax income from 34% forecast on our last call. We estimate that our diluted share counts for calculating Q2 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.3 million shares. We aim to keep the share count around this level throughout the balance of 2011 which is equal to our 2010 average. 
Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we're forecasting to report over $157 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operation is a better measure of our actual financial performance than net income.
During Q1, we repurchased and retired $12 million of our common stock. Entering Q2, we have $389 million remaining authorized by the board to purchase additional shares. Our repurchase program is active, and we expect an increase to the level of repurchases going forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.op-mac  [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of ill and representing William Blair."

What we probably have a more difficult time assessing on a go-forward basis is what rate existing customers want to upgrade, either their standard system or their S system to the Si System. I don't allow different than the question you asked about the de novo system but as you look at the activity that the sales organization has to go through to trade out a system and trade up or cultivate a new de novo system, it isn't that there is an enormous difference in the time required to get one done versus the other. So as we look at the overall system placement in the United States, it remains important for us to continue to either get our customers into the Si Systems or cultivate new greenfield. I don't know that there's a trend that we can point out that says this is going to continue. I think it'll probably oscillate up and down a bit as we go forward and that's probably the most best visibility we have."

And they build very comprehensive programs. That's very valuable for us both regionally and nationally. And so, I don't want to diminish from that, but at the same time, opening up a new store, if you will, the analogy being same-store sales versus new stores, it is also important. The most important element is driving into those stores and keeping the shelves full with procedures. And so that happens both ways.

As we have said previously while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during this conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. One experience comes from Jen in Ohio who had a da Vinci surgery for individuals is. After several laparoscopies that removed some but not all of the endometriosis, she writes, ""In the meantime, I had lost my job. I had to take pain medications throughout each day and as barely touch my pain. I couldn't drive, cook or clean. Some days I couldn't even drag myself out of bed. I had to rely on my family for everything. I felt absent from my son, my husband and my entire life. Finally a friend contacted me and told me about Dr. Ross Marschetta and how we helped her after years of being misdiagnosed by several doctors. Thank god, she did. We can forgive the da Vinci robotic assisted surgery next window is a perfect candidate. He was the first doctor who was confident he can help me. In June of 2010, I had my da Vinci robotic assisted laparoscopy. Dr. Marschetta was able to remove all of my and deletions both fibroids and fallopian tube and cystic ovary. My ovary was growing into my kidney and it would've remain untreated much longer it could have caused serious damage. Dr.  Marschetta called my case one of the worst had ever treated and said he would call at stage 5 if there was such a stage. He was thrilled with the work he was able to accomplish and explained that he never could have achieved this amazing result without the robot. He called my surgery a miracle. It was  miraculous. He gave me back my life. I weaned off my pain medication. On the Fourth of July my family I attended a friends party to the first one I had all year. I felt like myself again. My pain was  completely gone. I return to my normal everyday life as a mom, wife and writer. On my birthday is delivered by health, by parasailing an activity on my bucket list. People told me this was possible during those previous dark months, I never would've believed them. Dr.  Marschetta and the da Vinci robot saved my life. My family and I will be forever grateful.""Patients like Jen are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and perform the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again  in three months."

30239,129513268,115797,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today.

In this first quarter, our team has executed well, and we have had solid performance in procedures, system sales and the financial results that follow. 
For 2011, we are focused on the following: Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and neurology; expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; crisp execution in our product development efforts; and enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral and colorectal surgery. 
We grew in several specialties and geographies in the quarter. da Vinci Prostatectomy experienced strong growth in the quarter led by continued adoption of dVP in Europe. And gynecology malignant hysterectomy showed continued strength. Benign hysterectomy showed earlier seasonality, particularly in January and February. Emerging procedures continue to experience growth in our early adopting centers, in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal procedures. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.
Turning to operating highlights for the first quarter. Procedures grew 30% over the first quarter of 2010. We sold 120 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 104 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $388 million, up 18% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $157 million, up 28% over Q1 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $221 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. Net income was $104 million, up 22% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $180 million before noncash stock option expense, up 15% over the first quarter of last year and representing 46% of Q1 revenue. 
We ended the quarter with $1,757,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $12 million used in repurchasing stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $60 million from stock proceeds and $53 million used from working capital, we generated $168 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the first quarter.
As we have mentioned on past calls, we are making significant investments in progress in product development. In Q1, we received the CE mark for our Single-Site da Vinci instruments and accessories. We have begun a stage rollout of Single-Site in Europe focused on Single-Site cholecystectomy. Our early clinical and product performance results there have been encouraging. 
In the U.S., the FDA has requested additional clinical data on our Single-Site products. We're in the process of collecting this data in part from our European experience and will provide it to FDA as needed. In the quarter, we received FDA clearance for our da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging System and have likewise begun a staged rollout in the U.S. Whether our initial launch of Single-Site in Europe and Fluorescence Imaging in the U.S., we are focused on an outstanding early customer experience in the development of clinical evidence supporting their use. 
We continue to make progress on both our da Vinci vessel sealing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. Our vessel sealer has been submitted to the FDA and we are working through production readiness for this product. Our stapler is undergoing validation work and engineering refinement. We have not yet submitted the Stapler for clearance.
Lastly, we introduced our da Vinci Surgical Simulator in Q4 of 2010 and shipped our first units and volume in the first quarter. We are working with leading centers on validating simulator tasks and on developing curricular for its use. 
As we enter new surgical markets and drive its new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and then acquiring those technologies that can make a difference through Robotic Surgery. This quarter, we added 69 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,729 employees. 
I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,129513268,115797,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter revenues by product categ",1347,"Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
First quarter revenues by product category were as follows: First quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $157 million, up 28% compared with $123 million for the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. 
Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the first quarter of 2010 by approximately $20 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, the reduction reflects the lower impact of stocking orders over a larger base of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter, we had lower stocking orders which were offset by increased orders associated with customer buying patterns. We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. 
First quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $167 million increased 8% compared with $155 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2010, and decreased 6% compared with $178 million of Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2010, we began delivering new Si Systems for customers S Systems versus converting S Systems into Si systems via field upgrade. The contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-in are now more closely reflective of Si sales as a result of the change. Accordingly, we began reporting S to Si trade-ins as system sales. Inclusive of 19 S to Si trade-ins, we sold 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. This compares to 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010 and 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. I would note that the first quarter of 2010 system count excluded 9 S to Si upgrade that were treated as upgrade revenue, and the fourth quarter of 2010 system count included 10 S to Si trade-ins. 
Upgrade revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was approximately $2 million compared to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.38 million, a decrease from the $1.45 million realized in the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter. The decrease in average sales price compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects in approximately $1.3 million of revenue associated with simulators that was deferred as the simulators were delivered after the end of the quarter, an increase in the number of S to Si trade-ins for which we offer customer discounts for the return to S product and discounts offered in multi-system purchases. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects those factors outlined for the sequential-quarter comparison, combined with the positive product and geographical mix in the first quarter of 2010.
Service revenue increased to $64 million, up 26% compared with $51 million last year and up 5% compared with $61 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base. 
Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessories and Service revenue, increased to $221 million, up 28% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total first quarter revenue compared with 53% in the first quarter last year and 54% last quarter. 
International results were as follows: Outside the U.S., procedures grew 38% on a year-to-year basis, with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we experienced growth in our other target procedures including dVH in Europe. First quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $91 million, up 32% compared with revenue of $69 million in the first quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Instrument and accessory revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. We sold 31 systems outside the U.S. compared with 24 in the first quarter of 2010 to 38 last quarter. We sold 15 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 11 in the first quarter of 2010 and 28 last quarter. The fourth quarter has historically been the seasonally strongest quarter for system sales in Europe. Five of the systems sold in the first quarter were to Japanese customers. However, the tsunami and follow-on issues are expected to curtail sales in Japan for the foreseeable future. Aleks will provide these additional details of overseas system sales.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter was 72% compared with the first quarter 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with fourth quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The decreases compared to prior periods primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. 
First quarter 2011 operating expenses of $131 million were up 18% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 2% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter. We added 69 employees during the quarter, including 48 employees in our commercial operations organization and 18 employees in product operation.
First quarter 2011 operating income was $148 million or 38% of sales compared with $130 million or 39% of sales for the first quarter of 2010 and $154 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 operating income reflected $32 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $27 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth to noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of this year.
Our effective tax rate for the first year -- for the first quarter of 32% were lower than our 2010 rate of 33%. The reduction in rates between years reflects the lower state taxes and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. The first quarter rate was also favorably impacted by the benefit stock option exercise.
Our net income was $104 million or from $2.59 per share, compared with $85 million or $2.12 per share for the first quarter of 2011 and $121 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $1,757,000,000, up $148 million compared with December 31, 2010. The increase was driven by $100 million of cash flows from operations plus $60 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $12 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases. During the first quarter we bought back 36,000 shares at an average price of $323 per share. As of March 31, there were $389 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. Our stock buyback program remains active, and we intend to utilize the authorization to offset dilution created by stock options. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $260 million at March 31 from $247 million at December 31, reflecting the timing of receivables and collections. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. 
Our inventory increased to $93 million at March 31 from $87 million at December 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies have tightened and have build a finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building in Sunnyvale at the end of the second quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the first quarter, we sold 120 da Vinci Systems, 89 in the United States, 15 in Europe and 16 in rest of the world markets. As part of the 120 system sales, 13 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems and 19 S systems were traded in for Si Systems. We had a net 88 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,840, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 1,344 in the U.S., 330 in Europe and 166 in rest of world markets. 51 of the 120 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 110 of the 120 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 15 dual console systems. The 31 system sales internationally included 5 da Vinci systems into Japan, 4 into Australia and 3 into the countries of Germany, France and Turkey. 
Clinically, we had a solid quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Neurology and thoracic showed particularly solid sequential strength. On a year-over-year basis, the categories of thoracic, head and neck, GYN, colorectal and general surgery displayed the strongest growth. 
As we previously discussed, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early year lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q1 2010 procedure trends, malignant dVH showed greater sequential strength than benign dVH during the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, benign dVH is growing at a faster rate than malignant dVH. The overall category of da Vinci GYN surgery grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis. We would expect to see normal dVH cycles resume for the remainder of the year.
Within urology, our dVP business remains strong and particularly so outside the United States, specifically within Europe. France and Germany are coming up the curb nicely, and Italy remains strong. We described our U.S. dVP business as relatively flat over the past several quarters. However, on a sequential basis, it can fluctuate a bit, and in Q1, it showed sequential strength. Having said that, we believe the greatest opportunity for growth will continue to be fueled from the OUS markets.
At last year's European Association of Urology Conference, da Vinci related presentations, abstracts and postgraduate courses dominated the agenda, and the live surgery presentations were projected into standing-room only audiences. And at next month's AUA Conference, over 200 da Vinci-related abstracts have already been accepted. In addition, 16 AUA postgraduate courses will include da Vinci. dVP growth and urology in general remains strong and certainly a catalyst for many of our OUS system placements. 
Regarding Japan, as you can imagine, the catastrophic earthquake and subsequent tsunami have caused significant disruptions to the healthcare system and has placed a tremendous burden on all Japanese government resources. The five da Vinci sales in Japan had occurred prior to these tragic events. We would expect uncertainty within Japan to prevail for some time to come and we will share more as it becomes known.
During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were presented at various conferences and/or within peer review journals. But I'll take a moment to highlight just a few. In the recent edition of the journal Gynecologic Oncology, Doctors Lim and Kang et al, published a paper entitled a Comparative Detailed Analysis of the Learning Curve and Surgical Outcome for Robotic Hysterectomy with Lymphadenectomy versus Laparoscopic Hysterectomy with Lymphadenectomy in Treatment of Endometrial Cancer: A Case-Matched Controlled Study of the first 122 Patients. The goal was to determine the learning curve and surgical outcome for the first 122 robotic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy patients in comparison to the first 122 patients who underwent the same procedure laparoscopically. The learning curve of the surgical procedure was determined by measuring operative time with respect to chronological order of each patient who had undergone their respective procedure. Number of lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, days of hospitalization and complications of all patients were also analyzed and compared. Data were analyzed by mean age, body mass index, operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node retrieval and complications for both surgical procedures. 
In their results, they reported the mean operated time was approximately 40 minutes shorter for the dVH cohort as compared to the traditional laparoscopic cohort. The mean estimated blood loss was statistically significant at 81 milliliters for da Vinci hysterectomy compared to 207 milliliters for the laparoscopic approach. The days of hospitalization for the dVH patients was 1.5 days compared to 3.2 days for the laparoscopic group. The number of intraoperative complications in the dVH group was 1 as compared to 7 within the lap group. 
The authors concluded by saying, and I quote, ""Robotic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy has a faster learning curve in comparison to laparoscopic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy. The adequacy of the surgical staging was comparable between the two surgical methods. Robotic hysterectomy is associated with shorter hospitalization, less blood loss and less intraoperative and major complications, and lower rate of conversion to open procedure."" 
The interest in da Vinci from the thoracic community is increasing rapidly. In addition to lobectomies, we're seeing interest in thoracic pull-through procedures such as mediastinal mass resections. While the procedure numbers may be relatively small, the patient value is potentially very high. In a recent edition of the European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, a paper out of the University of Antwerp in Belgium authored by Doctors Balduyck and Hendriks et al entitled, Quality of Life After Anterior Mediastinal Mass Resection: A Prospective Study Comparing Open with Robotic-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection, was published. The objective was to prospectively evaluate quality of life evolution after robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection as compared to open anterior mediastinal tumor resection. The authors used a validated European quality of life questionnaire. Quality of life was prospectively recorded in all patients undergoing surgery for mediastinal tumors. A total of 36 patients underwent thoracoscopic resection using either the da Vinci robotic system or a sternotomy-based open resection. Questionnaires were administered before surgery and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, postoperatively, with response rates of 100%, 86%, 94% and 75% respectively. 
The results were as follows: Both approaches had comparable preoperative patient characteristics and quality of life subscales. Open resection by sternotomy was characterized by a significant decrease in general functioning one month after surgery, both physical and social. Patients also complained of increased thoracic pain in the first three months post-surgery. Following a da Vinci robotic resection, quality of life scores approximated the baseline preoperative scores 1 month after surgery. In other words, there were no reduction in patient function scores at the first postoperative quality of life measurement.
The authors' conclusion, and I quote, ""Numerous techniques have been published with different degrees of invasiveness, generating the existing controversy as to which is the best surgical approach for anterior mediastinal tumors. The high burden of decreased physical functioning reported after sternotomy is not seen after the da Vinci robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection. The initial experience and postoperative quality of life data are excellent and, therefore, the da Vinci robot will stay our future technique of choice for the treatment of resectable mediastinal tumors measuring less than 4 centimeters."" The patient value of a replacing large thoracotomies and/or sternotomies with a small, minimally invasive incision is significant, which is one of the reasons why thoracic surgery has become one of our fastest-growing specialties. 
In closing, I'll remind you that the second quarter marks the peak of our busy global conference season, with the AUA, ACOG, AATS and the American Society of colon and Rectal Surgery Conference is taking place, to name a few. We will provide you with the clinical highlights from some of these conferences during next quarter's call. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn the time over the Calvin."
30239,129513268,115797,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alex.

I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates for significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. Our first quarter 2011 procedures grew approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. Based upon our latest projections and consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect our total procedures for 2011 to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year from approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010.
Moving on to revenues. Our 2011 total revenue forecast also remains unchanged compared to our previous quarter's estimates. Our Q1 2011 revenues increased 18% compared to Q1 of last year. We continue to expect our full year 2011 revenue to grow approximately 16% to 20% for the year. 
With regard to gross margin. On our last call, we estimated our 2011 gross margin percentage to fall between 72% and 73% of revenue. Our first quarter 2011 gross profit margin of 71.8% was just below this range as system ASPs and product margins were impacted by higher da Vinci S trade-in volume, a factor that we expect to continue going forward. We now anticipate our full year 2011 gross margin percentage to come in at the lower end of the 72% to 73% range forecast on our last call.
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Consistent with our last call, we anticipate growing operating expenses between 16% and 20% in 2011 in line with our top line growth. In terms of noncash expenses, we continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $140 million and $145 million, up from $118 million reported in 2010.  And we continue to expect 2011 amortization of purchased intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in at the higher end of the $17 million to $18 million range forecast on our last call.
With regard to income tax driven primarily by lower state income tax estimates, we are now reducing our tax rate forecast to 33% of pretax income from 34% forecast on our last call. We estimate that our diluted share counts for calculating Q2 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.3 million shares. We aim to keep the share count around this level throughout the balance of 2011 which is equal to our 2010 average. 
Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since we're forecasting to report over $157 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operation is a better measure of our actual financial performance than net income.
During Q1, we repurchased and retired $12 million of our common stock. Entering Q2, we have $389 million remaining authorized by the board to purchase additional shares. Our repurchase program is active, and we expect to increase our level of repurchases going forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

So the flow of systems into the United States remains very strong. What we probably have a more difficult time assessing on a go-forward basis is that what rate existing customers want to upgrade, either their Standard system or their S System to the Si System. I know it's a little different than the question you asked about the de novo system, but as you look at the activity that the sales organization has to go through to trade out a system and trade up or cultivate a new de novo system, it isn't that there is an enormous difference in the time required to get one done versus the other. So as we look at the overall system placement in the United States, it remains important for us to continue to either get our customers into the Si Systems or cultivate new greenfield. I don't know that there's a trend that we can point out that says this is going to continue. I think it'll probably oscillate up and down a bit as we go forward, and that's probably the most -- the best visibility we have."

That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during this conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
One experience comes from Jenn in Ohio who had a da Vinci surgery for endometriosis. After several laparoscopies that removed some but not all of the endometriosis, she writes, ""In the meantime, I had lost my job. I had to take pain medications throughout each day and it just barely touch my pain. I couldn't drive, cook or clean. Some days I couldn't even drag myself out of bed. I had to rely on my family for everything. I felt absent from my son, my husband and my entire life. Finally, a friend contacted me and told me about Dr. Ross Marchetta and how we helped her after years of being misdiagnosed by several doctors. Thank God she did. He informed me of da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery and explained that I was a perfect candidate. He was the first doctor who was confident he could help me. In June of 2010, I had my da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopy. Using the robot, Dr. Marchetta was able to remove all of my endo lesions, both fibroids and fallopian tube and cystic ovary. My ovary was growing into my kidney, and if it would've remain untreated much longer, it could have caused serious damage. Dr. Marchetta called my case one of the worst he had ever treated and said he would call it Stage V, if there was such a stage. He was thrilled with the work he was able to accomplish and explained that he never could have achieved this amazing result without the robot. He called my surgery a miracle. It was miraculous. He gave me back my life. I weaned off my pain medication. On the 4th of July, my family and I attended a friend's party, the first fun I had, had all year. I felt like myself again. My pain was completely gone. I return to my normal everyday life as a mom, wife and writer. On my birthday, I celebrated my life by parasailing, an activity on my bucket list. If people had told me this was possible during those previous dark months, I never would've believed them. Dr. Marchetta and the da Vinci robot saved my life. My family and I will be forever grateful."" 
Patients like Jenn are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."

30239,129513268,115799,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today.

In this first quarter, our team has executed well, and we have had solid performance in procedures, system sales and the financial results that follow. 
For 2011, we are focused on the following: Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and neurology; expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; crisp execution in our product development efforts; and enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral and colorectal surgery. 
We grew in several specialties and geographies in the quarter. da Vinci Prostatectomy experienced strong growth in the quarter led by continued adoption of dVP in Europe. And gynecology malignant hysterectomy showed continued strength. Benign hysterectomy showed early year seasonality, particularly in January and February. Emerging procedures continue to experience growth in our early adopting centers, in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal procedures. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.
Turning to operating highlights for the first quarter. Procedures grew 30% over the first quarter of 2010. We sold 120 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 104 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $388 million, up 18% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $157 million, up 28% over Q1 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $221 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. Net income was $104 million, up 22% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $180 million before noncash stock option expense, up 15% over the first quarter of last year and representing 46% of Q1 revenue. 
We ended the quarter with $1,757,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $12 million used in repurchasing stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $60 million from stock proceeds and $53 million used from working capital, we generated $168 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the first quarter.
As we have mentioned on past calls, we are making significant investments in progress in product development. In Q1, we received the CE mark for our Single-Site da Vinci instruments and accessories. We have begun a stage rollout of Single-Site in Europe focused on Single-Site cholecystectomy. Our early clinical and product performance results there have been encouraging. 
In the U.S., the FDA has requested additional clinical data on our Single-Site products. We're in the process of collecting this data in part from our European experience and will provide it to FDA as needed. In the quarter, we received FDA clearance for our da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging System and have likewise begun a staged rollout in the U.S. Whether our initial launch of Single-Site in Europe and Fluorescence Imaging in the U.S., we are focused on an outstanding early customer experience in the development of clinical evidence supporting their use. 
We continue to make progress on both our da Vinci vessel sealing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. Our vessel sealer has been submitted to the FDA and we are working through production readiness for this product. Our stapler is undergoing validation work and engineering refinement. We have not yet submitted the stapler for clearance.
Lastly, we introduced our da Vinci Surgical Simulator in Q4 of 2010 and shipped our first units and volume in the first quarter. We are working with leading centers on validating simulator tasks and on developing curricular for its use. 
As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and then acquiring those technologies that can make a difference through Robotic Surgery. This quarter, we added 69 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,729 employees. 
I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,129513268,115799,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter revenues by product categ",1347,"Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
First quarter revenues by product category were as follows: First quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $157 million, up 28% compared with $123 million for the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. 
Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the first quarter of 2010 by approximately $20 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, the reduction reflects the lower impact of stocking orders over a larger base of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter, we had lower stocking orders which were offset by increased orders associated with customer buying patterns. We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. 
First quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $167 million increased 8% compared with $155 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2010, and decreased 6% compared with $178 million of Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2010, we began delivering new Si Systems for customers S Systems versus converting S Systems into Si systems via field upgrade. The contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-ins are now more closely reflective of Si sales as a result of the change. Accordingly, we began reporting S to Si trade-ins as system sales. Inclusive of 19 S to Si trade-ins, we sold 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. This compares to 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010 and 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. I would note that the first quarter of 2010 system count excluded 9 S to Si upgrade that were treated as upgrade revenue, and the fourth quarter of 2010 system count included 10 S to Si trade-ins. 
Upgrade revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was approximately $2 million compared to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.38 million, a decrease from the $1.45 million realized in the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter. The decrease in average sales price compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects in approximately $1.3 million of revenue associated with simulators that was deferred as the simulators were delivered after the end of the quarter, an increase in the number of S to Si trade-ins for which we offer customer discounts for the return to S product and discounts offered in multi-system purchases. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects those factors outlined for the sequential-quarter comparison, combined with the positive product and geographical mix in the first quarter of 2010.
Service revenue increased to $64 million, up 26% compared with $51 million last year and up 5% compared with $61 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base. 
Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessories and Service revenue, increased to $221 million, up 28% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total first quarter revenue compared with 53% in the first quarter last year and 54% last quarter. 
International results were as follows: Outside the U.S., procedures grew 38% on a year-to-year basis, with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we experienced growth in our other target procedures including dVH in Europe. First quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $91 million, up 32% compared with revenue of $69 million in the first quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Instrument and accessory revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. We sold 31 systems outside the U.S. compared with 24 in the first quarter of 2010 to 38 last quarter. We sold 15 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 11 in the first quarter of 2010 and 28 last quarter. The fourth quarter has historically been the seasonally strongest quarter for system sales in Europe. Five of the systems sold in the first quarter were to Japanese customers. However, the tsunami and follow-on issues are expected to curtail sales in Japan for the foreseeable future. Aleks will provide these additional details of overseas system sales.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter was 72% compared with the first quarter 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with fourth quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The decreases compared to prior periods primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. 
First quarter 2011 operating expenses of $131 million were up 18% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 2% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter. We added 69 employees during the quarter, including 48 employees in our commercial operations organization and 18 employees in product operation.
First quarter 2011 operating income was $148 million or 38% of sales compared with $130 million or 39% of sales for the first quarter of 2010 and $154 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 operating income reflected $32 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $27 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth to noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year.
Our effective tax rate for the first year -- for the first quarter of 32% was lower than our 2010 rate of 33%. The reduction in rates between years reflects lower state taxes and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. The first quarter rate was also favorably impacted by the benefit of stock option exercise.
Our net income was $104 million or from $2.59 per share, compared with $85 million or $2.12 per share for the first quarter of 2011 and $121 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $1,757,000,000, up $148 million compared with December 31, 2010. The increase was driven by $100 million of cash flows from operations plus $60 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $12 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases. During the first quarter we bought back 36,000 shares at an average price of $323 per share. As of March 31, there were $389 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. Our stock buyback program remains active, and we intend to utilize the authorization to offset dilution created by stock options. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $260 million at March 31 from $247 million at December 31, reflecting the timing of receivables and collections. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. 
Our inventory increased to $93 million at March 31 from $87 million at December 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies have tightened and have build up finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building in Sunnyvale at the end of the second quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the first quarter, we sold 120 da Vinci Systems, 89 in the United States, 15 in Europe and 16 in rest of the world markets. As part of the 120 system sales, 13 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems and 19 S systems were traded in for Si Systems. We had a net 88 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,840, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 1,344 in the U.S., 330 in Europe and 166 in rest of world markets. 51 of the 120 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 110 of the 120 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 15 dual console systems. The 31 system sales internationally included five da Vinci systems into Japan, four into Australia and three into the countries of Germany, France and Turkey. 
Clinically, we had a solid quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Neurology and thoracic showed particularly solid sequential strength. On a year-over-year basis, the categories of thoracic, head and neck, GYN, colorectal and general surgery displayed the strongest growth. 
As we previously discussed, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early year lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q1 2010 procedure trends, malignant dVH showed greater sequential strength than benign dVH during the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, benign dVH is growing at a faster rate than malignant dVH. The overall category of da Vinci GYN surgery grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis. We would expect to see normal dVH cycles resume for the remainder of the year.
Within urology, our dVP business remains strong and particularly so outside the United States, specifically within Europe. France and Germany are coming up the curb nicely, and Italy remains strong. We described our U.S. dVP business as relatively flat over the past several quarters. However, on a sequential basis, it can fluctuate a bit, and in Q1, it showed sequential strength. Having said that, we believe the greatest opportunity for growth will continue to be fueled from the OUS markets.
At last year's European Association of Urology Conference, da Vinci related presentations, abstracts and postgraduate courses dominated the agenda, and the live surgery presentations were projected into standing-room only audiences. And at next month's AUA Conference, over 200 da Vinci-related abstracts have already been accepted. In addition, 16 AUA postgraduate courses will include da Vinci. dVP growth and urology in general remains strong and is certainly a catalyst for many of our OUS system placements. 
Regarding Japan, as you can imagine, the catastrophic earthquake and subsequent tsunami have caused significant disruptions to the healthcare system and has placed a tremendous burden on all Japanese government resources. The five da Vinci sales in Japan had occurred prior to these tragic events. We would expect uncertainty within Japan to prevail for some time to come and we will share more as it becomes known.
During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were presented at various conferences and/or within peer review journals. But I'll take a moment to highlight just a few. In the recent edition of the journal Gynecologic Oncology, Doctors Lim and Kang et al, published a paper entitled a Comparative Detailed Analysis of the Learning Curve and Surgical Outcome for Robotic Hysterectomy with Lymphadenectomy versus Laparoscopic Hysterectomy with Lymphadenectomy in Treatment of Endometrial Cancer: A Case-Matched Controlled Study of the first 122 Patients. The goal was to determine the learning curve and surgical outcome for the first 122 robotic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy patients in comparison to the first 122 patients who underwent the same procedure laparoscopically. The learning curve of the surgical procedure was determined by measuring operative time with respect to chronological order of each patient who had undergone their respective procedure. Number of lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, days of hospitalization and complications of all patients were also analyzed and compared. Data were analyzed by mean age, body mass index, operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node retrieval and complications for both surgical procedures. 
In their results, they reported the mean operated time was approximately 40 minutes shorter for the dVH cohort as compared to the traditional laparoscopic cohort. The mean estimated blood loss was statistically significant at 81 milliliters for da Vinci hysterectomy compared to 207 milliliters for the laparoscopic approach. The days of hospitalization for the dVH patients was 1.5 days compared to 3.2 days for the laparoscopic group. The number of intraoperative complications in the dVH group was one as compared to seven within the lap group. 
The authors concluded by saying, and I quote, ""Robotic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy has a faster learning curve in comparison to laparoscopic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy. The adequacy of the surgical staging was comparable between the two surgical methods. Robotic hysterectomy is associated with shorter hospitalization, less blood loss and less intraoperative and major complications, and lower rate of conversion to open procedure."" 
The interest in da Vinci from the thoracic community is increasing rapidly. In addition to lobectomies, we're seeing interest in thoracic pull-through procedures such as mediastinal mass resections. While the procedure numbers may be relatively small, the patient value is potentially very high. In a recent edition of the European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, a paper out of the University of Antwerp in Belgium authored by Doctors Balduyck and Hendriks et al entitled, Quality of Life After Anterior Mediastinal Mass Resection: A Prospective Study Comparing Open with Robotic-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection, was published. The objective was to prospectively evaluate quality of life evolution after robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection as compared to open anterior mediastinal tumor resection. The authors used a validated European quality of life questionnaire. Quality of life was prospect of all patients undergoing surgery for mediastinal tumors. A total of 36 patients underwent thoracoscopic resection using either the da Vinci robotic system or a sternotomy-based open resection. Questionnaires were administered before surgery and at one, three, six and 12 months, postoperatively, with response rates of 100%, 86%, 94% and 75% respectively. 
The results were as follows: Both approaches had comparable preoperative patient characteristics and quality of life subscales. Open resection by sternotomy was characterized by a significant decrease in general functioning one month after surgery, both physical and social. Patients also complained of increased thoracic pain in the first three months post-surgery. Following a da Vinci robotic resection, quality of life scores approximated the baseline preoperative scores one month after surgery. In other words, there were no reduction in patient function scores at the first postoperative quality of life measurement.
The authors' conclusion, and I quote, ""Numerous techniques have been published with different degrees of invasiveness, generating the existing controversy as to which is the best surgical approach for anterior mediastinal tumors. The high burden of decreased physical functioning reported after sternotomy is not seen after the da Vinci robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection. The initial experience and postoperative quality of life data are excellent and, therefore, the da Vinci robot will stay our future technique of choice for the treatment of resectable mediastinal tumors measuring less than 4 centimeters."" The patient value of replacing large thoracotomies and/or sternotomies with a small, minimally invasive incision is significant, which is one of the reasons why thoracic surgery has become one of our fastest-growing specialties. 
In closing, I'll remind you that the second quarter marks the peak of our busy global conference season, with the AUA, ACOG, AATS and the American Society of Colorectal Surgery Conference is taking place, to name a few. We will provide you with the clinical highlights from some of these conferences during next quarter's call. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn the time over the Calvin."

I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates for significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. Our first quarter 2011 procedures grew approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. Based upon our latest projections and consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect our total procedures for 2011 to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year from approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010.
Moving on to revenues. Our 2011 total revenue forecast also remains unchanged compared to our previous quarter's estimates. Our Q1 2011 revenues increased 18% compared to Q1 of last year. We continue to expect our full year 2011 revenue to grow approximately 16% to 20% for the year. 
With regard to gross margin. On our last call, we estimated our 2011 gross margin percentage to fall between 72% and 73% of revenue. Our first quarter 2011 gross profit margin of 71.8% was just below this range as system ASPs and product margins were impacted by higher da Vinci S trade-in volume, a factor that we expect to continue going forward. We now anticipate our full year 2011 gross margin percentage to come in at the lower end of the 72% to 73% range forecast on our last call.
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Consistent with our last call, we anticipate growing operating expenses between 16% and 20% in 2011 in line with our top line growth. In terms of noncash expenses, we continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $140 million and $145 million, up from $118 million reported in 2010.  And we continue to expect 2011 amortization of purchased intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in at the higher end of the $17 million to $18 million range forecast on our last call.
With regard to income tax driven primarily by lower state income tax estimates, we are now reducing our tax rate forecast to 33% of pretax income from 34% forecast on our last call. We estimate that our diluted share counts for calculating Q2 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.3 million shares. We aim to keep the share count around this level throughout the balance of 2011 which is equal to our 2010 average. 
Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since we're forecasting to report over $157 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operation is a better measure of our actual financial performance than net income.
During Q1, we repurchased and retired $12 million of our common stock. Entering Q2, we have $389 million remaining authorized by the board to purchase additional shares. Our repurchase program is active, and we expect to increase our level of repurchases going forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

What we probably have a more difficult time assessing on a go-forward basis is at what rate existing customers want to upgrade, either their Standard system or their S System to the Si System. I know it's a little different than the question you asked about the de novo system, but as you look at the activity that the sales organization has to go through to trade out a system and trade up or cultivate a new de novo system, it isn't that there is an enormous difference in the time required to get one done versus the other. So as we look at the overall system placement in the United States, it remains important for us to continue to either get our customers into the Si Systems or cultivate new green field. I don't know that there's a trend that we can point out that says this is going to continue. I think it'll probably oscillate up and down a bit as we go forward, and that's probably the most -- the best visibility we have."

The same is true with the S. I can't out point at one event-driven activity that has caused an uptick from 10 to 19.

So that's the biggest factor, I think. We talked a little bit about the Simulator, too. And the Simulator, it's being bundled in with a lot of these sales in the quarter, and there's some cost that goes at the Simulator and at the same time, the ASP was steady to down. So the scenario we've set all along that we're going to be investing in our business in areas where we think we can grow procedures and drive adoption of robotic surgery, and I think the Simulator is one of those areas of investment that they kind of see on the gross margin line."

That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
One experience comes from Jenn in Ohio who had a da Vinci surgery for endometriosis. After several laparoscopies that removed some but not all of the endometriosis, she writes, ""In the meantime, I had lost my job. I had to take pain medications throughout each day and it just barely touched my pain. I couldn't drive, cook or clean. Some days I couldn't even drag myself out of bed. I had to rely on my family for everything. I felt absent from my son, my husband and my entire life. Finally, a friend contacted me and told me about Dr. Ross Marchetta and how he helped her after years of being misdiagnosed by several doctors. Thank God she did. He informed me of the da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery and explained that I was a perfect candidate. He was the first doctor who was confident he could help me. In June of 2010, I had my da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopy. Using the robot, Dr. Marchetta was able to remove all of my endo lesions, both fibroids and my fallopian tube and cystic ovary. My ovary was growing into my kidney, and if it would've remained untreated much longer, it could have caused serious damage. Dr. Marchetta called my case one of the worst he had ever treated and said he would call it Stage V, if there was such a stage. He was thrilled with the work he was able to accomplish and explained that he never could have achieved this amazing result without the robot. He called my surgery a miracle. It was miraculous. He gave me back my life. I weaned off my pain medication. On the 4th of July, my family and I attended a friend's party, the first fun I had, had all year. I felt like myself again. My pain was completely gone. I returned to my normal everyday life as a mom, wife and writer. On my birthday, I celebrated my health by parasailing, an activity on my bucket list. If people had told me this was possible during those previous dark months, I never would've believed them. Dr. Marchetta and the da Vinci robot saved my life. My family and I will be forever grateful."" 
Patients like Jenn are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months."

We are pleased with our growth in da Vinci procedures and with customer response to our recently released products in the second quarter. Our team has executed well in our 4 areas of focus for 2011, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology globally. Second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia. Third, crisp execution in our product development efforts. And finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery. 
Turning to procedures. Total procedures grew 30% over Q2 2010. And da Vinci Hysterectomy followed its seasonal pattern posting solid growth in hysterectomy for both malignant and benign conditions. 
In urology, da Vinci prostatectomy continued to grow primarily through growth in Europe as expected. Whole through procedures mainly partial nephrectomy, endometrial resection and sacrocolpopexy grew nicely in the quarter. Emerging procedures in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery have also showed strength, with clinical publications emerging from early adopting centers. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary during the call. 
Turning to operating highlights for the second quarter. Procedures grew approximately 30% over the second quarter of 2010. We sold 129 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 108 during the second quarter of last year, and 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers. 
Total revenue was $426 million, up 21% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $172 million, up 35% over Q2 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $239 million, up 31% from prior year and comprising 56% of total revenue. Net income was $117 million, up 32% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $203 million before noncash stock option expense, up 19% from second quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q2 revenue.
We ended the quarter with $1,822,000,000 in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $39 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $139 million used in the repurchasing of stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $32 million from stock proceeds and $41 million provided by working capital, we generated $170 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income for the second quarter.
Turning to products, we launched 3 new instruments in the U.S. this quarter. The thoracic grasper, and a bipolar dissector. We also received the CE mark for our fourth product, our section irrigation instrument and we have begun its rollout in Europe. 
We have submitted our 510(k) for the sectionary instrument and are working through the approval process with FDA. New instruments allow for faster and more precise da Vinci procedures and these new additions to our instrument line are targeted at facilitating our emerging procedures in thoracic and general surgery. 
As we mentioned last quarter, the FDA has requested additional clinical data for our Single-Site product. We have collected this clinical data from both U.S. and European sites and that while we submit our Single-Site 510(k) to FDA this month. Clinical results from Single-Site use in Europe are encouraging and our phase roll out is progressing. With Single-Site running at approximately 10 sites. 
We continue to make good progress on both our da Vinci vessels healing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. We are in the process of answering FDA questions on our vessels healing instrument while progressing through its manufacturing bring up. Our stapler is developing on plan, and we are working through its validation. 
Moving to recently released products. Our da Vinci Simulator has been well received by our customers. After, Bill Console, the simulator is the second step in a set of products aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of da Vinci training. 
The simulator has fit well with both dual console and single console Si customers and it's providing surgeons with improved, ease of access and support in learning da Vinci surgery. 
Several studies evaluating phase, content and construct validity of the simulator are in process and the initial response from surgeons, trainors in our field has been enthusiastic. Our phase rollout of imaging is progressing to plan with its initial use building in partial nephrectomy procedures. Lastly, we're investing in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 40 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D. Bringing our total team to 1,769 employees. I'll now pass the time to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our second quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% compared with $351 million for the second quarter of 2010 and up 10% compared with $388 million reported for the first quarter of 2011. Second quarter revenues per product category wer",1436,"Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% compared with $351 million for the second quarter of 2010 and up 10% compared with $388 million reported for the first quarter of 2011. 
Second quarter revenues per product category were as follows. Second quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $172 million, up 35% compared with $128 million for the second quarter of 2010 and up 9% compared with $157 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,870 realized in the second quarter of 2010 and approximately the same at the first quarter of 2011. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, the increase primarily reflects increased stocking orders associated with increased system sales.
We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on our learned installed base. 
Second quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $187 million increased 11% compared with $168 million of Systems revenue for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 12% compared with $167 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2011.
We sold 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011 compared with 108 systems in the second quarter of 2010 and 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter 2011 system count included 36 trade-ins, of which 21 were as for Si trade-off. In the first quarter of 2011 included 32 trade-ins, of which 19 were as for Si trade off. The second quarter 2010 system count included 19 trade-ins but excluded 10 S Si upgrade that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field.
Upgrade revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was approximately $800,000 compared with $7.6 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2011. Prior year upgrade around new included the 10 S Si upgrade. 
Our second quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.44 million, a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter of 2010 and an increase compared with the $1.38 million realized in the first quarter. The increase in average sales price compared with the first quarter of 2011 reflects increased simulator revenue and a favorable mix of systems and customers. 
We recognized revenue for 115 simulators in the quarter, including 33 that were sold in the first quarter in conjunction with system sales but were not delivered until the second quarter. In total, we've sold 162 simulators in the first 6 months. Included in the mix of systems sold in the second quarter were 21 dual console systems compared with 15 in the first quarter. 
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with prior year reflects a favorable product and geographic mix in the second quarter of 2010. Credits associated with the S trade-ins in the current quarter partially offset by simulator revenues. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix. 
Service revenue increased to $68 million, up 22% compared with $55 million last year and up 6% compared with $64 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system install base.
Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument and Accessory and Service revenue increased $239 million, up 31% compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 8% compared with the first quarter of 2011.
Recurring revenue represented 56% of total second quarter revenue compared with 52% in the second quarter last year and 57% last quarter. 
International results were as follows, procedures outside of the U.S. grew 38% on a year-to-date basis with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver. Although we also experience growth in other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe, second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $87 million, up 38% compared with revenue of $63 million in the second quarter of 2010 and down 5% compared with revenue of $91 million in the first quarter of 2011. Instrument and Accessory revenue grew 57% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. The changes in Instrument and Accessory revenue reflect growth in procedures and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. 
We sold 30 systems outside the U.S. compared with 22 in the second quarter of 2010 and 31 last quarter. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 14 in the second quarter of 2010 and 15 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of our overseas system sales. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 72% compared with the second quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with the first quarter 2011 gross margin of 72%. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2010 primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. Second quarter 2011 operating expenses of $139 million were up 18% compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and cost associated with increased revenue.
We added 40 employess during the quarter, including 23 employees in our commercial operations organization and 17 employees in product operation. Second quarter 2011 operating income was $168 million or 39% of sales compared with $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010 and $148 million or 38% of sales for the first quarter of 2011.
Second quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $32 million last quarter. The increases in noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made every 15th of each year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first quarter and lower than the 33% reported for the fiscal year ended September 2010.
Our net income was $117 million or $2.91 per share compared with $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010 and $104 million or $2.59 per share for the first quarter of 2011.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 6 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 6 months of 2011 was $814 million, up 20% compared with $679 million last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 29% and an increase in systems revenue of 9%. Operating income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $316 million, up 17% compared with the $269 million last year.
Operating income included $67 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 6 months of 2011 compared with $57 million in 2010. Net income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $222 million or $5.51 per share compared with $174 million or $4.31 last year. Cash flows from operations for the first 6 months of 2011 was $296 million compared with $291 million last year. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $1,822,000,000, up $65 million compared with March 31, 2011. The increase was driven by $196 million of cash flows from operations plus $32 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $139 million of stock buyback and $39 million of capital and IP purchases.
During the second quarter, we bought back 401,000 shares at an average price of $347 per share. As of June 30, there was 249 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. We also executed on the opportunity to purchase approximately 18 acres of land and buildings for $33 million next our current Sunnyvale campus for possible long-term growth.
Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $250 million at June 30 from $260 million at March 31 reflecting the timing of revenues in collection. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. Our net inventory increased to $100 million at June 30 from $93 million at March 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies are tightened and have build the finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building at Sunnyvale.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the second quarter, we sold 129 da Vinci systems, 99 in the United States, 16 in Europe and 14 in rest of world markets. As part of the 129 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems and 21 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 93 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,933 the cumulative number da Vinci systems worldwide. 1,411 in the United States, 342 in Europe and 180 in rest of world markets. 62 of the 129 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 121 of the 129 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 21 dual console systems. The 30 system sales internationally included 4 da Vinci systems into Japan, 4 into Italy and 3 into both Switzerland and India.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year growth of approximately 30%. Gynecology in the United States was particularly strong while growth within general surgery, urology, thoracic and head neck procedures was solid. As mentioned in the past, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q2 2010 procedure trends, benign dVH growth during the second quarter of 2011 grew solidly faster than malignant dVH. 
In addition to strong dVH adoption, sacrocolpopexy, endometrial resection, myomectomy have been key factors to the U.S. GYN expansion.
In Europe, dVH growth has begun to emerge within malignant procedures, primarily endometrial and cervical cancer resection. In addition, the category of general surgery has shown signs of early adoption. However, most of our EU growth is still being fueled by urology. 
In Asia, urology and general surgery were the strongest categories through the first half of the year. All in all, Q2 procedure growth showed global strength across several key categories. 
Q2 represents our busiest quarter for clinical trade changes and surgical conferences. The volume of clinical data presented procedure technique reviews and live surgery presentations was impressive. AUA represented 200 or so abstracts and 15 postgraduate courses. WRS was packed with live surgery, robotic panels and volume discussions covering all segments of Surgery. Not to mention as SAGES, the American Society of Colorectal Surgery, WATS and ACOG, as well as the various international conferences we participated in. We are confident that the dissemination of peer reviewed clinical data has been a critical factor in the rapid adoption of da Vinci surgery. And the peer reviewed exposure we received at these important venues is immeasurable.
During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were published within various peer reviewed journals representing all of our target specialties, but I'll take a moment to highlight just a few, which I believe represent an important theme. The economic impact of reduced complications and hospitalization and their connection toward improving clinical outcomes. In years past,providers would report on the cost effectiveness of robotic surgery in a fairly simple and consistent manner whereby they consider the purchase price of the capital equipment add to the other operating costs and divided by the number procedures they've completed. Direct cost comparisons were usually made to open a laparoscopic surgery. However, the cost of hospitalization and the cost of complications were often omitted. 
Recent published studies have included broader analysis that includes both direct and indirect hospital costs. In a recent edition of the Journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, a team from Brigham Womens Hospital and Harvard Medical School, comprised of both physician and business professionals, studied and reported on the evolution of the hospitals hysterectomy business in 2006 and compared it to 2009. Specifically, they studied the shift from open and vaginal hysterectomy to laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy that affected their costs. The paper entitled Increasing Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy, the effects on cost and complications evaluated the overall cost associated with 2,133 hysterectomy patients that underwent the procedure in 2006 and 2009. 
This study reported and I quote, ""a change from majority abdominal hysterectomy to minimally invasive hysterectomy was accompanied by a significant increase in procedure related complications without an increase in total main cost.""
Some of the relevant details. In 2006, approximately 65% of the 1,054 hysterectomies performed at Brigham and Women's were performed abominably. In 2009, only 35% out of 1,079 were performed abominably. Lap and robotic approaches comprised 17% of the hysterectomies in 2006, which grew to 46% in 2009. Vaginal hysterectomy remain fairly stable during this period and was typically confined to less complex cases. When evaluating outcomes and costs, the results were quite striking. The deviates cohort was associated with the lowest intraoperative and postoperative complication rates and the lowest estimated blood loss across all cohorts and along with laparoscopy, registered the lowest length of stay data in the group. The differences were considered very significant. When comparing abdominal hysterectomy to give dVH, length of stay was reduced from 3.5 days to 1.4 days, estimated blood loss went from 363 millimeters to 75 milliliters. The most telling was the reported complication rates. The rate of major intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with abdominal hysterectomy question was shown to be approximately 5x greater than with dVH. 
To quote the authors, ""Our data suggest that dedication to the implementation of a minimally invasive technique goals, such as a decreased complications, decreased operative times, decreased conversion rate and decreased estimated blood loss can be realized. The creation of a minimally invasive gynecology service at Brigham and Women's Hospital has benefited not only the trainees and the hospital but first and foremost our patients.""
In the June edition of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a study out of Seattle authored by Dr.s Peiretti, Donovitz and Shaw entitled surgical outcomes in Gynecologic Oncology in the era of surgical robotics and analysis of the first 1,000 cases was published. This study was very comprehensive and reported on multiple factors and clinical outcomes related to the da Vinci cancer surgery. There were, however, 2 comparisons that were central in this paper. First, could the authors increase the complexity of their da Vinci patients without increasing the complication rates? And second, how did their dVH outcomes for endometrial cancer resection compared to open hysterectomy outcomes?
The second objective would consist of a subset analysis of their most recent 377 da Vinci Hysterectomies and Endometrial Resection compared to the most recent endometrial resection, open endometrial resection surgeries. From 2006 to 2009, deviate share at the institution had grown from 9% to 36% of the GYN cancer resections. But further penetration was being governed by their unwillingness to accept higher BMI patients and the risk of increasing their complication rates, a concerned, which was dispelled by their careful analysis.
During the study period, the physicians raised their BMI constraints at 3 intervals beginning at 26 until reaching at an average BMI of just over 30.
within their first interval, within their final interval, they operate on patients with BMIs as high as 70. Interestingly, they discovered that neither their conversion rates nor complication rates increased within these more complex cohorts. In fact, they actually decrease.
The overall conversion rate for the entire 1,000 patient analysis was a mere 2.9% and their overall complication rates was 9.9%. 5.7% for majors and 4.2% for minor complications. 
In the subset analysis of women undergoing endometrial cancer resection, the difference between dVH and open hysterectomy was significant. Major complications associated with open surgery was 20.6% as compared to 6.4% for dVH. In patients with a BMI in excess of 40, major complications from from 43.5% for open to 11.3% for dVH.
Length of hospitalization was reduced from 5.3 days for open to 1.4 days with dVH. Lymphnode yields were approximately 10% higher within the dVH group. Intensive care unit admissions went from 3.8% for open to 0.5% for dVH. 
Mortality rates dropped from 1.5% to 0.27%. Their conclusion and I caught quote, ""Robotic surgery is associated with favorable morbidity and conversion rates in an unselected cohort. Compared to the bottom become a robotic endometrial cancer surgery results in improved outcomes.""
In a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology, a physician group out of Cornell and Presbyterian Hospital, New York City published their study comparing the overall cost associated with open cystectomy, lymph node dissection and diversions to da Vinci Cystectomy with diversions. This prospective study consisted of 186 consecutive patients and included appropriate sensitivity analysis. The authors collected a myriad of cost data both direct and indirect and these costs were carefully analyzed.
Cost data included but was not limited to system and service amortization, disposables, length of stay, complications, surgeon fees and anesthesia cost. In other words, both direct and variable cost were collected and scrutinized. Their study contained 3 approaches to urinary diversion following cystectomy. With the ileal kind of approach being the most commonly performed and the largest subcategory study. Not surprisingly, the others concluded that the greatest contribution to cost variation between the various cohorts were length of stay and complications.
Across the board, the direct cost between the various cohorts was pretty similar plus or minus $1,000 or so. But the difference in variable cost was very significant in da Vinci's favor. In an overall cost basis, comparing open cystectomy with ileal conduit to da Vinci cystectomy with ileal conduit, it was reported that da Vinci Cystectomy saved nearly $5,000 over the open surgical approach. The cost difference between the other 2 diversion techniques was less pronounced, slightly in da Vinci's favor for the continent, cutaneous diversion and slightly in the favor of the open technique for the orthotopic knee bladder approach. The least common numbers.
The authors conclusion and I quote, ""Despite the higher cost of materials, robotic cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open cystectomy for bladder cancers at high-volume tertiary referral center particularly for ileal conduit.""
The reduction in hospitalization, blood loss, complications and overall hospital cost has been a consistent theme throughout Intuitive's short history. They are central component in our pursuit to improve patient value. That concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the panel to Calvin."

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis.

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our forecast for 2011. Our prior estimate for total 2011 procedures was to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year. We now protect procedures to go approximately 27% to 29% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. 
During the second half of this year, we would expect a similar seasonal pattern as we experienced last year in 2010 with Q3 being seasonally weaker and Q4 seasonally stronger. 
Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue forecast. Previously, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow 15% to 20% about 2010. We are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase 19% to 21% for the year. Again, the timing for the remaining quarter should follow last year's seasonal pattern favoring Q4. Remember that in Q3 of 2010, our sequential Instrument and Accessory revenue was roughly flat compared to Q2. And Q3 total revenue was lower than Q2.
Our current forecast for gross margin percentage remains consistent with our last quarter's forecast. We continue to see 2011 gross margins coming in at around 72%. Moving to operating expense. 
We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven by our higher 2011 revenue forecast, we now anticipate operating expenses to grow at the higher end of the 16% to 20% range forecast on our last call. More precisely, we expect operating expenses to grow between 18% and 20% above the 2010 level.
In terms of noncash expenses, we now expect 2011 non cash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million, $5 million less than forecast on previous calls, up from $118 million reported in 2010. We continue to expect total 2011 amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income is expected to come in at between $17 million and $18 million, consistent with our previous estimate. With regard to income tax, we now expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within the range between 32% and 33% of pretax income compared to our previous forecast of approximately 33%.
We estimate that our diluted share count for calculating Q3 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. We aim to keep this share count reasonably close to this level as we expect to offset the impacts of option dilution via stock purchases. Finally, regarding cash flows. Since were forecasting to report over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income.
And with that,, we would like to open the call to your questions."

I think what we have learned over the years is that in procedure adoption, if it really follows a classic adoption curve in a sense that you have early adopters that will put up with some fill factors, that we call it, and then you'll have people that will wait until the procedure gets optimized before they jump in, and there is a lot of evolution that goes in that. I would say through that, it's pretty clear we are in their early adopters phase, and we are growing very nicely through the early adopters phase despite not having perfect optimization of Instruments and Accessories. How far we'll grow in that area? It's difficult to say, but we believe strongly that we are working on the right products. They are developing nicely. And the procedure is growing well through the early adoption phase both in the low rectal, as we talked about in the low -- the low anterior resections and you're starting to see some gravitation up into sigmoid and some of the other areas. So we're pleased at this point."

So it would be lower than our traditional set of da Vinci instrument per procedures side on that side. As far as fluorescence imaging goes, we're still pretty early on that too. The kit is comprised of a couple of endoscopes and some of the dye used in the fluorescent cases. That as you've seen, we've maintained our overall instrument and accessory revenue procedure at about $1,940 over the last 3 quarters and part of that has to do with fluorescence imaging coming on and bolstering the IMA revenue together with the 8.5 millimeters scope.

You'll see tumors that are at the base of tongue, tonsil tumors, and what are really classified as very complex operations. And that's where the majority of the clinical data that's being reported is derived from. As far as sizing, in our view, we look at that market as probably somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 procedures and that's really where we are going to stay for a while. I think that's where we add tremendous value. That's where there's a reconsolidation in that space and it's a fairly small community, and we think we can go very deep into that community.

That was our last question. As we have said previously, while be focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. 
I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. Colorado shares the following experience, ""After learning about my 2-inch tumor on my left kidney, I was very scared and nervous. I have a doctor friend that plays golf in my club and he told me about the da Vinci Systems. I was amazed at what he told me. I looked it up on the web, and after learning the difference between the regular surgery and the da Vinci systems, I felt 100% better. Then I had appointment with Dr. and he explained my condition and the options and I was completely comfortable with thought of surgery. It was my first major surgery and at 83. I was out of the hospital at the third day and doing some household chores by the fifth day. I live alone and have help for 5 days and I was alone after that. I took pain pills for 3 days and had no pain after that. I could have done without any, but I was told to take them. It is now 2 weeks after surgery and I feel like doing anything I do regularly. I will wait for the 6 weeks before playing golf. However, I'll pitch and starting next week. I cannot believe the difference and would like to thank whoever invented this. What a great improvement to surgery. I hope that anyone reading this has a chance of selecting the da Vinci system over the regular surgery. I have talked to someone who had regular surgery in the kidney and our stories are so different like night and day."" 
Patients like these are our strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We've built our company to take surgery Beyond the Limits of the Human Hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months."

We are pleased with our growth in da Vinci procedures and with customer response to our recently released products in the second quarter. Our team has executed well in our 4 areas of focus for 2011, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology globally. Second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia. Third, crisp execution in our product development efforts. And finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery. 
Turning to procedures. Total procedures grew 30% over Q2 of 2010. And da Vinci Hysterectomy followed its seasonal pattern posting solid growth in hysterectomy for both malignant and benign conditions. 
In urology, da Vinci prostatectomy continued to grow, primarily through growth in Europe as expected. Pull-through procedures namely partial nephrectomy, endometrial resection and sacrocolpopexy grew nicely in the quarter. Emerging procedures in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery have also showed strength, with clinical publications emerging from early adopting centers. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. 
Turning to operating highlights for the second quarter. Procedures grew approximately 30% over the second quarter of 2010. We sold 129 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 108 during the second quarter of last year, and 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers. 
Total revenue was $426 million, up 21% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $172 million, up 35% over Q2 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $239 million, up 31% from prior year and comprising 56% of total revenue. Net income was $117 million, up 32% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $203 million before noncash stock option expense, up 19% from the second quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q2 revenue.
We ended the quarter with $1,822,000,000 in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $39 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets, and $139 million used in the repurchasing of stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $32 million from stock proceeds and $41 million provided by working capital, we generated $170 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income for the second quarter.
Turning to products, we launched 3 new instruments in the U.S. this quarter. A Thoracic Grasper and Medium-Large Clip Appliers and a Bipolar Dissector. We also received the CE mark for our fourth product, our section irrigation [ph] instrument and we have begun its rollout in Europe. 
We have submitted our 510(k) for the section of each of the [ph] instrument and are working through the approval process with FDA. New instruments are all for faster and more precise da Vinci procedures and these new additions to our instrument line are targeted at facilitating our emerging procedures in thoracic and general surgery. 
As we mentioned last quarter, the FDA has requested additional clinical data for our Single-Site product. We have collected this clinical data from both the U.S. and European sites, and we'll resubmit our Single-Site 510(k) to FDA this month. Clinical results from Single-Site use in Europe are encouraging and our phase roll out in Europe is progressing. With Single-Site running at approximately 10 sites. 
We continue to make good progress on both our da Vinci vessels healing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. We are in the process of answering FDA questions on our vessels healing instrument, while progressing through its manufacturing bring up. Our stapler is developing on plan, and we are working through its validation. 
Moving to recently released products. Our da Vinci Simulator has been well received by our customers. After dual console, the simulator is the second step in a set of products aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of da Vinci training. 
The simulator has fit well with both dual console and single console Si customers and it is providing surgeons with improved, ease of access and support in learning da Vinci surgery. 
Several studies evaluating phase, content and construct validity of the simulator are in process and the initial response from surgeons, trainers in our field has been enthusiastic. Our phase rollout of Florescence Imaging is progressing to plan with its initial use building in partial nephrectomy procedures. Lastly, we're investing in building our team in expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 40 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D. Bringing our total team to 1,769 employees. I'll now pass this time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our second quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% compared with $351 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 10% compared with $388 million recorded for the first quarter of 2011. 
Second quarter revenues per product category were as follows. Second quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $172 million, up 35% compared with $128 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 9% compared with $157 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,870 realized in the second quarter of 2010, and approximately the same at the first quarter of 2011. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, the increase primarily reflects increased stocking orders associated with increased system sales.
We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. 
Second quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $187 million increased 11%, compared with $168 million of Systems revenue for the second quarter of 2010, an increased 12% compared with $167 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2011.
We sold 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 108 systems in the second quarter of 2010 and 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter 2011 system count included 36 trade-ins, of which 21 were as for Si trade-off. In the first quarter of 2011 included 32 trade-ins, of which 19 were as for Si trade off. The second quarter 2010 system count included 19 trade-ins but excluded 10 S Si upgrade that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field.
Upgrade revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was approximately $800,000, compared with $7.6 million to the second quarter of 2010 and $1.5 million to the first quarter of 2011. Prior year upgrade are up and included the 10 S Si upgrade. 
Our second quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.44 million, a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter of 2010, and an increase compared with the $1.38 million realized in the first quarter. The increase in average sales price compared with the first quarter of 2011 reflects the increased simulator set revenue and a favorable mix of systems and customers. 
We recognized revenue for 115 simulators in the quarter, including 33 that were sold in the first quarter in conjunction with system sales but were not delivered until the second quarter. In total, we have sold 162 simulators in the first 6 months. Included in the mix of systems sold in the second quarter were 21 dual console systems, compared with 15 in the first quarter. 
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects a favorable product and geographic mix in the first -- in the second quarter of 2010. Credits associated with the S trade-ins in the current quarter partially offset by simulator revenues. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and traded mix. 
Service revenue increased to $68 million, up 22% compared with $55 million last year. And up 6 million -- up 6% compared with $64 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base.
Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessory and Service revenue increased to $239 million, up 31% compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 8% compared with the first quarter of 2011.
Recurring revenue represented 56% of total second quarter revenue, compared with 52% in the second quarter last year and 57% last quarter. 
International results were as follows, procedures outside of the U.S. grew 38% on a year-to-year basis with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver. Although we also experience growth in other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe, second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $87 million, up 38% compared with revenue of $63 million in the second quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $91 million in the first quarter of 2011. Instrument and Accessory revenue grew 57% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. The changes in Instrument and Accessory revenue reflect growth in procedures and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. 
We sold 30 systems outside the U.S, compared with 22 in the second quarter of 2010, and 31 last quarter. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 14 in the second quarter of 2010 and 15 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of our overseas system sales. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter was 72%, compared with the second quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with the first quarter, 2011 gross margin of 72%. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2010 primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. Second quarter 2011 operating expenses at $139 million were up 18%, compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and cost associated with increased revenue.
We added 40 employees during the quarter, including 23 employees in our commercial operations organization and 17 employees in product operation. Second quarter 2011 operating income was $168 million or 39% of sales, compared to -- with $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010, and $148 million or 38% of sales for the first quarter of 2011.
Second quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense, compared with $30 million to the second quarter of 2010 and $32 million last quarter. The increases in noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 for this year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first quarter and lower than the 33% recorded for the fiscal year ended September 2010.
Our net income was $117 million or $2.91 per share, compared with $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010 and $104 million or $2.59 per share for the first quarter of 2011.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 6 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 6 months of 2011 was $814 million, up 20% compared with $679 million last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 29% and an increase in systems revenue of 9%. Operating income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $316 million, up 17% compared with $269 million last year.
Operating income included $67 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 6 months of 2011, compared with $57 million in 2010. Net income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $222 million or $5.51 per share, compared with $174 million or $4.31 per share last year. Cash flows from operations for the first 6 months of 2011 was $296 million compared with $291 million last year. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $1,822,000,000, up $65 million compared with March 31, 2011. The increase was driven by $196 million of cash flows from operations plus $32 million from the exercise to stock options, partially offset by $139 million of stock buyback and $39 million of capital and IP purchases.
During the second quarter, we bought back 401,000 shares at an average price of $347 per share. As of June 30, there was 249 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. We also executed on the opportunity to purchase approximately 18 acres of land and buildings for $33 million next to our current Sunnyvale campus for possible long-term growth.
Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $250 million at June 30, from $260 million at March 31 reflecting the timing of revenues and collection. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. Our net inventory increased to $100 million at June 30, from $93 million at March 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies are tightened and have build the finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building at Sunnyvale.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the second quarter, we sold 129 da Vinci systems, 99 in the United States, 16 in Europe and 14 in the rest of world markets. As part of the 129 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems and 21 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 93 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,933 the cumulative number da Vinci systems worldwide. 1,411 in the United States, 342 in Europe and 180 in the rest of world markets. 62 of the 129 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 121 of the 129 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 21 dual console systems. The 30 system sales internationally included 4 da Vinci systems into Japan, 4 into Italy and 3 into both Switzerland and India.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year growth of approximately 30%. Gynecology in the United States was particularly strong, while growth within general surgery, urology, thoracic and head-neck procedures was solid. As mentioned in the past, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q2 2010 procedure trends, benign dVH growth during the second quarter of 2011 grew solidly faster than malignant dVH. 
In addition to strong dVH adoption, sacrocolpopexy, endometrial resection, myomectomy have been key factors to the U.S. GYN expansion.
In Europe, dVH growth has begun to emerge within malignant procedures, primarily endometrial and cervical cancer resection. In addition, the category of general surgery has shown signs of early adoption. However, most of our EU growth is still being fueled by urology. 
In Asia, urology and general surgery were the strongest categories through the first half of the year. All in all, Q2 procedure growth showed global strength across several key categories. 
Q2 represents our busiest quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. The volume of clinical data presented, procedure, technique reviews and live surgery presentations was impressive. AUA represented 200 or so abstracts and 15 postgraduate courses. WRS was packed with live surgery, robotic panels and podium discussions covering all segments of surgery. Not to mention SAGES, the American Society of Colorectal Surgery, AATS and ACOG, as well as the various international conferences we participated in. We are convinced that the dissemination of peer-reviewed clinical data has been a critical factor in the rapid adoption of da Vinci surgery. And the peer-reviewed exposure we received at these important venues is immeasurable.
During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were published within various peer-reviewed journals representing all of our targeted specialties, but I'll take a moment to highlight just a few, which I believe represent an important theme. The economic impact of reduced complications and hospitalization and their connection toward improving clinical outcomes. In years past, providers would report on the cost effectiveness of robotic surgery in a fairly simple and consistent manner, whereby they consider the purchase price of the capital equipment add to at their operating costs and divide it by the number procedures they've completed. Direct cost comparisons were usually made to open a laparoscopic surgery. However, the cost of hospitalization and the cost of complications were often omitted. 
Recent published studies have included broader analysis that includes both direct and indirect hospital costs. In a recent edition of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a team from Brigham Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, comprised of both physician and business professionals, studied and reported on the evolution of the hospitals hysterectomy business in 2006 and compared it to 2009. Specifically, they study how the shift from open and vaginal hysterectomy to laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy had affected their costs. The paper entitled Increasing Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy, the effects on cost and complications evaluated the overall costs associated with 2,133 hysterectomy patients that underwent the procedure in 2006 and 2009. 
This study reported and I quote, ""A change from majority abdominal hysterectomy to minimally invasive hysterectomy was accompanied by a significant decrease in procedure related complications without an increase in total main cost.""
Some of the relevant details. In 2006, approximately 65% of the 1,054 hysterectomies performed at Brigham and Women's were performed abdominally. In 2009, only 35% out of 1,079 were performed abdominally. Lap and robotic approaches comprised 17% of the hysterectomies in 2006, which grew to 46% in 2009. Vaginal hysterectomy remain fairly stable during this period and was typically confined to less complex cases. When evaluating outcomes and costs, the results were quite striking. The deviates cohort was associated with the lowest intraoperative and postoperative complication rates and the lowest estimated blood loss across all cohorts and along with laparoscopy, registered the lowest length of stay data in the group. The differences were considered very significant. When comparing abdominal hysterectomy to dVH, length of stay was reduced from 3.5 days to 1.4 days, estimated blood loss went from 363 millimeters to 75 milliliters. The most telling was the reported complication rate. The rate of major intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with abdominal hysterectomy was shown to be approximately 5x greater than with dVH. 
To quote the authors, ""Our data suggest that dedication to the implementation of a minimally invasive technique goals, such as a decreased complications, decreased operative times, decreased conversion rate and decreased estimated blood loss can be realized. A creation of a minimally invasive gynecology service at Brigham and Women's Hospital has benefited not only the trainees and the hospital but first and foremost our patients.""
In the June edition of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, a study out of Seattle authored by Doctors Paley, Veljovich and Shah entitled Surgical outcomes in gynecologic oncology in the era of surgical robotics: an analysis of the first 1,000 cases was published. This study was very comprehensive and it reported on multiple factors and clinical outcomes related to da Vinci cancer surgery. There were, however, 2 comparisons that were central on this paper. First, could the authors increase the complexity of their da Vinci patients without increasing the complication rates? And second, how did their dVH outcomes for endometrial cancer resection compared to open hysterectomy outcomes?
The second objective would consist of a subset analysis of their most recent 377 da Vinci Hysterectomies and Endometrial Resection compared to the most recent endometrial resection, open endometrial resection surgeries. From 2006 to 2009, deviate share at the institution had grown from 9% to 36% of the GYN cancer resections. But further penetration was being governed by their unwillingness to accept higher BMI patients at the risk of increasing their complication rates, a concerned, which was dispelled by their careful analysis.
During the study period, the physicians raised their BMI constraints at 3 intervals, beginning at 26 until reaching at an average BMI of just over 30.
Within their first interval, they operated on patient -- excuse me, within their final interval, they operated on patients with BMIs as high as 70. Interestingly, they discovered that neither their conversion rate nor complication rates increased within these more complex cohorts. In fact, they actually decreased.
Their overall conversion rate for their entire 1,000 patient analysis was a mere 2.9% and their overall complication rate was 9.9%. 5.7% for majors and 4.2% for minor complications. 
In a subset analysis of women undergoing endometrial cancer resection, the difference between dVH and open hysterectomy was significant. Major complications associated with open surgery was 20.6%, as compared to 6.4% for dVH. In patients with BMI in excess of 40, major complications threw up from 43.5% for open to 11.3% for dVH.
Length of hospitalization was reduced from 5.3 days for open to 1.4 days with dVH. Lymphnode yields were approximately 10% higher within the dVH group. Intensive care unit admissions went from 3.8% for open to 0.5% for dVH. 
Mortality rates dropped from 1.5% to 0.27%. Their conclusion, ""Robotic surgery is associated with favorable morbidity and conversion rates in an unselected cohort. Compared to lab autonomy, robotic endometrial cancer surgery results in improved outcomes.""
In a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology, a physician group out of Cornell and Presbyterian Hospital, New York City published their study comparing the overall cost associated with open cystectomy, lymph node dissection and diversion to da Vinci Cystectomy with diversions. This prospective study consisted of 186 consecutive patients and included appropriate sensitivity analysis. The authors collected a myriad of cost data, both direct and indirect and these costs were carefully analyzed.
Cost data included, but was not limited to, system and service amortization, disposables, length of stay, complications, surgeon fees and anesthesia cost. In other words, both direct and variable cost were collected and scrutinized. Their study contained 3 approaches to urinary diversion following cystectomy. With the ileal conduit approach being the most commonly performed and the largest subcategory study. Not surprisingly, the authors concluded that the greatest contribution to cost variation between the various cohorts were length of stay and complications.
Across the board, the direct cost between the various cohorts was pretty similar plus/minus $1,000 or so. But the difference in variable cost was very significant, in da Vinci's favor. In an overall cost basis, comparing open cystectomy with ileal conduit to a da Vinci cystectomy with ileal conduit, it was reported that the da Vinci Cystectomy saved nearly $5,000 over the open surgical approach. The cost difference between the other 2 diversion techniques was less pronounced, slightly in da Vinci's favor for the continent, cutaneous diversion and slightly in the favor of the open technique for the orthotopic neobladder approach. The least common approach.
The authors' conclusion, ""Despite the higher cost of materials, robotic cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open cystectomy for bladder cancers at high-volume tertiary referral center, particularly for ileal conduit.""
The reduction in hospitalization, blood loss, complications and overall hospital cost has been a consistent theme throughout Intuitive's short history. They are central component in our pursuit to improve patient value. That concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the panel to Calvin."
30239,132975156,143024,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis.

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our forecast for 2011. Our prior estimate for total 2011 procedures was to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year. We now protect procedures to go approximately 27% to 29% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. 
During the second half of this year, we would expect a similar seasonal pattern as we experienced last year in 2010, with Q3 being seasonally weaker and Q4 seasonally stronger. 
Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue forecast. Previously, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow 16% to 20% above 2010. We are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase 19% to 21% for the year. Again, the timing for the remaining quarters should follow last year's seasonal pattern favoring Q4. Remember that in Q3 of 2010, our sequential Instrument and Accessory revenue was relatively flat compared to Q2. And Q3 total revenue was lower than Q2.
Our current forecast for gross margin percentage remains consistent with our last quarter's forecast. We continue to see 2011 gross margins coming in at around 72%. 
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven by our higher 2011 revenue forecast, we now anticipate operating expenses to grow at the higher end of the 16% to 20% range forecast on our last call. More precisely, we expect operating expenses to grow between 18% and 20%, above the 2010 level.
In terms of noncash expenses, we now expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million, $5 million less than forecast on our previous calls, up from $118 million reported in 2010. We continue to expect total 2011 amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income is expected to come in at between $17 million and $18 million, consistent with our previous estimate. With regard to income tax, we now expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within the range between 32% and 33% of pretax income, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 33%.
We estimate that our diluted share count for calculating Q3 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. We aim to keep this share count reasonably close to this level as we expect to offset the impact of option dilution via stock purchases. 
Finally, regarding cash flows. Since were forecasting to report over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income.
And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

I would say through that, it's pretty clear we're in the early adopters phase, and we're growing very nicely through the early adopters phase despite not having perfect optimization of Instruments and Accessories. How far we'll grow in that area? It's difficult to say, but we believe strongly that we're working on the right products. They are developing nicely.

On the Single-Site side of things, as you know, we're currently selling directly or selling it to Europe now. Their initial set of customers, as Gary mentioned, is roughly 10 or so sites but their working on that. Here on Single-Site, we are competing directly against some of the laparoscopic tool companies. So it's a little different than the traditional da Vinci side where it's against just open surgery. On a good amount, I think there's an established market for Single-Site operations, and I think we're kind of looking at to compete there, perhaps at a slight premium to that. So it would be lower than our traditional set of da Vinci instrument per procedures side on that side. As far as fluorescence imaging goes, we're still pretty early on that, too. The kit is comprised of a couple of endoscopes and some of the dye used in the fluorescence cases. That as you've seen, we've maintained our overall instrument and accessory revenue procedure at about $1,940 over the last 3 quarters and part of that has to do with fluorescence imaging coming on and bolstering the IMA revenue together with the 8.5 millimeters scope. So that could help the small volume right now but in general, it would be a slight increase to the revenue per procedure but not a big impact at this stage."

As far as sizing, in our view, we look at that market as probably somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 procedures and that's really where we are going to stay for a while. I think that's where we add tremendous value. That's where there's a reconsolidation in that space and it's a fairly small community, and we think we can go very deep into that community. So we will focus on that and we'll see where it takes us from there."

That was our last question. As we have said previously, while be focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. 
I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. Lyle [ph] of Colorado shares the following experience, ""After learning about my 2-inch tumor on my left kidney, I was very scared and nervous. I have a doctor friend that plays golf in my club and he told me about the da Vinci Systems. I was amazed at what he told me. I looked it up on the web, and after learning the difference between the regular surgery and the da Vinci systems, I felt 100% better. Then I had appointment with Dr. Visha [ph] and he explained my condition and the options and I was completely comfortable with thought of surgery. It was my first major surgery and at 83. I was out of the hospital at the third day and doing some household chores by the fifth day. I live alone and have help for 5 days and I was alone after that. I took pain pills for 3 days and had no pain after that. I could have done without any, but I was told to take them. It is now 2 weeks after surgery and I feel like doing anything I do regularly. I will wait for the 6 weeks before playing golf. However, I'll pitch and starting next week. I cannot believe the difference and would like to thank whoever invented this. What a great improvement to surgery. I hope that anyone reading this has a chance of selecting the da Vinci system over the regular surgery. I have talked to someone who had regular surgery in the kidney and our stories are so different like night and day."" 
Patients like these are our strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We've built our company to take surgery Beyond the Limits of the Human Hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months."

We are pleased with our growth in da Vinci procedures and with customer response to our recently released products in the second quarter. Our team has executed well in our 4 areas of focus for 2011, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology globally. Second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia. Third, crisp execution in our product development efforts. And finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery. 
Turning to procedures. Total procedures grew 30% over Q2 of 2010. And da Vinci Hysterectomy followed its seasonal pattern posting solid growth in hysterectomy for both malignant and benign conditions. 
In urology, da Vinci prostatectomy continued to grow, primarily through growth in Europe as expected. Pull-through procedures namely partial nephrectomy, endometrial resection and sacrocolpopexy grew nicely in the quarter. Emerging procedures in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery have also showed strength, with clinical publications emerging from early adopting centers. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. 
Turning to operating highlights for the second quarter. Procedures grew approximately 30% over the second quarter of 2010. We sold 129 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 108 during the second quarter of last year, and 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers. 
Total revenue was $426 million, up 21% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $172 million, up 35% over Q2 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $239 million, up 31% from prior year and comprising 56% of total revenue. Net income was $117 million, up 32% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $203 million before noncash stock option expense, up 19% from the second quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q2 revenue.
We ended the quarter with $1,822,000,000 in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $39 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets, and $139 million used in the repurchasing of stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $32 million from stock proceeds and $41 million provided by working capital, we generated $170 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income for the second quarter.
Turning to products, we launched 3 new instruments in the U.S. this quarter. A Thoracic Grasper and Medium-Large Clip Appliers and a Bipolar Dissector. We also received the CE mark for our fourth product, our section irrigation [ph] instrument and we have begun its rollout in Europe. 
We have submitted our 510(k) for the section irrigation [ph] instrument and are working through the approval process with FDA. New instruments allow for faster and more precise da Vinci procedures and these new additions to our instrument line are targeted at facilitating our emerging procedures in thoracic and general surgery. 
As we mentioned last quarter, the FDA has requested additional clinical data for our Single-Site product. We have collected this clinical data from both the U.S. and European sites, and we'll resubmit our Single-Site 510(k) to FDA this month. Clinical results from Single-Site use in Europe are encouraging and our phase roll out in Europe is progressing. With Single-Site running at approximately 10 sites. 
We continue to make good progress on both our da Vinci vessels healing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. We are in the process of answering FDA questions on our vessels healing instrument, while progressing through its manufacturing bring up. Our stapler is developing on plan, and we are working through its validation. 
Moving to recently released products. Our da Vinci Simulator has been well received by our customers. After dual console, the simulator is the second step in a set of products aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of da Vinci training. 
The simulator has fit well with both dual console and single console Si customers and it is providing surgeons with improved, ease of access and support in learning da Vinci surgery. 
Several studies evaluating phase, content and construct validity of the simulator are in process and the initial response from surgeons, trainers in our field has been enthusiastic. Our phase rollout of Florescence Imaging is progressing to plan with its initial use building in partial nephrectomy procedures. Lastly, we're investing in building our team, in expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 40 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D. Bringing our total team to 1,769 employees. I'll now pass this time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,132975156,143040,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% compared with $351 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 10% compared with $388 million reported for the first quarter of 2011. Second quarter revenues per product category wer",1450,"Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% compared with $351 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 10% compared with $388 million reported for the first quarter of 2011. 
Second quarter revenues per product category were as follows. Second quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $172 million, up 35% compared with $128 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 9% compared with $157 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,870 realized in the second quarter of 2010, and approximately the same at the first quarter of 2011. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, the increase primarily reflects increased stocking orders associated with increased system sales.
We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. 
Second quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $187 million increased 11%, compared with $168 million of Systems revenue for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 12% compared with $167 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2011.
We sold 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 108 systems in the second quarter of 2010 and 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter 2011 system count included 36 trade-ins, of which 21 were S for Si trade-off. In the first quarter of 2011 included 32 trade-ins, of which 19 were S for Si trade off. The second quarter 2010 system count included 19 trade-ins but excluded 10 S Si upgrades that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field.
Upgrade revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was approximately $800,000, compared with $7.6 million to the second quarter of 2010 and $1.5 million to the first quarter of 2011. Prior year upgrade revenue included the 10 S Si upgrade. 
Our second quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.44 million, a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter of 2010, and an increase compared with the $1.38 million realized in the first quarter. The increase in average sales price compared with the first quarter of 2011 reflects the increased simulator set revenue and a favorable mix of systems to customers. 
We recognized revenue for 115 simulators in the quarter, including 33 that were sold in the first quarter in conjunction with system sales but were not delivered until the second quarter. In total, we have sold 162 simulators in the first 6 months. Included in the mix of systems sold in the second quarter were 21 dual console systems, compared with 15 in the first quarter. 
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects a favorable product and geographic mix in the first -- in the second quarter of 2010. Credits associated with the S trade-ins in the current quarter partially offset by simulator revenues. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix. 
Service revenue increased to $68 million, up 22% compared with $55 million last year. And up 6 million -- up 6% compared with $64 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base.
Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessory and Service revenue increased to $239 million, up 31% compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 8% compared with the first quarter of 2011.
Recurring revenue represented 56% of total second quarter revenue, compared with 52% in the second quarter last year and 57% last quarter. 
International results were as follows, procedures outside of the U.S. grew 38% on a year-to-year basis with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver. Although we also experience growth in other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe, second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $87 million, up 38% compared with revenue of $63 million in the second quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $91 million in the first quarter of 2011. Instrument and Accessory revenue grew 57% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. The changes in Instrument and Accessory revenue reflect growth in procedures and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. 
We sold 30 systems outside the U.S, compared with 22 in the second quarter of 2010, and 31 last quarter. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 14 in the second quarter of 2010 and 15 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of our overseas system sales. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter was 72%, compared with the second quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with the first quarter, 2011 gross margin of 72%. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2010 primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. Second quarter 2011 operating expenses at $139 million were up 18%, compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and costs associated with increased revenue.
We added 40 employees during the quarter, including 23 employees in our commercial operations organization and 17 employees in product operation. Second quarter 2011 operating income was $168 million or 39% of sales, compared to -- with $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010, and $148 million or 38% of sales for the first quarter of 2011.
Second quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense, compared with $30 million to the second quarter of 2010 and $32 million last quarter. The increases in noncash compensation reflect our annual grant made February 15 of each year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first quarter and lower than the 33% recorded for the fiscal year ended 2010.
Our net income was $117 million or $2.91 per share, compared with $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010 and $104 million or $2.59 per share for the first quarter of 2011.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 6 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 6 months of 2011 was $814 million, up 20% compared with $679 million last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 29% and an increase in systems revenue of 9%. Operating income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $316 million, up 17% compared with $269 million last year.
Operating income included $67 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 6 months of 2011, compared with $57 million in 2010. Net income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $222 million or $5.51 per share, compared with $174 million or $4.31 per share last year. Cash flows from operations for the first 6 months of 2011 was $296 million compared with $291 million last year. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $1,822,000,000, up $65 million compared with March 31, 2011. The increase was driven by $196 million of cash flows from operations plus $32 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $139 million of stock buyback and $39 million of capital and IP purchases.
During the second quarter, we bought back 401,000 shares at an average price of $347 per share. As of June 30, there was 249 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. We also executed on the opportunity to purchase approximately 18 acres of land and buildings for $33 million next to our current Sunnyvale campus for possible long-term growth.
Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $250 million at June 30, from $260 million at March 31 reflecting the timing of revenues and collection. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. Our net inventory increased to $100 million at June 30, from $93 million at March 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies are tightened and have build the finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building at Sunnyvale.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the second quarter, we sold 129 da Vinci systems, 99 in the United States, 16 in Europe and 14 in the rest of world markets. As part of the 129 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems and 21 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 93 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,933 the cumulative number da Vinci systems worldwide. 1,411 in the United States, 342 in Europe and 180 in the rest of world markets. 62 of the 129 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 121 of the 129 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 21 dual console systems. The 30 system sales internationally included 4 da Vinci systems into Japan, 4 into Italy and 3 into both Switzerland and India.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year growth of approximately 30%. Gynecology in the United States was particularly strong, while growth within general surgery, urology, thoracic and head-neck procedures was solid. As mentioned in the past, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q2 2010 procedure trends, benign dVH growth during the second quarter of 2011 grew solidly faster than malignant dVH. 
In addition to strong dVH adoption, sacrocolpopexy, endometrial resection, myomectomy have been key factors to the U.S. GYN expansion.
In Europe, dVH growth has begun to emerge within malignant procedures, primarily endometrial and cervical cancer resection. In addition, the category of general surgery has shown signs of early adoption. However, most of our EU growth is still being fueled by urology. 
In Asia, urology and general surgery were the strongest categories through the first half of the year. All in all, Q2 procedure growth showed global strength across several key categories. 
Q2 represents our busiest quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. The volume of clinical data presented, procedure technique reviews and live surgery presentations was impressive. AUA represented 200 or so abstracts and 16 postgraduate courses. WRS was packed with live surgery, robotic panels and podium discussions covering all segments of surgery. Not to mention SAGES, the American Society of Colorectal Surgery, AATS and ACOG, as well as the various international conferences we participated in. We are convinced that the dissemination of peer-reviewed clinical data has been a critical factor in the rapid adoption of da Vinci surgery. And the peer-review exposure we received at these important venues is immeasurable.
During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were published within various peer-review journals representing all of our targeted specialties, but I'll take a moment to highlight just a few, which I believe represent an important theme. The economic impact of reduced complications and hospitalization and their connection toward improving clinical outcomes. In years past, providers would report on the cost effectiveness of robotic surgery in a fairly simple and consistent manner, whereby they consider the purchase price of the capital equipment add to it their operating costs and divide it by the number procedures they've completed. Direct cost comparisons were usually made to open a laparoscopic surgery. However, the cost of hospitalization and the cost of complications were often omitted. 
Recent published studies have included broader analysis that includes both direct and indirect hospital costs. In a recent edition of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a team from Brigham Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, comprised of both physician and business professionals, studied and reported on the evolution of the hospitals hysterectomy business in 2006 and compared it to 2009. Specifically, they study how the shift from open and vaginal hysterectomy to laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy had affected their costs. The paper entitled Increasing Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy, the effects on cost and complications evaluated the overall costs associated with 2,133 hysterectomy patients that underwent the procedure in 2006 and 2009. 
This study reported and I quote, ""A change from majority abdominal hysterectomy to minimally invasive hysterectomy was accompanied by a significant decrease in procedure related complications without an increase in total mean cost.""
Some of the relevant details. In 2006, approximately 65% of the 1,054 hysterectomies performed at Brigham and Women's were performed abdominally. In 2009, only 35% out of 1,079 were performed abdominally. Lap and robotic approaches comprised 17% of the hysterectomies in 2006, which grew to 46% in 2009. Vaginal hysterectomy remain fairly stable during this period and was typically confined to less complex cases. When evaluating outcomes and costs, the results were quite striking. The deviates cohort was associated with the lowest intraoperative and postoperative complication rates and the lowest estimated blood loss across all cohorts and along with laparoscopy, registered the lowest length of stay data in the group. The differences were considered very significant. When comparing abdominal hysterectomy to dVH, length of stay was reduced from 3.5 days to 1.4 days, estimated blood loss went from 363 millimeters to 75 milliliters. The most telling was the reported complication rate. The rate of major intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with abdominal hysterectomy was shown to be approximately 5x greater than with dVH. 
To quote the authors, ""Our data suggest that dedication to the implementation of a minimally invasive technique goals, such as a decreased complications, decreased operative times, decreased conversion rate and decreased estimated blood loss can be realized. A creation of a minimally invasive gynecology service at Brigham and Women's Hospital has benefited not only the trainees and the hospital but first and foremost our patients.""
In the June edition of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, a study out of Seattle authored by Doctors Paley, Veljovich and Shah entitled Surgical outcomes in gynecologic oncology in the era of surgical robotics: an analysis of the first 1,000 cases was published. This study was very comprehensive and it reported on multiple factors and clinical outcomes related to da Vinci cancer surgery. There were, however, 2 comparisons that were central in this paper. First, could the authors increase the complexity of their da Vinci patients without increasing the complication rates? And second, how did their dVH outcomes for endometrial cancer resection compare to open hysterectomy outcomes?
The second objective would consist of a subset analysis of their most recent 377 da Vinci Hysterectomies and Endometrial Resection compared to the most recent endometrial resection, open endometrial resection surgeries. From 2006 to 2009, deviate share at the institution had grown from 9% to 36% of the GYN cancer resections. But further penetration was being governed by their unwillingness to accept higher BMI patients at the risk of increasing their complication rates, a concern, which was dispelled by their careful analysis.
During the study period, the physicians raised their BMI constraints at 3 intervals, beginning at 26 until reaching at an average BMI of just over 30.
Within their first interval, they operated on patient -- excuse me, within their final interval, they operated on patients with BMIs as high as 70. Interestingly, they discovered that neither their conversion rate nor complication rates increased within these more complex cohorts. In fact, they actually decreased.
Their overall conversion rate for their entire 1,000 patient analysis was a mere 2.9% and their overall complication rate was 9.9%. 5.7% for majors and 4.2% for minor complications. 
In a subset analysis of women undergoing endometrial cancer resection, the difference between dVH and open hysterectomy was significant. Major complications associated with open surgery was 20.6%, as compared to 6.4% for dVH. In patients with BMI in excess of 40, major complications dropped from 43.5% for open to 11.3% for dVH.
Length of hospitalization was reduced from 5.3 days for open to 1.4 days with dVH. Lymphnode yields were approximately 10% higher within the dVH group. Intensive care unit admissions went from 3.8% for open to 0.5% for dVH. 
Mortality rates dropped from 1.5% to 0.27%. Their conclusion, and I quote: ""Robotic surgery is associated with favorable morbidity and conversion rates in an unselected cohort. Compared to laparotomy, robotic endometrial cancer surgery results in improved outcomes.""
In a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology, a physician group out of Cornell and Presbyterian Hospital, New York City published their study comparing the overall cost associated with open cystectomy, lymph node dissection and diversions to da Vinci Cystectomy with diversions. This prospective study consisted of 186 consecutive patients and included appropriate sensitivity analysis. The authors collected a myriad of cost data, both direct and indirect and these costs were carefully analyzed.
Cost data included, but was not limited to, system and service amortization, disposables, length of stay, complications, surgeon fees and anesthesia cost. In other words, both direct and variable costs were collected and scrutinized. Their study contained 3 approaches to urinary diversion following cystectomy. With the ileal conduit approach being the most commonly performed and the largest subcategory study. Not surprisingly, the authors concluded that the greatest contribution to cost variation between the various cohorts were length of stay and complications.
Across the board, the direct cost between the various cohorts was pretty similar plus/minus $1,000 or so. But the difference in variable cost was very significant, in da Vinci's favor. In an overall cost basis, comparing open cystectomy with ileal conduit to a da Vinci cystectomy with ileal conduit, it was reported that the da Vinci Cystectomy saved nearly $5,000 over the open surgical approach. The cost difference between the other 2 diversion techniques was less pronounced, slightly in da Vinci's favor for the continent, cutaneous diversion and slightly in the favor of the open technique for the orthotopic neobladder approach. The least common approach.
The authors' conclusion, ""Despite the higher cost of materials, robotic cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open cystectomy for bladder cancers at high-volume tertiary referral center, particularly for ileal conduit.""
The reduction in hospitalization, blood loss, complications and overall hospital cost has been a consistent theme throughout Intuitive's short history. They are central components in our pursuit to improve patient value. That concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the panel to Calvin."

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis.

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our forecast for 2011. Our prior estimate for total 2011 procedures was to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year. We now project procedures to grow approximately 27% to 29% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. 
During the second half of this year, we would expect a similar seasonal pattern as we experienced last year in 2010, with Q3 being seasonally weaker and Q4 seasonally stronger. 
Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue forecast. Previously, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow 16% to 20% above 2010. We are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase 19% to 21% for the year. Again, the timing for the remaining quarters should follow last year's seasonal pattern favoring Q4. Remember that in Q3 of 2010, our sequential Instrument and Accessory revenue was roughly flat compared to Q2. And Q3 total revenue was lower than Q2.
Our current forecast for gross margin percentage remains consistent with our last quarter's forecast. We continue to see 2011 gross margins coming in at around 72%. 
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven by our higher 2011 revenue forecast, we now anticipate operating expenses to grow at the higher end of the 16% to 20% range forecast on our last call. More precisely, we expect operating expenses to grow between 18% and 20%, above the 2010 level.
In terms of noncash expenses, we now expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million, $5 million less than forecast on our previous calls, up from $118 million reported in 2010. We continue to expect total 2011 amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income is expected to come in at between $17 million and $18 million, consistent with our previous estimate. With regard to income tax, we now expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within the range between 32% and 33% of pretax income, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 33%.
We estimate that our diluted share count for calculating Q3 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. We aim to keep this share count reasonably close to this level as we expect to offset the impact of option dilution via stock repurchases. 
Finally, regarding cash flows. Since we're forecasting to report over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income.
And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

I would say through that, it's pretty clear we're in the early adopters phase, and we're growing very nicely through the early adopters phase despite not having perfect optimization of Instruments and Accessories. How far we'll grow in that area? It's difficult to say, but we believe strongly that we're working on the right products. They are developing nicely.

On the Single-Site side of things, as you know, we're currently selling directly or selling it to Europe now. Their initial set of customers, as Gary mentioned, is roughly 10 or so sites but their working on that. Here on Single-Site, we are competing directly against some of the laparoscopic tool companies. So it's a little different than the traditional da Vinci side where it's against just open surgery. And so given that, I think there's an established market for Single-Site operations, and I think we're kind of looking at to compete there, perhaps at a slight premium to that. So it would be lower than our traditional set of da Vinci instrument per procedures side on that side. As far as fluorescence imaging goes, we're still pretty early on that, too. The kit is comprised of a couple of endoscopes and some of the dye used in the fluorescence cases. That as you've seen, we've maintained our overall instrument and accessory revenue procedure at about $1,940 over the last 3 quarters and part of that has to do with fluorescence imaging coming on and bolstering the IMA revenue together with the 8.5 millimeters scope. So that could help the small volume right now but in general, it would be a slight increase to the revenue per procedure but not a big impact at this stage."

That was our last question. As we have said previously, while be focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. 
I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. Lyle [ph] of Colorado shares the following experience, ""After learning about my 2-inch tumor on my left kidney, I was very scared and nervous. I have a doctor friend that plays golf in my club and he told me about the da Vinci Systems. I was amazed at what he told me. I looked it up on the web, and after learning the difference between the regular surgery and the da Vinci systems, I felt 100% better. Then I had appointment with Dr. Visha [ph] and he explained my condition and the options and I was completely comfortable with thought of surgery. It was my first major surgery and, at 83, I was out of the hospital at the third day and doing some household chores by the fifth day. I live alone and have help for 5 days and I was alone after that. I took pain pills for 3 days and had no pain after that. I could have done without any, but I was told to take them. It is now 2 weeks after surgery and I feel like doing anything I do regularly. I will wait for the 6 weeks before playing golf. However, I'll pitch and putt starting next week. I cannot believe the difference and would like to thank whoever invented this. What a great improvement to surgery. I hope that anyone reading this has a chance of selecting the da Vinci system over the regular surgery. I have talked to someone who had regular surgery in the kidney and our stories are so different like night and day."" 
Patients like these are our strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We've built our company to take surgery Beyond the Limits of the Human Hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months."

30239,139431450,173529,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the growth in da Vinci procedures and with the performance of our capital and clinical teams in the third quarter. Overall, the Intuitive Surgical is executing well in our 4 2011 focus areas.  Which are",724,"Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the growth in da Vinci procedures and with the performance of our capital and clinical teams in the third quarter. Overall, the Intuitive Surgical is executing well in our 4 2011 focus areas.  Which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology; second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; third, crisp execution in our product development efforts; and finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, TransOral, colorectal and general surgery.
Total procedures grew approximately 30% over Q3 2010 with strong year-over-year growth in gynecology. Gynecology procedure performance was solid for all of our target procedures, including hysterectomy for malignant and benign conditions, sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy. And urology, da Vinci Prostatectomy continued to grow year-over-year driven by European uptick. EBT was flat in the quarter on a sequential basis expected given the summer seasonal slowdown in Europe. 
For follow-on procedures in urology, our penetration into treatment for kidney cancer continues to grow as more total nephrectomies are converting to nephron-sparing partial nephrectomies enabled by da Vinci.
Emerging procedures in thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery continued to show strength both sequentially and year-over-year. 
TransOral Robotic Surgery grew nicely on a year-over-year basis however absolute volumes in TORS are relatively small and quarter-to-quarter variation is significant. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.
Operating highlights for the third quarter are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 30% over the third quarter of 2010. We sold 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 105 during the third quarter last year, 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers. 
Total revenue was $447 million, up 30% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $176 million, up 38% over Q3 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $248 million, up 34% from prior year and comprising 55% of total revenue. Net income was $122 million, up 41% over the last year. We generated an operating profit of $214 million before noncash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year and represented [indiscernible] of Q3 revenue.
We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $181 million used in the repurchase of our stock. 
Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $91 million from stock proceeds and $19 million provided by working capital, we generated $190 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 155% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter.
Turning to products. We received FDA approval for our suction irrigation instrument in the quarter, which combined with the new Thoracic Grasper and new Bipolar Dissector comprises an instrument kit designed to facilitate thoracic procedures. Early uptake of our thoracic instrument kit has been encouraging. As we mentioned on our last call, we continued to answer questions posed by FDA on our Single-Site and vessel sealing products. Our interactions with FDA have been constructive and our teams are working diligently to answer their questions. 
Our stapler continues to progress through its validation and testing processes and progress there remains encouraging. Given the current uncertainty of the U.S. regulatory process, we do not have additional information to share with you regarding timing for approval or launch of these products.
With regard to recently launched products, our imaging system is gaining acceptance with customers, primarily for visualizing vascular and partial nephrectomy procedures. We're also pleased with the continued uptake of our da Vinci simulators and feedback on their use. Simulators and dual consoles are providing our customers with targeted tools to improve the quality and accessibility of robotic surgery training reflected in strong simulator purchases and steady demand for dual consoles. Lastly, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. In the quarter, we moved our manufacturing operations to our new facility built to allow for increased capacity and proximity to our R&D center. We added 76 people to our team, predominantly in manufacturing, sales and R&D bringing our total team to 1,845 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010 and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as f",1445,"Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010 and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $176 million, up 38% compared with $128 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 3% compared with $172 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instruments and accessories revenue growth was driven by procedure growth of 30% and early adopter purchases of recently launched products, including our firefly and thoracic instrument sets. Quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by procedure growth and sales of our recently launched products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of approximately $1,950 per procedure was higher than the $1,830 realized in the third quarter of 2010 and slightly higher than the $1,940 achieved in the second quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory products.
Third quarter 2011 systems revenue of $199 million increased 25% compared with the $160 million of systems revenue through the third quarter of 2010, an increase of 7% compared with $187 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2011. Our higher third quarter 2011 systems revenue was driven by higher system unit sales and higher system ASPs. We sold 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the 105 systems in the third quarter of the 2010 and 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011. 
The third quarter of 2011 system count included 35 systems involving trade-ins of order units comprised of 14 standard systems and 21  da Vinci S. During the second quarter of 2011, 36 systems involved trade-in comprised of 15 standard units and 21 da Vinci S. The third quarter 2010 system count included 15 standard system trade-ins but excluded 10 S to Si upgrades that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field.
Upgrade revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately $5 million compared with $10 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $1 million for the second quarter of 2011. Prior year upgrade revenue included the 10 S to Si upgrade. 
Our third quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades was $1.46 million, an increase from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter of 2010 and an increase compared with the $1.44 million realized in the second quarter. The increase in average sales price reflects higher proportion of dual console systems in the product mix as we sold 29 dual console systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 21 in the second quarter 2011. 
Also benefiting the year-over-year comparison is revenue associated with our simulator product. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix. We sold 98 simulators in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 115 during the second quarter of 2011, which included 33 on backorder from the first quarter of 2011. 
In total, we have sold 260 simulators in the first 9 months since its introduction. The large majority of simulators are purchased in conjunction with new da Vinci systems sales and are included in our systems ASP calculation. 
Service revenue increased to $72 million, up 25% compared with $57 million last year and up 6% compared with $68 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger systems installed base.
Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $248 million, up 34% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total third quarter revenue compared with 54% in the third quarter last year and 56% last quarter. 
International results were as follows: Procedures outside of the U.S. grew 34% on a year-to-year basis with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we also experienced growth in our other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe. Third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $94 million, up 59% compared with revenue of $59 million in the third quarter of 2010 and up 9% compared with revenue of $87 million in the second quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue outside the U.S. grew 51% year-over-year and decreased 7% sequentially driven by summer seasonality. We sold 34 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 30 last quarter. We sold 18 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 16 and in the third quarter of 2010 and 16 last quarter. 
Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was of 73% compared with 73% for the third quarter of 2010 and 72% for the second quarter of 2011. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2011 was driven by higher system ASPs and lower service parts consumption. Third quarter 2011 operating expenses of $147 million were up 24% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects cost associated with employees added during the quarter, higher engineering project cost and variable cost associated with increased revenue. 
We added 76 employees during -- in the quarter, including 47 employees in product operation and 25 employees in commercial operation. Third quarter 2011 operating income was $179 million or 40% of sales compared with $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010 and $168 million or 39% of sales for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $35 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first 6 months of 2011 and lower than the 37% reflected in the previous year. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower foreign and state taxes. 
Our net income was $122 million or $3.05 per share compared with $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010 and $117 million or $2.91 per share for the second quarter of 2011. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 9 months 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.26 billion, up 23% compared with $1.02 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 31% and an increase in systems revenue of 15%. Operating income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $495 million, up 23% compared with $402 million last year. Operating income included $102 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2011 compared with $88 million in 2010. Net income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $344 million or $8.55 per share compared with $261 million or $6.45 per share last year. Gross cash flows from operations for the first 9 months of 2011 totaled $527 million compared with $416 million last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $1.89 billion, up $65 million compared with June 30, 2011. The increase was driven by $190 million of gross cash flows from operations plus $91 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $181 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases.
During the third quarter, we bought back 526,000 shares at an average price of $344 per share. As of September 30, there was $68 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $265 million at September 30 from $250 million at June 30, primarily reflecting the higher or the impact of higher third quarter revenue. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter.
Our net inventory increased to $109 million at September 30 from $100 million at June 30. Our higher inventory reflects our business growth, expanded product offering and safety stocks acquired for key components. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the third quarter, we sold 133 da Vinci systems. 99 in the United States, 18 into Europe and 16 into the rest of world markets. As part of the 133 system sales, 14 standard da Vinci systems and 21 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 98 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,031, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide. 1,478 in the U.S., 357 in Europe and 196 in rest of world markets. 60 of the 133 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 117 of the 133 systems sold represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 29 dual console systems. The 34 system sales internationally included 6 da Vinci systems into Japan, 6 into Germany, 4 into India and 3 into Spain.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Colorectal and thoracic surgery growth was particularly strong, gynecology displayed solid sequential growth, specifically, benign hysterectomy and myomectomy. 
As mentioned in the past, Q3 represents certain seasonal challenges specifically in Europe. The months of July and August are particularly slow. Our European system sales growth for the quarter was less affected than our EU procedure business during these months. Our systems sales performance in Europe continues to be fueled by urology. 
Q3 represents a quieter quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. However, it represented a very productive quarter for clinical publications within the medical journal. This quarter alone, nearly 400 papers and abstracts appeared within various peer-reviewed journals. Gynecology, urology, general and colorectal, head neck, cardiac and thoracic surgery were well represented. 
The British Journal of Urology, which is considered to be among the most conservative and most respected peer-reviewed urology journals in circulation, dedicated their entire September edition to papers reporting on da Vinci's role within their field. The edition contained 15 papers covering a wide range of da Vinci studies, including dVP, da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty. In addition to the market clinical reports in comparison, there were also procedure technique and economic cost. A few reports offered neutral or even clinical analysis of robotic surgery but the majority were positive. Rather than taking time to review each of these papers in detail, I'll take a moment to highlight some of the written observations and conclusions. 
With regard to da Vinci Cystectomy, Dr. Lee and his team from Cornell concluded that despite an increased materials cost, robotic radical cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open radical cystectomy as a treatment for bladder cancer when the impact of complications is considered. With respect to da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy, Dr.'s Abrayu and Gill from USC reported that within their study, 0 ischemia robotic partial nephrectomy was successful in all cases without any higher eclamping and warm ischemia time was 0 in all cases.
They also stated that the elimination of warm ischemia may ultimately preserve renal function. Dr.'s Cha and Lee wrote robotic parts of nephrectomy appears to be a viable minimally invasive option for nephrons-sparing surgery. Robotic partial nephrectomy may reduce some of the technical challenges associated with lap partial nephrectomy and thus extend the potential benefits of minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery to a larger population.
[indiscernible]  Simply that da Vinci has become an integral tool in urologic cancer surgery and its presence in the global urologic community has become widespread. The dedication of an entire British Journal of Urology edition to robotic surgery is just further evidence of this phenomenon. A very large observational study comprised of over 19,000 prostate cancer surgery patients appeared in the British Journal of Urology a month earlier. The study analyzed the substitution that took place between open prostatectomy and minimally invasive prostatectomy over a 4-year period beginning in 2003. These patients had their prostatectomy between 2003 and 2006. However, the reported trends should certainly apply to subsequent years.
The study emanated out of Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston and was collaboration between the Division of Urology and the Center for Surgery of Public Health. The aim of the study was to determine differences in surgical outcomes by surgical approach during a period of rapid adoption for the minimally invasive surgical approach to radical prostatectomy. The study noted that minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had grown from 5.7% of the U.S. prostatectomies in 2003 to approximately 39.2% in 2006. At the same time, open prostatectomy decreased by approximately 33.5%. During this study period, the length of hospital stay for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy decreased from 2 days to 1  day and the length of stay for[indiscernible] 3.2 days to 2.9 days. The perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had decreased from 13.8% to 10.7% while at the perioperative complication rate for open prostatectomy had decreased from 18.1% to 14.6%.
Said another way, the perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy at the end of 2006 was 27% less than it was for open prostatectomy. When comparing the data over the entire 4-year study period, the results were fairly striking. Perioperative complications were 27% less for the minimally invasive group. Blood transfusions were fewer by 83%, anastomotic strictures were fewer by 51% and length of stay was shorter by 42%.
In their conclusions, the authors stated, and I quote, ""The increased use of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy corresponds with a decreasing trend for complications, blood transfusions, length of stay and need for reoperation. Additionally, minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was found to have fewer associated complications compared with men undergoing the open procedure.""
As we've mentioned in previous calls, da Vinci's role within the specialty of thoracic surgery is on the rise. The desire to reduce or eliminate large, painful intercostal incisions is shared mutually by patients and surgeons. Traditional video assisted the thoracoscopy has provided some relief for patients. However, its adoption has been somewhat limited to smaller, less complex procedures. 
While da Vinci Lobectomy wedged and segmental procedures are relatively new, with instrument sets that have yet to be optimized, it's early adoption has been strong. In a recent edition of the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Dr. Robert and his team from the University of Alabama, Birmingham published a study under initial 168 consecutive completely portal robotic pulmonary resections. The study took place over a 14-month period and included lobectomies, wedge and segmental resections. The majority, 106 patients had da Vinci Lobectomies. The results of the da Vinci patients were compared to 318 propensity matched patients who underwent a rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. The metrics that made up the comparison were morbidity, mortality, quality of life, hospitalization and operative time.
Dr. reported that the da Vinci group had a morbidity rate of 27% compared to a 38% morbidity rate for the thoracotomy group. Associated mortality was 0 for the da Vinci group and 3.1% for the thoracotomy group.
Quality-of-life metrics were defined as the subject's functioning and well-being in the physical, psychological and social domains in relation to their disease and treatment. In this comparison, the da Vinci group scored 53 compared to 40 with the thoracotomy group. Hospitalization was reduced in half, 4 days to 2 when performing these procedures robotically.
And finally, in technical procedure improvements in their final 106 patients, which included retraction and some minor instrument modification, only one was converted to an open thoracotomy. All patients underwent a lymph node dissection, which yielded an average of 17 lymph nodes.
As is usually the case with initial series comparisons, the procedure time for the robotics patients was shown to be a bit longer than that the open thoracotomy group. In conclusion, the author states, and I quote, ""The newly refined 4-armed robotic lobectomy is safe and yields an R 0 resection with complete lymph node removal. It has a lower morbidity, mortality, shorter hospital stay and better quality of life than rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. Technical advances are possible to shorten and improve the operation.""
As many of you have recently read, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has published its recommendation against PSA screening for prostate cancer. Their recommendation applies to U.S. men that do not have symptoms that are considered highly suspicious for prostate cancer regardless of age, race or family history. You may also be aware that the American Urology Association disagrees with the panel's recommendation. Our position on this topic is consistent with the 18,000 physicians that comprise the AUA. It is our belief that the physician members of the AUA are in the best position to appropriately assess the tools and techniques for screening their patients for this serious disease.
This concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing an update to our financial guidance for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. 
Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our guidance for 2011. Our prior forecast was for total 2011 procedures to grow approximately 27% to 29% for the year. We now project procedures to grow approximately 29% to 30% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. 
Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue guidance. On our last call, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow approximately 19% to 21% above 2010 results. Based upon higher capital and recurring revenue projections, we are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase between 22% and 23% for the year. 
We are also slightly increasing our guidance for 2011 gross margin percentage. Our previous guidance was for full year 2011 gross margin to come in at roughly 72% of revenue. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage now stands at 72.3%. We now forecast our full year 2011 gross profit percentage to be consistent with these year-to-date results within the range of between 72% and 72.5%.
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven primarily by higher variable expenses associated with our higher revenue forecast, we now anticipate full year 2011 operating expenses to grow between 19.5% and 20.5% above 2010 levels, compared to 18% to 20% growth previously forecast. 
Our guidance for significant noncash expenses remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million and amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million.
We are slightly reducing our guidance for other income which is mainly comprised of interest income. We now expect 2011 other income to total around $15 million, down from the $17 million to $18 million previously forecast. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within a range of between 32% and 33% of pretax income consistent with the guidance provided on our previous call.
We estimate that our diluted share count for calculated Q4 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. Going forward, we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effects of stock option grants.
Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since our guidance calls for over $150 million of noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operation is a better measure of our financial performance than net income. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

We have 60 of the 133 systems went to existing customers, which means that there were 73 customers that bought for the first time. Within both cohorts, both the existing customers, as well as the new first-time buyers, we've seen a pretty good mix across various-sized hospitals from fairly what you might consider smaller hospitals, 2 large hospitals. So I think that continues. I don't know that there is anything remarkably different from one quarter to the next because it ultimately follows the path to the patient. In other words, if the procedures are being performed, procedures like GYN, benign hysterectomy, myomectomy, if they are being performed in smaller hospitals, then it stands to reason that the decisions that are looking to participate in those procedures are going to look toward da Vinci. So it can certainly move into smaller hospitals and it continues to do that. But I don't think there is any new trends to really report on there. As far as the overall number of hospitals that own more than one now, I believe following Q3, there are almost 300 hospitals that have and in fact, 299 hospitals that own more than one system. You have 5 hospitals that own 6 systems, you have 3 hospitals that own 5. You've got 15 that own 4 and you've got 45 that own 3 and 231 that own 2. So I don't know again, that's been fairly consistent. We keep adding to each of those cohorts.

As we have said previously, while we focused on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
Pennsylvania share the following experience, ""I had been suffering with painful periods for almost 2 years. I had already had one  endoscopic surgery and I got very little relief from the pain. After suffering for several more months and having to spend 2 to 3 days in bed each month and every one telling me I needed to have hysterectomy, I've decided I needed to try something else. Our friend and coworker recommended Dr. to me. I met with him and started to feel that maybe there was hope for me that didn't require hysterectomy. Dr. explained the procedure that he would perform and the risks. He said that there would be an only 8% chance of the endometriosis recurring. He explained that he would be performing the procedure with the help of a robotic arm. I agreed to the procedure and I'm thrilled that I did. The procedure took 1.5 hours. Dr. removed all of the endometriosis and the endometrioma. I have had 2 periods since the surgery, and I'm amazed at the results. I'm living a normal life again. I do still have a normal cramping that accompanies most women's periods but I no longer need to spend several days in bed and take prescription pain relievers. There was very little scaring because the procedure only required 4 small incisions. And the pain I experienced was less than I would experience when I get my period. My only regret is that I didn't find Dr. sooner. When I compared this procedure to my other endoscopic procedure, the da Vinci procedure was far better. There was less scarring and I experienced less pain with the da Vinci procedure. I only took 2 pain pills after the procedure and went back to my normal routine in less than a week. I would definitely recommend the da Vinci.""
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery Beyond the Limits of the Human Hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that really make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."

Overall, the Intuitive team is executing well in our 4 2011 focus areas, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology; second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; third, crisp execution in our product development efforts; and finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery.
Total procedures grew approximately 30% over Q3 2010 with strong year-over-year growth in gynecology. Gynecology procedure performance was solid for all of our target procedures, including hysterectomy for malignant and benign conditions, sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy. In urology, da Vinci Prostatectomy continued to grow year-over-year driven by European uptick. dVP was flat in the quarter on a sequential basis, expected given the summer seasonal slowdown in Europe. 
For follow-on procedures in urology, our penetration into treatment for kidney cancer continues to grow as more total nephrectomies are converting to nephron-sparing partial nephrectomies enabled by da Vinci.
Emerging procedures in thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery continued to show strength both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Transoral robotic surgery grew nicely on a year-over-year basis, however, absolute volumes in TORS are relatively small and quarter-to-quarter variation is significant. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.
Operating highlights for the third quarter are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 30% over the third quarter of 2010. We sold 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 105 during the third quarter of last year, 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers. 
Total revenue was $447 million, up 30% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $176 million, up 38% over Q3 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $248 million, up 34% from prior year and comprising 55% of total revenue. Net income was $122 million, up 41% over the last year. We generated an operating profit of $214 million before noncash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year and represented [Audio Gap] of Q3 revenue.
We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $181 million used in the repurchase of our stock. 
Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $91 million from stock proceeds and $19 million provided by working capital, we generated $190 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 155% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter.
Turning to products. We received FDA approval for our suction irrigation instrument in the quarter, which, combined with the new thoracic grasper and new bipolar dissector, comprises an instrument kit designed to facilitate thoracic procedures. Early uptake of our thoracic instrument kit has been encouraging. 
As we mentioned on our last call, we continued to answer questions posed by FDA on our Single-Site and vessel sealing products. Our interactions with FDA have been constructive and our teams are working diligently to answer their questions. 
Our stapler continues to progress through its validation and testing processes and progress there remains encouraging. Given the current uncertainty of the U.S. regulatory process, we do not have additional information to share with you regarding timing for approval or launch of these products.
With regard to recently launched products, our Firefly fluorescence imaging system is gaining acceptance with customers, primarily for visualizing vasculature in partial nephrectomy procedures. We are also pleased with the continued uptake of our da Vinci simulators and feedback on their use. Simulators and dual consoles are providing our customers with targeted tools to improve the quality and accessibility of robotic surgery training reflected in strong simulator purchases and steady demand for dual consoles. 
Lastly, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. In the quarter, we moved our manufacturing operation to our new facility built to allow for increased capacity and proximity to our R&D center. We added 76 people to our team, predominantly in manufacturing, sales and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,845 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as",1438,"Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $176 million, up 38% compared with $128 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 3% compared with $172 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by procedure growth of 30% and early adopter purchases of recently launched products, including our Firefly and thoracic instrument sets. Quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by procedure growth and sales of our recently launched products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of approximately $1,950 per procedure was higher than the $1,830 realized in the third quarter of 2010, and slightly higher than the $1,940 achieved in the second quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory products.
Third quarter 2011 systems revenue of $199 million increased 25% compared with $160 million of systems revenue through the third quarter of 2010, and increased 7% compared with $187 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2011. Our higher third quarter 2011 systems revenue was driven by higher system unit sales and higher system ASPs. We sold 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared with 105 systems in the third quarter of the 2010 and 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011. 
The third quarter of 2011 system count included 35 systems involving trade-ins of order units, comprised of 14 standard systems and 21 da Vinci Ss During the second quarter of 2011, 36 systems involved trade-in comprised of 15 standard units and 21 da Vinci Ss. The third quarter 2010 system count included 15 standard system trade-ins, but excluded 10 S to Si upgrades that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field.
Upgrade revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately $5 million compared with $10 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $1 million for the second quarter of 2011. Prior-year upgrade revenue included the 10 S to Si upgrade. 
Our third quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades was $1.46 million, an increase from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter of 2010 and an increase compared with the $1.44 million realized in the second quarter. The increase in average sales price reflects higher proportion of dual console systems in the product mix as we sold 29 dual console systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 21 in the second quarter 2011. Also benefiting the year-over-year comparison is revenue associated with our simulator product. 
ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix. We sold 98 simulators in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 115 during the second quarter of 2011, which included 33 on backorder from the first quarter of 2011. 
In total, we have sold 260 simulators in the first 9 months since its introduction. The large majority of simulators are purchased in conjunction with new da Vinci System sales and are included in our systems ASP calculation. 
Service revenue increased to $72 million, up 25% compared with $57 million last year, and up 6% compared with $68 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger systems installed base.
Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $248 million, up 34% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total third quarter revenue compared with 54% in the third quarter last year and 56% last quarter. 
International results were as follows: Procedures outside of the U.S. grew 34%,  on a year-to-year basis, with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we also experienced growth in our other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe. Third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $94 million, up 59% compared with revenue of $59 million in the third quarter of 2010 and up 9% compared with revenue of $87 million in the second quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue outside the U.S. grew 51% year-over-year and decreased 7% sequentially driven by summer seasonality. We sold 34 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 30 last quarter. We sold 18 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 16 in the third quarter of 2010 and 16 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was of 73% compared with 73% for the third quarter of 2010 and 72% for the second quarter of 2011. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2011 was driven by higher system ASPs and lower service parts consumption. Third quarter 2011 operating expenses of $147 million were up 24% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects cost associated with employees added during the quarter, higher engineering project costs and variable costs associated with increased revenue. We added 76 employees in the quarter, including 47 employees in product operations and 25 employees in commercial operations. 
Third quarter 2011 operating income was $179 million or 40% of sales compared with $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010 and $168 million or 39% of sales for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $35 million last quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first 6 months of 2011 and lower than the 37% reflected in the previous year. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower foreign and state taxes. 
Our net income was $122 million or $3.05 per share compared with $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010 and $117 million or $2.91 per share for the second quarter of 2011. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 9 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.26 billion, up 23% compared with $1.02 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 31% and an increase in systems revenue of 15%. Operating income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $495 million, up 23% compared with $402 million last year. Operating income included $102 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2011 compared with $88 million in 2010. Net income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $344 million or $8.55 per share compared with $261 million or $6.45 per share last year. Gross cash flows from operations for the first 9 months of 2011 totaled $527 million compared with $416 million last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $1.89 billion, up $65 million compared with June 30, 2011. The increase was driven by $190 million of gross cash flows from operations plus $91 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $181 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases.
During the third quarter, we bought back 526,000 shares at an average price of $344 per share. As of September 30, there was $68 million of the Board-authorized buybacks remaining. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $265 million at September 30 from $250 million at June 30, primarily reflecting the higher or the impact of higher third quarter revenue. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter.
Our net inventory increased to $109 million at September 30 from $100 million at June 30. Our higher inventory reflects our business growth, expanded product offering and safety stocks acquired for key components. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

As part of the 133 system sales, 14 standard da Vinci Systems and 21 da Vinci S Systems were traded in",1475,"Thank you, Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 133 da Vinci Systems: 99 in the United States, 18 into Europe and 16 into rest of world markets. As part of the 133 system sales, 14 standard da Vinci Systems and 21 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 98 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,031, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,478 in the U.S., 357 in Europe and 196 in rest of world markets. 60 of the 133 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 117 of the 133 systems sold represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 29 dual console systems. The 34 system sales internationally included 6 da Vinci Systems into Japan, 6 into Germany, 4 into India and 3 into Spain.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Colorectal and thoracic surgery growth was particularly strong, while gynecology displayed solid sequential growth, specifically, benign hysterectomy and myomectomy. 
As mentioned in the past, Q3 represents certain seasonal challenges specifically in Europe. The months of July and August are particularly slow. Our European system sales growth for the quarter was less affected than our EU procedure business during these months. Our systems sales performance in Europe continues to be fueled by urology. 
Q3 represents a quieter quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. However, it represented a very productive quarter for clinical publications within the medical journal. This quarter alone, nearly 400 papers and abstracts appeared within various peer-reviewed journals. Gynecology, urology, general and colorectal, head/neck, cardiac and thoracic surgery were well represented. 
The British Journal of Urology, which is considered to be among the more conservative and most respected peer-reviewed urology journals in circulation, dedicated their entire September edition to papers reporting on da Vinci's role within their field. The edition contained 15 papers covering a wide range of da Vinci studies, including dVP, da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty. 
In addition to the market clinical reports in comparisons, there were also procedure technique and economic cost reviews. A few reports offered neutral or even clinical analysis of robotic surgery, but the majority were positive. Rather than taking time to review each of these papers in detail, I'll take a moment to highlight some of the written observations and conclusions. 
With regard to da Vinci Cystectomy, Dr. Lee and his team from Cornell concluded that despite an increased materials cost, robotic radical cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open radical cystectomy as a treatment for bladder cancer when the impact of complications is considered. With respect to da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy, Doctors Abreu and Gill from USC reported that within their study, 0 ischemia robotic partial nephrectomy was successful in all cases without any higher eclamping and the warm ischemia time was 0 in all cases.
They also stated that the elimination of warm ischemia may ultimately preserve renal function. Doctors Cha and Lee wrote, ""Robotic partial nephrectomy appears to be a viable minimally invasive option for nephrons-sparing surgery. Robotic partial nephrectomy may reduce some of the technical challenges associated with lap partial nephrectomy, and thus, extend the potential benefits of minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery to a larger population.""
[Audio Gap], simply, that da Vinci has become an integral tool in urologic cancer surgery, and its presence in the global urologic community has become widespread. The dedication of an entire British Journal of Urology edition to robotic surgery is just further evidence of this phenomenon. 
A very large observational study comprised of over 19,000 prostate cancer surgery patients appeared in the British Journal of Urology a month earlier. The study analyzed the substitution that took place between open prostatectomy and minimally invasive prostatectomy over a 4-year period beginning in 2003. These patients had their prostatectomy between 2003 and 2006. However, the reported trends should certainly apply to subsequent years.
The study emanated out of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and was a collaboration between the Division of Urology and the Center for Surgery and Public Health. The aim of the study was to determine differences in surgical outcomes by surgical approach during a period of rapid adoption for the minimally invasive surgical approach to radical prostatectomy. The study noted that minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had grown from 5.7% of the U.S. prostatectomies in 2003 to approximately 39.2% in 2006. At the same time, open prostatectomy decreased by approximately 33.5%. 
During this study period, the length of hospital stay for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy decreased from 2 days to 1 day, and the length of stay for [Audio Gap] 3.2 days to 2.9 days. The perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had decreased from 13.8% to 10.7% while at the perioperative complication rate for open prostatectomy had decreased from 18.1% to 14.6%. Said another way, the perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy at the end of 2006 was 27% less than it was for open prostatectomy. 
When comparing the data over the entire 4-year study period, the results were fairly striking. Perioperative complications were 27% less for the minimally invasive group. Blood transfusions were fewer by 83%. Anastomotic strictures were fewer by 51%, and length of stay was shorter by 42%.
In their conclusions, the authors stated, and I quote, ""The increased use of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy corresponds with a decreasing trend for complications, blood transfusions, length of stay and need for reoperation. Additionally, minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was found to have fewer associated complications compared with men undergoing the open procedure.""
As we've mentioned in previous calls, da Vinci's role within the specialty of thoracic surgery is on the rise. The desire to reduce or eliminate large, painful intercostal incisions is shared mutually by patients and surgeons. Traditional video-assisted thoracoscopy has provided some relief for patients. However, its adoption has been somewhat limited to smaller, less complex procedures.  
While da Vinci Lobectomy, wedged and segmental procedures, are relatively new, with instrument sets that have yet to be optimized, it's early adoption has been strong. In a recent edition of the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Dr. Robert Cerfolio and his team from the University of Alabama, Birmingham published a study on their initial 168 consecutive completely portal robotic pulmonary resections. The study took place over a 14-month period and included lobectomies, wedge and segmental resections. The majority, 106 patients, had da Vinci Lobectomies. The results of the da Vinci patients were compared to 318 propensity-matched patients who underwent a rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. The metrics that made up the comparison were morbidity, mortality, quality of life, hospitalization and operative time.
Dr. Cerfolio reported that the da Vinci group had a morbidity rate of 27% compared to a 38% morbidity rate for the thoracotomy group. Associated mortality was 0 for the da Vinci group and 3.1% for the thoracotomy group.
Quality-of-life metrics were defined as the subject's functioning and well-being in the physical, psychological and social domains in relation to their disease and treatment. In this comparison, the da Vinci group scored 53 compared to 40 with the thoracotomy group. Hospitalization was reduced in half, 4 days to 2, when performing these procedures robotically.
And finally, technical procedure improvements in their final 106 patients, which included fourth arm retraction and some minor instrument modification, only one was converted to an open thoracotomy. All patients underwent a lymph node dissection, which yielded an average of 17 lymph nodes.
As is usually the case with initial series comparisons, the procedure time for the robotics patients was shown to be a bit longer than with the open thoracotomy group. 
In conclusion, the author states, and I quote, ""The newly refined 4-arm robotic lobectomy is safe and yields an R0 resection with complete lymph node removal. It has a lower morbidity, mortality, shorter hospital stay and better quality of life than rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. Technical advances are possible to shorten and improve the operation.""
As many of you have recently read, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has published its recommendations against PSA screening for prostate cancer. Their recommendation applies to U.S. men that do not have symptoms that are considered highly suspicious for prostate cancer, regardless of age, race or family history. You may also be aware that the American Urology Association disagrees with the panel's recommendation. Our position on this topic is consistent with the 18,000 physicians that comprise the AUA. It is our belief that the physician members of the AUA are in the best position to appropriately assess the tools and techniques for screening their patients for this serious disease.
This concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing an update to our financial guidance for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our guidance for 2011. Our prior forecast was for total 2011 procedures to grow approximately 27% to 29% for the year. We now project procedures to grow approximately 29% to 30% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. 
Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue guidance. On our last call, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow approximately 19% to 21% above 2010 results. Based upon higher capital and recurring revenue projections, we are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase between 22% and 23% for the year. 
We are also slightly increasing our guidance for 2011 gross margin percentage. Our previous guidance was for full year 2011 gross margin to come in at roughly 72% of revenue. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage now stands at 72.3%. We now forecast our full year 2011 gross profit percentage to be consistent with these year-to-date results within the range of between 72% and 72.5%.
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven primarily by higher variable expenses associated with our higher revenue forecast, we now anticipate full year 2011 operating expenses to grow between 19.5% and 20.5% above 2010 levels, compared to 18% to 20% growth previously forecast. 
Our guidance for significant noncash expenses remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million and amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million.
We are slightly reducing our guidance for other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income. We now expect 2011 other income to total around $15 million, down from the $17 million to $18 million previously forecast. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within a range of between 32% and 33% of pretax income, consistent with the guidance provided on our previous call.
We estimate that our diluted share count for calculated Q4 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. Going forward, we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effects of stock option grants.
Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since our guidance calls for over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income. 
And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

And the majority of the growth in dVP should happen outside the United States. In the short period, we've had, following the patients in the discussions we've had with the physicians, a lot of physicians believe that they will follow the guidelines of the AUA. Now how that unfolds over time is really anyone's guess at this point. And we're not going to speculate what that what might mean.

We had 60 of the 133 systems went to existing customers, which means that there were 73 customers that bought for the first time. Within both cohorts, both the existing customers, as well as the new first-time buyers, we've seen a, I'd say, a pretty good mix across various-sized hospitals from fairly, what you might consider smaller hospitals to large hospitals. So I think that continues. I don't know that there's anything remarkably different from one quarter to the next because it ultimately follows the path to the patient. In other words, if the procedures are being performed, procedures like GYN, benign hysterectomy, myomectomies, if they're being performed in smaller hospitals, then it stands to reason that the physicians that are looking to participate in those procedures are going to look toward da Vinci. So it can certainly move into smaller hospitals and it continues to do that. But I don't think there's any new trends to really report on there. As far as the overall number of hospitals that own more than one now, I believe following Q3, there are almost 300 hospitals that have, and in fact, 299 hospitals that own more than one system. You have 5 hospitals that own 6 systems, you have 3 hospitals that own 5, you've got 15 that own 4 and you've got 45 that own 3 and 231 that own 2. So I don't know. Again, that's been fairly consistent. We keep adding to the -- each of those cohorts.

But I think you've heard us over the years, and certainly you have been following us for as long as you've had. In that, we look at early adopters and recognize that early adopters will put up with what we term as fiddle factors, something that is less than optimized. And we saw it with prostatectomy. We saw it with hysterectomy. We've seen with just about everything we've done. And when we look at general surgery, specifically colon and rectal surgery, there is a very good set of instrumentation. There's ways to manage the vessels either by suturing, by using our PK device or our harmonic device and/or stapling through an ancillary port. It's just not optimized in the sense that the surgeon has to break the choreography, have someone else do tests that they would like to do or should do or believe is in their best interest to do or break scrub and so on and so forth. Now despite all of that, we're seeing very nice trajectories in the growth in both in low anterior resection, in sigmoid resection, in right colon resections, in thoracic surgery. But as you said, we're not going to break those out in detail. I would say that it is very encouraging at an early stage, but it's difficult to tell you much more without really going into the details or the numbers. Is it necessary to have those other instruments? We believe to get the full optimization, you have to optimize the procedure, you have to optimize the instrument set. You'll grow until you get there, but hopefully, if you spec the instruments right, it should be a nice addition to the armamentarium."

And we're working on getting its approval in the U.S.
That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focused on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
Lori of Pennsylvania share the following experience, ""I had been suffering with painful periods for almost 2 years. I had already had one endoscopic surgery, and I got very little relief from the pain. After suffering for several more months and having to spend 2 to 3 days in bed each month and every one telling me I needed to have a hysterectomy, I decided I needed to try something else. A friend and co-worker recommended Dr. Coslett to me. I met with him and started to feel that maybe there was hope for me that didn't require hysterectomy. Dr. Coslett explained the procedure that he would perform and the risks. He said there would be only an 8% chance of the endometriosis recurring. He explained that he would be performing the procedure with the help of a robotic arm. I agreed to the procedure and I am thrilled that I did. That procedure took 1.5 hours. Dr. Coslett removed all of the endometriosis and an endometrioma. I have had 2 periods since the surgery, and I'm amazed at the results. I'm living a normal life again. I do still have the normal cramping that accompanies most women's periods, but I no longer need to spend several days in bed and take prescription pain relievers. There was very little scarring because the procedure only required 4 small incisions. And the pain I experienced was less than I would do -- than I would experience when I get my period. My only regret is that I didn't find Dr. Coslett sooner. When I compared this procedure to my other endoscopic procedure, the da Vinci procedure was far better. There was less scarring, and I experienced less pain with the da Vinci procedure. I only took 2 pain pills after the procedure and went back to my normal routine in less than a week. I would definitely recommend the da Vinci.""
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committing to driving the vital few things that really make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."

30239,139431450,173630,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the growth in da Vinci procedures and with the performance of our capital and clinical teams in the third quarter. Overall, the Intuitive team is executing well in our 4 2011 focus areas, which are first",729,"Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the growth in da Vinci procedures and with the performance of our capital and clinical teams in the third quarter. Overall, the Intuitive team is executing well in our 4 2011 focus areas, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology; second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; third, crisp execution in our product development efforts; and finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery.
Total procedures grew approximately 30% over Q3 2010 with strong year-over-year growth in gynecology. Gynecology procedure performance was solid for all of our target procedures, including hysterectomy for malignant and benign conditions, sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy. In urology, da Vinci Prostatectomy continued to grow year-over-year driven by European uptick. dVP was flat in the quarter on a sequential basis, expected given the summer seasonal slowdown in Europe. 
For follow-on procedures in urology, our penetration into treatment for kidney cancer continues to grow as more total nephrectomies are converting to nephron-sparing partial nephrectomies enabled by da Vinci.
Emerging procedures in thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery continued to show strength both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Transoral robotic surgery grew nicely on a year-over-year basis, however, absolute volumes in TORS are relatively small and quarter-to-quarter variation is significant. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.
Operating highlights for the third quarter are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 30% over the third quarter of 2010. We sold 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 105 during the third quarter of last year, 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers. 
Total revenue was $447 million, up 30% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $176 million, up 38% over Q3 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $248 million, up 34% from prior year and comprising 55% of total revenue. Net income was $122 million, up 41% over the last year. We generated an operating profit of $214 million before noncash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year and represented [Audio Gap] of Q3 revenue.
We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $181 million used in the repurchase of our stock. 
Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $91 million from stock proceeds and $19 million provided by working capital, we generated $190 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 155% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter.
Turning to products. We received FDA approval for our suction irrigation instrument in the quarter, which, combined with the new thoracic grasper and new bipolar dissector, comprises an instrument kit designed to facilitate thoracic procedures. Early uptake of our thoracic instrument kit has been encouraging. 
As we mentioned on our last call, we continued to answer questions posed by FDA on our Single-Site and vessel sealing products. Our interactions with FDA have been constructive and our teams are working diligently to answer their questions. 
Our stapler continues to progress through its validation and testing processes and progress there remains encouraging. Given the current uncertainty of the U.S. regulatory process, we do not have additional information to share with you regarding timing for approval or launch of these products.
With regard to recently launched products, our Firefly fluorescence imaging system is gaining acceptance with customers, primarily for visualizing vasculature in partial nephrectomy procedures. We are also pleased with the continued uptake of our da Vinci simulators and feedback on their use. Simulators and dual consoles are providing our customers with targeted tools to improve the quality and accessibility of robotic surgery training reflected in strong simulator purchases and steady demand for dual consoles. 
Lastly, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. In the quarter, we moved our manufacturing operation to our new facility built to allow for increased capacity and proximity to our R&D center. We added 76 people to our team, predominantly in manufacturing, sales and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,845 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as",1439,"Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $176 million, up 38% compared with $128 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 3% compared with $172 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by procedure growth of 30% and early adopter purchases of recently launched products, including our Firefly and thoracic instrument sets. Quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by procedure growth and sales of our recently launched products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of approximately $1,950 per procedure was higher than the $1,830 realized in the third quarter of 2010, and slightly higher than the $1,940 achieved in the second quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory products.
Third quarter 2011 systems revenue of $199 million increased 25% compared with $160 million of systems revenue through the third quarter of 2010, and increased 7% compared with $187 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2011. Our higher third quarter 2011 systems revenue was driven by higher system unit sales and higher system ASPs. We sold 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared with 105 systems in the third quarter of the 2010 and 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011. 
The third quarter of 2011 system count included 35 systems involving trade-ins of order units, comprised of 14 standard systems and 21 da Vinci Ss. During the second quarter of 2011, 36 systems involved trade-in comprised of 15 standard units and 21 da Vinci Ss. The third quarter 2010 system count included 15 standard system trade-ins, but excluded 10 S to Si upgrades that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field.
Upgrade revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately $5 million compared with $10 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $1 million for the second quarter of 2011. Prior-year upgrade revenue included the 10 S to Si upgrade. 
Our third quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades was $1.46 million, an increase from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter of 2010 and an increase compared with the $1.44 million realized in the second quarter. The increase in average sales price reflects a higher proportion of dual console systems in the product mix as we sold 29 dual console systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 21 in the second quarter 2011. Also benefiting the year-over-year comparison is revenue associated with our simulator product. 
ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix. We sold 98 simulators in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 115 during the second quarter of 2011, which included 33 on backorder from the first quarter of 2011. 
In total, we have sold 260 simulators in the first 9 months since its introduction. The large majority of simulators are purchased in conjunction with new da Vinci System sales and are included in our systems ASP calculation. 
Service revenue increased to $72 million, up 25% compared with $57 million last year, and up 6% compared with $68 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger systems installed base.
Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $248 million, up 34% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total third quarter revenue compared with 54% in the third quarter last year and 56% last quarter. 
International results were as follows: Procedures outside of the U.S. grew 34%,  on a year-to-year basis, with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we also experienced growth in our other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe. Third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $94 million, up 59% compared with revenue of $59 million in the third quarter of 2010 and up 9% compared with revenue of $87 million in the second quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue outside the U.S. grew 51% year-over-year and decreased 7% sequentially driven by summer seasonality. We sold 34 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 30 last quarter. We sold 18 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 16 in the third quarter of 2010 and 16 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was of 73% compared with 73% for the third quarter of 2010 and 72% for the second quarter of 2011. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2011 was driven by higher system ASPs and lower service parts consumption. Third quarter 2011 operating expenses of $147 million were up 24% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects cost associated with employees added during the quarter, higher engineering project costs and variable costs associated with increased revenue. We added 76 employees in the quarter, including 47 employees in product operations and 25 employees in commercial operations. 
Third quarter 2011 operating income was $179 million or 40% of sales compared with $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010 and $168 million or 39% of sales for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $35 million last quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first 6 months of 2011 and lower than the 37% reflected in the previous year. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower foreign and state taxes. 
Our net income was $122 million or $3.05 per share compared with $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010 and $117 million or $2.91 per share for the second quarter of 2011. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 9 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.26 billion, up 23% compared with $1.02 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 31% and an increase in systems revenue of 15%. Operating income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $495 million, up 23% compared with $402 million last year. Operating income included $102 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2011 compared with $88 million in 2010. Net income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $344 million or $8.55 per share compared with $261 million or $6.45 per share last year. Gross cash flows from operations for the first 9 months of 2011 totaled $527 million compared with $416 million last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $1.89 billion, up $65 million compared with June 30, 2011. The increase was driven by $190 million of gross cash flows from operations plus $91 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $181 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases.
During the third quarter, we bought back 526,000 shares at an average price of $344 per share. As of September 30, there was $68 million of the Board-authorized buybacks remaining. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $265 million at September 30 from $250 million at June 30, primarily reflecting the higher or the impact of higher third quarter revenue. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter.
Our net inventory increased to $109 million at September 30 from $100 million at June 30. Our higher inventory reflects our business growth, expanded product offering and safety stocks acquired for key components. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

As part of the 133 system sales, 14 standard da Vinci Systems and 21 da Vinci S Systems were traded in",1475,"Thank you, Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 133 da Vinci Systems: 99 in the United States, 18 into Europe and 16 into rest of world markets. As part of the 133 system sales, 14 standard da Vinci Systems and 21 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 98 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,031, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,478 in the U.S., 357 in Europe and 196 in rest of world markets. 60 of the 133 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 117 of the 133 systems sold represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 29 dual console systems. The 34 system sales internationally included 6 da Vinci Systems into Japan, 6 into Germany, 4 into India and 3 into Spain.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Colorectal and thoracic surgery growth was particularly strong, while gynecology displayed solid sequential growth, specifically, benign hysterectomy and myomectomy. 
As mentioned in the past, Q3 represents certain seasonal challenges specifically in Europe. The months of July and August are particularly slow. Our European system sales growth for the quarter was less affected than our EU procedure business during these months. Our systems sales performance in Europe continues to be fueled by urology. 
Q3 represents a quieter quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. However, it represented a very productive quarter for clinical publications within the medical journal. This quarter alone, nearly 400 papers and abstracts appeared within various peer-reviewed journals. Gynecology, urology, general and colorectal, head/neck, cardiac and thoracic surgery were well represented. 
The British Journal of Urology, which is considered to be among the more conservative and most respected peer-reviewed urology journals in circulation, dedicated their entire September edition to papers reporting on da Vinci's role within their field. The edition contained 15 papers covering a wide range of da Vinci studies, including dVP, da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty. 
In addition to the market clinical reports in comparisons, there were also procedure technique and economic cost reviews. A few reports offered neutral or even clinical analysis of robotic surgery, but the majority were positive. Rather than taking time to review each of these papers in detail, I'll take a moment to highlight some of the written observations and conclusions. 
With regard to da Vinci Cystectomy, Dr. Lee and his team from Cornell concluded that despite an increased materials cost, robotic radical cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open radical cystectomy as a treatment for bladder cancer when the impact of complications is considered. With respect to da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy, Doctors Abreu and Gill from USC reported that within their study, 0 ischemia robotic partial nephrectomy was successful in all cases without any higher eclamping and the warm ischemia time was 0 in all cases.
They also stated that the elimination of warm ischemia may ultimately preserve renal function. Doctors Cha and Lee wrote, ""Robotic partial nephrectomy appears to be a viable minimally invasive option for nephron-sparing surgery. Robotic partial nephrectomy may reduce some of the technical challenges associated with lap partial nephrectomy, and thus, extend the potential benefits of minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery to a larger population.""
[Audio Gap], simply, that da Vinci has become an integral tool in urologic cancer surgery, and its presence in the global urologic community has become widespread. The dedication of an entire British Journal of Urology edition to robotic surgery is just further evidence of this phenomenon. 
A very large observational study comprised of over 19,000 prostate cancer surgery patients appeared in the British Journal of Urology a month earlier. The study analyzed the substitution that took place between open prostatectomy and minimally invasive prostatectomy over a 4-year period beginning in 2003. These patients had their prostatectomy between 2003 and 2006. However, the reported trends should certainly apply to subsequent years.
The study emanated out of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and was a collaboration between the Division of Urology and the Center for Surgery and Public Health. The aim of the study was to determine differences in surgical outcomes by surgical approach during a period of rapid adoption for the minimally invasive surgical approach to radical prostatectomy. The study noted that minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had grown from 5.7% of the U.S. prostatectomies in 2003 to approximately 39.2% in 2006. At the same time, open prostatectomy decreased by approximately 33.5%. 
During this study period, the length of hospital stay for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy decreased from 2 days to 1 day, and the length of stay for [Audio Gap] 3.2 days to 2.9 days. The perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had decreased from 13.8% to 10.7% while at the perioperative complication rate for open prostatectomy had decreased from 18.1% to 14.6%. Said another way, the perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy at the end of 2006 was 27% less than it was for open prostatectomy. 
When comparing the data over the entire 4-year study period, the results were fairly striking. Perioperative complications were 27% less for the minimally invasive group. Blood transfusions were fewer by 83%. Anastomotic strictures were fewer by 51%, and length of stay was shorter by 42%.
In their conclusions, the authors stated, and I quote, ""The increased use of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy corresponds with a decreasing trend for complications, blood transfusions, length of stay and need for reoperation. Additionally, minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was found to have fewer associated complications compared with men undergoing the open procedure.""
As we've mentioned in previous calls, da Vinci's role within the specialty of thoracic surgery is on the rise. The desire to reduce or eliminate large, painful intercostal incisions is shared mutually by patients and surgeons. Traditional video-assisted thoracoscopy has provided some relief for patients. However, its adoption has been somewhat limited to smaller, less complex procedures.  
While da Vinci Lobectomy, wedged and segmental procedures, are relatively new, with instrument sets that have yet to be optimized, it's early adoption has been strong. In a recent edition of the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Dr. Robert Cerfolio and his team from the University of Alabama, Birmingham published a study on their initial 168 consecutive completely portal robotic pulmonary resections. The study took place over a 14-month period and included lobectomies, wedge and segmental resections. The majority, 106 patients, had da Vinci Lobectomies. The results of the da Vinci patients were compared to 318 propensity-matched patients who underwent a rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. The metrics that made up the comparison were morbidity, mortality, quality of life, hospitalization and operative time.
Dr. Cerfolio reported that the da Vinci group had a morbidity rate of 27% compared to a 38% morbidity rate for the thoracotomy group. Associated mortality was 0 for the da Vinci group and 3.1% for the thoracotomy group.
Quality-of-life metrics were defined as the subject's functioning and well-being in the physical, psychological and social domains in relation to their disease and treatment. In this comparison, the da Vinci group scored 53 compared to 40 with the thoracotomy group. Hospitalization was reduced in half, 4 days to 2, when performing these procedures robotically.
And finally, technical procedure improvements in their final 106 patients, which included fourth arm retraction and some minor instrument modification, only one was converted to an open thoracotomy. All patients underwent a lymph node dissection, which yielded an average of 17 lymph nodes.
As is usually the case with initial series comparisons, the procedure time for the robotics patients was shown to be a bit longer than with the open thoracotomy group. 
In conclusion, the author states, and I quote, ""The newly refined 4-arm robotic lobectomy is safe and yields an R0 resection with complete lymph node removal. It has a lower morbidity, mortality, shorter hospital stay and better quality of life than rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. Technical advances are possible to shorten and improve the operation.""
As many of you have recently read, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has published its recommendations against PSA screening for prostate cancer. Their recommendation applies to U.S. men that do not have symptoms that are considered highly suspicious for prostate cancer, regardless of age, race or family history. You may also be aware that the American Urology Association disagrees with the panel's recommendation. Our position on this topic is consistent with the 18,000 physicians that comprise the AUA. It is our belief that the physician members of the AUA are in the best position to appropriately assess the tools and techniques for screening their patients for this serious disease.
This concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing an update to our financial guidance for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our guidance for 2011. Our prior forecast was for total 2011 procedures to grow approximately 27% to 29% for the year. We now project procedures to grow approximately 29% to 30% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. 
Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue guidance. On our last call, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow approximately 19% to 21% above 2010 results. Based upon higher capital and recurring revenue projections, we are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase between 22% and 23% for the year. 
We are also slightly increasing our guidance for 2011 gross margin percentage. Our previous guidance was for full year 2011 gross margin to come in at roughly 72% of revenue. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage now stands at 72.3%. We now forecast our full year 2011 gross profit percentage to be consistent with these year-to-date results within a range of between 72% and 72.5%.
Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven primarily by higher variable expenses associated with our higher revenue forecast, we now anticipate full year 2011 operating expenses to grow between 19.5% and 20.5% above 2010 levels, compared to 18% to 20% growth previously forecast. 
Our guidance for significant noncash expenses remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million and amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million.
We are slightly reducing our guidance for other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income. We now expect 2011 other income to total around $15 million, down from the $17 million to $18 million previously forecast. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within a range of between 32% and 33% of pretax income, consistent with the guidance provided on our previous call.
We estimate that our diluted share count for calculated Q4 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. Going forward, we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effects of stock option grants.
Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since our guidance calls for over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income. 
And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

And the majority of the growth in dVP should happen outside the United States. In the short period we've had following the panel recommendations and the discussions we've had with physicians, a lot of physicians believe that they will follow the guidelines of the AUA.

We had 60 of the 133 systems went to existing customers, which means that there were 73 customers that bought for the first time. Within both cohorts, both the existing customers, as well as the new first-time buyers, we've seen a, I'd say, a pretty good mix across various-sized hospitals from fairly, what you might consider smaller hospitals to large hospitals. So I think that continues. I don't know that there's anything remarkably different from one quarter to the next because it ultimately follows the path to the patient. In other words, if the procedures are being performed, procedures like GYN, benign hysterectomy, myomectomies, if they're being performed in smaller hospitals, then it stands to reason that the physicians that are looking to participate in those procedures are going to look toward da Vinci. So it can certainly move into smaller hospitals and it continues to do that. But I don't think there's any new trends to really report on there. As far as the overall number of hospitals that own more than one now, I believe following Q3, there are almost 300 hospitals that have, and in fact, 299 hospitals that own more than one system. You have 5 hospitals that own 6 systems, you have 3 hospitals that own 5, you've got 15 that own 4 and you've got 45 that own 3 and 231 that own 2. So I don't know. Again, that's been fairly consistent. We keep adding to the -- each of those cohorts. So I guess, I'll give the -- summarize this long answer, there really isn't anything remarkable that I think we can point to over the past few quarters in terms of demographics."

We saw it with hysterectomy. We've seen with just about everything we've done. And when we look at general surgery, specifically colon and rectal surgery, there is a very good set of instrumentation. There's ways to manage the vessels either by suturing, by using our PK device or our harmonic device and/or stapling through an ancillary port. It's just not optimized in the sense that the surgeon has to break the choreography, have someone else do tasks that they would like to do or should do or believe is in their best interest to do or break scrub and so on and so forth.

That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focused on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
Lori of Pennsylvania shares the following experience, ""I had been suffering with painful periods for almost 2 years. I had already had one endoscopic surgery, and I got very little relief from the pain. After suffering for several more months and having to spend 2 to 3 days in bed each month and everyone telling me I needed to have a hysterectomy, I decided I needed to try something else. A friend and co-worker recommended Dr. Coslett to me. I met with him and started to feel that maybe there was hope for me that didn't require hysterectomy. Dr. Coslett explained the procedure that he would perform and the risks. He said there would be only an 8% chance of the endometriosis recurring. He explained that he would be performing the procedure with the help of a robotic arm. I agreed to the procedure and I am thrilled that I did. That procedure took 1.5 hours. Dr. Coslett removed all of the endometriosis and an endometrioma. I have had 2 periods since the surgery, and I'm amazed at the results. I'm leading a normal life again. I do still have the normal cramping that accompanies most women's periods, but I no longer need to spend several days in bed and take prescription pain relievers. There was very little scarring because the procedure only required 4 small incisions. And the pain I experienced was less than I would do -- than I would experience when I get my period. My only regret is that I didn't find Dr. Coslett sooner. When I compared this procedure to my other endoscopic procedure, the da Vinci procedure was far better. There was less scarring, and I experienced less pain with the da Vinci procedure. I only took 2 pain pills after the procedure and went back to my normal routine in less than a week. I would definitely recommend the da Vinci.""
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committing to driving the vital few things that really make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."
