I’m very pleased to report that RAI finished up a strong year with excellent performance across its operating companies.  As our results show, both of our reportable business segments delivered additional volume and share gained on key brands in Q4, and this drove increases in adjusted earnings and margins.  For the full year, R. J. Reynolds and American Snuff continued to generate profitable growth, despite ongoing weakness in consumer spending, and continued competitive activity.
In addition, Santa Fe had another great year, delivering double digit growth in both volume and earnings. In fact, the company’s Natural American Spirit brand delivered growth on every style, and in every state last year. This successful performance demonstrates not just the fundamental strength of our operating company’s key brand, but also the effective execution of their business strategy. 
And RAI continued to deliver outstanding value to our shareholders in 2010, with a dividend increase of 8.9% and a two for one stock split. We also announced an increase in our dividend payout target to 80%, which further demonstrates our commitment to returning value to shareholders. As you know, this is my last earnings call before I retire at the end of this month.  It’s been a pleasure and a privilege to lead this company for the past six and a half years, and I’ve enjoyed working with and getting to know so many of you in the financial community. 
Given RAI’s tremendous achievements over this period, and its current positive momentum, I am confident that great things lie ahead for this company and for its talented people.  As we’ve demonstrated over the years, we’ll continue to deliver on our commitment to all of our stakeholders. And now I’d like to hand the call over to Dan, who will give you a closer look at our 2010 performance.

399584,118795075,98759,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you Susan, and hello everyone. As you’ve just heard, our operating companies delivered strong Q4 and full year results, driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I’m pleased to report that R",1148,"Thank you Susan, and hello everyone. As you’ve just heard, our operating companies delivered strong Q4 and full year results, driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I’m pleased to report that R.J. Reynolds’s cigarette brand portfolio strategy is working extremely well, with gains on both brands continuing to offset declines on the company’s other cigarette brands. 
As you know, we made a decision sometime back to de-emphasize and eliminate our private label brands in order to reduce complexity. Excluding those brands, R. J. Reynolds share in Q4 increased by a full share point, to 28.1%. Even factoring in the declining private label brands, the company’s total cigarette market share was 28.3%, down just two-tenths of a percentage point. This holds true for the full year as well.  Total 2010 cigarette market share was 28.1%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from the prior year. 
Excluding the private label brands, its market share was up seven-tenths of a percentage point, at 27.5%. Both of R. J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, played major roles in the company’s strong performance. Combined growth brand market share increased 2.9 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.2%. These two brands accounted for more than 55% of R. J. Reynolds total volume. 
Camel’s Q4 cigarette market share increased by sixth-tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 8%, with the brand’s highest market share in more than 40 years.  For the full year, Camel’s market share rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 7.7%.  Camel’s improving share and demographics continue to benefit from growing consumer interest in its menthol styles.  These styles use capsule technology to offer adult smokers more fresh menthol flavor on demand, a unique product point of difference over competitive menthol brands. 
Also enhancing the brand’s performance in the growing menthol category is Camel Crush, which uses the same technology to offer the option of regular or menthol with each cigarette. Including Camel Crush, Camel’s menthol market share jumped seven-tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter, to 2.1%.  Camel is also performing well as a total tobacco brand, with further equity building and refinements to its innovative, modern smoke free tobacco products. 
Camel SNUS continued to perform well, even with lower levels of promotional support, and its performance is being enhanced by two new styles, Robust and Winterchill, that were added in Q3.  These larger pouch products offer adult tobacco consumers a richer, more full bodied tobacco taste as well as smoke free and spit free convenience. In Camel’s new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Camel Orbs, Sticks, and Strips, have received product and packaging upgrades and will be introduced in two new lead markets in March. 
Now, turning to R. J. Reynolds other growth brand, Pall Mall; by all measures Pall Mall had an outstanding year as the nation’s fastest growing major cigarette brand.  Pall Mall increased its Q4 market share by 2.3 percentage points, to 8.3%. For the full year, Pall Mall gained 2.7 percentage point to 7.4%. That’s the brand’s highest market share since 1975. Trial and conversion to Pall Mall continue to increase while promotional levels remain steady. 
For value conscious adult smokers, Pall Mall offers a meaningful product point of difference from other value brands, by delivering a high quality, longer lasting cigarette at an affordable price. That’s a true value proposition. Another drive performance at R. J. Reynolds is their continued focus on product improvement. This ongoing process is making the company much more efficient and focused, while freeing up resources to investing growth for the long term. 
Even though they’ve already made great strides on this front, there’s still more to come. R. J. Reynolds has dramatically reduced its product offerings, and by doing so, it’s also driving down complexity. The company ended the year with less than 150 SKUs, a reduction that represents four out of every five of the SKUs that it had back in 2004, and they plan further reductions in 2011. The company is also in the process of further improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies, with the consolidation of three facilities into its largest factory in Tobaccoville. 
As a result of this move, the company has offered buyouts to members of the manufacturing workforce, to better align resources with production needs. Additionally, R. J. Reynolds plans to build a new R&D annex at its Tobaccoville manufacturing center, with construction starting this summer. This will be a smaller, more modern facility that will better meet the company’s future needs. As you know, R. J. Reynolds recently expanded its field trade marketing organization to serve American Snuff. 
This transition has gone extremely well, and we’re already starting to reap the benefits of this change. So, R. J. Reynolds has made substantial progress on many fronts this year, and this demonstrates the growing momentum that positions the company well in the coming year, and far into the future. 
Turning to American Snuff, the company finished the year on a very strong note, with higher moist snuff pricing and volume, driving gains and adjusted operating income and share for both Q4 and the full year. American Snuff’s first half of the year was especially challenging, with high levels of competitive promotional activity and value price line extensions, as well as declines in their roll your own and other non core tobacco products, following increased Federal excise taxes. 
However, the company made up substantial ground as it moved through the year, with equity enhancements to the Grizzly brand driving that growth.  The company’s total Q4 moist snuff consumer offtake share increased to 31.3%, a gain of eight-tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. The company believes this measure better reflects the actual brand performance.  For the full year, American Snuff’s total moist snuff consumer off take share was 30.4%. 
Grizzly, American Snuff’s flagship brand, continued it positive momentum in Q4, with its share of consumer off take reaching another record high of 27.2%.  The brand continues to benefit from the packaging upgrade, to embossed metal lids, in Q2. The recent field trade marketing change is also contributing to the improved performance. (inaudible) products continue to be the fastest growing styles in moist snuff, and jumped more than 20% in 2010.
Grizzly’s pouches are performing extremely well.  Grizzly captured more than 24% of all pouch sales in Q4, and has the number one wintergreen pouch product in the category. So as we expected, American Snuff delivered solid gains in volume and earnings, driven by strong performance in the second half of the year, even as price gaps to premium continued to narrow. This momentum positions the company for further gains this year. 
That rounds out the year’s successful business performance at RAI’s operating companies.  Now Tom will provide some financial details.  Tom?

During my discussion I’ll focus primarily on adjusted results, to provide perspective on our underlying business performance.  Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available",800,"Thank you Dan, and good morning.  During my discussion I’ll focus primarily on adjusted results, to provide perspective on our underlying business performance.  Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website. Now, let’s take a look at Q4 and full year. RAI’s Q4 adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.60 per share. These adjusted results exclude charges of $0.05 per share in non-cash, good will impairment charges related to the proposed sale of Lane Ltd., and related assets, as well as trademark impairment charges for American Snuff’s Taylor’s Pride loose-leaf tobacco brand. 
These adjusted results also exclude $0.02 per share in cost primarily related to plant closings and the expansion of R. J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization. On a reported basis, RAI’s Q4 EPS was $0.53 per share, up 43% from the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.49 per share, up 7% from the prior year.  Full year adjusted results exclude the previously referenced charges and costs, as well as charges for changes in Federal health care laws, and Canadian government settlements. 
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $1.90 per share, up 15% from the prior year. RAI’s adjusted operating margin increased significantly in both Q4 and for the full year.  For 2010, margin increased 1.3 percentage points, to 29.8%, boosted by higher pricing, growth brand gains, and productivity improvements at our operating companies. 
Now turning to R. J. Reynolds performance.  R. J. Reynolds Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5.5% from the prior year quarter to $514 million, benefitting from higher cigarette pricing and growth brand volume gains. The company also delivered additional promotional efficiencies and productivity improvements. For the full year, adjusted operating income rose 4.4% to $2.12 billion.  R. J. Reynolds also saw gains in its Q4 adjusted operating margin, which increased 2.4 percentage points to 29.1%.
For the full year, R. J. Reynolds adjusted operating margin increased to 28.9%. Turning to cigarette shipment volumes, R. J. Reynolds Q4 cigarette shipment volume declined 5.1%, but excluding private label brands was down just 1.9%.  That compares well to the industry wide volume decline of 4.7%. Over the full year, the company’s cigarette shipment volume was also down 5.1%, but again, when private label brands are excluded, the company’s volume was down only 2.1%.  That compares favorably with an industry decline of 3.8%.
So that’s a brief review of R. J. Reynolds key results. Now let’s turn to American Snuff.  The company delivered outstanding growth in Q4, with adjusted operating income increasing 23.5% from the prior year quarter, to $103 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist snuff volume growth.  For the full year, adjusted operating income rose 6.1% from the prior year period to $374 million. American Snuff’s Q4 adjusted operating margin  rose 2.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter, to 53.9%, and for the full year, adjusted operating margin of 52% was down slightly from the prior year, primarily due to excise tax related declines in roll your own and other non-core tobacco products. 
Turning to moist snuff volume, the company’s total Q4 shipment volume grew 8.2% and was up 5.8% for the full year. So American Snuff showed great resilience and good momentum in the second half of the year, which positions it well for the year ahead. As a result of the strong performance by our operating companies, Reynolds American has delivered outstanding value in the past year, generating a total shareholder return of over 31%, more than double that of the S & T 500.  We will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our investors. 
Turning to our balance sheet, Reynolds American ended the year with cash balances of $2.2 billion, after the company contributed an additional $500 million to the pension plans in Q4. That brought total pension contributions to $800 million for the year, putting RAI in a well-funded position.  With the repayment of $300 million in debt in July, our leverage ratio further improved to a strong 1.5 time debt to EBITDA.
With the proposed sale of the Lane business, we’ll be adding approximately $200 million in cash to the balance sheet, while further reducing complexity and streamlining American Snuff’s operations. And now I’ll close with our guidance for 2011. 
Based on RAI’s excellent results, and given the solid momentum on key brands and productivity efforts at our operating companies, we expect full year EPS in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. I would note that this guidance assumes that the sale of Lane is completed in the first half of this year. Thank you, and we’ll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Latoya, would you remind our callers how they get into the queue?

It, in Q4, actually had 4.3 market share points, and I think Pall Mall, in my mind, very similar to all our brands in all the operating companies was really a differentiated proposition, and it is not just a pure price play.  It really has got product differentiation as part of the mix.  Of course, it’s a brand with historic equity in the market as well, and we continue to invest in a different way, but in the equity of the brand as well. This all comes back to that product differentiation where it’s a longer lasting cigarette, more puffs per cigarette.  
So yes, pricing might be a trial, the thing that gets the consumer to try it out of the gate, but actually they stick with it because it’s a very unique product in the market and differentiated.  So looking forward, I think even if some of the macro economic trends in the country change, I believe that the proposition is still correct for the consumers, and we can continue to grow whether the economy is going well or not going so well. And I would also remind you that prior to this latest economic downturn, the brand already was growing, even when the economy was doing extremely well.

Joining me this morning are RAI's President and CEO, Susan Ivey; Dan Delen, RAI's President and CEO-elect; and Tom Adams, our CFO.
The information we will discuss includes forward-looking statements. A number of factors could generate results materially different from our projections today. These factors include, but are not limited to, items detailed in our press release and SEC filings. Except as provided by Federal Securities Laws, we're not required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Susan."

I'm very pleased to report that RAI finished up a strong year with excellent performance across its operating companies. As our results show, both of our reportable business segments delivered additional volume and share gain on key brands in the fourth quarter and this drove increases in adjusted earnings and margin.
For the full year, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff continued to generate profitable growth despite ongoing weakness in consumer spending and continued competitive activity. 
In addition, Santa Fe had another great year, delivering double-digit growth in both volume and earnings. In fact, the companies Natural American Spirit brand delivered growth on every style and in every state last year. This successful performance demonstrates not just the fundamental strength of our operating company's key brands, but also the effective execution of their business strategy. And RAI continued to deliver outstanding value to our shareholders in 2010, with a dividend increase of 8.9% and a two-for-one stock split. We also announced an increase in our dividend payout target to 80%, which further demonstrates our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As you know, this is my last earnings call before I retire at the end of this month. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to lead this company for the past 6 1/2 years. And I've enjoyed working with and getting to know so many of you in the financial community. Given RAI's tremendous achievements over this period and its current positive momentum, I am confident that great things lie ahead for this company and for its talented people. As we demonstrated over the years, we'll continue to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Dan who will give you a closer look at our 2010 performance."
399584,118795075,98799,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and hello everyone.

I'm pleased to repo",1155,"Thank you, Susan, and hello everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full-year results. Driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to report that R.J. Reynolds cigarette brand portfolio strategy is working extremely well with gains in growth brands continuing to offset declines on the company's other cigarette brands.
As you know, we've made a decision sometime back to deemphasize and eliminate our private label brands in order to reduce complexity. Excluding those brands, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share in the fourth quarter increased by a full sharepoint to 28.1%. Even factoring in the declining private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share was 28.3%, down just 0.02 of a percentage point, this holds true for the full year as well. 
Total 2010 cigarette market share was 28.1%, down two tenths of a percentage point from the prior year. But excluding the private label brands, its market share was up seven tenths of a percentage point at 27.5%. 
Both of R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, played major roles in the company's strong performance. Combined growth brand market share increased 2.9 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.2%. And these two brands accounted for more than 55% of R.J. Reynolds' total volume. 
Camel's fourth quarter cigarette market share increased by six tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 8%. This is the brand's highest market share in more than 40 years. And for the full year, Camel's market share rose two tenths of a percentage point to 77%. Camel's improving share and demographics continue to benefit from growing consumer interest and its menthol styles. These styles use capsule technologies to offer adult smokers more fresh menthol flavor on demand, a unique product point of difference over competitive menthol brands. Also, enhancing the breath performance in the growing menthol category is Camel Crush, which uses the same technology to offer the option of regular or menthol with each cigarette. 
Including Camel Crush, Camel's menthol market share jumped by seven tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 2.1%. Camel is also performing well as a total tobacco brand with further equity building and refinement to its innovative more modern smoke-free tobacco products. Camel SNUS continues to perform well even with lower levels of promotional sports and as performance is being enhanced by two new styles, Robust and Winterchill that were added in the third quarter. These larger products offer adult tobacco consumers a richer more full body tobacco taste as well as smoke-free and spit-free convenience.
In Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco server products, Camel Orbs, Sticks, and Strips have received product and packaging upgrades and will be introduced in two new lead markets in March.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' other growth brand, Pall Mall. By all measures, Pall Mall had an outstanding year. As the nation's fastest growing major cigarette brand, Paul increased it's fourth quarter market share by 2.3 percentage points to 8.3%. And for the full year, Pall Mall gained 2.7 percentage points to 7.4%. That's the brand's highest market share since 1975. 
Trial and conversion to Pall Mall continue to increase while promotional levels remained steady. For value conscious adult smokers, Pall Mall offers a meaningful product point of difference from other value brands by delivering a high-quality, longer lasting cigarette at an affordable price, that's a true value proposition.
Another driver of performance and R.J. Reynolds is the continued focus on productivity improvements. This ongoing process is making the company much more efficient and focused by bringing up resources in growth for the long term. And even though they've already made great strides in this front, there are still more to come. 
R.J. Reynolds has dramatically reduced its product offerings and by doing so, it's also driving down complexity. The company ended the year with less than 150 SKUs, a reduction that represents four out of every five of the SKUs that has backed in 2004 and they plan further reductions in 2011. 
The company is also in the process of further improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies with a consolidation of three facilities into its largest factory in Tobaccoville. As a result of this move, the company has offered buyouts to members of the manufacture workforce to better align resources with production needs. Additionally, R.J. Reynolds plans to build new R&D annex at its Tobaccoville manufacturing center with constructions starting December. This will be a smaller, more modern facility that will better meet the company's future needs. As you know, R.J. Reynolds recently expanded its trade marketing organization to serve American Snuff. This transition has gone extremely well and we're already starting to reap the benefits of this change.
So, R.J. Reynolds has made substantial progress on many fronts this year. And this demonstrates the growing momentum that positions the company well in the coming year and far into the future.
Turning to American Snuff. The company finished the year on a very strong note with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, driving gains in adjusted operating income and share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. American Snuff first half of the year was especially challenging, with high levels of competitive promotional activity and value priced line extensions, as well as declines in their and other non-core tobacco products, following increased federal excise taxes. 
However, the company made up substantial ground as it moved through the year with equity enhancements to the Grizzly brand driving that growth. The company's total fourth quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share increased to 31.3%, a gain of eight tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. The company believes this measure better reflects the actual brand performance. 
For the full year, American Snuff's total moist-snuff consumer offtake share was 30.4%. Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, continued its positive momentum in the fourth quarter with its share of consumer offtake reaching another record high of 27.2%. The brand continues to benefit from the packaging upgrades to embossed metal lids in the second quarter. And the recent field trade-marketing change is also contributing to the improved performance. House products continue to be the fastest growing styles in moist-snuff and jumped more than 20% in 2010. In Grizzly patches are performing extremely well. Grizzly captured more than 24% of all Patch sales in the fourth quarter and has the number one Winter green product in the category.
So as we expected, American Snuff delivered solid grades in volume and earnings, driven by strong performance in the second half of the year. Even as price gaps to premium continued to narrow. And to this momentum positions the company for further gains this year.
That rounds out the year's successful business performance at our operating companies. Now, Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"
399584,118795075,98799,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on",795,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website. Now, let's take a look at the fourth quarter and full year.
RAI's fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.60 per share. These adjusted results, exclude charges of $0.05 per share in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the proposed sale of Lane, Limited and related assets, as well as trademark impairment charges for American Snuff Taylor's Pride loose-leaf tobacco brand. These adjusted results also exclude $0.02 per share in cost primarily related to plant closings and the expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization.
On a reported basis, RAI's fourth quarter EPS was $0.53 per share, up 43% from the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.49 per share, up 7% from the prior year. Full year adjusted results exclude the previously referenced charges and costs, as well as charges for changes in federal health care laws and Canadian government settlements.
On a reported basis, full-year EPS was $1.90 per share, up 15% from the prior year. RAI's adjusted operating margin increased significantly in both the fourth quarter and the full year. For 2010, margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 29.8%, boosted by higher pricing growth brand gains and productivity improvements at our operating companies.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds performance. R.J. Reynolds fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 5.5% from the prior year quarter to $514 million, benefiting from higher cigarette pricing and growth-brand volume gains. The company also delivered additional promotional efficiencies and productivity improvements. For the full year, adjusted operating income rose 4.4% to $2.12 billion. R.J. Reynolds also saw gains in its fourth quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 2.4 percentage points to 29.1%. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating margin increased to 28.9%.
Turning to cigarette shipment volume, R.J. Reynolds fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.1%. But excluding Private Label brands, was down just 1.9%. That compares well to the industry volume decline of 4.7%. Over the full year, the company's cigarette shipment volume was also down 5.1%, but again when Private Label brands are excluded, the company's volume was down only 2.1%, that compares favorably with an industry decline of 3.8%.
So that's a brief review of R.J. Reynolds' key result. Now let's turn to American Snuff.
The company delivered outstanding growth in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing 23.5% from the prior year quarter to $103 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. And for the full year, adjusted operating income rose 6.1% from the prior year period to $374 million. 
American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin rose 2.2 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 53.9%. And for the full year, adjusted operating margin of 52% was down slightly from the prior year primarily due to excise tax related decline in quality rather than other non-core tobacco products. Turning to moist-snuff volume, the company's total fourth quarter shipment volume grew 8.2% and was up 5.8% for the full year. So American Snuff showed great resilience and good momentum in the second half of the year, which positions it well for the year ahead. As a result of the strong performance by our operating companies, Reynolds American had delivered outstanding value in the past year, generating a total shareholder return of over 31%, more than double that of the S&P 500. And we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our investors. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the year with cash balances of $2.2 billion. After the company contributed an additional $500 million of the pension plan in the fourth quarter. That brought total pension contributions to $800 million for the year putting RAI in a well-funded position. With the repayment of $300 million in debt in July, our leverage ratio further improved to a strong 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA. With the proposed sale of the Lane business, we'll be adding approximately $200 million in cash to do balance sheet while further reducing complexity and streamlining American Snuff's operations.
And now I'll close with our guidance for 2011. Based on RAI's excellent results and given the solid momentum on key brands and productivity efforts at our operating companies, we expect full-year EPS in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. I would note that this guidance assumes that the sale of Lane is completed in the first half of this year.
Thank you. And we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Latoya, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

It, in the fourth quarter hit 8.3 market share points. And I think Pall Mall, in my mind, very similar to all our brands in all the operating companies is really a differentiated proposition. And it is not just a pure price play. It's really got a product differentiation as part of the mix, of course it's a brand with historic equity in the market as well. And we continue to invest in a different way but in the equity of the brand as well. And this all comes back to that product differentiation which is a longer lasting cigarette, more puffs per cigarette. So yes, pricing might be at a trial, the consumer tried to out of the gate. But actually they stick with it because it's a very unique product in the market and differentiated. So looking forward, I think even if some of the macro economic trends in the country changed, I believe that the proposition is still correct for the consumers and we can continue to grow whether the economy's going well or not going so well. And I would also remind you that prior to this latest economic downturn, the brand already was growing even when the economy was doing extremely well."

I'm very pleased to report that RAI finished up a strong year with excellent performance across its operating companies. As our results show, both of our reportable business segments delivered additional volume and share gained on key brands in the fourth quarter, and this drove increases in adjusted earnings and margin.
For the full year, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff continued to generate profitable growth despite ongoing weakness in consumer spending and continued competitive activity. 
In addition, Santa Fe had another great year, delivering double-digit growth in both volume and earnings. In fact, the company's Natural American Spirit brand delivered growth on every style and in every state last year. This successful performance demonstrates, not just the fundamental strength of our operating company's key brands, but also the effective execution of their business strategy. And RAI continued to deliver outstanding value to our shareholders in 2010, with a dividend increase of 8.9% and a two-for-one stock split. We also announced an increase in our dividend payout target to 80%, which further demonstrates our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As you know, this is my last earnings call before I retire at the end of this month. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to lead this company for the past 6 1/2 years. And I've enjoyed working with and getting to know so many of you in the financial community. Given RAI's tremendous achievements over this period and its current positive momentum, I am confident that great things lie ahead for this company and for its talented people. As we've demonstrated over the years, we'll continue to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Dan who will give you a closer look at our 2010 performance."
399584,118795075,98979,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to repo",1155,"Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to report that R.J. Reynolds cigarette brand portfolio strategy is working extremely well with gains on growth brands continuing to offset declines on the company's other cigarette brands.
As you know, we've made a decision some time back to de-emphasize and eliminate our private label brands in order to reduce complexity. Excluding those brands, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share in the fourth quarter increased by a full share point to 28.1%. Even factoring in the declining private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share was 28.3%, down just 0.02 of a percentage point. This holds true for the full year as well. 
Total 2010 cigarette market share was 28.1%, down 0.02 of a percentage point from the prior year. But excluding the private label brands, its market share was up 0.07 of a percentage point at 27.5%. 
Both of R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, played major roles in the company's strong performance. Combined growth brand market share increased 2.9 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.2%. And these two brands accounted for more than 55% of R.J. Reynolds' total volume. 
Camel's fourth quarter cigarette market share increased by 0.06 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 8%. This is the brand's highest market share in more than 40 years. And for the full year, Camel's market share rose 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.7%. Camel's improving share and demographics continue to benefit from growing consumer interest in its menthol styles. These styles use capsule technologies to offer adult smokers more fresh menthol flavor on demand, a unique product point of difference over competitive menthol brands. Also enhancing the breath performance in the growing menthol category is Camel Crush, which uses the same technology to offer the option of regular or menthol with each cigarette. 
Including Camel Crush, Camel's menthol market share jumped by 0.07 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 2.1%. Camel is also performing well as a total tobacco brand with further equity building and refinement to its innovative more modern smoke-free tobacco products. 
Camel SNUS continue to perform well even with lower levels of promotional support, and this performance is being enhanced by two new styles, Robust and Winterchill that were added in the third quarter. These larger cost products offer adult tobacco consumers a richer, more full body tobacco taste as well as smoke-free and spit-free convenience.
In Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Camel Orbs, Sticks, and Strips have received product and packaging upgrades and will be introduced in two new lead markets in March.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' other growth brand, Pall Mall. By all measures, Pall Mall had an outstanding year. As the nation's fastest growing major cigarette brand, Pall Mall increased its fourth quarter market share by 2.3 percentage points to 8.3%. And for the full year, Pall Mall gained 2.7 percentage points to 7.4%. And that's the brand's highest market share since 1975. 
Trial and conversion to Pall Mall continue to increase while promotional levels remained steady. For value-conscious adult smokers, Pall Mall offers a meaningful product point of difference from other value brands by delivering a high-quality, longer lasting cigarette at an affordable price. That's a true value proposition.
Another driver of performance at R.J. Reynolds is their continued focus on productivity improvement. This ongoing process is making the company much more efficient and focused while freeing up resources in growth for the long term. And even though they've already made great strides on this front, there's still more to come. 
R.J. Reynolds has dramatically reduced its product offerings and by doing so, it's also driving down complexity. The company ended the year with less than 150 SKUs, a reduction that represents four out of every five of the SKUs that has held back in 2004, and they plan further reductions in 2011. 
The company is also in the process of further improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies with a consolidation of three facilities into its largest factory at Tobaccoville. As a result of this move, the company has offered buyouts to members of the manufacturing workforce to better align resources with production needs. 
Additionally, R.J. Reynolds plans to build a new R&D annex at its Tobaccoville manufacturing center with constructions starting this summer. This will be a smaller, more modern facility that will better meet the company's future needs. 
As you know, R.J. Reynolds recently expanded its field trade marketing organization to serve American Snuff. This transition has gone extremely well and we're already starting to reap the benefits of this change.
So, R.J. Reynolds has made substantial progress on many fronts this year. And this demonstrates the growing momentum that positions the company well in the coming year and far into the future.
Turning to American Snuff. The company finished the year on a very strong note with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, driving gains in adjusted operating income and share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. American Snuff's first half of the year was especially challenging, with high levels of competitive promotional activity and value-priced line extensions, as well as declines in the roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products, following increased federal excise taxes. 
However, the company made up substantial ground as it moved through the year with equity enhancements to the Grizzly brand driving that growth. The company's total fourth quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share increased to 31.3%, a gain of 0.08 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. The company believes this measure better reflects the actual brand performance. 
For the full year, American Snuff's total moist-snuff consumer offtake share was 30.4%. Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, continued its positive momentum in the fourth quarter with its share of consumer offtake reaching another record high of 27.2%. The brand continues to benefit from the packaging upgrades to embossed metal lids in the second quarter. And In the recent field trade-marketing change is also contributing to the improved performance. 
House products continue to be the fastest growing styles in moist-snuff and jumped more than 20% in 2010. Grizzly's Pouches are performing extremely well. Grizzly captured more than 24% of all Pouch sales in the fourth quarter and has the number one Wintergreen Pouch product in the category.
So as we expected, American Snuff delivered solid gains in volume and earnings, driven by strong performance in the second half of the year. Even as price gaps to premium continue to narrow. And this momentum positions the company for further gains this year.
That rounds out the year's successful business performance at RAI's operating companies. Now Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on",796,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website. Now, let's take a look at the fourth quarter and full year.
RAI's fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.60 per share. These adjusted results, exclude charges of $0.05 per share in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the proposed sale of Lane, Limited and related assets, as well as trademark impairment charges for American Snuff Taylor's Pride loose-leaf tobacco brand. These adjusted results also exclude $0.02 per share in cost primarily related to plant closings and the expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization.
On a reported basis, RAI's fourth quarter EPS was $0.53 per share, up 43% from the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.49 per share, up 7% from the prior year. Full year adjusted results exclude the previously referenced charges and costs, as well as charges for changes in federal health care laws and Canadian government settlements.
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $1.90 per share, up 15% from the prior year. RAI's adjusted operating margin increased significantly in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. For 2010, margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 29.8%, boosted by higher pricing growth brand gains and productivity improvements at our operating companies.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 5.5% from the prior year quarter to $514 million, benefiting from higher cigarette pricing and growth-brand volume gains. The company also delivered additional promotional efficiencies and productivity improvements. For the full year, adjusted operating income rose 4.4% to $2.12 billion. R.J. Reynolds also saw gains in its fourth quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 2.4 percentage points to 29.1%. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating margin increased to 28.9%.
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.1%, but excluding private label brands, was down just 1.9%. That compares well to the industry volume decline of 4.7%. Over the full year, the company's cigarette shipment volume was also down 5.1%, but again when private label brands are excluded, the company's volume was down only 2.1%, that compares favorably with an industry decline of 3.8%.
So that's a brief review of R.J. Reynolds' key results. 
Now let's turn to American Snuff. The company delivered outstanding growth in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing 23.5% from the prior year quarter to $103 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. And for the full year, adjusted operating income rose 6.1% from the prior year period to $374 million. 
American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin rose 2.2 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 53.9%. And for the full year, adjusted operating margin of 52% was down slightly from the prior year primarily due to excise tax-related declines in roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products. 
Turning to moist-snuff volume. The company's total fourth quarter shipment volume grew 8.2% and was up 5.8% for the full year. So American Snuff showed great resilience and good momentum in the second half of the year, which positions it well for the year ahead. As a result of the strong performance by our operating companies, Reynolds American has  delivered outstanding value in the past year, generating a total shareholder return of over 31%, more than double that of the S&P 500. And we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our investors. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the year with cash balances of $2.2 billion after the company contributed an additional $500 million to the pension plans in the fourth quarter. That brought total pension contributions to $800 million for the year putting RAI in a well-funded position. With the repayment of $300 million in debt in July, our leverage ratio further improved to a strong 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
With the proposed sale of the Lane business, we'll be adding approximately $200 million in cash to the balance sheet while further reducing complexity and streamlining American Snuff's operations.
And now I'll close with our guidance for 2011. Based on RAI's excellent results and given the solid momentum on key brands and productivity efforts at our operating companies, we expect full year EPS in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. I would note that this guidance assumes that the sale of Lane is completed in the first half of this year.
Thank you. And we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Latoya, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

It, in the fourth quarter, actually hit 8.3 market share points. And I think Pall Mall, in my mind, very similar to all our brands in all the operating companies is really a differentiated proposition. And it is not just a pure price play. It's really got a product differentiation as part of their mix. Of course, it's a brand with historic equity in the market as well. And we continue to invest in a different way, but in the equity of the brand as well. And this all comes back to that product differentiation where it's a longer-lasting cigarette, more puffs per cigarette. So yes, pricing might be of a trial, the thing that gets the consumer to try it out of the gate, but actually they stick with it because it's a very unique product in the market and differentiated. So looking forward, I think even if some of the macro-economic trends in the country changed, I believe that the proposition is still correct for the consumers, and we can continue to grow whether the economy's going well or not going so well. And I would also remind you that prior to this latest economic downturn, the brand already was growing even when the economy was doing extremely well."

I'm very pleased to report that RAI finished up a strong year with excellent performance across its operating companies. As our results show, both of our reportable business segments delivered additional volume and share gains on key brands in the fourth quarter, and this drove increases in adjusted earnings and margin.
For the full year, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff continued to generate profitable growth despite ongoing weakness in consumer spending and continued competitive activity. 
In addition, Santa Fe had another great year, delivering double-digit growth in both volume and earnings. In fact, the company's Natural American Spirit brand delivered growth on every style and in every state last year. This successful performance demonstrates, not just the fundamental strength of our operating company's key brand, but also the effective execution of their business strategies. And RAI continued to deliver outstanding value to our shareholders in 2010, with a dividend increase of 8.9% and a two-for-one stock split. We also announced an increase in our dividend payout target to 80%, which further demonstrates our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As you know, this is my last earnings call before I retire at the end of this month. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to lead this company for the past 6 1/2 years. And I've enjoyed working with and getting to know so many of you in the financial community. Given RAI's tremendous achievements over this period and its current positive momentum, I am confident that great things lie ahead for this company and for its talented people. As we've demonstrated over the years, we'll continue to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Dan who will give you a closer look at our 2010 performance."
399584,118795075,99190,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full-year results driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to repo",1155,"Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full-year results driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to report that R.J. Reynolds cigarette brand portfolio strategy is working extremely well with gains on growth brands continuing to offset declines on the company's other cigarette brands.
As you know, we made a decision some time back to de-emphasize and eliminate our private label brands in order to reduce complexity. Excluding those brands, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share in the fourth quarter increased by a full share point to 28.1%. Even factoring in the declining private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share was 28.3%, down just 0.02 of a percentage point. This holds true for the full year as well. 
Total 2010 cigarette market share was 28.1%, down 0.02 of a percentage point from the prior year. But excluding the private label brands, its market share was up 0.07 of a percentage point at 27.5%. 
Both of R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, played major roles in the company's strong performance. Combined growth brand market share increased 2.9 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.2%. And these two brands accounted for more than 55% of R.J. Reynolds' total volume. 
Camel's fourth quarter cigarette market share increased by 0.06 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 8%. This is the brand's highest market share in more than 40 years. And for the full year, Camel's market share rose 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.7%. Camel's improving share and demographics continue to benefit from growing consumer interest in its menthol styles. These styles use capsule technologies to offer adult smokers more fresh menthol flavor on demand, a unique product point of difference over competitive menthol brands. Also enhancing the brand’s performance in the growing menthol category is Camel Crush, which uses the same technology to offer the option of regular or menthol with each cigarette. 
Including Camel Crush, Camel's menthol market share jumped by 0.07 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 2.1%. Camel is also performing well as a total tobacco brand with further equity building and refinements to its innovative more modern smoke-free tobacco products. 
Camel SNUS continue to perform well even with lower levels of promotional support, and its performance is being enhanced by two new styles, Robust and Winterchill that were added in the third quarter. These larger cost products offer adult tobacco consumers a richer, more full body tobacco taste as well as smoke-free and spit-free convenience.
In Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Camel Orbs, Sticks, and Strips have received product and packaging upgrades and will be introduced in two new lead markets in March.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' other growth brand, Pall Mall. By all measures, Pall Mall had an outstanding year. As the nation's fastest growing major cigarette brand, Pall Mall increased its fourth quarter market share by 2.3 percentage points to 8.3%. And for the full year, Pall Mall gained 2.7 percentage points to 7.4%. And that's the brand's highest market share since 1975. 
Trial and conversion to Pall Mall continue to increase while promotional levels remained steady. For value-conscious adult smokers, Pall Mall offers a meaningful product point of difference from other value brands by delivering a high-quality, longer lasting cigarette at an affordable price. That's a true value proposition.
Another driver of performance at R.J. Reynolds is their continued focus on productivity improvement. This ongoing process is making the company much more efficient and focused while freeing up resources in invest in growth for the long term. And even though they've already made great strides on this front, there's still more to come. 
R.J. Reynolds has dramatically reduced its product offerings and by doing so, it's also driving down complexity. The company ended the year with less than 150 SKUs, a reduction that represents four out of every five of the SKUs that has held back in 2004, and they plan further reductions in 2011. 
The company is also in the process of further improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies with a consolidation of three facilities into its largest factory at Tobaccoville. As a result of this move, the company has offered buyouts to members of the manufacturing workforce to better align resources with production needs. 
Additionally, R.J. Reynolds plans to build a new R&D annex at its Tobaccoville manufacturing center with constructions starting this summer. This will be a smaller, more modern facility that will better meet the company's future needs. 
As you know, R.J. Reynolds recently expanded its field trade marketing organization to serve American Snuff. This transition has gone extremely well and we're already starting to reap the benefits of this change.
So, R.J. Reynolds has made substantial progress on many fronts this year. And this demonstrates the growing momentum that positions the company well in the coming year and far into the future.
Turning to American Snuff. The company finished the year on a very strong note with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, driving gains in adjusted operating income and share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. American Snuff's first half of the year was especially challenging, with high levels of competitive promotional activity and value-priced line extensions, as well as declines in the roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products, following increased federal excise taxes. 
However, the company made up substantial ground as it moved through the year with equity enhancements to the Grizzly brand driving that growth. The company's total fourth quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share increased to 31.3%, a gain of 0.08 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. The company believes this measure better reflects the actual brand performance. 
For the full year, American Snuff's total moist-snuff consumer offtake share was 30.4%. Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, continued its positive momentum in the fourth quarter with its share of consumer offtake reaching another record high of 27.2%. The brand continues to benefit from the packaging upgrades to embossed metal lids in the second quarter. And the recent field trade-marketing change is also contributing to the improved performance. 
House products continue to be the fastest growing styles in moist-snuff and jumped more than 20% in 2010. Grizzly's Pouches are performing extremely well. Grizzly captured more than 24% of all Pouch sales in the fourth quarter and has the number one Wintergreen Pouch product in the category.
So as we expected, American Snuff delivered solid gains in volume and earnings, driven by strong performance in the second half of the year. Even as price gaps to premium continue to narrow. And this momentum positions the company for further gains this year.
That rounds out the year's successful business performance at RAI's operating companies. Now Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"
399584,118795075,99190,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on",793,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website. Now, let's take a look at the fourth quarter and full year.
RAI's fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.60 per share. These adjusted results, exclude charges of $0.05 per share in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the proposed sale of Lane Limited and related assets, as well as trademark impairment charges for American Snuff Taylor's Pride loose-leaf tobacco brand. These adjusted results also exclude $0.02 per share in cost primarily related to plant closings and the expansion of R.J. Reynolds’ field trade-marketing organization.
On a reported basis, RAI's fourth quarter EPS was $0.53 per share, up 43% from the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.49 per share, up 7% from the prior year. Full-year adjusted results exclude the previously referenced charges and costs, as well as charges for changes in federal health care laws and Canadian government settlements.
On a reported basis, full-year EPS was $1.90 per share, up 15% from the prior year. RAI's adjusted operating margin increased significantly in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. For 2010, margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 29.8%, boosted by higher pricing growth brand gains and productivity improvements at our operating companies.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 5.5% from the prior year quarter to $514 million, benefiting from higher cigarette pricing and growth-brand volume gains. The company also delivered additional promotional efficiencies and productivity improvements. For the full year, adjusted operating income rose 4.4% to $2.12 billion. R.J. Reynolds also saw gains in its fourth quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 2.4 percentage points to 29.1%. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating margin increased to 28.9%.
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.1%, but excluding private label brands, was down just 1.9%. That compares well to the industry volume decline of 4.7%. Over the full year, the company's cigarette shipment volume was also down 5.1%, but again when private label brands are excluded, the company's volume was down only 2.1%, that compares favorably with an industry decline of 3.8%.
So that's a brief review of R.J. Reynolds' key results. 
Now let's turn to American Snuff. The company delivered outstanding growth in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing 23.5% from the prior year quarter to $103 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. And for the full year, adjusted operating income rose 6.1% from the prior year period to $374 million. 
American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin rose 2.2 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 53.9%. And for the full year, adjusted operating margin of 52% was down slightly from the prior year primarily due to excise tax-related declines in roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products. 
Turning to moist-snuff volume. The company's total fourth quarter shipment volume grew 8.2% and was up 5.8% for the full year. So American Snuff showed great resilience and good momentum in the second half of the year, which positions it well for the year ahead. As a result of the strong performance by our operating companies, Reynolds American has delivered outstanding value in the past year, generating a total shareholder return of over 31%, more than double that of the S&P 500. And we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our investors. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the year with cash balances of $2.2 billion after the company contributed an additional $500 million to the pension plans in the fourth quarter. That brought total pension contributions to $800 million for the year putting RAI in a well-funded position. With the repayment of $300 million in debt in July, our leverage ratio further improved to a strong 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
With the proposed sale of the Lane business, we'll be adding approximately $200 million in cash to the balance sheet while further reducing complexity and streamlining American Snuff's operations.
And now I'll close with our guidance for 2011. Based on RAI's excellent results and given the solid momentum on key brands and productivity efforts at our operating companies, we expect full-year EPS in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. I would note that this guidance assumes that the sale of Lane is completed in the first half of this year.
Thank you. And we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Latoya, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

So looking forward, I think even if some of the macro-economic trends in the country change, I believe that the proposition is still correct for the consumers, and we can continue to grow whether the economy's going well or not going so well. And I would also remind you that prior to this latest economic downturn, the brand already was growing even when the economy was doing extremely well."

I'm very pleased to report that RAI finished up a strong year with excellent performance across its operating companies. As our results show, both of our reportable business segments delivered additional volume and share gains on key brands in the fourth quarter, and this drove increases in adjusted earnings and margin.
For the full year, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff continued to generate profitable growth despite ongoing weakness in consumer spending and continued competitive activity. 
In addition, Santa Fe had another great year, delivering double-digit growth in both volume and earnings. In fact, the company's Natural American Spirit brand delivered growth on every style and in every state last year. This successful performance demonstrates, not just the fundamental strength of our operating company's key brand, but also the effective execution of their business strategies. And RAI continued to deliver outstanding value to our shareholders in 2010, with a dividend increase of 8.9% and a two-for-one stock split. We also announced an increase in our dividend payout target to 80%, which further demonstrates our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As you know, this is my last earnings call before I retire at the end of this month. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to lead this company for the past 6 1/2 years. And I've enjoyed working with and getting to know so many of you in the financial community. Given RAI's tremendous achievements over this period and its current positive momentum, I am confident that great things lie ahead for this company and for its talented people. As we've demonstrated over the years, we'll continue to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Dan who will give you a closer look at our 2010 performance."
399584,118795075,99221,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full-year results driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to repo",1155,"Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. As you've just heard, our operating companies delivered strong fourth quarter and full-year results driven by gains in volume and share on key brands, as well as improved pricing and efficiencies. I'm pleased to report that R.J. Reynolds cigarette brand portfolio strategy is working extremely well with gains on growth brands continuing to offset declines on the company's other cigarette brands.
As you know, we made a decision some time back to de-emphasize and eliminate our private label brands in order to reduce complexity. Excluding those brands, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share in the fourth quarter increased by a full share point to 28.1%. Even factoring in the declining private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share was 28.3%, down just 0.02 of a percentage point. This holds true for the full year as well. 
Total 2010 cigarette market share was 28.1%, down 0.02 of a percentage point from the prior year. But excluding the private label brands, its market share was up 0.07 of a percentage point at 27.5%. 
Both of R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, played major roles in the company's strong performance. Combined growth brand market share increased 2.9 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.2%. And these two brands accounted for more than 55% of R.J. Reynolds' total volume. 
Camel's fourth quarter cigarette market share increased by 0.06 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 8%. This is the brand's highest market share in more than 40 years. And for the full year, Camel's market share rose 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.7%. Camel's improving share and demographics continue to benefit from growing consumer interest in its menthol styles. These styles use capsule technologies to offer adult smokers more fresh menthol flavor on demand, a unique product point of difference over competitive menthol brands. Also enhancing the brand’s performance in the growing menthol category is Camel Crush, which uses the same technology to offer the option of regular or menthol with each cigarette. 
Including Camel Crush, Camel's menthol market share jumped by 0.07 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 2.1%. Camel is also performing well as a total tobacco brand with further equity building and refinements to its innovative more modern smoke-free tobacco products. 
Camel SNUS continue to perform well even with lower levels of promotional support, and its performance is being enhanced by two new styles, Robust and Winterchill that were added in the third quarter. These larger cost products offer adult tobacco consumers a richer, more full body tobacco taste as well as smoke-free and spit-free convenience.
In Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Camel Orbs, Sticks, and Strips have received product and packaging upgrades and will be introduced in two new lead markets in March.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' other growth brand, Pall Mall. By all measures, Pall Mall had an outstanding year. As the nation's fastest growing major cigarette brand, Pall Mall increased its fourth quarter market share by 2.3 percentage points to 8.3%. And for the full year, Pall Mall gained 2.7 percentage points to 7.4%. And that's the brand's highest market share since 1975. 
Trial and conversion to Pall Mall continue to increase while promotional levels remained steady. For value-conscious adult smokers, Pall Mall offers a meaningful product point of difference from other value brands by delivering a high-quality, longer lasting cigarette at an affordable price. That's a true value proposition.
Another driver of performance at R.J. Reynolds is their continued focus on productivity improvement. This ongoing process is making the company much more efficient and focused while freeing up resources in invest in growth for the long term. And even though they've already made great strides on this front, there's still more to come. 
R.J. Reynolds has dramatically reduced its product offerings and by doing so, it's also driving down complexity. The company ended the year with less than 150 SKUs, a reduction that represents four out of every five of the SKUs that has held back in 2004, and they plan further reductions in 2011. 
The company is also in the process of further improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies with a consolidation of three facilities into its largest factory at Tobaccoville. As a result of this move, the company has offered buyouts to members of the manufacturing workforce to better align resources with production needs. 
Additionally, R.J. Reynolds plans to build a new R&D annex at its Tobaccoville manufacturing center with constructions starting this summer. This will be a smaller, more modern facility that will better meet the company's future needs. 
As you know, R.J. Reynolds recently expanded its field trade marketing organization to serve American Snuff. This transition has gone extremely well and we're already starting to reap the benefits of this change.
So, R.J. Reynolds has made substantial progress on many fronts this year. And this demonstrates the growing momentum that positions the company well in the coming year and far into the future.
Turning to American Snuff. The company finished the year on a very strong note with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, driving gains in adjusted operating income and share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. American Snuff's first half of the year was especially challenging, with high levels of competitive promotional activity and value-priced line extensions, as well as declines in the roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products, following increased federal excise taxes. 
However, the company made up substantial ground as it moved through the year with equity enhancements to the Grizzly brand driving that growth. The company's total fourth quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share increased to 31.3%, a gain of 0.08 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. The company believes this measure better reflects the actual brand performance. 
For the full year, American Snuff's total moist-snuff consumer offtake share was 30.4%. Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, continued its positive momentum in the fourth quarter with its share of consumer offtake reaching another record high of 27.2%. The brand continues to benefit from the packaging upgrades to embossed metal lids in the second quarter. And the recent field trade-marketing change is also contributing to the improved performance. 
House products continue to be the fastest growing styles in moist-snuff and jumped more than 20% in 2010. Grizzly's Pouches are performing extremely well. Grizzly captured more than 24% of all Pouch sales in the fourth quarter and has the number one Wintergreen Pouch product in the category.
So as we expected, American Snuff delivered solid gains in volume and earnings, driven by strong performance in the second half of the year. Even as price gaps to premium continue to narrow. And this momentum positions the company for further gains this year.
That rounds out the year's successful business performance at RAI's operating companies. Now Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"
399584,118795075,99221,"Reynolds American Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on",793,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website. Now, let's take a look at the fourth quarter and full year.
RAI's fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.60 per share. These adjusted results, exclude charges of $0.05 per share in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the proposed sale of Lane Limited and related assets, as well as trademark impairment charges for American Snuff Taylor's Pride loose-leaf tobacco brand. These adjusted results also exclude $0.02 per share in cost primarily related to plant closings and the expansion of R.J. Reynolds’ field trade-marketing organization.
On a reported basis, RAI's fourth quarter EPS was $0.53 per share, up 43% from the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.49 per share, up 7% from the prior year. Full-year adjusted results exclude the previously referenced charges and costs, as well as charges for changes in federal health care laws and Canadian government settlements.
On a reported basis, full-year EPS was $1.90 per share, up 15% from the prior year. RAI's adjusted operating margin increased significantly in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. For 2010, margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 29.8%, boosted by higher pricing growth brand gains and productivity improvements at our operating companies.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 5.5% from the prior year quarter to $514 million, benefiting from higher cigarette pricing and growth-brand volume gains. The company also delivered additional promotional efficiencies and productivity improvements. For the full year, adjusted operating income rose 4.4% to $2.12 billion. R.J. Reynolds also saw gains in its fourth quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 2.4 percentage points to 29.1%. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating margin increased to 28.9%.
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.1%, but excluding private label brands, was down just 1.9%. That compares well to the industry volume decline of 4.7%. Over the full year, the company's cigarette shipment volume was also down 5.1%, but again when private label brands are excluded, the company's volume was down only 2.1%, that compares favorably with an industry decline of 3.8%.
So that's a brief review of R.J. Reynolds' key results. 
Now let's turn to American Snuff. The company delivered outstanding growth in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing 23.5% from the prior year quarter to $103 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. And for the full year, adjusted operating income rose 6.1% from the prior year period to $374 million. 
American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin rose 2.2 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 53.9%. And for the full year, adjusted operating margin of 52% was down slightly from the prior year primarily due to excise tax-related declines in roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products. 
Turning to moist-snuff volume. The company's total fourth quarter shipment volume grew 8.2% and was up 5.8% for the full year. So American Snuff showed great resilience and good momentum in the second half of the year, which positions it well for the year ahead. As a result of the strong performance by our operating companies, Reynolds American has delivered outstanding value in the past year, generating a total shareholder return of over 31%, more than double that of the S&P 500. And we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our investors. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the year with cash balances of $2.2 billion after the company contributed an additional $500 million to the pension plans in the fourth quarter. That brought total pension contributions to $800 million for the year putting RAI in a well-funded position. With the repayment of $300 million in debt in July, our leverage ratio further improved to a strong 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
With the proposed sale of the Lane business, we'll be adding approximately $200 million in cash to the balance sheet while further reducing complexity and streamlining American Snuff's operations.
And now I'll close with our guidance for 2011. Based on RAI's excellent results and given the solid momentum on key brands and productivity efforts at our operating companies, we expect full-year EPS in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. I would note that this guidance assumes that the sale of Lane is completed in the first half of this year.
Thank you. And we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Latoya, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

It, in the fourth quarter, actually hit 8.3 market share points. And I think Pall Mall, in my mind, very similar to all our brands in all the operating companies is really a differentiated proposition. And it is not just a pure price play. It's really got a product differentiation as part of their mix. Of course, it's a brand with historic equity in the market as well. And we continue to invest in a different way, but in the equity of the brand as well. And this all comes back to that product differentiation where it's a longer-lasting cigarette, more puffs per cigarette. So yes, pricing might be the trial, the thing that gets the consumer to try it out of the gate, but actually they stick with it because it's a very unique product in the market and differentiated. So looking forward, I think even if some of the macro-economic trends in the country change, I believe that the proposition is still correct for the consumers, and we can continue to grow whether the economy's going well or not going so well. And I would also remind you that prior to this latest economic downturn, the brand already was growing even when the economy was doing extremely well."

Two of our highlights I'd like to touch on, Reynolds American continued to deliver value to our shareholders with a further dividend increase of 8.2% in February, bringing it in line with RAI's revised 80% dividend payout target. I would also note that RAI successfully closed the sale Of Lane, Limited  subsidiary in February. This allows RAI's operating companies to focus our energy resources of the primary growth categories within their businesses.
This continued transformation of our operating companies business and our focus on providing innovative tobacco products to meet changing consumer preferences positions RAI well for long-term success. As we reported today, RAI is reaffirming its guidance, and we expect full-year adjusted EPS growth in the mid-to-high single digits, excluding charges related to plant closings and tax items.
Before I turn to our operating perform, I want to briefly address developments on the regulatory fronts. After the recent release of the report on menthol by the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, as well as reports from the industry and others, the FDA is now considering input from our range of parties in its review of the use of menthol cigarettes. R.J. Reynolds continue to believe that any final decision by the agency should be based on sound science, and the company will continue to provide information and perspectives on this issue to the agency as it undertakes this process. We remain committed to complying with FDA requirements as they are established, while continuing to compete effectively in the marketplace.
Now I'd like to talk about the highlights of R.J. Reynolds this first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased slightly as gains in the companies' growth of brand offset cigarette volume declines in its support and nonsupport brands. R.J. Reynolds adjusted operating margin also improved, driven by pricing and productivity gain. R.J. Reynolds long-term strategy to reduce complexity and improved efficiency is proven to be very successful. And the company plans to further refine its cigarette portfolio and eliminate most of its remaining private label brands this year you remember the company reduced its SKUs by over 80% through the end of last year to less than 150. R.J. Reynolds is also making good progress in improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies like consolidating production at its tobacco facility. The company remains on track to close its Whitaker Park manufacturing facility later this year.
R.J. Reynolds total first quarter cigarette market share was stable at 27.9%. However, if we exclude the delisted private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share actually increased by a full percentage point. As I mentioned earlier today, R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to make gains in the first quarter. Their combined market share increased 2.7 percentage points to 16.3%. We remain pleased by Camel's performance, both in terms of market share and brand demographics.
The brand's first quarter cigarette market share increased by 0.07 of a percentage point from the prior-year quarter to 7.8%. And Camel launched a new equity building promotion, the Hump Day sweepstakes campaign at the end of March. Already, the brand is seeing a great response from consumers. This program is highlighted on Camel's packaging as being used in all major brand marketing materials. The promotion encourages adult tobacco consumers to seize the Hump Day and break free to explore the unexpected and get rewarded.
This is part of Camel's brands promise, to empower individual enjoyment for adult tobacco consumers. Also enhancing Camel's performance are its menthol styles, with innovative capsule technologies that offer adult smokers the choice, fresh and full flavor on demand. In fact, Camel's menthol share of market, including Camel Crush, increased 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter and now stands at 2%.
Moving to modern smoke-free tobacco. Camel introduced a number of changes in the quarter, all aimed at deepening the brand's commitment to offer innovative, smoke-free tobacco products for adult consumers to enjoy anytime and anywhere. For example, while Camel SNUS continues to show steady growth, R.J. Reynolds expanded the range of SNUS offerings during the quarter. To give even more adult tobacco consumers a reason to try and ultimately, switch to Camel SNUS. 
In February, Camel SNUS introduced Frost Large Pouches and a Mint style in selected lead markets. These new styles broaden the range of choices for adult tobacco consumers and generating good interest.
Camel SNUS Frost is the best-selling SNUS style in America, and the larger Frost Pouch styles will meet the preferences of a broader range of tobacco users. Camel SNUS Mint is another good addition to the portfolio, with Mint being the long-established preference in smokeless tobacco. With the introduction of an increasing number of competitive SNUS products over the past year, the SNUS category is continuing to expand. R.J. Reynolds expects this increase interest to further build positive for this category over the long-term. And Camel SNUS is well positioned to benefit from this growth.
In March, Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips were introduced in two new lead markets, Charlotte and Denver. These new dissolvable products and their packaging reflects the input of R.J. Reynolds received from consumers in the first round of lead markets. The company expects to continue to gain valuable insights from adult tobacco consumers in this new markets.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds other growth brand, Pall Mall. Pall Mall had another outstanding quarter, increasing its market share by two percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 8.5%. The company remains focused on building the Pall Mall brand while balancing overall share and profitability growth. 
In summary, R.J. Reynolds continues its positive momentum in the first quarter, which provides a strong foundation for longer term success.
Turning to American Snuff. I'm very pleased with the company's results in the first quarter, with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, delivering increases in the company's adjusted operating income and margin. Bear in mind that these results reflect only two months of earnings from Lane before that business was sold at the end of February. Once again, American Snuff's performance was led by its flagship brand, Grizzly, which continues to benefit from last year's packaging upgrade. Grizzly is also benefiting from the R.J. Reynolds field trade marketing organization that serves American Snuff. The company now has more than 2,000 trade and marketing professionals, representing its products at retail.
Turning to market share. The company's total moist-snuff offtake share increased 1.3 percentage points in the first quarter to 31.1%. And this growth was driven by Grizzly, which increases share by 1.5 percentage points to 27.1%. Grizzly's performance during the quarter was further enhanced by its strong positioning in Pouch sales. In the first quarter, more than 9% of total moist-snuff category sales were in the rapidly growing Pouch segment, and Grizzly groups represent about 25% of that total. That's great progress considering that the brand introduced its first Pouch style product just three years ago.
I'm pleased to report that Grizzly now has the number one overall projects by in the market. I must say that despite intense competitive activity, Grizzly has had a powerful impact since it was introduced 10 years ago, and that's still with only 12 styles.
I'd also like to mention the new retail moist muff contract that American Snuff introduced in February. These contracts represent an investment in the business and ensures that Grizzly will have it's fair share of retail space, as well as improved pricing and brand communication.
This investment will better position Grizzly for continued long-term growth. So it's clear that both American Snuff and R.J. Reynolds are focused on delivering profitable growth for RAI shareholders. And I'm extremely pleased with the momentum. Now Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website.
Turning to our financial highlights. RAI's first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by 0.4% to $0.59. These adjusted results exclude the $0.01 per share related to plant closings and tax items. On a reported basis, RAI's first quarter EPS was $0.60, that was more than triple the prior year quarter's reported EPS of $0.14, which was impacted by the changes in Federal healthcare laws and the Canadian government settlements. RAI's adjusted operating margin saw strong growth in the first quarter, gaining 0.09 of a percentage point to 29.6%. As a result of this performance, I'm pleased to reaffirm adjusted 2011 EPS guidance in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, excluding implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items.
I would note that delaying sale closed earlier than our original expectations of mid year which will result in a lower earnings contribution from that business that we have previously estimated.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds performance. RJ Reynolds' first quarter adjusted operating income of $471 million increased slightly from the prior-year quarter. The company benefited from higher cigarette pricing and growth brand volume gains, while also delivering further productivity improvements. This adjusted results exclude $8 million in implementation costs related to plant closings.
And R.J. Reynolds also improved its first quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 0.5 percentage points to 27.8%. 
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds first quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.2% from the prior-year quarter. However, excluding the delisted private label brands, volume was down 3%. This compares well with the industries first quarter volume decline of 3.4%.
I would also note that R.J. Reynolds' wholesale inventory levels declined about 300 million units during the quarter, while industry inventories remained constant at relatively higher levels. So that's a brief recap of R.J. Reynolds key results.
On American Snuff, given the impact on earnings from the sale Of Lane, American Snuff delivered solid first quarter growth, with adjusted operating income increasing 4.2% from the prior-year quarter to $87 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. These adjusted results exclude $2 million of implementation costs.
American Snuff's first quarter adjusted operating margin also increased, gaining 0.5 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 52.3%.
Turning to moist-snuff volume. The company's total first quarter shipment volume grew 13.2%. I would note that this reflects a favorable comparison with the prior-year quarter, which was impacted by aggressive competitive activity. Grizzly's first quarter shipment volume saw a significant increase, rising 17.1% from the prior-year quarter. So American Snuff continues to build on the strong foundation and is well positioned for growth over the rest of the year. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $3 billion, including the $200 million from the Lane sales. I'll remind you that on April 15, R.J. Reynolds made its MSA [ph] payment of about $2 billion, of which $477 million was deposited in the NPM disputed funds account. That brings the total amount in dispute to almost $3 billion for the years 2003 through 2008. We continue to evaluate opportunities to add value for our shareholders. With the 8.2% dividend increase in February, RAI has raised dividend by nearly 18% over the past year.

That number's probably somewhere about 1.8 to 2 and what that really means is absent any pricing, that's what the decline rate would be. And on top of that, that would put the price sensitivity in demand. That historically of about 0.35.

I'm very pleased to be with you today, and share with you some of the insights and results at Reynolds American and its operating companies. As our results show, RAI and it's operating companies turned in a good first quarter, givi",1447,"Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be with you today, and share with you some of the insights and results at Reynolds American and its operating companies. As our results show, RAI and it's operating companies turned in a good first quarter, giving us a solid foundation for growth in the year ahead.
As you can see from the positive results across our companies, RAI's initiative to transform tobacco continues to gain momentum. RAI delivers higher adjusted earnings and margin, driven by additional volume and share gains on all our operating companies' key brands, as well as higher pricing and further productivity improvements. Both of our reportable business segments, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff, continue to execute their business strategies extremely well. And this is reflected by further improvement in their marketplace and financial performance. And once again, performance was strong at Santa Fe, with higher volume, share and earnings in the first quarter. 
Two other highlights I'd like to touch on. Reynolds American continued to deliver value to our shareholders with a further dividend increase of 8.2% in February, bringing it in line with RAI's revised 80% dividend payout target. I would also note that RAI successfully closed the sale of its Lane, Limited subsidiary in February. This allows RAI's operating companies to focus our energy resources on the primary growth categories within their businesses.
This continued transformation of our operating companies' business and their focus on providing innovative tobacco products to meet changing consumer preferences positions RAI well for long-term success. As we reported today, RAI is reaffirming its guidance, and we expect full year adjusted EPS growth in the mid- to high single-digits, excluding charges related to plant closings and tax items.
Before I turn to our operating companies' performance, I want to briefly address developments on the regulatory front. After the recent release of the report on menthol by the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, as well as reports from the industry and others, the FDA is now considering input from a range of parties in its review of the use of menthol in cigarettes. R.J. Reynolds continues to believe that any final decision by the agency should be based on sound science. And the company will continue to provide information and perspectives on this issue to the agency as it undertakes this process. We remain committed to complying with FDA requirements as they are established, while continuing to compete effectively in the marketplace.
Now I'd like to talk about the highlights of R.J. Reynolds this first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased slightly as gains in the companies' growth brands offset cigarette volume declines in its support and nonsupport brands. R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating margin also improved, driven by pricing and productivity gain. R.J. Reynolds' long-term strategy to reduce complexity and improve efficiency has proven to be very successful. And the company plans to further refine its cigarette portfolio and eliminate most of its remaining private label brands this year. You'll remember that the company reduced its SKUs by over 80% through the end of last year to less than 150. R.J. Reynolds is also making good progress in improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies like consolidating production at its Tobaccoville facility. The company remains on track to close its Whitaker Park manufacturing facility later this year.
R.J. Reynolds' total first quarter cigarette market share was stable at 27.9%. However, if we exclude the delisted private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share actually increased by a full percentage point. As I mentioned earlier today, R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to make gains in the first quarter. Their combined market share increased 2.7 percentage points to 16.3%. We remain pleased by Camel's performance, both in terms of market share and brand demographics.
The brand's first quarter cigarette market share increased by 0.7 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 7.8%. And Camel launched a new equity building promotion, the Hump Day Sweepstakes campaign at the end of March. Already, the brand is seeing a great response from consumers. This program is highlighted on Camel's packaging as being used in all major brand marketing materials. The promotion encourages adult tobacco consumers to seize the Hump Day and break free to explore the unexpected and get rewarded.
This is part of Camel's brand promise, to empower individual enjoyment for adult tobacco consumers. Also enhancing Camel's performance are its menthol styles with innovative capsule technology that offer adult smokers the choice, fresh menthol flavor on demand. In fact, Camel's menthol share of market, including Camel Crush, increased 0.5 percentage point in the first quarter and now stands at 2%.
Moving to modern smoke-free tobacco. Camel introduced a number of changes in the quarter, all aimed at deepening the brand's commitment to offer innovative smoke-free tobacco products for adult consumers to enjoy anytime and anywhere. For example, while Camel SNUS continues to show steady growth, R.J. Reynolds expanded the range of SNUS offerings during the quarter to give even more adult tobacco consumers a reason to try and ultimately, switch to Camel SNUS. 
In February, Camel SNUS introduced Frost Large Pouches and a Mint style in selected lead markets. These new styles broaden the range of choices for adult tobacco consumers and are generating good interest. Camel SNUS Frost is the best-selling SNUS style in America, and the larger Frost Pouch styles will meet the preferences of a broader range of tobacco users. Camel SNUS Mint is another good addition to the portfolio, with mint being a long-established preference in smokeless tobacco. With the introduction of an increasing number of competitive SNUS products over the past year, the SNUS category is continuing to expand. R.J. Reynolds expects this increased interest to further build positive awareness for this category over the long-term. And Camel SNUS is well positioned to benefit from this growth.
In March, Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips were introduced in two new lead markets, Charlotte and Denver. These new dissolvable products and their packaging reflects the input that R.J. Reynolds received from consumers in its first round of lead markets. The company expects to continue to gain valuable insights from adult tobacco consumers in these new markets.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' other growth brand, Pall Mall. Pall Mall had another outstanding quarter, increasing its market share by 2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 8.5%. The company remains focused on building the Pall Mall brand while balancing overall share and profitability growth. In summary, R.J. Reynolds continues its positive momentum in the first quarter, which provides a strong foundation for longer-term success.
Turning to American Snuff. I'm very pleased with the company's results in the first quarter, with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, delivering increases in the company's adjusted operating income and margin. Bear in mind that these results reflect only 2 months of earnings from Lane before that business was sold at the end of February. Once again, American Snuff's performance was led by its flagship brand, Grizzly, which continues to benefit from last year's packaging upgrade. Grizzly is also benefiting from the R.J. Reynolds field trade marketing organization that serves American Snuff. The company now has more than 2,000 trade marketing professionals, representing its products at retail.
Turning to market share. The company's total moist-snuff consumer offtake share increased 1.3 percentage points in the first quarter to 31.1%. And this growth was driven by Grizzly, which increased share by 1.5 percentage points to 27.1%. Grizzly's performance during the quarter was further enhanced by its strong position in Pouch sales. In the first quarter, more than 9% of total moist-snuff category sales were in the rapidly growing Pouch segment, and Grizzly grew to represent about 25% of that total. That's great progress, considering that the brand introduced its first Pouch product just three years ago. I'm pleased to report that Grizzly now has the #1 overall pouch style in the market. I must say that despite intense competitive activities, Grizzly has had a powerful impact since it was introduced 10 years ago, and that's still with only 12 styles.
I'd also like to mention the new retail moist-snuff contract that American Snuff introduced in February. These contracts represent an investment in the business and ensures that Grizzly will have its fair share of retail space, as well as improved pricing and brand communication. This investment will better position Grizzly for continued long-term growth. So it's clear that both American Snuff and R.J. Reynolds are focused on delivering profitable growth for RAI shareholders. And I'm extremely pleased with their momentum. Now Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website.
Turning to our financial highlights. RAI's first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 5.4% to $0.59. These adjusted results exclude $0.01 per share related to plant closings and tax items. On a reported basis, RAI's first quarter EPS was $0.60. That was more than triple the prior year quarter's reported EPS of $0.14, which was impacted by the changes in federal healthcare laws and the Canadian government settlements. RAI's adjusted operating margin saw strong growth in the first quarter, gaining 0.9 of a percentage point to 29.6%. As a result of this performance, I'm pleased to reaffirm adjusted 2011 EPS guidance in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, excluding implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items. I would note that delaying sale closed earlier than our original expectations of mid-year, which will result in a lower earnings contribution from that business than we have previously estimated.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' first quarter adjusted operating income of $471 million increased slightly from the prior-year quarter. The company benefited from higher cigarette pricing and growth brand volume gains, while also delivering further productivity improvements. This adjusted results exclude $8 million in implementation costs related to plant closings. And R.J. Reynolds also improved its first quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 0.5 percentage point to 27.8%. 
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' first quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.2% from the prior year quarter. However, excluding the delisted private label brands, volume was down 3%. This compares well with the industry's first quarter volume decline of 3.4%. I would also note that R.J. Reynolds' wholesale inventory levels declined about 300 million units during the quarter, while industry inventory remained constant at relatively higher levels. So that's a brief recap of R.J. Reynolds' key results.  
On American Snuff, given the impact on earnings from the sale of Lane, American Snuff delivered solid first quarter growth, with adjusted operating income increasing 4.2% from the prior year quarter to $87 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. These adjusted results exclude $2 million of implementation costs.
American Snuff's first quarter adjusted operating margin also increased, gaining 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 52.3%.
Turning to moist-snuff volume. The company's total first quarter shipment volume grew 13.2%. I would note that this reflects a favorable comparison with the prior year quarter, which was impacted by aggressive competitive activity. Grizzly's first quarter shipment volume saw a significant increase, rising 17.1% from the prior year quarter. So American Snuff continues to build on their strong foundation and is well positioned for growth over the rest of the year. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $3 billion, including the $200 million from the Lane sale. I'll remind you that on April 15, R.J. Reynolds made its MSA [Master Settlement Agreement] payment of about $2 billion, of which $477 million was deposited in the NPM [non-participating manufacturers] disputed funds account. That brings the total amount in dispute to almost $3 billion for the years 2003 through 2008. 
We continue to evaluate opportunities to add value for our shareholders. With the 8.2% dividend increase in February, RAI has raised dividend by nearly 18% over the past year. Thank you, and we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

I would remind you, as I have in the past on these calls, that we're building two facilities at American Snuff, a lead processing facility, as well as a new manufacturing facility in Memphis. Our capital expenditures this year, we expect to be in the range where they were last year. And that's right around $200 million. And we spent $44 million of that in the first quarter. So we still have a little bit of lifting to do there. We've got some debt coming due in June, $400 million, and that's our floater, that's at about 1%. And so we would likely pay that off in cash so that rather than refinancing that because refinancing will be dilutive to our results. That having been said, we are focused on getting value back to shareholders. In my remarks, I mentioned that we have increased the dividend, almost 18% in the past year. We look at that as a primary vehicle to getting value back. But we also do discuss share repurchases, and we will continue to have those discussions but internally and with our board."

And what that really means is, absent any pricing, that's what the decline rate would be. And on top of that, I would put the price sensitivity of demand at that historic rate of about 0.35.

399584,129579938,116664,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be with you today, and share with you some of the insights and results at Reynolds American and its operating companies. As our results show, RAI and it's operating companies turned in a good first quarter, givi",1448,"Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be with you today, and share with you some of the insights and results at Reynolds American and its operating companies. As our results show, RAI and it's operating companies turned in a good first quarter, giving us a solid foundation for growth in the year ahead.
As you can see from the positive results across our companies, RAI's initiative to transform tobacco continues to gain momentum. RAI delivers higher adjusted earnings and margin, driven by additional volume and share gains on all our operating companies' key brands, as well as higher pricing and further productivity improvements. Both of our reportable business segments, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff, continue to execute their business strategies extremely well. And this is reflected by further improvement in their marketplace and financial performance. And once again, performance was strong at Santa Fe, with higher volume, share and earnings in the first quarter. 
Two other highlights I'd like to touch on. Reynolds American continued to deliver value to our shareholders with a further dividend increase of 8.2% in February, bringing it in line with RAI's revised 80% dividend payout target. I would also note that RAI successfully closed the sale of its Lane, Limited subsidiary in February. This allows RAI's operating companies to focus their energy resources on the primary growth categories within their businesses.
This continued transformation of our operating companies' business and their focus on providing innovative tobacco products to meet changing consumer preferences positions RAI well for long-term success. As we reported today, RAI is reaffirming its guidance, and we expect full year adjusted EPS growth in the mid- to high single-digits, excluding charges related to plant closings and tax items.
Before I turn to our operating companies' performance, I want to briefly address developments on the regulatory front. After the recent release of the report on menthol by the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, as well as reports from the industry and others, the FDA is now considering input from a range of parties in its review of the use of menthol in cigarettes. R.J. Reynolds continues to believe that any final decision by the agency should be based on sound science. And the company will continue to provide information and perspectives on this issue to the agency as it undertakes this process. We remain committed to complying with FDA requirements as they are established while continuing to compete effectively in the marketplace.
Now I'd like to talk about the highlights of R.J. Reynolds this first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased slightly as gains in the companies' growth brands offset cigarette volume declines in its support and nonsupport brands. R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating margin also improved, driven by pricing and productivity gain. R.J. Reynolds' long-term strategy to reduce complexity and improve efficiency has proven to be very successful. And the company plans to further refine its cigarette portfolio and eliminate most of its remaining private label brands this year. You'll remember that the company reduced its SKUs by over 80% through the end of last year to less than 150. R.J. Reynolds is also making good progress in improving its cigarette manufacturing efficiencies like consolidating production at its Tobaccoville facility. The company remains on track to close its Whitaker Park manufacturing facility later this year.
R.J. Reynolds' total first quarter cigarette market share was stable at 27.9%. However, if we exclude the delisted private label brands, the company's total cigarette market share actually increased by a full percentage point. As I mentioned earlier today, R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to make gains in the first quarter. Their combined market share increased 2.7 percentage points to 16.3%. We remain pleased by Camel's performance, both in terms of market share and brand demographics.
The brand's first quarter cigarette market share increased by 0.7 tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 7.8%. And Camel launched a new equity building promotion, the Hump Day Sweepstakes campaign at the end of March. Already, the brand is seeing a great response from consumers. This program is highlighted on Camel's packaging as being used in all major brand marketing materials. The promotion encourages adult tobacco consumers to seize the Hump Day and break free to explore the unexpected and get rewarded.
This is part of Camel's brand promise, to empower individual enjoyment for adult tobacco consumers. Also enhancing Camel's performance are its menthol styles with innovative capsule technology that offer adult smokers the choice, fresh menthol flavor on demand. In fact, Camel's menthol share of market, including Camel Crush, increased 0.5 percentage point in the first quarter and now stands at 2%.
Moving to modern smoke-free tobacco. Camel introduced a number of changes in the quarter, all aimed at deepening the brand's commitment to offer innovative smoke-free tobacco products for adult consumers to enjoy anytime and anywhere. For example, while Camel SNUS continues to show steady growth, R.J. Reynolds expanded the range of SNUS offerings during the quarter to give even more adult tobacco consumers a reason to try and ultimately, switch to Camel SNUS. 
In February, Camel SNUS introduced Frost Large Pouches and a Mint style in selected lead markets. These new styles broaden the range of choices for adult tobacco consumers and are generating good interest. Camel SNUS Frost is the best-selling SNUS style in America, and the larger Frost Pouch styles will meet the preferences of a broader range of tobacco users. Camel SNUS Mint is another good addition to the portfolio, with mint being a long-established preference in smokeless tobacco. With the introduction of an increasing number of competitive SNUS products over the past year, the SNUS category is continuing to expand. R.J. Reynolds expects this increased interest to further build positive awareness for this category over the long-term. And Camel SNUS is well positioned to benefit from this growth.
In March, Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips were introduced in two new lead markets, Charlotte and Denver. These new dissolvable products and their packaging reflect the input that R.J. Reynolds received from consumers in its first round of lead markets. The company expects to continue to gain valuable insights from adult tobacco consumers in these new markets.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' other growth brand, Pall Mall. Pall Mall had another outstanding quarter, increasing its market share by 2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 8.5%. The company remains focused on building the Pall Mall brand while balancing overall share and profitability growth. In summary, R.J. Reynolds continues its positive momentum in the first quarter, which provides a strong foundation for longer-term success.
Turning to American Snuff. I'm very pleased with the company's results in the first quarter, with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume, delivering increases in the company's adjusted operating income and margin. Bear in mind that these results reflect only 2 months of earnings from Lane before that business was sold at the end of February. Once again, American Snuff's performance was led by its flagship brand, Grizzly, which continues to benefit from last year's packaging upgrade. Grizzly is also benefiting from the R.J. Reynolds field trade marketing organization that serves American Snuff. The company now has more than 2,000 trade marketing professionals, representing its products at retail.
Turning to market share. The company's total moist-snuff consumer offtake share increased 1.3 percentage points in the first quarter to 31.1%. And this growth was driven by Grizzly, which increased share by 1.5 percentage points to 27.1%. Grizzly's performance during the quarter was further enhanced by its strong position in Pouch sales. In the first quarter, more than 9% of total moist-snuff category sales were in the rapidly growing Pouch segment, and Grizzly grew to represent about 25% of that total. That's great progress, considering that the brand introduced its first Pouch product just 3 years ago. I'm pleased to report that Grizzly now has the #1 overall pouch style in the market. I must say that despite intense competitive activities, Grizzly has had a powerful impact since it was introduced 10 years ago, and that's still with only 12 styles.
I'd also like to mention the new retail moist-snuff contracts that American Snuff introduced in February. These contracts represent an investment in the business and ensures that Grizzly will have its fair share of retail space, as well as improved pricing and brand communication. This investment will better position Grizzly for continued long-term growth. So it's clear that both American Snuff and R.J. Reynolds are focused on delivering profitable growth for RAI shareholders. And I'm extremely pleased with their momentum. Now Tom will provide some financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is available on our website.
Turning to our financial highlights. RAI's first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 5.4% to $0.59. These adjusted results exclude $0.01 per share related to plant closings and tax items. On a reported basis, RAI's first quarter EPS was $0.60. That was more than triple the prior year quarter's reported EPS of $0.14, which was impacted by the changes in federal healthcare laws and the Canadian government settlements. RAI's adjusted operating margin saw strong growth in the first quarter, gaining 0.9 of a percentage point to 29.6%. As a result of this performance, I'm pleased to reaffirm adjusted 2011 EPS guidance in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, excluding implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items. I would note that the Lane sale closed earlier than our original expectations of mid-year, which will result in a lower earnings contribution from that business than we have previously estimated.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' first quarter adjusted operating income of $471 million increased slightly from the prior year quarter. The company benefited from higher cigarette pricing and growth brand volume gains, while also delivering further productivity improvements. This adjusted results exclude $8 million in implementation costs related to plant closings. And R.J. Reynolds also improved its first quarter adjusted operating margin, which increased 0.5 percentage point to 27.8%. 
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' first quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 5.2% from the prior year quarter. However, excluding the delisted private label brands, volume was down 3%. This compares well with the industry's first quarter volume decline of 3.4%. I would also note that R.J. Reynolds' wholesale inventory levels declined about 300 million units during the quarter, while industry inventory remained constant at relatively higher levels. So that's a brief recap of R.J. Reynolds' key results.  
On American Snuff, given the impact on earnings from the sale of Lane, American Snuff delivered solid first quarter growth, with adjusted operating income increasing 4.2% from the prior year quarter to $87 million. This was driven by higher pricing and moist-snuff volume growth. These adjusted results exclude $2 million of implementation costs.
American Snuff's first quarter adjusted operating margin also increased, gaining 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 52.3%.
Turning to moist-snuff volume. The company's total first quarter shipment volume grew 13.2%. I would note that this reflects a favorable comparison with the prior year quarter, which was impacted by aggressive competitive activity. Grizzly's first quarter shipment volume saw a significant increase, rising 17.1% from the prior year quarter. So American Snuff continues to build on their strong foundation and is well positioned for growth over the rest of the year. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $3 billion, including the $200 million from the Lane sale. I'll remind you that on April 15, R.J. Reynolds made its MSA [Master Settlement Agreement] payment of about $2 billion, of which $477 million was deposited in the NPM [non-participating manufacturers] disputed funds account. That brings the total amount in dispute to almost $3 billion for the years 2003 through 2008. 
We continue to evaluate opportunities to add value for our shareholders. With the 8.2% dividend increase in February, RAI has raised dividend by nearly 18% over the past year. Thank you, and we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

I would remind you, as I have in the past on these calls, that we're building two facilities at American Snuff, a lead processing facility, as well as a new manufacturing facility in Memphis. Our capital expenditures this year, we expect to be in the range where they were last year. And that's right around $200 million. And we spent $44 million of that in the first quarter. So we still have a little bit of lifting to do there. We've got some debt coming due in June, $400 million, and actually that's our floater, that's at about 1%. And so we would likely pay that off in cash so that rather than refinancing that because refinancing will be dilutive to our results. That having been said, we are focused on getting value back to shareholders. In my remarks, I mentioned that we have increased the dividend, almost 18% in the past year. We look at that as a primary vehicle to getting value back. But we also do discuss share repurchases, and we will continue to have those discussions both internally and with our board."

Of course, we'll need to watch and see what happens with the more recent spike in gas prices, in terms of what that does to disposable income. The way I like to look at kind of the total market development, there appears to be sort of a level of secular decline in cigarettes, specifically. That number is probably somewhere about 1.8 to 2. And what that really means is, absent any pricing, that's what the decline rate would be. And on top of that, I would put the price sensitivity of demand at that historic rate of about 0.35. And we haven't really seen any change in trend based on short-term economic factors to that model."

Reynolds American delivered higher earnings in the second quarter as its operating companies key brands made additional gains despite the challenging economic and competitive environments.Both of our reportable business segments",1231,"Good morning, everyone. Reynolds American delivered higher earnings in the second quarter as its operating companies key brands made additional gains despite the challenging economic and competitive environments.
Both of our reportable business segments continue to execute their business strategies effectively. With R.J. Reynolds growth brands increasing their combined market share and American Snuff reporting excellent growth in volume, share and operating margin.
At Santa Fe, I'm pleased to say second quarter results were strong. Once again, the company generated growth in volume, share and earnings. As we reported today, RAI's first half results allowed us to tighten our earnings projections for the full year.
RAI and its operating companies continue to demonstrate strength and resilience despite significant competitive activity in the second quarter and the ongoing weak economy.
As a result, we remain on track to deliver 2011 adjusted EPS growth in the mid- to high-single digits. This range excludes the charge for the Scott smoking cessation lawsuit in Louisiana, as well as implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items recognized in the first half of the year.
Over the long term, our strategy is straightforward and bullish. RAI and its operating companies are focused on leading transformation of the tobacco industry, while continuing to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. We continue to drive innovation across our businesses, with a commitment to redefining enjoyment for adult tobacco consumer.
Now I'll provide additional details on our operating companies. R.J. Reynolds' second quarter adjusted operating income was down slightly in both the second quarter and for the first half. Gains in the companies growth brands were offset by cigarette volume declines in its support and non-support brands. The cigarette category continues to demonstrate good pricing power as evidenced by the price increase that R.J. Reynolds took early this month. 
I would also note that the R.J. Reynolds remained focused on achieving the right balance between profitability and market share growth. Competitive promotional activity increased significantly with the timing of promotional cycles in April and May, while R.J. Reynolds had relatively normal promotional levels in the quarter.
The company's total second quarter cigarette market share was down half a percentage point at 27.4%. However, if we exclude the private label brands that have been delisted as part of the company's portfolio simplification efforts, it's total cigarette market share was in line with the prior-year quarter at 27.3%.
R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well in the second quarter. Their combined market share increased 1.5 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 16.3%. And these 2 brands accounted for almost 60% of the company's total cigarette volume in the quarter.
Camel's second quarter market share was steady at 7.8%, which is good performance, especially for premium priced brand in this challenging environment. R.J. Reynolds continue to focus on building brand equity for Camel. The brand's most recent promotion, the Hump Day campaign started in March. And the response from adult tobacco consumers to its web-based initiative have been nothing short of fantastic.
Indeed, this is the company's most successful promotion in recent years, with more than 1 million visits to the brand's websites. A key driver behind Camel's performance is its menthol styles, which use R.J. Reynolds' innovative capsule technology. Camel share of the growing menthol market increased by 0.3% in the second quarter and now stands at 2.1%.
R.J. Reynolds will continue to build momentum with next week's national expansion, Camel Crush Bold. This one additional SKU also uses a capsule technology and offers a richer, more full-bodied tobacco taste. I would also point out that this is R.J. Reynolds' first new national cigarette line extension since Camel Crush went national 3 years ago.
The company expects this new style to drive additional growth and further broaden the appeal of the Camel brand.
Now moving to Camel's modern smoke-free tobacco products. Camel SNUS again performed well in the second quarter. Its interest continues to grow in this convenient smoke-free option for adult tobacco consumers. As we mentioned last quarter, R.J. Reynolds introduced 2 new Camel SNUS styles in lead market, SNUS mint and Frost Large. Although they've been in the markets for only one quarter, they're showing encouraging results. These 2 styles offer adult tobacco consumers more options to try and ultimately switch to this innovative product. 
In addition, the company launched the Camel SNUS Pleasure Switch Challenge promotion, which is also increasing the brand's awareness and trial.
On Camel's line of dissolvable tobacco products, these products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips, were refined and improved and introduced in 2 new lead markets in March. The products are attracting consumer interest in the company continues to gain valuable insights about this new category.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds second growth brand. Pall Mall reported another excellent quarter, delivering double-digit volume growth and increasing its market share by 1.5 percentage points. The brand achieved an 8.5% share of market for the quarter. This high-quality, longer-lasting cigarettes has proven to be a very popular choice for adult smokers taking value, especially in this weak economy.
This distinctive blend of quality and value offers a strong foundation for Pall Mall's long-term success. So in summary, R.J. Reynolds demonstrated strength and resilience in the face of some strong headwinds in the quarter and is well positioned for growth in the remainder of the year. Now turning to American Snuff.
I'm pleased with the company's solid underlying performance in the quarter despite low price line extensions of premium brands and significant promotional activities on deep discount brands. I would note that the sale of Lane in February negatively impacted the earnings comparison for the quarter, and Tom will give you more details on that in just a moment.
American Snuff's second quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share performed extremely well, increasing 1.5 percentage points from the prior-year quarter to 31.3%. This performance is driven by the company's flagship brand, Grizzly, which reported strong gains in both volume and share. Grizzly's momentum continued in the second quarter, with consumer offtake share increasing by 1.9 percentage points from the prior year. Grizzly now holds a 27.4% share of market. The brand continues to benefit from the strength of the scale of R.J. Reynolds field trade marketing organization that now also serves American Snuff.
In addition, the new retail moist snuff contracts that were introduced in the second quarter are giving Grizzly more retail space, as well as improved brand and pricing communication. This investment has better positioned the brand for continued long-term growth. And American Snuff continues to invest in the equity of Grizzly with promotions like its current giving it to use say sweepstakes, which engages adult tobacco consumers in an exciting web-based campaign.
In the brand is planning activities to celebrate its 10th anniversary by September. Grizzly's post sales continued to be a key factor in the brand's strong performance. The growing pouch segment accounts for more than 9% of the moist-snuff category. Grizzly has also seen rapid growth in its pouch styles since their introduction just 3 years ago. I'm proud to say that Grizzly Wintergreen Pouches are the best-selling pouch styles in the market. 
In summary, both American Snuff and R.J. Reynolds continued to successfully leverage their sound business strategies and grow their key brands while navigating through a challenging environment. Now Tom will provide some additional financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted-to-reported results are in our press release, which is on our website. RAI have a solid quarter posting adjusted earnings per share of $0.67, up 1.5%. Higher pricing and moist-snuff volume gains more than offset cigarette volume declines. These adjusted results reflect the impact of the Lane sale and exclude a charge of $0.15 per share related to the Scott lawsuit.
On a reported basis, RAI second earnings per share was $0.52, down 10.3% from the prior-year quarter. For the first half of 2011, adjusted earnings per share was $1.26, up 4.1% from the prior-year period. This adjusted results exclude the second quarter charges I just mentioned, as well as first quarter tax items.
In addition, there were prior-year charges for plant closings and the single sales force implementation. RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, in line with the prior-year quarter. First half adjusted operating margin was 29.9%, up 0.5% from the prior-year period.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds performance. The company's second quarter adjusted operating income was $562 million, down $6 million from the prior-year quarter. Higher cigarette pricing, productivity improvements and growth-brand gains were offset by the decline in support and nonsupport cigarette volume. These adjusted results exclude $139 million for the Scott lawsuit, as well as $3 million in implementation costs related to plant closing.
For the first half of 2011, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating income was $1.03 billion, down 0.5% from the prior-year period. This first half adjusted results also exclude the charges I just mentioned.
R.J. Reynolds second quarter adjusted operating margin declined $0.06of a percentage points to 28.7%. And that brought the first-half adjusted operating margin to 28.3%, in line with the prior-year period. I would note the second quarter margin was negatively impacted by an increase in all R.J. Reynolds' contract manufacturing for the BAT Japan. disruptions from the natural disaster there in March of higher demand for the BAP products sourced by R.J. Reynolds.
Excluding that impact, second quarter margin was in line with the prior-year period. 
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' second quarter cigarette shipment volume inclined 4.4% from the prior-year quarter. Volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of competitive promotional activity in the quarter. If you exclude the company's delisted private label brands, volume was down 3.6% while the industry's second quarter volume declined 1.3%.
However, I would note that industry's cigarette inventories as wholesale increased significantly during the quarter. I would remind you that R.J. Reynolds has a policy to minimize wholesale inventory fluctuations.
Now turning to American Snuff's second quarter results. The company's operating income was $81 million, down 4.7% from the adjusted prior-year quarter. Here I would note the prior-year quarter did include about $10 million from the Lane business, which was sold in February this year. American Snuff also made investments in the implementation of new retail moist-snuff contracts.
For the first half of 2011, the company's adjusted operating income was $168 million, down $1 million from the prior year period, which included a full 6 months of earnings from Lane. First half adjusted results exclude $2 million in implementation costs. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin increased by 5.5 percentage points from the adjusted prior-year quarter to 52.4%. I would note the margin did benefit from the timing of promotional spending in the prior year related to the introduction of embossed metal lids on Grizzly.
That brought first half adjusted operating margin to 52.3%, up 3.1 percentage points. Turning to moist-snuff volume. American Snuff increased most snuff shipment volume by 3.6% in the second quarter, bringing the first half shipment volume gain to 8.1%. Underlying industry volume growth has remained at about 6% this year. 
Grizzly's second quarter shipment volume also increased despite strong competitive activity rising 4.7% from the prior-year quarter. All in all, the brand's first half shipments were up 10.4%.
Kodiak, American Snuff's premium priced brand, delivers stable volume performance in the quarter. Now I'd like to turn to RAI's balance sheet.
Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.3 billion and this was after making the $1.96 billion MSA payment in April. The company also continued to strengthen its balance sheet, with a debt repayment of $400 million in June.
We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders, with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 80%. And we remain focused on evaluating opportunities to turn additional value to shareholder.
Based on RAI first half performance and a positive momentum we expect over the rest of the year, we've raised the bottom end of our adjusted 2011 earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.62 to $2.70. This excludes the Scott lawsuit charge and the implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items.
Also excluded from this estimate is any potential impact from the Engle progeny cases. We are currently reviewing the financial implications at this week's decision by the Florida Supreme Court. Thank you, and now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator? Would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

I think first of all, it's worth kind of noting why wholesalers actually did inventory. There was during the quarter, in the back end of the quarter, particularly, there was price increase speculation on behalf of the wholesalers. In addition to that, some of the wholesalers, they needed extra inventory to cover the Fourth of July holiday. Of course, the Fourth of July happens every year so you would expect that part of it was in the numbers. And we in the company have an ongoing policy to really limit the press speculation and we do that by basically placing wholesalers on allocation and is making sure that we minimize any fluctuations in the supply chain. And the reason we do that is because obviously as an adverse impact on our operations and on the entire supply chain so to keep everything as a efficient as possible. So from an impact point of view, I think it's fair to say that the industry serve inventory that was built as wholesale, we were underrepresented within that. And we did our best to limit inventory build to only what was required for the Fourth of July holiday. Now with just to underscore that point, if you look at our business to date now in July, I would say that we've seen a normal levels of shipment post to Fourth of July holiday. Now I think one other factor is quite important when we think about the inventory side of things. When that is actually shipped, you get full list price for the volume that's actually shipped. But the value of the promotional dollars attached to that volume, they only sort of hit the company when it's actually shipped from wholesale to retail. So really building inventories is that full margin."

And then fundamentally, it's a great product with some great packaging now with the metal-lid upgrade and at a very reasonable popular price. and I think that's just hitting on all cylinders as we speak. and I think there's still more to come in terms of that growth, particularly around some of the field force efforts. And the way I would describe that is, of course, we launched a new retail contract that retail. And we have many more feed on the street now servicing the brand. But getting those new retail contracts and one thing is actually signing the contract, the second part of that is actually implementing and executing. And from that, we continue to see ongoing benefit."

We also have in our plans as we've disclosed about $300 million pension plan contribution that we'll make in the back half of the year for some number of order of magnitude close to the $300 million. And then we've unfortunately have the Scott case, that $139 million that Dan has talked about. And so we do have requirement on our capital for -- within the near term. And we've also just pay down debt but that was actually in the balance of $400 million. Now to your point that does put us right at the bottom end it's actually slightly below our range of debt to EBITDA that would like to operate in, which is 1.5 to 2.5.

First of all, in the MLB, this is a latest iteration of the trade program and we have seen many trade programs over the years they kind of come and go. And most trade programs whether or not I think the MLB is no different to that, you get a certain level of people, retailers basically signing up for them. And then over time, what you see is more and more people kind of joining the program. And that's very normal kind of trade behavior over time, and this go around and there's been no different. Now what all trade programs tried to do is they try to split the world between retailers that are on the program and retailers that aren't. And so fundamentally, I don't think there is a significant change in the aggregate kind of dynamics out of retail. And when I kind of look at the second quarter specifically, what maybe had a more significant impact on our business was actually the absolute number of dollars spent back in the marketplace, not so much of where and what retailers against what the trade program. And just to reiterate some of the comments I made earlier, that spent competitive expense increased in the early part of the quarter specifically in the months of April and May and then came down to more normalized levels in the month of June. So that's really on the cigarettes I. I think on the moist snuff side, the way I would characterize our trade program, it's a fairly standard, fairly normal kind of trade program. On were really doing is incentivizing retailers to give Grizzly it's fair share of presence at retail. And by presence preference, I really mean the right number of places at retail, given the sense of the brand and the right level of signage and price communication. So I think it really what were incentive maybe is basically a ketchup were historically, the American Snuff company was a very much few were people out a trade marketing wasn't able to comment depressants with the brand Grizzly specifically deserves. And so really just kind of late in ketchup as we speak and basic during the quite affectively which is reflecting in a very positive momentum on the brand."

Reynolds American delivered higher earnings in the second quarter as its operating companies key brands made additional gains despite the challenging economic and competitive environments.Both of our reportable business segments",1236,"Good morning, everyone. Reynolds American delivered higher earnings in the second quarter as its operating companies key brands made additional gains despite the challenging economic and competitive environments.
Both of our reportable business segments continue to execute their business strategies effectively. With R.J. Reynolds growth brands increasing their combined market share and American Snuff reporting excellent growth in volume, share and operating margin.
At Santa Fe, I'm pleased to say second quarter results were strong. Once again, the company generated growth in volume, share and earnings. As we reported today, RAI's first half results allowed us to tighten our earnings projections for the full year.
RAI and its operating companies continue to demonstrate strength and resilience despite significant competitive activity in the second quarter and the ongoing weak economy.
As a result, we remain on track to deliver 2011 adjusted EPS growth in the mid- to high-single digits. This range excludes the charge for the Scott smoking cessation lawsuit in Louisiana, as well as implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items recognized in the first half of the year.
Over the long term, our strategy is straightforward and bullish. RAI and its operating companies are focused on leading transformation of the tobacco industry, while continuing to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. We continue to drive innovation across our businesses, with a commitment to redefining enjoyment for adult tobacco consumer.
Now I'll provide additional details on our operating companies. R.J. Reynolds' second quarter adjusted operating income was down slightly in both the second quarter and for the first half. Gains in the companies growth brands were offset by cigarette volume declines in its support and non-support brands. The cigarette category continues to demonstrate good pricing power as evidenced by the price increase that R.J. Reynolds took early this month. 
I would also note that R.J. Reynolds remained focused on achieving the right balance between profitability and market share growth. Competitive promotional activity increased significantly with the timing of promotional cycles in April and May, while R.J. Reynolds had relatively normal promotional levels in the quarter.
The company's total second quarter cigarette market share was down half a percentage point at 27.4%. However, if we exclude the private label brands that have been delisted as part of the company's portfolio simplification efforts, it's total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 27.3%.
R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well in the second quarter. Their combined market share increased 1.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.3%. And these 2 brands accounted for almost 60% of the company's total cigarette volume in the quarter.
Camel's second quarter market share was steady at 7.8%, which is good performance, especially for premium priced brand in this challenging environment. R.J. Reynolds continue to focus on building brand equity for Camel. The brand's most recent promotion, the Hump Day Sweepstakes campaign started in March. And the response from adult tobacco consumers to this web-based initiative have been nothing short of fantastic.
Indeed, this is the company's most successful promotion in recent years, with more than 1 million visits to the brand's websites. A key driver behind Camel's performance is its menthol styles, which use R.J. Reynolds' innovative capsule technology. Camel share of the growing menthol market increased by 0.3 of a percentage point in the second quarter and now stands at 2.1%.
R.J. Reynolds will continue to build momentum with next week's national expansion, Camel Crush Bold. This one additional SKU also uses the capsule technology and offers a richer, more full-bodied tobacco taste. I would also point out that this is R.J. Reynolds' first new national cigarette line extension since Camel Crush went national 3 years ago.
The company expects this new style to drive additional growth and further broaden the appeal of the Camel brand.
Now moving to Camel's modern smoke-free tobacco products. Camel SNUS again performed well in the second quarter. Its interest continues to grow in this convenient smoke-free option for adult tobacco consumers. As we mentioned last quarter, R.J. Reynolds introduced 2 new Camel SNUS styles in lead market, SNUS mint and Frost Large. Although they've been in the markets for only one quarter, they're showing encouraging results. These 2 styles offer adult tobacco consumers more options to try and ultimately switch to this innovative product. 
In addition, the company launched the Camel SNUS Pleasure Switch Challenge promotion, which is also increasing the brand's awareness and trial.
On Camel's line of dissolvable tobacco products, these products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips, were refined and improved and introduced in 2 new lead markets in March. The products are attracting good consumer interest and the company continues to gain valuable insights about this new category.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds second growth brand. Pall Mall reported another excellent quarter, delivering double-digit volume growth and increasing its market share by 1.5 percentage points. The brand achieved an 8.5% share of market for the quarter. This high-quality, longer-lasting cigarette has proven to be a very popular choice for adult smokers taking value, especially in this weak economy.
This distinctive blend of quality and value offers a strong foundation for Pall Mall's long-term success. So in summary, R.J. Reynolds demonstrated strength and resilience in the face of some strong headwinds in the quarter and is well positioned for growth in the remainder of the year. Now turning to American Snuff.
I'm pleased with the company's solid underlying performance in the quarter despite low price line extensions of premium brands and significant promotional activities on deep discount brands. I would note that the sale of Lane in February negatively impacted the earnings comparison for the quarter, and Tom will give you more details on that in just a moment.
American Snuff's second quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share performed extremely well, increasing 1.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 31.3%. This performance was driven by the company's flagship brand, Grizzly, which reported strong gains in both volume and share. Grizzly's momentum continued in the second quarter, with consumer offtake share increasing by 1.9 percentage points from the prior year. Grizzly now holds a 27.4% share of market. The brand continues to benefit from the strength and scale of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization that now also serves American Snuff.
Addition, the new retail moist snuff contracts that were introduced in the second quarter are giving Grizzly more retail space, as well as improved brand and pricing communication. This investment has better positioned the brand for continued long-term growth. And American Snuff continues to invest in the equity of Grizzly with promotions like its current giving it to you straight sweepstakes, which engages adult tobacco consumers in an exciting web-based campaign.
And the brand is planning activities to celebrate its 10th anniversary by September. Grizzly's post sales continued to be a key factor in the brand's strong performance. The growing pouch segment accounts for more than 9% of the moist-snuff category. Grizzly has also seen rapid growth in its pouch styles since their introduction just 3 years ago. I'm proud to say that Grizzly Wintergreen Pouches are the best-selling pouch styles in the market. 
In summary, both American Snuff and R.J. Reynolds continued to successfully leverage their sound business strategies and grow their key brands while navigating through a challenging environment. Now Tom will provide some additional financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted-to-reported results are in our press release, which is on our website. RAI have a solid quarter posting adjusted earnings per share of $0.67, up 1.5%. Higher pricing and moist-snuff volume gains more than offset cigarette volume declines. These adjusted results reflect the impact of the Lane sale and exclude a charge of $0.15 per share related to the Scott lawsuit.
On a reported basis, RAI second quarter earnings per share was $0.52, down 10.3% from the prior year quarter. For the first half of 2011, adjusted earnings per share was $1.26, up 4.1% from the prior year period. This adjusted results exclude the second quarter charges I just mentioned, as well as first quarter tax items.
In addition, there were prior year charges for plant closings and the single sales force implementation. RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, in line with the prior year quarter. First half adjusted operating margin was 29.9%, up 0.5% from the prior year period.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds performance. The company's second quarter adjusted operating income was $562 million, down $6 million from the prior year quarter. Higher cigarette pricing, productivity improvements and growth-brand gains were offset by the decline in support and nonsupport cigarette volume. These adjusted results exclude $139 million for the Scott lawsuit, as well as $3 million in implementation costs related to plant closing.
For the first half of 2011, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating income was $1.03 billion, down 0.5% from the prior year period. This first half adjusted results also exclude the charges I just mentioned.
R.J. Reynolds second quarter adjusted operating margin declined 0.6 of a percentage point to 28.7%. And that brought the first half adjusted operating margin to 28.3%, in line with the prior year period. I would note the second quarter margin was negatively impacted by an increase in R.J. Reynolds' contract manufacturing for the BAT Japan. Disruptions from the natural disaster there in March drove higher demand for BAT products sourced by R.J. Reynolds.
Excluding that impact, second quarter margin was in line with the prior year period. 
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' second quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 4.4% from the prior-year quarter. Volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of competitive promotional activity in the quarter. If you exclude the company's delisted private label brands, volume was down 3.6% while the industry's second quarter volume declined 1.3%.
However, I would note that industry's cigarette inventories, as wholesale, increased significantly during the quarter. I would remind you that R.J. Reynolds has a policy to minimize wholesale inventory fluctuations.
Now turning to American Snuff's second quarter results. The company's operating income was $81 million, down 4.7% from the adjusted prior-year quarter. Here I would note the prior-year quarter did include about $10 million from the Lane business, which was sold in February this year. American Snuff also made investments in the implementation of new retail moist-snuff contracts.
For the first half of 2011, the company's adjusted operating income was $168 million, down $1 million from the prior year period, which included a full 6 months of earnings from Lane. First half adjusted results exclude $2 million in implementation costs. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin increased by 5.5 percentage points from the adjusted prior year quarter to 52.4%. I would note the margin did benefit from the timing of promotional spending in the prior year related to the introduction of embossed metal lids on Grizzly.
That brought first half adjusted operating margin to 52.3%, up 3.1 percentage points. Turning to moist-snuff volume. American Snuff increased moist-snuff shipment volume by 3.6% in the second quarter, bringing the first half shipment volume gain to 8.1%. Underlying industry volume growth has remained at about 6% this year. 
Grizzly's second quarter shipment volume also increased despite strong competitive activity rising 4.7% from the prior year quarter. All in all, the brand's first half shipments were up 10.4%.
Kodiak, the American Snuff's premium priced brand, delivers stable volume performance in the quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn to RAI's balance sheet.
Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.3 billion and this was after making the $1.96 billion MSA payment in April. The company also continued to strengthen its balance sheet, with a debt repayment of $400 million in June.
We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders, with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 80%. And we remain focused on evaluating opportunities to return additional value to shareholder.
Based on RAI first half performance and a positive momentum we expect over the rest of the year, we've raised the bottom end of our adjusted 2011 earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.62 to $2.70. This excludes the Scott lawsuit charge and the implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items.
Also excluded from this estimate is any potential impact from the Engle progeny cases. We are currently reviewing the financial implications at this week's decision by the Florida Supreme Court.

I think first of all, it's worth kind of noting why wholesalers actually build inventory. There was during the quarter, in the back end of the quarter, particularly, there was price increase speculation on behalf of the wholesalers. And in addition to that, some of the wholesalers, they needed extra inventory to cover the 4th of July holiday. Of course, the 4th of July happens every year so you would expect that part of it was in the numbers. And we as a company have an ongoing policy to really limit the price speculation and we do that by basically placing wholesalers on allocation and just making sure that we minimize any fluctuations in the supply chain. And the reason we do that is because it obviously has an adverse impact on our operations and on the entire supply chain so to keep everything as efficient as possible. So from an impact point of view, I think it's fair to say that the industry serve inventory that was built as wholesale, we were underrepresented within that. And we did our best to limit inventory build to only what was required for the 4th of July holiday. Now maybe just to underscore that point, if we look at our business to date now in July, I would say that we've seen a normal levels of shipment post the 4th of July holiday. And I think one other factor is quite important when we think about the inventory side of things. When that is actually shipped, you get full list price for the volume that's actually shipped. But the value of the promotional dollars attached to that volume, they only sort of hit the company when it's actually shipped from wholesale to retail. So really building inventories is at full margin."

It's really fully exploiting what already were some of the inherent strengths of the brand. We've talked many times in the past about the growing equity that we continue to see on the brand. And then fundamentally, it's a great product with some great packaging now with the metal-lid upgrade at a very reasonable popular price. and I think it's just -- it's hitting on all cylinders as we speak. and I think there's still more to come in terms of that growth, particularly around some of the field force efforts. And the way I would describe that is, of course, we launched a new retail contract that retail. And we have many more feed on the street now servicing the brand.

When we filed our Q, we spent about all over $90 million in the first half. We're going to spend a little over $200 million for the year and then a bit on capital projects, principally the project at American Snuff for the leased processing facility and the new plant in Memphis. We also have in our plans as we've disclosed about $300 million pension plan contribution that we'll make in the back half of the year for some number of order of magnitude close to the $300 million. And then we've unfortunately have the Scott case, that $139 million that Dan has talked about. And so we do have requirement on our capital for -- within the near term. And we've also just pay down -- we've paid down debt but that was actually in the balance of $400 million. Now to your point that does put us right at the bottom end. It's actually slightly below our range of debt to EBITDA that we'd like to operate in, which is 1.5 to 2.5. But you also need to kind of kick in there is pension deficit which is roughly $0.5 billion. So we're really looking at we're kind of 1 7. And we're mindful of that. We understand that we have some abilities to borrow and that the rates are favorable. And we discussed all these things with our Board of Directors.

First of all, on the MLP, this is a latest iteration of the trade program and we have seen many trade programs over the years they kind of come and go. And most trade programs when they're launch, and I think the MLP is no different to that. You get a certain level of people, retailers basically signing up form. And then over time, what you see is more and more people kind of joining the program. And that's very normal kind of trade behavior over time, and this go around has been no different. Now what all trade programs tried to do is they try to split the world between retailers that are on the program and retailers that aren't. And so fundamentally, I don't think there is a significant change in the aggregate kind of dynamics out of retail. And when I kind of look at the second quarter specifically, what maybe had a more significant impact on our business was actually the absolute number of dollars spent back in the marketplace, not so much where and what retailers against what the trade program. And just to reiterate some of the comments I made earlier, that spent competitive spent increased in the early part of the quarter, specifically in the months of April and May and then came down to more normalized levels in the month of June. So that's really on the cigarettes side. I think on the moist-snuff side, the way I would characterize our trade program, it's a fairly standard, fairly normal kind of trade program. All we're really doing is incentivizing retailers to give Grizzly it's fair share of presence at retail. And by presence, I really mean the right number of phasings at retail, given the size of the brand and the right level of signage and also price communication. So I think really what we're incentivizing is basically a catch-up were historically, the American Snuff company was a very much fewer people out in trade marketing. It wasn't able to command the presence of the brand Grizzly specifically deserves. And so we're really just kind of playing catch-up as we speak, and I think doing that quite affectively which is reflecting in a very positive momentum on the brand."

Reynolds American delivered higher earnings in the second quarter as its operating companies key brands made additional gains despite the challenging economic and competitive environments.Both of our reportable business segments",1237,"Good morning, everyone. Reynolds American delivered higher earnings in the second quarter as its operating companies key brands made additional gains despite the challenging economic and competitive environments.
Both of our reportable business segments continue to execute their business strategies effectively. With R.J. Reynolds growth brands increasing their combined market share and American Snuff reporting excellent growth in volume, share and operating margin.
At Santa Fe, I'm pleased to say second quarter results were strong. Once again, the company generated growth in volume, share and earnings. As we reported today, RAI's first half results allowed us to tighten our earnings projections for the full year.
RAI and its operating companies continue to demonstrate strength and resilience despite significant competitive activity in the second quarter and the ongoing weak economy.
As a result, we remain on track to deliver 2011 adjusted EPS growth in the mid- to high-single digits. This range excludes the charge for the Scott smoking cessation lawsuit in Louisiana, as well as implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items recognized in the first half of the year.
Over the long term, our strategy is straightforward and bold. RAI and its operating companies are focused on leading transformation of the tobacco industry, while continuing to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. We continue to drive innovation across our businesses, with a commitment to redefining enjoyment for adult tobacco consumer.
Now I'll provide additional details on our operating companies. R.J. Reynolds' second quarter adjusted operating income was down slightly in both the second quarter and for the first half. Gains in the company's growth brands were offset by cigarette volume declines in its support and non-support brands. The cigarette category continues to demonstrate good pricing power as evidenced by the price increase that R.J. Reynolds took early this month. 
I would also note that R.J. Reynolds remained focused on achieving the right balance between profitability and market share growth. Competitive promotional activity increased significantly with the timing of promotional cycles in April and May, while R.J. Reynolds had relatively normal promotional levels in the quarter.
The company's total second quarter cigarette market share was down half a percentage point at 27.4%. However, if we exclude the private label brands that have been delisted as part of the company's portfolio simplification efforts, it's total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 27.3%.
R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well in the second quarter. Their combined market share increased 1.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 16.3%. And these 2 brands accounted for almost 60% of the company's total cigarette volume in the quarter.
Camel's second quarter cigarette market share was steady at 7.8%, which is good performance, especially for premium priced brand in this challenging environment. R.J. Reynolds continue to focus on building brand equity for Camel. The brand's most recent promotion, the Hump Day Sweepstakes campaign started in March. And the response from adult tobacco consumers to this web-based initiative have been nothing short of fantastic.
Indeed, this is the company's most successful promotion in recent years, with more than 1 million visits to the brand's websites. A key driver behind Camel's performance is its menthol styles, which use R.J. Reynolds' innovative capsule technology. Camel share of the growing menthol market increased by 0.3 of a percentage point in the second quarter and now stands at 2.1%.
R.J. Reynolds will continue to build momentum with next week's national expansion, Camel Crush Bold. This one additional SKU also uses the capsule technology and offers a richer, more full-bodied tobacco taste. I would also point out that this is R.J. Reynolds' first new national cigarette line extension since Camel Crush went national 3 years ago.
The company expects this new style to drive additional growth and further broaden the appeal of the Camel brand.
Now moving to Camel's modern smoke-free tobacco products. Camel SNUS again performed well in the second quarter. Its interest continues to grow in this convenient smoke-free option for adult tobacco consumers. As we mentioned last quarter, R.J. Reynolds introduced 2 new Camel SNUS styles in lead market, SNUS mint and Frost Large. Although they've been in the markets for only one quarter, they're showing encouraging results. These 2 styles offer adult tobacco consumers more options to try and ultimately switch to this innovative product. 
In addition, the company launched the Camel SNUS Pleasure Switch Challenge promotion, which is also increasing the brand's awareness and trial.
On Camel's line of dissolvable tobacco products, these products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips, were refined and improved and introduced in 2 new lead markets in March. The products are attracting good consumer interest and the company continues to gain valuable insights about this new category.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds second growth brand. Pall Mall reported another excellent quarter, delivering double-digit volume growth and increasing its market share by 1.5 percentage points. The brand achieved an 8.5% share of market for the quarter. This high-quality, longer-lasting cigarette has proven to be a very popular choice for adult smokers taking value, especially in this weak economy.
This distinctive blend of quality and value offers a strong foundation for Pall Mall's long-term success. So in summary, R.J. Reynolds demonstrated strength and resilience in the face of some strong headwinds in the quarter and is well positioned for growth in the remainder of the year. Now turning to American Snuff.
I'm pleased with the company's solid underlying performance in the quarter despite low price line extensions of premium brands and significant promotional activities on deep discount brands. I would note that the sale of Lane in February negatively impacted the earnings comparison for the quarter, and Tom will give you more details on that in just a moment.
American Snuff's second quarter moist-snuff consumer offtake share performed extremely well, increasing 1.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 31.3%. This performance was driven by the company's flagship brand, Grizzly, which reported strong gains in both volume and share. Grizzly's momentum continued in the second quarter, with consumer offtake share increasing by 1.9 percentage points from the prior year. Grizzly now holds a 27.4% share of market. The brand continues to benefit from the strength and scale of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization that now also serves American Snuff.
Addition, the new retail moist snuff contracts that were introduced in the second quarter are giving Grizzly more retail space, as well as improved brand and pricing communication. This investment has better positioned the brand for continued long-term growth. And American Snuff continues to invest in the equity of Grizzly with promotions like its current ""giving it to you straight"" sweepstakes, which engages adult tobacco consumers in an exciting web-based campaign.
And the brand is planning activities to celebrate its 10th anniversary by September. Grizzly's post sales continued to be a key factor in the brand's strong performance. The growing pouch segment accounts for more than 9% of the moist-snuff category. Grizzly has also seen rapid growth in its pouch styles since their introduction just 3 years ago. I'm proud to say that Grizzly Wintergreen Pouches are the best-selling pouch styles in the market. 
In summary, both American Snuff and R.J. Reynolds continued to successfully leverage their sound business strategies and grow their key brands while navigating through a challenging environment. Now Tom will provide some additional financial details. Tom?"

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business performance. Reconciliations of adjusted-to-reported results are in our press release, which is on our website. RAI have a solid quarter posting adjusted earnings per share of $0.67, up 1.5%. Higher pricing and moist-snuff volume gains more than offset cigarette volume declines. These adjusted results reflect the impact of the Lane sale and exclude a charge of $0.15 per share related to the Scott lawsuit.
On a reported basis, RAI second quarter earnings per share was $0.52, down 10.3% from the prior year quarter. For the first half of 2011, adjusted earnings per share was $1.26, up 4.1% from the prior year period. This adjusted results exclude the second quarter charges I just mentioned, as well as first quarter tax items.
In addition, there were prior year charges for plant closings and the single sales force implementation. RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, in line with the prior year quarter. First half adjusted operating margin was 29.9%, up 0.5% from the prior year period.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds performance. The company's second quarter adjusted operating income was $562 million, down $6 million from the prior year quarter. Higher cigarette pricing, productivity improvements and growth-brand gains were offset by the decline in support and nonsupport cigarette volume. These adjusted results exclude $139 million for the Scott lawsuit, as well as $3 million in implementation costs related to plant closing.
For the first half of 2011, R.J. Reynolds' adjusted operating income was $1.03 billion, down 0.5% from the prior year period. This first half adjusted results also exclude the charges I just mentioned.
R.J. Reynolds second quarter adjusted operating margin declined 0.6 of a percentage point to 28.7%. And that brought the first half adjusted operating margin to 28.3%, in line with the prior year period. I would note the second quarter margin was negatively impacted by an increase in R.J. Reynolds' contract manufacturing for the BAT Japan. Disruptions from the natural disaster there in March drove higher demand for BAT products sourced by R.J. Reynolds.
Excluding that impact, second quarter margin was in line with the prior year period. 
Turning to cigarette shipment volume. R.J. Reynolds' second quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 4.4% from the prior-year quarter. Volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of competitive promotional activity in the quarter. If you exclude the company's delisted private label brands, volume was down 3.6% while the industry's second quarter volume declined 1.3%.
However, I would note that industry's cigarette inventories, as wholesale, increased significantly during the quarter. I would remind you that R.J. Reynolds has a policy to minimize wholesale inventory fluctuations.
Now turning to American Snuff's second quarter results. The company's operating income was $81 million, down 4.7% from the adjusted prior-year quarter. Here I would note the prior-year quarter did include about $10 million from the Lane business, which was sold in February this year. American Snuff also made investments in the implementation of new retail moist-snuff contracts.
For the first half of 2011, the company's adjusted operating income was $168 million, down $1 million from the prior year period, which included a full 6 months of earnings from Lane. First half adjusted results exclude $2 million in implementation costs. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin increased by 5.5 percentage points from the adjusted prior year quarter to 52.4%. I would note the margin did benefit from the timing of promotional spending in the prior year related to the introduction of embossed metal lids on Grizzly.
That brought first half adjusted operating margin to 52.3%, up 3.1 percentage points. Turning to moist-snuff volume. American Snuff increased moist-snuff shipment volume by 3.6% in the second quarter, bringing the first half shipment volume gain to 8.1%. Underlying industry volume growth has remained at about 6% this year. 
Grizzly's second quarter shipment volume also increased despite strong competitive activity rising 4.7% from the prior year quarter. All in all, the brand's first half shipments were up 10.4%.
Kodiak, the American Snuff's premium priced brand, delivers stable volume performance in the quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn to RAI's balance sheet.
Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.3 billion and this was after making the $1.96 billion MSA payment in April. The company also continued to strengthen its balance sheet, with a debt repayment of $400 million in June.
We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders, with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 80%. And we remain focused on evaluating opportunities to return additional value to shareholder.
Based on RAI first half performance and a positive momentum we expect over the rest of the year, we've raised the bottom end of our adjusted 2011 earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.62 to $2.70. This excludes the Scott lawsuit charge and the implementation costs related to plant closings and tax items.
Also excluded from this estimate is any potential impact from the Engle progeny cases. We are currently reviewing the financial implications at this week's decision by the Florida Supreme Court. Thank you, and now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator? Would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

I think first of all, it's worth kind of noting why wholesalers actually build inventory. There was during the quarter, in the back end of the quarter, particularly, there was price increase speculation on behalf of the wholesalers. And in addition to that, some of the wholesalers, they needed extra inventory to cover the 4th of July holiday. Of course, the 4th of July happens every year so you would expect that part of it's within the numbers. And we as a company have an ongoing policy to really limit the price speculation and we do that by basically placing wholesalers on allocation and just making sure that we minimize any fluctuations in the supply chain. And the reason we do that is because it obviously has an adverse impact on our operations and on the entire supply chain so to keep everything as efficient as possible. So from an impact point of view, I think it's fair to say that the industry -- sort of inventory that was built as wholesale, we were underrepresented within that. And we did our best to limit inventory build to only what was required for the 4th of July holiday. Now maybe just to underscore that point, if we look at our business to date now in July, I would say that we've seen a normal levels of shipment post the 4th of July holiday. And I think one other factor is quite important when we think about the inventory side of things. When that is actually shipped, you get full list price for the volume that's actually shipped. But the value of the promotional dollars attached to that volume, they only sort of hit the company when it's actually shipped from wholesale to retail. So really building inventories is at full margin."

And then fundamentally, it's a great product with some great packaging now with the metal-lid upgrade at a very reasonable popular price. and I think it's just -- it's hitting on all cylinders as we speak. and I think there's still more to come in terms of that growth, particularly around some of the field force efforts.

We're going to spend a little over $200 million for the year and then a bit on capital projects, principally the projects at American Snuff for the leased processing facility and the new plant in Memphis. We also have in our plans as we've disclosed about $300 million pension plan contribution that we'll make in the back half of the year for some number of order of magnitude close to the $300 million. And then we've unfortunately have the Scott case, that $139 million that Dan has talked about. And so we do have some requirement on our capital for -- within the near term. And we've also just paid down -- we've paid down debt but that was actually in the balance of $400 million. Now to your point that does put us right at the bottom end. It's actually slightly below our range of debt to EBITDA that we'd like to operate in, which is 1.5 to 2.5. But you also need to kind of kick in there is pension deficit which is roughly $0.5 billion. So we're really looking at we're kind of 1 7. And we're mindful of that.

First of all, on the MLP, this is a latest iteration of the trade program and we have seen many trade programs over the years they kind of come and go. And most trade programs when they're launched, and I think the MLP is no different to that. You get a certain level of people, retailers basically signing up form. And then over time, what you see is more and more people kind of joining the program. And that's very normal kind of trade behavior over time, and this go around has been no different. Now what all trade programs tried to do is they try to split the world between retailers that are on the program and retailers that aren't. And so fundamentally, I don't think there is a significant change in the aggregate kind of dynamics out of retail. And when I kind of look at the second quarter specifically, what maybe had a more significant impact on our business was actually the absolute number of dollars spent back in the marketplace, not so much where and what retailers against what the trade program. And just to reiterate some of the comments I made earlier, that spent competitive spent increased in the early part of the quarter, specifically in the months of April and May and then came down to more normalized levels in the month of June. So that's really it on the cigarettes side. I think on the moist-snuff side, the way I would characterize our trade program, it's a fairly standard, fairly normal kind of trade program. All we're really doing is incentivizing retailers to give Grizzly it's fair share of presence at retail. And by presence, I really mean the right number of facings at retail, given the size of the brand and the right level of signage and also price communication. So I think really what we're incentivizing is basically a catch-up were historically, the American Snuff company was a very much fewer people out in trade marketing. It wasn't able to command the presence of the brand Grizzly specifically deserved. And so we're really just kind of playing catch-up as we speak, and I think doing that quite affectively which is reflecting in a very positive momentum on the brand."

I think first of all, this obviously is not a reportable segment for us. But certainly, I'm very happy with the performance of that company in the quarter and frankly, over the last years that the brand and the company keeps going from strength to strength. And it's really posting sort of double digit volume, share and operating income growth. And I think given the current economic environment out there, the way that this is super premium brand has been able to buck the trend is remarkable and very noteworthy. On the international side, I think, it continues to progress nicely but it is a very, very small part of the business. But it has a small but not insignificant in growing share in some key markets like Germany, Switzerland and Japan."

Earlier today, Reynolds American announced that its Board of Directors had approved a 5.7% increase in its dividend. Tom will provide more details in just a moment, but I'm very pleased with the Board's vote of confidence and continued support, not only for our near-term direction but also for our long-term strategy. We'd also like to report that for the fourth consecutive year, RAI has received independent recognition for its ongoing sustainability and responsibility initiatives. The company was again awarded membership in the Dow Jones sustainability North America Index and is the only U.S. tobacco company in the index and we are certainly proud of that recognition. So some very good news to start off our call today.
Turning to RAI's outlook. Based on our results through the third quarter, we are tightening our earnings outlook for the full year. We now expect adjusted EPS of $2.63 to $2.68. I would note that our guidance excludes the impact of the individual Engle progeny cases and the Scott lawsuit, as well as implementation and integration costs and tax items, which Tom will discuss in more detail.
Now I'll give you my perspective on the company's results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Overall, I'm very pleased with RAI's solid third quarter performance. I believe our performance reflects both the fundamental strength and positive momentum of our business strategy. These results are particularly noteworthy because they come in the face of a challenging economic and competitive environment. Our third quarter results underscore our ability to manage near-term challenges while continuing to transform our business for the long term in an evolving industry.
So let's look at how our operating companies did in more detail.
R.J. Reynolds performed very well this quarter despite a difficult operating environment. The company delivered higher adjusted operating income and excellent improvement in their adjusted operating margin in both the third quarter and the first 9 months of this year. Driving these results were gains on the company's 2 growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, along with continued pricing and productivity improvements. Before I get into more detail on our performance, let's step back and look at industry cigarette volumes.
Total cigarette industry shipment volume declined 6.4% in the third quarter and R.J. Reynolds volume, excluding the company's deemphasized private label brands, was in line with the industry. As many of you know, industry shipment volumes have fluctuated significantly across the quarters this year due to large swings in wholesale inventory levels. When we look at the category on a year-to-date basis, we get a much better view of the actual underlying performance. For the first 9 months of this year, industry shipment volumes declined 3.7%, while R.J. Reynolds cigarette volumes, excluding private label brands, was down 4.4%. R.J. Reynolds volume decline was driven by losses on support and nonsupport brands. These brands have been hit hard by significant increase in competitive promotional activity this year. As you know, R.J. Reynolds manages these brands to optimize the mix between market share performance and profitability. And in order to accomplish that, the company has not significantly increased the discounting levels on these brands this year.
Now looking at market share. R.J. Reynolds total cigarette market share, excluding private label, was down 0.8% for the quarter but again for the 9 months, it was in line with the prior-year period at 27.4%. R.J. Reynolds growth brand, Camel and Pall Mall once again delivered good performance in the third quarter. These 2 brands continue to play an increasingly important role in R.J. Reynolds results and now account for 60% of the company's total cigarette volume. 
Camel, R.J. Reynolds' premium growth brand, continues to deliver solid performance despite a really challenging market environment. This environment is putting pressure on all premium priced products and Camel is no exception. Although the brand's market share was down slightly compared to the prior-year quarter, Camel has delivered steady, sequential market share growth this year. Camel is benefiting from the outstanding performance of its menthol styles, which increased our market share by 1/2 a share point from the prior year quarter and now stands at 2.4%. And Camel menthol has accounted for the majority of growth from the premium menthol category this year. Camel's menthol styles, which include Camel Crush and Camel Crush Bold utilize R.J. Reynolds' innovative capsule technology, which offers adult smokers the choice of how they enjoy their smoking experience. This option has proven to be quite appealing and is driving positive brand demographics. Camel Crush Bold, which was expanded nationally in late July is only the second style for Camel Crush and is R.J. Reynolds' only cigarette line extension in more than 3 years. This style offers a richer, more full-bodied taste and the company expects it to further broaden the appeal of the Camel brand and drive additional growth. But our commitment to innovation doesn't stop there. We also see tremendous growth potential for Camel SNUS. I'm pleased to say that Camel SNUS enjoys a 70% share market in the category and shipments are up more than 20% this year. While the category itself is still small, awareness and trial remains high and we continue to believe that the same consumer convenience attributes that are driving growth in other smoker's tobacco product categories should benefit the SNUS category as well. 
Now turning to Pall Mall., R.J. Reynolds value growth brand. Pall Mall continued to deliver strong market share and volume gains in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods. This growth came in the face of significant competitive activity with many brand choices at or below Pall Mall's price point. Pall Mall's third quarter market share increased by 7/10 of a percentage point and stands at 8.6%. The brand's strong performance is underpinned by is positioning as a high quality, longer-lasting cigarette that offers exceptional value. In today's economic environment, Pall Mall is a terrific asset in R.J. Reynolds' brand portfolio.
So all in all, R.J. Reynolds has performed well through the third quarter. The company's results show the strength and resilience of its business model. The company's growth brands continue to drive improved performance by bringing innovation, coupled with a rich heritage, to the market.
Now onto American Snuff. The company once again delivered strong marketplace performance in the quarter despite the intense promotional environment in the moist-snuff category. American Snuff achieved outstanding growth in both volume and market share in the quarter. The company's market share increased 1.1 percentage points from the prior-year quarter and now stands at 31.6%. American Snuff's flagship brand, Grizzly, drove the company's performance, delivered excellent volume growth of more than 9% in the quarter and almost 10% for the year-to-date period. Not many brands are delivered 10% growth in this economy. On top of that, Grizzly's third quarter market share increased by 1.6 percentage points from the prior-year period with a total market share of 27.8%. Grizzly is really benefiting from the new retail contracts that American Snuff rolled out in the second quarter of this year. This investment is providing the brands with its fair share of retail space, as well as better brand and pricing communication. Grizzly is also benefiting from a strength in scale of R.J. Reynolds' fuel trade marketing organization, which now also serves Americans Snuff. I would also note that Grizzly celebrated its 10th anniversary in September. The brand is a true success story, becoming the market leader in a rapidly growing and highly profitable category in just 10 years. So those are the highlights for American Snuff news. I believe that the company's solid underlying performance and the investments they are making puts them in position to deliver sustainable growth well into the future.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would briefly like to point out that RAI's Santa Fe subsidiary continued to deliver excellent results in the third quarter, as its Natural American brand again drove gains in earnings, volume and market share. So good news, on that front as well. That's a look at some of Reynolds American's achievements in the third quarter. Now Tom will provide additional details. Tom?"
399584,141534581,177005,"Reynolds American Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard, RAI and its operating companies continued to deliver good results last quarter. As I discuss that performance, I'll focus on Adjusted Results to provide perspective on underlying business.",949,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard, RAI and its operating companies continued to deliver good results last quarter. As I discuss that performance, I'll focus on Adjusted Results to provide perspective on underlying business. So let's start with RAI's results.
On a reported basis, third quarter EPS was $0.63 per share, down 3.1% from the prior-year quarter, driven by an accrual for the 4 Engle progeny lawsuits, specifically the Martin, Hall, Gray and Campbell cases. $63 million was accrued in the third quarter, which included $53 million for compensatory and punitive damages and $10 million for attorneys' fees and statutory interest. These 4 cases have proceeded through the appellate process in the state of Florida and R.J. Reynolds will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review these 4 cases. R.J. Reynolds policy is to record any litigation loss when an unfavorable outcome in any individual case becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The company believes it has strong legal positions and defenses for its Engle Progeny cases. But the nature, evolution and progression of the Engle Progeny cases through the federal and state court systems in Florida do not allow management a sufficient level of predictability of the timing and outcomes on a case-by-case basis. So for the foreseeable future, we will provide adjusted EPS guidance, excluding any impacts of Engle Progeny cases and order to provide a consistent basis for evaluating ongoing business performance.
Excluding net charges of $0.06 per share and implementation and integration costs of $0.01 per share, RAI's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.70 per share, up 2.9%. Adjusted EPS for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.96 per share, up 3.7%. These adjusted earnings exclude the items I just described, as well as the stock lawsuit and tax items. I hope the American's adjusted operating margin for the third quarter increased 1.5 percentage points to 32.1% driven by higher pricing and productivity at our operating companies.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' third quarter adjusted operating income, which excluded the accrual for the 4 annual lawsuits, increased 2.6% from the prior-year quarter to $587 million as higher cigarette pricing and productivity gains more than offset cigarette volume declines. R.J. Reynolds delivered significant improvement in their adjusted operating margin, which increased 1.4 percentage points from the prior-year period to 31.2%.
Now let's look at America Snuff. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $90 million, down 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. That decrease was driven by the impact of the sale of Lane early this Year. Lane contributed about $10 million to American Snuff's operating income in the prior year period. For the 9-month period, adjusted operating income was $258 million, down 5.1% from the prior year period. This comparison was also negatively affected by The Lane sale. The company's third quarter adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, down slightly from the prior-year quarter, while operating margin for the first 9 months rose 1.9 percentage Points to 53.2%.
Turning to moist-snuff volume, American Snuff's total moist-snuff shipment volume again saw strong growth to 7% in the third quarter and was up 7.7% for the 9 months. American Snuff's growth was driven by Grizzly, with third quarter shipment volume growth of 9.1% and Grizzly's volume increased 9.9% for the first 9 months. So American Snuff is doing very well in and is positioned to deliver additional games this year. Now I'd like to give some additional details on the dividend increase we announced this morning.
As Dan mentioned, the Board approved a 5.7% increase in RAI's dividend, which further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to our shareholders. When combined with the increase that was announced in February, our total dividend growth is 14.3% this year or $0.28 per share on an annualized basis. We continue to view our dividend as the key tool for returning value to our shareholders but we are also evaluating other opportunities to effectively use our cash and return additional value.
With respect to our balance sheet, Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $2 billion and we have significant financial flexibility with a leverage ratio of 1.3x debt to EBITDA which is slightly below our target range of one point 5x to 2.5x. We have also taken some significant steps to strengthen our pension plans. The company contributed $75 million to the pension plans in the third quarter. In addition, a contribution of $125 million was made in early October, bringing our total contribution to $200 million this year.
Now turning to guidance. Based on our solid performance through the first 9 months of this year, Reynolds American has tightened its full year forecast to an adjusted EPS range of $2.63 to $2.68., that's an earnings increase of 5.6% to 7.6% from the 2010 adjusted results. As I explained earlier, this guidance excludes charges for individual Engle progeny lawsuits, the Scott lawsuit, implementation and integration costs and tax items, as well as any potential impact of goodwill and trademark impairments.
So in closing, we feel good about our performance and the value we are returning to our shareholders. We've delivered sustainable growth in our businesses, which has allowed us do reward our shareholders with the higher dividends. Our total shareholder return for the first 9 months this year of 20% would be considered good in any market but when compared to the S&P 500, which has declined by more than 8.5%, it's been a very impressive performance. On that positive note, we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Gavin, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

I think we look at it sequentially. We see that we actually grew 1/10 of a market share point and this is an environment, a market environment, where there is significant down trading going on. When I think about down trading, I really think we need look at the down trading in 2 forms. There's always the down trading within the cigarette category and more recently, we've also been picking up some of the growth of other smoking categories that are lower priced sodium options and by that, what i really mean is the little cigar category, which is tax advantage in this country today, which is growing, and also it looks like traditional but it's being classified as pipe tobacco but it's actually being smoked as your own. But that's down trading that's going on in the market place and in the light of that, to have Camel hold up it's performance like it did, I think it's very, very positive."

In fact, just looking at where we sit so far in the fourth, so really this quarter to date I would say that it looks like there's a small ramp up in competitive spend during this fourth quarter but all within kind of a normal to-ing and fro-ing the marketplace and the normal kind of cyclical activity that happens in the category."

But of course, we're present and growing in the growing category of moist-snuff. We've organically launched into the SNUS category, very happy with that performance as well. We are far and away the leader in that small but growing category and in fact have seen 20% volume growth year-on-year. Then of course, I think the consumer continues to look for new opportunities out there to enjoy the tobacco experience. And as you know, we are testing dissolvables as we speak and certainly, I think the concept there is very relevant and I believe that consumers will keep looking, potentially even beyond that for new ways to enjoy the tobacco experience. So I think we're quite happy with our footprint sort of across the different categories as we see it having evolved to date but continue to look and continue to think about where this might be going in the future and what new opportunities may present themselves."

I think when we take a look at our support brands and just to remind the rest of the people on the call, these are bands like Winston, Cool, Sailor and Doral.

We watch these brands very closely, just to make sure that we're optimizing the quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year kind of results from and really trying to balance out the profitability on these brands with the market share performance. I think we do spend a little bit of money on these brands but obviously, disproportionately, they get significantly less resources than our growth brands, those being Camel and Pall Mall.

Earlier today, Reynolds American announced that its Board of Directors had approved a 5.7% increase in its dividend. Tom will provide more details in just a moment, but I'm very pleased with the Board's vote of confidence and continued support, not only for our near-term direction but also for our long-term strategy. We also like to report that for the fourth consecutive year, RAI has received independent recognition for its ongoing sustainability and responsibility initiatives. The company was again awarded membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and it's the only U.S. tobacco company in the index. And we are certainly proud of that recognition. So some very good news to start off our call today.
Turning to RAI's outlook. Based on our results through the third quarter, we are tightening our earnings outlook for the full year. We now expect adjusted EPS of $2.63 to $2.68. I would note that our guidance excludes the impact of the individual Engle progeny cases and the Scott lawsuit, as well as implementation and integration costs and tax items, which Tom will discuss in more detail.
Now, I'll give you my perspective on the company's results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Overall, I'm very pleased with RAI's solid third quarter performance. I believe our performance reflects both the fundamental strength and positive momentum of our business strategy. These results are particularly noteworthy because they come in the face of a challenging economic and competitive environment. Our third quarter results underscore our ability to manage near-term challenges while continuing to transform our business for the long term in an evolving industry.
So let's look at how our operating companies did in more detail. R.J. Reynolds performed very well this quarter despite a difficult operating environment. The company delivered higher adjusted operating income and excellent improvement in their adjusted operating margin in both the third quarter and the first 9 months of this year. Driving these results were gains on the company's 2 growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, along with continued pricing and productivity improvements. Before I get into more detail on our performance, let's step back and look at industry cigarette volumes.
Total cigarette industry shipment volume declined 6.4% in the third quarter, and R.J. Reynolds' volume, excluding the company's deemphasized private label brands, was in line with the industry. As many of you know, industry shipment volumes have fluctuated significantly across the quarters this year due to large swings in the wholesale inventory levels. 
When we look at the category on a year-to-date basis, we get a much better view of the actual underlying performance. For the first 9 months of this year, industry shipment volume declined 3.7%, while R.J. Reynolds' cigarette volume, excluding private label brands, was down 4.4%. R.J. Reynolds' volume decline was driven by losses on support and nonsupport brands. These brands have been hit hard by a significant increase in competitive promotional activity this year. As you know, R.J. Reynolds manages these brands to optimize the mix between market share performance and profitability. And in order to accomplish that, the company has not significantly increased the discounting levels on these brands this year.
Now looking at market share. R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share, excluding private label, was down 0.8% for the quarter. But, again, for the 9 months, it was in line with the prior-year period at 27.4%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brand, Camel and Pall Mall, once again delivered good performance in the third quarter. These 2 brands continue to play an increasingly important role in R.J. Reynolds' results and now account for 60% of the company's total cigarette volume. 
Camel, R.J. Reynolds' premium growth brand, continues to deliver solid performance despite a really challenging marketing environment. This environment is putting pressure on all premium priced products, and Camel is no exception. Although the brand's market share was down slightly compared to the prior-year quarter, Camel has delivered steady, sequential market share growth this year. Camel is benefiting from the outstanding performance of its menthol styles, which increased our market share by 1/2 a share point from the prior-year quarter and now stands at 2.4%. And Camel menthol has accounted for the majority of growth from the premium menthol category this year. 
Camel's menthol styles, which include Camel Crush and Camel Crush Bold, utilize R.J. Reynolds' innovative capsule technology, which offers adult smokers the choice of how they enjoy their smoking experience. This option has proven to be quite appealing and is driving positive brand demographics. Camel Crush Bold, which was expanded nationally in late July, is only the second style for Camel Crush and is R.J. Reynolds' only cigarette line extension in more than 3 years. This style offers a richer, more full-bodied taste, and the company expects it to further broaden the appeal of the Camel brand and drive additional growth. 
But our commitment to innovation doesn't stop there. We also see tremendous growth potential for Camel SNUS. I'm pleased to say that Camel SNUS enjoys a 70% share market in the category, and shipments are up more than 20% this year. While the category itself is still small, awareness and trial remains high. And we continue to believe that the same consumer convenience attributes that are driving growth in other smokers' tobacco product categories should benefit the SNUS category as well. 
Now turning to Pall Mall, R. J. Reynolds' value growth brand. Pall Mall continued to deliver strong market share and volume gains in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods. This growth came in the face of significant competitive activity with many brand choices at or below Pall Mall's price point. Pall Mall's third quarter market share increased by 7/10 of a percentage point and stands at 8.6%. The brand's strong performance is underpinned by its positioning as a high quality, longer-lasting cigarette that offers exceptional value. In today's economic environment, Pall Mall is a terrific asset in R.J. Reynolds' brand portfolio.
So all in all, R.J. Reynolds has performed well through the third quarter. The company's results show the strength and resilience of its business model. The company's growth brands continue to drive improved performance by bringing innovation, coupled with a rich heritage, to the market.
Now onto American Snuff. The company once again delivered strong marketplace performance in the quarter despite the intense promotional environment in the moist-snuff category. American Snuff achieved outstanding growth in both volume and market share in the quarter. The company's market share increased 1.1 percentage points from the prior-year quarter and now stands at 31.6%. American Snuff's flagship brand, Grizzly, drove the company's performance, delivered excellent volume growth of more than 9% in the quarter and almost 10% for the year-to-date period. 
Not many brands are delivering 10% growth in this economy. On top of that, Grizzly's third quarter market share increased by 1.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, with a total market share of 27.8%. Grizzly is really benefiting from the new retail contracts that American Snuff rolled out in the second quarter of this year. This investment is providing the brand with its fair share of retail space, as well as better brand and pricing communication. Grizzly is also benefiting from the strength and scale of R.J. Reynolds' field trade marketing organization, which now also serves Americans Snuff. I would also note that Grizzly celebrated its 10th anniversary in September. The brand is a true success story, becoming the market leader in a rapidly growing and highly profitable category in just 10 years. 
So those are the highlights for American Snuff. I believe that the company's solid underlying performance and the investments they are making puts them in position to deliver sustainable growth well into the future.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would briefly like to point out that RAI's Santa Fe subsidiary continued to deliver excellent results in the third quarter, as its Natural American Spirit brand again drove gains in earnings, volume and market share. So good news on that front as well. 
That's a look at some of Reynolds American's achievements in the third quarter. Now Tom will provide additional details. Tom?"
399584,141534581,177196,"Reynolds American Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard, RAI and its operating companies continued to deliver good results last quarter. As I discuss that performance, I'll focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying busine",942,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard, RAI and its operating companies continued to deliver good results last quarter. As I discuss that performance, I'll focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business. So let's start with RAI's results.
On a reported basis, third quarter EPS was $0.63 per share, down 3.1% from the prior-year quarter, driven by an accrual for the 4 Engle progeny lawsuits, specifically the Martin, Hall, Gray and Campbell cases. $63 million was accrued in the third quarter, which included $53 million for compensatory and punitive damages and $10 million for attorney's fees and statutory interest. These 4 cases have proceeded through the appellate process in the state of Florida, and R.J. Reynolds will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review these 4 cases. 
R.J. Reynolds' policy is to record any litigation loss when an unfavorable outcome in any individual case becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The company believes it has strong legal positions and defenses for its Engle progeny cases. But the nature, evolution and progression of the Engle progeny cases through the federal and state court systems in Florida do not allow management a sufficient level of predictability of the timing and outcomes on a case-by-case basis. So for the foreseeable future, we will provide adjusted EPS guidance, excluding any impacts of Engle progeny cases, in order to provide a consistent basis for evaluating ongoing business performance.
Excluding net charge of $0.06 per share and implementation and integration costs of $0.01 per share, RAI's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.70 per share, up 2.9%. Adjusted EPS for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.96 per share, up 3.7%. These adjusted earnings exclude the items I just described, as well as the Scott lawsuit and tax items. Reynolds American's adjusted operating margin for the third quarter increased 1.5 percentage points to 32.1%, driven by higher pricing and productivity at our operating companies.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' third quarter adjusted operating income, which excluded the accrual for the 4 Engle lawsuits, increased 2.6% from the prior-year quarter to $587 million, as higher cigarette pricing and productivity gains more than offset cigarette volume declines. R.J. Reynolds delivered significant improvement in their adjusted operating margin, which increased 1.4 percentage points from the prior-year period to 31.2%.
Now let's look at American Snuff. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $90 million, down 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. That decrease was driven by the impact of the sale of Lane early this Year. Lane contributed about $10 million to American Snuff's operating income in the prior-year period. For the 9-month period, adjusted operating income was $258 million, down 5.1% from the prior-year period. This comparison was also negatively affected by the Lane sale. The company's third quarter adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, down slightly from the prior-year quarter, while operating margin for the first 9 months rose 1.9 percentage points to 53.2%.
Turning to moist-snuff volume, American Snuff's total moist-snuff shipment volume again saw strong growth to 7% in the third quarter and was up 7.7% for the 9 months. American Snuff's growth was driven by Grizzly, with third quarter shipment volume growth of 9.1%. And Grizzly's volume increased 9.9% for the first 9 months. So American Snuff is doing very well and is positioned to deliver additional gains this year. 
Now I'd like to give some additional details on the dividend increase we announced this morning. As Dan mentioned, the Board approved a 5.7% increase in RAI's dividend, which further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to our shareholders. When combined with the increase that was announced in February, our total dividend growth is 14.3% this year or $0.28 per share on an annualized basis. We continue to view our dividend as the key tool for returning value to our shareholders, but we are also evaluating other opportunities to effectively use our cash and return additional value.
With respect to our balance sheet, Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $2 billion, and we have significant financial flexibility with a leverage ratio of 1.3x debt to EBITDA, which is slightly below our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x. We have also taken some significant steps to strengthen our pension plans. The company contributed $75 million to the pension plans in the third quarter. In addition, a contribution of $125 million was made in early October, bringing our total contribution to $200 million this year.
Now turning to guidance. Based on our solid performance through the first 9 months of this year, Reynolds American has tightened its full-year forecast to an adjusted EPS range of $2.63 to $2.68. That's an earnings increase of 5.6% to 7.6% from the 2010 adjusted results. As I explained earlier, this guidance excludes charges for individual Engle progeny lawsuits, the Scott lawsuit, implementation and integration costs and tax items, as well as any potential impact of goodwill and trademark impairments.
So in closing, we feel good about our performance and the value we are returning to our shareholders. We've delivered sustainable growth in our businesses, which has allowed us to reward our shareholders with the higher dividends. Our total shareholder return for the first 9 months this year of 20% would be considered good in any market, but when compared to the S&P 500, which has declined by more than 8.5%, it's been a very impressive performance. 
On that positive note, we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Gavin, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

I think we look at it sequentially. We see that we actually grew 1/10 of a market share point, and this isn't an environment in a market environment, where there is significant downtrading going on. When I think about downtrading, I really think we need to look at the downtrading in 2 forms. There's obviously downtrading within the cigarette category, and more recently, we've also been picking up some of the growth of other smoking categories that are lower-priced smoking options. And by that, what I really mean is the little cigar category, which is tax advantage in this country today, which is growing. And also the -- it looks like traditional roll-your-own, but it's being classified as pipe tobacco. But it's actually being smoked as roll-your-own. So we have a little nickname in terms of [indiscernible] pipe-your-own category. But that's the downtrading sort of that's going on in the market place.

In fact, just looking at where we sit so far in the fourth, so, really, this quarter to date, I would say that it looks like there's a small ramp-up in competitive spend during this fourth quarter, but all within kind of a normal to-ing and fro-ing in the marketplace and the normal kind of cyclical activity that happens in the category."

Really, in the back-end of the first quarter of this year, we started spending or really investing into the marketplace a bit more. And that has to do with actually getting our fair share of prices at retail, getting our pricing communicated and through to the consumer and really just getting our fair share of things at retail. And so that requires some investment from a company point of view. And that investment, happy to report that it's actually paying off dividends, and we're actually seeing a good return on that investment as evidenced by the superior performance of Grizzly in the marketplace. It's up year-on-year, 1.6 market share points, sequentially up 4/10 and really quite proud of that performance despite the loss of the competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace."

Earlier today, Reynolds American announced that its Board of Directors had approved a 5.7% increase in its dividend. Tom will provide more details in just a moment, but I'm very pleased with the Board's vote of confidence and continued support, not only for our near-term direction but also for our long-term strategy. We also like to report that for the fourth consecutive year, RAI has received independent recognition for its ongoing sustainability and responsibility initiatives. The company was again awarded membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and is the only U.S. tobacco company in the index. And we are certainly proud of that recognition. So some very good news to start off our call today.
Turning to RAI's outlook. Based on our results through the third quarter, we are tightening our earnings outlook for the full year. We now expect adjusted EPS of $2.63 to $2.68. I would note that our guidance excludes the impact of the individual Engle progeny cases and the Scott lawsuit, as well as implementation and integration costs and tax items, which Tom will discuss in more detail.
Now I'll give you my perspective on the company's results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Overall, I'm very pleased with RAI's solid third quarter performance. I believe our performance reflects both the fundamental strength and positive momentum of our business strategy. These results are particularly noteworthy because they come in the face of a challenging economic and competitive environment. Our third quarter results underscore our ability to manage near-term challenges while continuing to transform our business for the long term in an evolving industry.
So let's look at how our operating companies did in more detail. R.J. Reynolds performed very well this quarter despite a difficult operating environment. The company delivered higher adjusted operating income and excellent improvement in their adjusted operating margin in both the third quarter and the first 9 months of this year. Driving these results were gains on the company's 2 growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, along with continued pricing and productivity improvements. Before I get into more detail on our performance, let's step back and look at industry cigarette volumes.
Total cigarette industry shipment volume declined 6.4% in the third quarter, and R.J. Reynolds' volume, excluding the company's de-emphasized private label brands, was in line with the industry. As many of you know, industry shipment volumes have fluctuated significantly across the quarters this year due to large swings in the wholesale inventory levels. 
When we look at the category on a year-to-date basis, we get a much better view of the actual underlying performance. For the first 9 months of this year, industry shipment volume declined 3.7%, while R.J. Reynolds' cigarette volume, excluding private label brands, was down 4.4%. R.J. Reynolds' volume decline was driven by losses on support and nonsupport brands. These brands have been hit hard by a significant increase in competitive promotional activity this year. As you know, R.J. Reynolds manages these brands to optimize the mix between market share performance and profitability. And in order to accomplish that, the company has not significantly increased the discounting levels on these brands this year.
Now looking at market share. R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share, excluding private label, was down 0.8% for the quarter. But, again, for the 9 months, it was in line with the prior-year period at 27.4%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brand, Camel and Pall Mall, once again delivered good performance in the third quarter. These 2 brands continue to play an increasingly important role in R.J. Reynolds' results and now account for 60% of the company's total cigarette volume. 
Camel, R.J. Reynolds' premium growth brand, continues to deliver solid performance despite a really challenging marketing environment. This environment is putting pressure on all premium priced products, and Camel is no exception. Although the brand's market share was down slightly compared to the prior-year quarter, Camel has delivered steady, sequential market share growth this year. Camel is benefiting from the outstanding performance of its menthol styles, which increased our market share by 1/2 a share point from the prior-year quarter and now stands at 2.4%. And Camel menthol has accounted for the majority of growth from the premium menthol category this year. 
Camel's menthol styles, which include Camel Crush and Camel Crush Bold, utilize R.J. Reynolds' innovative capsule technology, which offers adult smokers the choice of how they enjoy their smoking experience. This option has proven to be quite appealing and is driving positive brand demographics. Camel Crush Bold, which was expanded nationally in late July, is only the second style for Camel Crush and is R.J. Reynolds' only cigarette line extension in more than 3 years. This style offers a richer, more full-bodied taste, and the company expects it to further broaden the appeal of the Camel brand and drive additional growth. 
But our commitment to innovation doesn't stop there. We also see tremendous growth potential for Camel SNUS. I'm pleased to say that Camel SNUS enjoys a 70% share market in the category, and shipments are up more than 20% this year. While the category itself is still small, awareness and trial remains high. And we continue to believe that the same consumer convenience attributes that are driving growth in other smokeless tobacco product categories should benefit the SNUS category as well. 
Now turning to Pall Mall, R. J. Reynolds' value growth brand. Pall Mall continued to deliver strong market share and volume gains in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods. This growth came in the face of significant competitive activity with many brand choices at or below Pall Mall's price point. Pall Mall's third quarter market share increased by 7/10 of a percentage point and stands at 8.6%. The brand's strong performance is underpinned by its positioning as a high-quality, longer-lasting cigarette that offers exceptional value. In today's economic environment, Pall Mall is a terrific asset in R.J. Reynolds' brand portfolio.
So all in all, R.J. Reynolds has performed well through the third quarter. The company's results show the strength and resilience of its business model. The company's growth brands continue to drive improved performance by bringing innovation, coupled with a rich heritage, to the market.
Now onto American Snuff. The company once again delivered strong marketplace performance in the quarter despite the intense promotional environment in the moist-snuff category. American Snuff achieved outstanding growth in both volume and market share in the quarter. The company's market share increased 1.1 percentage points from the prior-year quarter and now stands at 31.6%. American Snuff's flagship brand, Grizzly, drove the company's performance, delivered excellent volume growth of more than 9% in the quarter and almost 10% for the year-to-date period. 
Not many brands are delivering 10% growth in this economy. On top of that, Grizzly's third quarter market share increased by 1.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, with a total market share of 27.8%. Grizzly is really benefiting from the new retail contracts that American Snuff rolled out in the second quarter of this year. This investment is providing the brand with its fair share of retail space, as well as better brand and pricing communication. Grizzly is also benefiting from the strength and scale of R.J. Reynolds' field trade marketing organization, which now also serves American Snuff. I would also note that Grizzly celebrated its 10th anniversary in September. The brand is a true success story, becoming the market leader in a rapidly growing and highly profitable category in just 10 years. 
So those are the highlights for American Snuff. I believe that the company's solid underlying performance and the investments they are making puts them in position to deliver sustainable growth well into the future.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would briefly like to point out that RAI's Santa Fe subsidiary continued to deliver excellent results in the third quarter, as its Natural American Spirit brand again drove gains in earnings, volume and market share. So good news on that front as well. 
That's a look at some of Reynolds American's achievements in the third quarter. Now Tom will provide additional details. Tom?"
399584,141534581,177416,"Reynolds American Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard, RAI and its operating companies continued to deliver good results last quarter. As I discuss that performance, I'll focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying busine",942,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard, RAI and its operating companies continued to deliver good results last quarter. As I discuss that performance, I'll focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business. So let's start with RAI's results.
On a reported basis, third quarter EPS was $0.63 per share, down 3.1% from the prior-year quarter, driven by an accrual for the 4 Engle progeny lawsuits, specifically the Martin, Hall, Gray and Campbell cases. $63 million was accrued in the third quarter, which included $53 million for compensatory and punitive damages and $10 million for attorney's fees and statutory interest. These 4 cases have proceeded through the appellate process in the state of Florida, and R.J. Reynolds will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review these 4 cases. 
R.J. Reynolds' policy is to record any litigation loss when an unfavorable outcome in any individual case becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The company believes it has strong legal positions and defenses for its Engle progeny cases. But the nature, evolution and progression of the Engle progeny cases through the federal and state court systems in Florida do not allow management a sufficient level of predictability of the timing and outcomes on a case-by-case basis. So for the foreseeable future, we will provide adjusted EPS guidance, excluding any impacts of Engle progeny cases, in order to provide a consistent basis for evaluating ongoing business performance.
Excluding that charge of $0.06 per share and implementation and integration costs of $0.01 per share, RAI's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.70 per share, up 2.9%. Adjusted EPS for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.96 per share, up 3.7%. These adjusted earnings exclude the items I just described, as well as the Scott lawsuit and tax items. Reynolds American's adjusted operating margin for the third quarter increased 1.5 percentage points to 32.1%, driven by higher pricing and productivity at our operating companies.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance. R.J. Reynolds' third quarter adjusted operating income, which excluded the accrual for the 4 Engle lawsuits, increased 2.6% from the prior-year quarter to $587 million, as higher cigarette pricing and productivity gains more than offset cigarette volume declines. R.J. Reynolds delivered significant improvement in their adjusted operating margin, which increased 1.4 percentage points from the prior-year period to 31.2%.
Now let's look at American Snuff. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $90 million, down 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. That decrease was driven by the impact of the sale of Lane early this year. Lane contributed about $10 million to American Snuff's operating income in the prior-year period. For the 9-month period, adjusted operating income was $258 million, down 5.1% from the prior-year period. This comparison was also negatively affected by the Lane sale. The company's third quarter adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, down slightly from the prior-year quarter, while operating margin for the first 9 months rose 1.9 percentage points to 53.2%.
Turning to moist-snuff volume, American Snuff's total moist-snuff shipment volume again saw strong growth to 7% in the third quarter and was up 7.7% for the 9 months. American Snuff's growth was driven by Grizzly, with third quarter shipment volume growth of 9.1%. And Grizzly's volume increased 9.9% for the first 9 months. So American Snuff is doing very well and is positioned to deliver additional gains this year. 
Now I'd like to give some additional details on the dividend increase we announced this morning. As Dan mentioned, the Board approved a 5.7% increase in RAI's dividend, which further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to our shareholders. When combined with the increase that was announced in February, our total dividend growth is 14.3% this year or $0.28 per share on an annualized basis. We continue to view our dividend as the key tool for returning value to our shareholders, but we are also evaluating other opportunities to effectively use our cash and return additional value.
With respect to our balance sheet, Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $2 billion, and we have significant financial flexibility with a leverage ratio of 1.3x debt to EBITDA, which is slightly below our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x. We have also taken some significant steps to strengthen our pension plans. The company contributed $75 million to the pension plans in the third quarter. In addition, a contribution of $125 million was made in early October, bringing our total contribution to $200 million this year.
Now turning to guidance. Based on our solid performance through the first 9 months of this year, Reynolds American has tightened its full-year forecast to an adjusted EPS range of $2.63 to $2.68. That's an earnings increase of 5.6% to 7.6% from the 2010 adjusted results. As I explained earlier, this guidance excludes charges for individual Engle progeny lawsuits, the Scott lawsuit, implementation and integration costs and tax items, as well as any potential impact of goodwill and trademark impairments.
So in closing, we feel good about our performance and the value we are returning to our shareholders. We've delivered sustainable growth in our businesses, which has allowed us to reward our shareholders with the higher dividends. Our total shareholder return for the first 9 months this year of 20% would be considered good in any market, but when compared to the S&P 500, which has declined by more than 8.5%, it's been a very impressive performance. 
On that positive note, we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Gavin, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

I think we look at it sequentially. We see that we actually grew 1/10 of a market share point, and this is in an environment, in a market environment, where there is significant downtrading going on. When I think about downtrading, I really think we need to look at the downtrading in 2 forms. There's obviously downtrading within the cigarette category, and more recently, we've also been picking up some of the growth of other smoking categories that are lower-priced smoking options. And by that, what I really mean is the little cigar category, which is tax advantage in this country today, which is growing. And also the -- it looks like traditional roll-your-own, but it's being classified as pipe tobacco, but it's actually being smoked as roll-your-own. So we have a little nickname internally for that, we're calling it the pipe-your-own category. But that's the downtrading sort of that's going on in the market place. And in the light of that, to have Camel hold up its performance like it did, I think it's very, very positive."

I think it's fair to say that, that decline rate is maybe a little bit higher than we might have expected given what's happened with price movements and where we're seeing the absence of significant tax increases this year. In fact, happy to report that the SETs seem to be coming in at about $0.01 or $0.02 for the entire year 2011. But what we have noticed is some growth in some of the other smoking categories. And I mean by that, I mentioned this earlier on the call, but it's the little cigar category and that category that we're calling pipe-your-own, which is really products that are packed, as if they are pipe tobacco but tend to be used by consumers as a roll-your-own. And those categories have been growing. And I think once we factor that in, I think we're still very much in line with the historical price sensitivity of demand."

I mean, we certainly saw some of the margins of the brand. So actually it's quite positive from that point of view.

And I'm including that $125 million that we put it in, in October in there. So pension assets are around $4.9 billion. We're comfortable with 85%, and that's because we actually reduced the discount rate. We're now modeling a 5% discount rate as opposed to 5.6%, and that's added some liabilities. And while I won't call where interest rates will go over time, I do believe that they're going to go up. And as I mentioned before, a 100-basis-point movement up in the discount rate eliminates $500,000 to $600,000 of our liabilities, and that would put us on a fully-funded basis.
