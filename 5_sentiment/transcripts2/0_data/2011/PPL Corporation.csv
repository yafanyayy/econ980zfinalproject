We've got a lot to cover today, so we'll jump right into it. Today, we planned to discuss our 2010 results and our 2011 earnings forecast, as well as provide you with a more in-depth discussion of the strength of our platform that we feel is in well positioned, I should say to grow share in our value over the next two years. 
Obviously, the past few years have been a challenging for our sector, especially those with significant competitive generation. At PPL, we've used this period as an opportunity to strengthen our business mix and focus capital on the rate regulated sector of our industry. As a result, we've reduced our earnings risk profile and retained the upside inherent to our supply business when wholesale electricity markets recover from our current down cycle. We already see proof that the steps we've taken over the past few years have significantly strengthened our company while improving our flexibility to thrive in a variety of market scenarios. This morning, we'll provide you with our normal year-end update and also discuss our 2011 earnings forecast.
Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer will provide you with a detailed operational overview and Paul Farr, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial details with you. And of course we'll leave time for your questions at the end. 
Before launching into the discussion, I would like to talk briefly about some recent M&A trait press rumors mentioning P&L. You're all aware to our long standing and appropriate policy not to discuss market rumors or speculations, and we won't deviate from that today. As we've said many times before, the company continuously explores opportunities to enhance value whether it be acquisitions, divestitures, improved operations of our existing businesses. There's something to discuss in regards to one of those potential opportunities, we do it when the time is appropriate. So until that time comes, we'll not respond to questions on that matter today. Now let's move onto the earnings announcement we've made this morning.
Driven by a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with reported earnings of $2.17 per share and ongoing earnings of $3.13 per share. These results are higher than our most recent forecast range even excluding the $0.12 share contribution from the Kentucky operations, which were not included in our prior forecast. 
Considering the continued headwinds of very low wholesale electricity prices driven by low natural gas prices, we're very pleased with our 2010 results. Fully factoring in dilution from the E.ON U.S. acquisition, our 2010 earnings from ongoing operations are 60% higher than our 2009 results. While the combination of our very beneficial hedging profile and depressed energy and capacity prices results in a lower earnings per share forecast for 2011 than we achieved in 2010, we expect strong growth in our utility segments in the future.
This earnings growth is based on immediate infrastructure improvements in these companies, which will result in significant rate base growth over the next several years. We expect compound annual rate base growth of our combined regulated businesses to be approximately 9.5% from 2011 to 2015. We're confident in our ability to earn reasonable returns on this rate base because these utilities are best-in-class performance and they operate in jurisdictions with highly constructive regulatory frameworks. Also, support not to overlook the superb competitive generation assets that we have in the mid-Atlantic region and in Montana. While margins have fallen because of lowering natural gas and capacity pricing, our units continue to be among the most competitive in the PJM Interconnection.
This position has been enhanced by a significant environmental investments that have already been made in our co-units and the investments to expand capacity in our nuclear and hydro units. Our diverse mix of coal, natural gas fired hydro and nuclear generation in this region means that we are well-positioned to benefit from proposed EPA regulations.
In Montana, our balanced portfolio of coal-fired and hydro electric generation puts us in a very good competitive position. As I alluded to earlier, we're confident that prices will eventually rebound, and we do begin to see some industrial growth throughout our territories. When they do, our shareholders will benefit significantly. Our strategic actions for the past year have strengthened our financial position, increasing the proportionate the size of our regulated business and lowering our exposure to commodity market volatility. 
Today, we're announcing that earnings forecast for 2011 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share and Paul will walk you through the major year-on-year drivers in his prepared remarks. Within the forecast, I'd like to highlight that we're projecting 50% of our 2011 earnings will come from our regulated businesses, a substantial increase over 2010. We've also tightened our range compared with previous earnings forecast, reflecting the higher mix of rate regulated businesses and my confidence in PPL's ability to execute in our business plan.
Beyond the excellence assets that we have in place to grow shareholder value, we also have some significant strength that differentiate us from our peers in the sector. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we have strong regulatory relationships built on foundations of transparency and meeting the commitments we make. We expect in value the role the regulators play in ensuring reliable electricity and gas services at reasonable prices while providing a fair return to share owners. Our communicative cooperative approach has led us to a mutual respect among PPL reps and regulators, a respect that makes us a credible voice in the policymaking process. Our regulated companies are among the best in terms of cost competitiveness, reliability and customer service, earning very high customer satisfaction and regulatory recognition.
We intend to retain that distinction by making necessary and prudent investments that will maintain our strong reliability and customer service. In the U.K., for example, we're recognized as an efficiency and customer service leader, benchmarks by which others are judged. This commitment is operational excellence also incorporates disciplined cost management practices to ensure that we're getting the most out of the money we spend.
At the heart of our success, our 14,000 highly trained dedicated employees in our business. We rely on these expert to deliver on the promises that we make to our customers and shareholders. Finally, we're clearly remaining committed to a strong dividend, which we view as a key element of total shareholder return. Our acquisition this past year fortified our dividend and the rate base growth potential that Bill will discuss in a minute. I think this clearly puts us in a much stronger position to grow the dividend in the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for our business and operational review."

Today, I'm going to review four of our key business segments with a focus on the value drivers for each one. I believe you'll see that PPL has a compelling growth story in each of our regulated businesses, and we have a highly competitive generation fleet that is very well-positioned. Jim mentioned that our regulated growth and rate base is now estimated at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% over the next five years. That's a full 2% higher than we had previously forecast. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and start with an overview of LG&E and KU, which forms our largest regulated business segment. Going forward, we will refer to this segment as the Kentucky regulated segment. The segment consists of two vertically integrated utilities, LG&E, is a gas and electric utility while KU is electric only. Our regulated generation fleet has a capacity of about 8,100 megawatts, with the recent addition of the Trimble County II Coal Plant. LG&E and KU commissioned this 800 megawatt plant in January at a cost of just over $1,500 per KBW. This is an exceptionally low cost for state-of-the-art facility like this.
Like our other regulated operations, LG&E and KU have a history of outstanding customer satisfaction and efficient reliable and safe operations. Brian [ph] and his team have earned the trust and respect of regulators where they have constructive and supportive working relationships. The combination of efficient and effective operations and this constructive regulatory environment have resulted in these utilities having some of the lowest rates in the nation. These rates are a significant economic development tool for our service territories as well. The growth prospects driven by this economic development, coupled with pending changes in EPA environmental regulations will lead to further growth the rate base and returns on that investment. 
As noted on Slide 10, the Kentucky environmental cost recovery mechanism or ECR is provided by a statute enacted in Kentucky in 1992. It allows your near realtime recovery of cost associated with environmental compliance for coal-fired generation. Currently, about 85% of the applicable environmental costs, including investment and operating costs are being recovered through the ECR. Since inception, over $2.9 billion of environmental capital spending, including [ph] have been recovered through the FECR mechanism. The remaining 15% of environmental cost represent the cost associated or allocated to all system sales, sales to Virginia retail customers and sales to Kentucky municipal utility served by KU under FERC approved, full requirements contract. These remaining costs are recoverable through general rate cases. 
As you know, increased regulations being issued and proposed by the EPA are expected to impact coal-fired generation. We expect the majority of our compliance cost in Kentucky will be recovered through the ECR mechanism. The tenant upon final EPR regulations and our valuation of the lease cost options, we believe the various compliance cost for air and coal combustion residuals, CCRs could be more than $2 billion over the next five years. This estimate is not assuming hazardous definition for CCR nor does it include any incremental cost associated with CO2 compliance or new water quality standards. Our estimate will continue to be refined as regulation and lease cost compliance analysis are finalized.
Slide 11 summarizes the environmental control equipment already installed on our coal plants in Kentucky. As you can see, significant environmental controls are already installed at these plants. But we do expect additional investment will be needed to comply with the evolving environmental regulations. LG&E and KU's rate base has grown by more than 50% over the past five years with the construction of Thermal Country II and the installation of scrubbers at KU's Browne and Gen plants. As you can see from this slide, we expect a similar increase over the next five years.
We show environmental CapEx in two categories. We expect the spending designated by the orange bar to be needed regardless of the outcome of the new EPA regulation. The green bar represents the $2 billion estimated to comply with new and proposed EPA regulations, as I mentioned earlier. Since the majority of the environmental CapEx should be recovered through the ECR mechanism, the remainder of environmental and non-environmental CapEx in our group will drive the need for future rate cases.
As agreed in the Kentucky change of control proceeding, new base rates can not be effective prior to January 1, 2013. We are able to offset regulatory lag to a degree using mechanisms that supplement traditional rate cases, and we believe our rates will remain competitive and light a similar activity at surrounding utilities in our favorable starting position. PPL continues to be very pleased with the addition of the newly acquired Kentucky operations, the rate base growth potential, transparent regulatory construct and economic prospects in the Kentucky region will provide earnings growth for this business well into the future.
Before turning to WPD, I'd like to comment briefly on the integration process. The significant amount of upfront work went into ensuring a smooth transition upon closing. Our day one integration work went extremely well, and we will continue to pursue ways to operate the combined business in an efficient manner and within our regulatory commitments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for a review of WPD.  Our WPD business is regulated by the U.K. Office of Gas and Electricity Markets or Ofgem. The U.K. enjoys a fully developed mature electricity market. The regulatory framework is well established and provides a favorable efficient system where WPD has tried for many years. Ofgem has approved a $2 billion expenditure program and the current five-year distribution price control review period, DPCR5 to fund maintenance, capital improvements and upgrades to WPD's network. This approved network investment is 31% higher than that provided in the last price control period.
A key element of the regulation is a multiyear formula rate nature of revenue determination. There is no regulatory lag in expenditures over the entire price control period. They are fully factored into the determination of WPD's revenues during this regulatory cycle. Another key feature of the regulatory construct is the incentive nature of the scheme, whereby companies that are front tier performers can outperform peers on a revenue and ROE basis. Beyound the base revenues, each distribution network operator has the opportunity to earn incentive revenues related to performance and customer service, reliability and cost efficiencies, areas in which WPD has excelled.
We expect that our regulated asset value will increase from $2.8 billion at the end of 2010 to almost $3.5 billion by 2015, driven by the network investments I just mentioned. A key component of last year's price control review was recognition of WPD's readership in the area of operational performance. As shown here, we lead the industry with the lowest number of customer complaints, best contact center performance, best capital unit cost and customer reliability. In fact, the degree to which WPD excelled in these areas, lead the U.K. regulator to increase WPD's revenues by over $240 million in recent future rate periods. This type of best-in-class service is nothing new to WPD. During the last price control review, WPD was awarded over $100 million in incentive revenues.
And finally for international, as of November EEI Conference, we committed to provide modeling parameters for WPD when we announced the 2011 guidance. As the basis for helping model the U.K. operations, we thought that using this segment, P&L format already available to you in our published financials statements would be the best option. 
So let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 6.9% per year plus inflation for the balance of the price control review period. Most of our operating cost increase with inflation although depreciation expense increase at a higher rate due to the levels of CapEx. Pension expenses expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 55 million in 2012 and beyond, primarily due to projected amortization of prior actuarial losses. For calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed, expect for about 20% that is inflation linked. And over the longer term, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 25%. With these factors and applying for foreign currency rate, you should be able to more accurately model the inherent growth in WPD's future earnings contribution. 
In summary, the goal for the international segment is to continue to add value for shareholders to frontier performance and customer service and business efficiency, achieving significant growth in rate base and being a source of growing earnings and cash flow for PPL. 
Now let's move on to our Pennsylvania regulated segments starting on Slide 19. Like our Kentucky and WPD operations, PPL Electric Utilities is also known for its superior customer service and well-established constructive regulatory relationships in Pennsylvania. We have very visible investment opportunities with rate base growth projected to rise from $3 billion to $4.8 billion, a 60% increase over the next five years. In fact, we expect to make sustainable investments over the next 10 years to replace aging infrastructure largely built in the 1960s and 1970s, a good portion of which is now starting to reach the end of its usual life. 
On the transmission side of our business, our projected CapEx investment of $1.9 billion through 2015 is nearly 5x higher than the prior five years. As you know, our transmission business operates under an attractive formula structure with annual true-ups effective June 1 of each year, capturing rate base additions and OMS escalations on a very timely basis. The majority of EU's increased transmission spending is recoverable under the formula rate structure and they are added incentives for our Susquehanna-Roseland line. On the distribution side of our business, we're forecasting $1.5 billion of new investment, resulting from a combination of aging infrastructure, smart grid technology and more traditional CapEx.
Distribution cost are currently recovered through a base rate filing. As we have noted in the past, we are interested in pursuing alternative rate mechanisms that would provide for more timely recovery of the capital deploy. Absent this, we anticipate filing rate cases in 2012 and 2014 to recover the increasing expenditures needed to maintain customer liability and improve network efficiency. EU's CapEx profile on Slide 20 provides further information on those upcoming investments. 
We plan to increase our capital spending over the next two years before we hit an expected sustained level of capital investment, excluding the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line. As illustrated here and shown in light green, transmission is a predominant driver of our CapEx group. The $1.9 billion in investment from 2011 to 2015 consistent of $800 million in aging infrastructure replacements, $700 million for capacity and other projects and the remaining $440 million is associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland line. 
Regarding Susquehanna-Roseland, the environmental review of the project by the National Park Service is going. After which, we expect construction to resume in 2013 and 2014 with the project and service early 2015. The need for this project has been reaffirmed several times by PGM, and we expect the need for the project will continue to be reaffirmed. We do not expect the recent legislation in New Jersey and associated generation projects to eliminate the need for this line.
In summary, our capital investment opportunities  and distribution translate into an annualized rate base growth of 10%. Over the same period, transmission rate base growth at just over 20%. From 28% to 40% of total rate case, increasing the proportion of our earnings driven by the transmission formula rate structure. 
Let's move on to Slide 22 and take a closer look at our competitive supply segment. We've discussed this segment and its investments highlights with you in great detail on the past and today I'll provide a brief update. Importantly, we want to highlight our ability to control spending and optimize our operations during low commodity cycles and our ability to meet and benefit from evolving EPA regulations. 
Slide 23 details the environmental control equipment we've already installed on our fleet and the control equipment under consideration. Approximately 40% of annual output from the fleet is carbon free, nuclear and hydro while approximately 50% of our output is coal-fired, the majority of our coal plants are large supercritical plants that are well controlled from an environmental perspective and highly efficient. Our proactive approach to environmental compliance positions the PPL fleet favorably for future EPA regulation. 96% of the competitive coal generation is scrub, 88% has not control already installed. 
Since 2005, PPL's invested $1.6 billion in environmental control equipment, positioning it very well for many of the proposed EPA regulations. The additional control equipment that is under consideration can be installed at an expected cost of just $350 million to $400 million. At this low point in the commodity cycle, we are clearly focused on controlling our cost. We did reduced our 2010 capital spending by nearly $100 million compared to our original plan and we've reduced our five-year plan by nearly $500 million. We're also focused on managing operating cost. We cut $30 million out of our operating budgets in both '10 and '11 despite the addition of new environmental control equipment in compliance with new security and work our regulations at our nuclear stations. We've been operating our coal units at minimum output levels during certain off-peak hours and are working to achieve even lower minimum levels. In order to reduce fuel cost, we continue to analyze the types of fuel we're bringing at each of our units. For example, we're continuing to prepare several units to burn powder river basin coal, as well as Illinois based. And we look to burn of-speck coals during off-peak periods as another means to reduce cost.
We've maintained our disciplined three-year hedging program, which is captured significant value for shareholders. The hedging program added $700 million to our margins in 2010 and our hedges for '11 and '12 are in the money by $1.4 billion. While we're unable to completely eliminate volatility in this business, our hedging strategy had significantly reduce the substantial portion of that volatility. On this slide, we're preparing our asset hedge positions for 2011 and 2012. There are a few notable changes to this slide, I'd like to point out from previous quarters. We've eliminated the base fully loaded hedged price and instead provided the annual capacity revenue separately at the bottom of this slide. This provides more visibility on our expected PGM capacity revenues. 
As we discussed previously, given current market conditions and transmission work in the region, our forecast for 2011 does not include a basis premium over PJM West Hub for units. We are also giving a range for delivered coal prices in the East and now provide you with a range of our expected coal price in the West as well. As for 2013, we continue to be very lightly hedged with less than 10% of our PJM generation under contract. We do, however, have about 80% of our coal under contract for 2013. When we enter into a more meaningful level of energy hedges for 2013, we'll provide you an update.
In 2010, we began to see signs of economic recovery and annual net energy requirements within PGM increased nearly 3% from 2009. This is roughly equivalent to the output of a 2,200 megawatt nuclear plant. PGM forecast a similar level of increased demand over the next few years. At the same time, low current foreign crisis and the uncertainty that New Jersey and Maryland are adding to future capacity, there is little incentive to add new generation. We have anticipate the return of demand will drive forward market prices higher, as well as the impact of EPA's proposed regulations affecting the supply side of the equation. 
Our internal modeling estimates that approximately 12 gigawatts of generation could be retired within PJM by 2013. This assumes all control unit less than 200 megawatts are retired along with some inefficient uncontrolled units greater than 200 megawatts. Analysis by the group, Credit Suisse and others have made similar assumptions and project retirements somewhat higher than our own analysis. The impact of those retirement should improve energy and capacity prices over the longer term.
Now before turning the call over to Paul, I'd like to conclude with the following. The new PPL, with the addition of the Kentucky regulated segment, has a very strong group of regulated businesses. These utilities will provide a significant platform of growth for a regulated earnings well into the future. The leaders of this businesses clearly understand the importance of continuing our tradition of working with regulators to ensure reliable service while providing shareholders with solid returns. 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% and rate base. Over the next five years, PPL will be investing more than $11 billion in our delivery business in the U.S. and the U.K. Importantly, of this $11 billion, we expect 55% or $6.4 billion will be recoverable using the realtime mechanisms in the U.K., Kentucky and under our formula REITs. We believe this clearly differentiates PPL from others in our sector.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."
185508,117935595,99302,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 28 to review our financial results for 2010. Our earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter and year reflects the earnings contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment due to the successful",1286,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 28 to review our financial results for 2010. Our earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter and year reflects the earnings contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment due to the successful close of the transaction on November 1. 
For the full year 2010, we earned $3.13 per share, exceeding the $2.87 per share midpoint of our 2010 forecast of earnings per share from ongoing operations. The two largest contributors of our performance versus forecast for the quarter would be the operating earnings from Kentucky of $0.12 per share and several tax items that net benefited the quarter by just about $0.12 per share. On a segment basis, we fully allocated dilution from the equity units, which was incorporated into our forecast, resulting in a $0.07 per share net contribution from Kentucky for the quarter.
The tax items that net benefited the quarter included a positive impact from evaluation adjustment for Pennsylvania net operating loss carry forwards and the negative impact of bonus depreciation, a decrease to section $1.99 deduction both of which impacted supply, as well as the negative tax impact of the tax restructuring that took place in international. 
I'll review the segment earnings drivers for 2010 and then discuss our earnings forecast for 2011. Turning to Slide 29, our international regulated segment earned $0.53 per share in 2010, a $0.19 per share decrease from 2009. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1, 2010, under DPCR5; higher pension expense; higher interest expense, primarily due to the GBP 400 million debt issuance in March of 2010; and higher interest expense on WPD's inflation index bond on the back of higher inflation later in the year; the favorable impact of currency exchange rates; higher income taxes; and dilution of $0.07 per share. 
Moving to Slide 30, our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.27 per share in 2010, an $0.08 decline compared to 2009. This decrease was the net result of higher O&M expenses, primarily due to expanded vegetation management activities and higher staffing costs, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances, higher depreciation and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to supply. The supply segment earned $2.27 per share in 2010, an increase of $1.39 per share compared to last year, driven by significantly higher realized sales prices for our eastern base low generation, lower margins unload following agreements due to customer migration and the economic downturn and higher average fuel costs and higher energy margins in the West, primarily due to higher net sales prices partially offset by lower sales volumes.
2010 was also impacted by higher O&M primarily on our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the Unit 1 force outage in the third quarter, higher refueling outage cost and higher payroll cost. Higher depreciation driven by the Brunner Island's scrubbers and replacement in service in 2009, lower income taxes primarily due to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances related to the DA net operating loss carryforwards, I just mentioned and the impact of investment tax credits for the whole Wooden Rainbow hydro expansion project. 
Discontinued operations, which include operating results for the Long Island generation and the main hydros and the pending sale of Upark, equities and PPL's equity interest in Safe Harbor, as well as dilution of $0.33 per share. 
Turning to Slide 32. As Jim already mentioned, we are announcing our 2011 earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.50 per share with the midpoint of $2.50 per share. This slide provides an overview of the key factors expected to impact 2011 earnings. A significant earning driver between 2010 and 2011 is dilution of $0.34 per share, reflecting a full year's impact of 103 million of shares of common equity issued in June 2010 to finance the Kentucky acquisition. The full year addition of our Kentucky regulated business is the largest positive driver of 2011 earnings followed by increased delivery margins in our Pennsylvania regulated segment, resulting from PPL Electrics already approved distribution rate increase that became effective January 1 of this year. 
Offsetting these positive earnings drivers are lower supply margins, which are the net result of lower electricity prices, including lower basis and capacity prices in the eastern higher fuel costs in the East and West, partially offsetting these unfavorable factors are higher expected generation and higher margins on load volume agreements. We expect higher O&M in our supply segment primarily due to increased outage cost at our fossil plants in the East and West, higher income taxes primarily in the supply segment due to the 2010 release and deferred tax valuation allowances and a lower Section 199 benefit. Lower earnings as a result of 2010 sale of non-core generating assets, higher depreciation in our supply in Pennsylvania regulated segments and higher financing cost due to higher commitment fees and higher debt levels, including a full year of interest on the equity units that we issued in June.
In addition, when excluding the impact of dilution, which is captured the single driver on this slide, we expect flat earnings in our international regulated segment driven by higher delivery revenue and a more favorable currency exchange rate offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. 
On Slide 33, we've detailed our 2010 free cash flow from operations before dividends. The 2010 free cash flow before dividends includes the operating results of the Kentucky regulated segment, but not the cash used in the acquisition of these assets.
Since last quarter, the most significant change in the 2010 free cash flow before dividends is the expected timing of the proceeds from the pending sale of Law Review part and our interest in Safe Harbor. We now expect to close that transaction and receive the proceeds in 2011. The change in cash from operations for 2010 is the net result of a return of third-party collateral, an increase on unbilled revenue and the impact of bonus tax depreciation. 
In addition to adding asset sale proceeds to 2011, the 2011 pretty cash flow before dividend is driven by higher expected cash from operations, primarily due to a full-year impact of the Kentucky operating results; the cash benefit of bonus tax depreciation; and an expected income tax refund in 2011, which are expected to be partially offset by large pension contributions, both domestically and international and for the return of collateral to third parties. This positive cash from operations is expected to be partially offset by large capital expenditure programs in all segments.
Turning to Slide 34. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on our dividend as a key element of total share in return. Our significantly more rate regulated business mix provides strong support for the current dividend and for future dividend growth. As depicted on this chart, regulated earnings alone nearly covered the current dividend. As a regulated earnings grow, we would expect to be able to enhance stimulating growth profile. 
Now moving to Slide 35. We're looking forward to 2012 and 2013. We expect higher domestic rate regulated earnings due to higher rate basis, directly tied to large capital expenditure programs and assumptions related to plan base rate filings during this period.

In addition, the regulatory review period first opportunity of coming in the gas cycle here is expected to be extended from five years to eight years. So that's kind of formula rate treatment and the predictability and forecastability should go out over a longer period of time to be determined what happens in the intervening years, though because eight years is a long period to commit to a capital structure as to what they will permit or what they will do with the cap structure meaning interest rate, soon interest rate in your model cap structure over that eight-year period of time.

We've got a lot to cover today, so we'll jump right into it. Today, we plan to discuss our 2010 results and our 2011 earnings forecast, as well as provide you a more in-depth discussion of the strength of our platform that we feel is in well-positioned, I should say, to grow shareowner value over the next few years. 
Obviously, the past few years have been very challenging for our sector, especially those with significant competitive generation. At PPL, we've used this period as an opportunity to strengthen our business mix and focus capital on the rate-regulated sector of our industry. As a result, we've reduced our earnings risk profile and retained the upside inherent to our Supply business when wholesale electricity markets recover from our current down cycle. We already see proof that the steps we've taken over the past few years have significantly strengthened our company, while improving our flexibility to thrive in a variety of market scenarios. This morning, we'll provide you with our normal year-end update and also discuss our 2011 earnings forecast.
Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide you with a detailed operational overview; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial details with you. And of course we'll leave time for your questions at the end. 
Before launching into the discussion, however, I'd like to talk briefly about some recent M&A trade press rumors mentioning PPL. You're all aware to our long standing and appropriate policy not to discuss market rumors or speculation, and we won't deviate from that today. As we've said many times before, the company continuously explores opportunities to enhance value whether it be acquisitions, divestitures, improved operations of our existing businesses. There's something to discuss in regards to one of those potential opportunities, we do it when the time is appropriate. So until that time comes, we'll not respond to questions on that matter today. 
Now let's move on to the earnings announcement we've made this morning. Driven by a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with reported earnings of $2.17 per share and ongoing earnings of $3.13 per share. These results are higher than our most recent forecast range even excluding the $0.12 share contribution from the Kentucky operations, which were not included in our prior forecast. 
Considering the continued headwinds of very low wholesale electricity prices driven by low natural gas prices, we're very pleased with our 2010 results. Fully factoring in dilution from the E.ON U.S. acquisition, our 2010 earnings from ongoing operations are 60% higher than our 2009 results. While the combination of our very beneficial hedging profile and depressed energy and capacity prices results in a lower earnings per share forecast for 2011 than we achieved in 2010, we expect strong growth in our utility segments in the future.
This earnings growth is based on immediate infrastructure improvements in these companies, which will result in significant rate base growth over the next several years. We expect compound annual growth rate or rate base growth of our combined regulated businesses to be approximately 9.5% from 2011 to 2015. We're confident in our ability to earn reasonable returns on this rate base because these utilities are best-in-class performers, and they operate in jurisdictions with highly constructive regulatory frameworks. Also, it's important not to overlook the superb competitive generation assets that we have in the mid-Atlantic region and in Montana. While margins have fallen because of lowering natural gas and capacity pricing, our units continue to be among the most competitive in the PJM Interconnection.
This position has been enhanced by the significant environmental investments that have already been made in our co-units and the investments to expand capacity in our nuclear and hydro units. Our diverse mix of coal, natural gas fired hydro and nuclear generation in this region means that we are well-positioned to benefit from proposed EPA regulations.
In Montana, our balanced portfolio of coal-fired and hydro electric generation puts us in a very good competitive position. As I alluded to earlier, we're confident that prices will eventually rebound, and we do begin to see some industrial growth throughout our territories. When they do, our shareowners will benefit significantly. Our strategic actions for the past year have strengthened our financial position, increasing the proportionate size of our regulated business and lowering our exposure to commodity market volatility. 
Today, we're announcing that our earnings forecast for 2011 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and Paul will walk you through the major year-on-year drivers in his prepared remarks. Within the forecast, I'd like to highlight that we're projecting 50% of our 2011 earnings will come from our regulated businesses, a substantial increase over 2010. We've also tightened our range compared with previous earnings forecast, reflecting a higher mix of rate-regulated businesses and my confidence in PPL's ability to execute on our business plan.
Beyond the excellent assets that we have in place to grow shareowner value, we also have some significant strengths that differentiate us from our peers in the sector. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we have strong regulatory relationships built on foundations of transparency and meeting the commitments we make. We respect and value the role of the regulators play in ensuring highly reliable electricity and gas services at reasonable prices while providing a fair return to shareowners. Our communicative, cooperative approach has led us to a mutual respect among PPL reps and regulators, a respect that makes us a credible voice in the policy-making process. Our regulated companies are among the best in terms of cost competitiveness, reliability and customer service earning very high customer satisfaction and regulatory recognition.
We intend to retain that distinction by making necessary and prudent investments that will maintain our strong reliability in customer service. In the U.K., for example, we're recognized as an efficiency and customer service leader, benchmarks by which others are judged. This commitment to operational excellence also incorporates disciplined cost management practices to ensure that we're getting the most out of the money we spend.
At the heart of our success are 14,000 highly trained, dedicated employees in our business. We rely on these experts to deliver on the promises that we make to our customers and shareowners. Finally, we're clearly remain committed to a strong dividend, which we view as a key element of total shareowner return. Our acquisition this past year fortified our dividend and the rate base growth potential that Bill will discuss in a minute. I think this clearly puts us in a much stronger position to grow the dividend in the future. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for our business and operational review."
185508,117935595,99561,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to review four of our key business segments, with a focus on the value drivers for each one. I believe you'll see that PPL has a compelling growth story in each of our regulated businesses, and we",2885,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to review four of our key business segments, with a focus on the value drivers for each one. I believe you'll see that PPL has a compelling growth story in each of our regulated businesses, and we have a highly competitive generation fleet that is very well-positioned. Jim mentioned that our regulated growth and rate base is now estimated at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% over the next five years. That's a full 2% higher than we had previously forecast. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and start with an overview of LG&E and KU, which forms our largest regulated business segment. Going forward, we will refer to this segment as the Kentucky-regulated segment. The segment consists of two vertically integrated utilities. LG&E is a gas and electric utility, while KU is electric only. Our regulated generation fleet has a capacity of about 8,100 megawatts, with the recent addition of the Trimble County 2 coal plant. LG&E and KU commissioned this 800-megawatt plant in January at a cost of just over $1,500 per kW. This is an exceptionally low cost for state-of-the-art facility like this.
Like our other regulated operations, LG&E and KU have a history of outstanding customer satisfaction and efficient, reliable and safe operations. Vic Staffieri and his team have earned the trust and respect of regulators where they have constructive and supportive working relationships. The combination of efficient and effective operations and this constructive regulatory environment have resulted in these utilities having some of the lowest rates in the nation. These rates are a significant economic development tool for our service territories as well. The growth prospects driven by this economic development, coupled with pending changes in EPA environmental regulations, will lead to further growth in rate base and returns on that investment. 
As noted on Slide 10, the Kentucky environmental cost recovery mechanism or ECR is provided by a statute enacted in Kentucky in 1992. It allows your near real-time recovery of cost associated with environmental compliance for coal-fired generation. Currently, about 85% of the applicable environmental costs, including investment and operating costs, are being recovered through the ECR. Since inception, over $2.9 billion of environmental capital spending, including CWIP, has been recovered through the [indiscernible] ECR mechanism. The remaining 15% of environmental cost represent the cost associated or allocated to all system sales, sales to Virginia retail customers and sales to Kentucky municipal utility served by KU under FERC-approved, full requirements contracts. These remaining costs are recoverable through general rate cases. 
As you know, increased regulations being issued and proposed by the EPA are expected to impact coal-fired generation. We expect the majority of our compliance cost in Kentucky will be recovered through the ECR mechanism. Dependent upon final EPA regulations and our evaluation of the lease cost options, we believe the various compliance cost for air and coal combustion residuals, CCRs, could be more than $2 billion over the next five years. This estimate is not assuming hazardous definition for CCR, nor does it include any incremental cost associated with CO2 compliance or new water quality standards. Our estimate will continue to be refined as regulation and lease cost compliance analyses are finalized.
Slide 11 summarizes the environmental control equipment already installed on our coal plants in Kentucky. As you can see, significant environmental controls are already installed at these plants. But we do expect additional investment will be needed to comply with the evolving environmental regulations. LG&E and KU's rate base has grown by more than 50% over the past five years, with the construction of Trimble Country 2 and the installation of scrubbers at KU's Brown and Ghent plants. As you can see from this slide, we expect a similar increase over the next five years.
We show environmental CapEx in two categories. We expect the spending designated by the orange bar to be needed regardless of the outcome of the new EPA regulations. The green bar represents the $2 billion estimated to comply with new and proposed EPA regulations, as I mentioned earlier. Since the majority of the environmental CapEx should be recovered through the ECR mechanism, the remainder of the environmental and non-environmental CapEx and O&M growth will drive the need for future rate cases.
As agreed in the Kentucky change of control proceeding, new base rates can not be effective prior to January 1, 2013. We are able to offset regulatory lag to a degree using mechanisms that supplement traditional rate cases, and we believe our rates will remain competitive in light of similar activity at surrounding utilities in our favorable starting position. PPL continues to be very pleased with the addition of the newly acquired Kentucky operations. The rate base growth potential, transparent regulatory construct and economic prospects in the Kentucky region will provide earnings growth for this business well into the future.
Before turning to WPD, I'd like to comment briefly on the integration process. A significant amount of upfront work went into ensuring a smooth transition upon closing. Our day one integration work went extremely well, and we will continue to pursue ways to operate the combined business in an efficient manner and within our regulatory commitments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for a review of WPD.  Our WPD business is regulated by the U.K. Office of Gas and Electricity Markets or Ofgem. The U.K. enjoys a fully developed mature electricity market. The regulatory framework is well established and provides a favorable efficient system where WPD has thrived for many years. Ofgem has approved a $2 billion expenditure program and the current five-year distribution price control review period, DPCR5, to fund maintenance capital improvements and upgrades to WPD's network. This approved network investment is 31% higher than that provided in the last price control period.
A key element of the regulation is a multiyear formula rate nature of revenue determination. There is no regulatory lag in expenditures over the entire price control period. They are fully factored into the determination of WPD's revenues during this regulatory cycle. Another key feature of the regulatory construct is the incentive nature of the scheme, whereby companies that are frontier performers can outperform peers on a revenue and ROE basis. Beyond the base revenues, each distribution network operator has the opportunity to earn incentive revenues related to performance and customer service, reliability and cost efficiencies, areas in which WPD has excelled.
We expect that our regulated asset value will increase from $2.8 billion at the end of 2010 to almost $3.5 billion by 2015, driven by the network investments I just mentioned. A key component of last year's price control review was recognition of WPD's readership in the area of operational performance. As shown here, we lead the industry with the lowest number of customer complaints, best contact center performance, best capital unit cost and customer reliability. In fact, the degree to which WPD excelled in these areas lead the U.K. regulator to increase WPD's revenues by over $240 million in distant future rate periods. This type of best-in-class service is nothing new to WPD. During the last price control review, WPD was awarded over $100 million in incentive revenues.
And finally for international, at the November EEI Conference, we committed to provide modeling parameters for WPD when we announce 2011 guidance. As a basis for helping model the U.K. operations, we thought that using the segment's P&L format, already available to you in our published financial statements, would be the best option. So let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 6.9% per year plus inflation for the balance of the price control review period. 
Most of our operating costs increased with inflation, although depreciation expense increases at a higher rate due to the increased levels of CapEx. Pension expense is expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 55 million in 2012 and beyond, primarily due to projected amortization of prior actuarial losses. For calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed, expect for about 20% that is inflation-linked. And over the longer term, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 25%. With these factors and applying the foreign currency rate, you should be able to more accurately model the inherent growth in WPD's future earnings contribution. 
In summary, the goal for the international segment is to continue to add value for shareholders to frontier performance and customer service and business efficiency, achieving significant growth in rate base and being a source of growing earnings and cash flow for PPL. 
Now let's move on to our Pennsylvania-regulated segments starting on Slide 19. Like our Kentucky and WPD operations, PPL Electric Utilities is also known for its superior customer service and well-established, constructive regulatory relationships in Pennsylvania. We have very visible investment opportunities, with rate base growth projected to rise from $3 billion to $4.8 billion, a 60% increase over the next five years. In fact, we expect to make sustained investments over the next 10 years to replace aging infrastructure largely built in the 1960s and 1970s, a good portion of which is now starting to reach the end of its useful life. 
On the Transmission side of our business, our projected CapEx investment of $1.9 billion through 2015 is nearly 5x higher than the prior five years. As you know, our Transmission business operates under an attractive formula rate structure with annual true-ups effective June 1 of each year, capturing rate base additions and O&M escalations on a very timely basis. The majority of EU's increased transmission spending is recoverable under the FERC formula rate structure, and there are added incentives to our Susquehanna-Roseland line. On the distribution side of our business, we're forecasting $1.5 billion of new investment, resulting from a combination of aging infrastructure, smart grid technology and more traditional CapEx.
Distribution costs are currently recovered through a base rate filing. As we have noted in the past, we are interested in pursuing alternative rate mechanisms that would provide for more timely recovery of and on the capital deploy. Absent this, we anticipate filing rate cases in 2012 and 2014 to recover the increasing expenditures needed to maintain customer reliability and improve network efficiency. EU's CapEx profile on Slide 20 provides further information on those upcoming investments. 
We plan to increase our capital spending over the next two years before we hit an expected sustained level of capital investment, excluding the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line. As illustrated here and shown in light green, transmission is a predominant driver of our CapEx growth. The $1.9 billion in investment from 2011 to 2015 consists of $800 million in aging infrastructure replacements, $700 million for capacity and other projects, and the remaining $440 million is associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland line. 
Regarding Susquehanna-Roseland, the environmental review of the project by the National Park Service is going. After which, we expect construction to resume in 2013 and 2014, with the project in service early 2015. The need for this project has been reaffirmed several times by PJM, and we expect the need for the project will continue to be reaffirmed. We do not expect the recent legislation in New Jersey and associated generation projects to eliminate the need for this line.
In summary, our capital investment opportunities  and distribution translate into an annualized rate base growth of 10%. Over the same period, transmission rate base growth is just over 20% from 28% to 40% of total rate base, increasing the proportion of our earnings driven by the transmission formula rate structure. 
Let's move on to Slide 22 and take a closer look at our competitive Supply segment. We've discussed this segment and its investment highlights with you in great detail in the past, and today I'll provide a brief update. Importantly, we want to highlight our ability to control spending and optimize our operations during low commodity cycles and our ability to meet and benefit from evolving EPA regulations. 
Slide 23 details the environmental control equipment we've already installed on our fleet and the control equipment under consideration. Approximately 40% of annual output from the fleet is carbon free, nuclear and hydro, while approximately 50% of our output is coal-fired. Majority of our coal plants are large supercritical plants that are well controlled from an environmental perspective and highly efficient. Our proactive approach to environmental compliance positions the PPL fleet favorably for future EPA regulation. 96% of the competitive coal generation is scrub, 88% has NOx controls already installed. 
Since 2005, PPL has invested $1.6 billion in environmental control equipment, positioning us very well to meet many of the proposed EPA regulations. The additional control equipment that is under consideration can be installed at an expected cost of just $350 million to $400 million. 
At this low point in the commodity cycle, we are focused on controlling our cost. We did reduce our 2010 capital spending by nearly $100 million compared to our original plan, and we've reduced our five-year plan by nearly $500 million. We're also focused on managing operating cost. We cut $30 million out of our operating budgets in both '10 and '11 despite the addition of new environmental control equipment and compliance with new security and work hour regulations at our nuclear station. 
We have been operating our coal units at minimum output levels during certain off-peak hours and are working to achieve even lower minimum levels. In order to reduce fuel cost, we continue to analyze the types of fuel we're burning at each of our units. For example, we're continuing to prepare several units to burn Powder River Basin coal, as well as Illinois based. And we look to burn off-spec coal during off-peak periods as another means to reduce cost.
We've maintained our disciplined three-year hedging program, which has captured significant value for shareholders. The hedging program added $700 million to our margins in 2010, and our hedges for '11 and '12 are in the money by $1.4 billion. While we're unable to completely eliminate volatility in this business, our hedging strategy has significantly reduced the substantial portion of that volatility. On this slide, we're preparing our asset hedge positions for 2011 and 2012. There are a few notable changes to this slide I'd like to point out from previous quarters. We've eliminated the base fully loaded hedge price and instead provided the annual capacity revenue separately at the bottom of the slide. This provides more visibility on our expected PJM capacity revenues. 
As we discussed previously, given current market conditions and transmission work in the region, our forecast for 2011 does not include a basis premium over PJM West Hub for our units. We are also giving you a range for delivered coal prices in the East and now provide you with a range of our expected coal price in the West as well. As for 2013, we continue to be very lightly hedged, with less than 10% of our PJM generation under contract. We do, however, have about 80% of our coal under contract for 2013. When we enter into a more meaningful level of energy hedges for 2013, we'll provide you an update.
In 2010, we began to see signs of economic recovery and annual net energy requirements within PJM increased nearly 3% from 2009. This is roughly equivalent to the output of a 2,200-megawatt nuclear plant. PJM forecast a similar level of increased demand over the next few years. At the same time, low current forward prices and the uncertainty that New Jersey and Maryland are adding to future capacity prices, there is a little incentive to add new generation. We anticipate that the return of demand will drive forward market prices higher, as well the impact of EPA's proposed regulations affecting the supply side of the equation. 
Our internal modeling estimates that approximately 12 gigawatts of generation could be retired within PJM by 2019. This assumes all uncontrolled units, less than 200 megawatts are retired, along with some inefficient uncontrolled units greater than 200 megawatts. Analyses by the Brattle Group, Credit Suisse and others have made similar assumptions and project retirements somewhat higher than our own analysis. The impact of those retirement should improve energy and capacity prices over the longer term.
Now before turning the call over to Paul, I'd like to conclude with the following. The new PPL, with the addition of the Kentucky-regulated segment, has a very strong group of regulated businesses. These utilities will provide a significant platform of growth for a regulated earnings well into the future. The leaders of these businesses clearly understand the importance of continuing our tradition of working with regulators to ensure reliable service while providing shareowners with solid returns. 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% in rate base. Over the next five years, PPL will be investing more than $11 billion in our delivery businesses in the U.S. and the U.K. Importantly, of this $11 billion, we expect 55% or $6.4 billion will be recoverable using the near real-time mechanisms in the U.K., Kentucky and under our FERC formula rates. We believe this clearly differentiates PPL from others in our sector.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."
185508,117935595,99561,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 28 to review our financial results for 2010. Our earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter and year reflect the earnings contribution of our Kentucky-regulated segment due to the successful",1282,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 28 to review our financial results for 2010. Our earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter and year reflect the earnings contribution of our Kentucky-regulated segment due to the successful close of the transaction on November 1. 
For the full year 2010, we earned $3.13 per share, exceeding the $2.87 per share midpoint of our 2010 forecast of earnings per share from ongoing operations. The two largest contributors of our outperformance versus forecast for the quarter were the operating earnings from Kentucky of $0.12 per share and several tax items that net benefited the quarter by just about $0.12 per share. On a segment basis, we fully allocated dilution from the equity units, which was incorporated into our forecast, resulting in a $0.07 per share net contribution from Kentucky for the quarter.
The tax items that net benefited the quarter included a positive impact from evaluation adjustment for Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards and the negative impact of bonus depreciation that decreased our Section 199 deduction, both of which impacted supply, as well as the negative tax impact of the tax restructuring that took place in international. 
I'll review the segment earnings drivers for 2010 and then discuss our earnings forecast for 2011. Turning to Slide 29. Our international regulated segment earned $0.53 per share in 2010, a $0.19 per share decrease from 2009. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1, 2010 under DPCR5; higher pension expense; higher interest expense, primarily due to the GBP 400 million debt issuance in March of 2010; and higher interest expense on WPD's inflation index bonds on the back of higher inflation later in the year; the favorable impact of currency exchange rates; higher income taxes; and dilution of $0.07 per share. 
Moving to Slide 30. Our Pennsylvania-regulated segment earned $0.27 per share in 2010, an $0.08 decline compared to 2009. This decrease was the net result of higher O&M expenses, primarily due to expanded vegetation management activities and higher staffing costs, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances, higher depreciation and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Supply. The Supply segment earned $2.27 per share in 2010, an increase of $1.39 per share compared to last year, driven by significantly higher realized sales prices for our Eastern baseload generation, lower margins on load-following agreements due to customer migration and the economic downturn and higher average fuel costs and higher energy margins in the West, primarily due to higher net sales prices partially offset by lower sales volumes.
2010 was also impacted by higher O&M, primarily at our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the Unit 1 forced outage in the third quarter; higher refueling outage cost and higher payroll costs; higher depreciation driven by the Brunner Island's scrubbers that were placed in service in 2009; lower income taxes, primarily due to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances related to the PA net operating loss carryforwards I just mentioned; and the impact of investment tax credits for the Holtwood and Rainbow hydro expansion projects; discontinued operations, which includes operating results of the Long Island generation and the Maine hydros; and the pending sale of UPark, Wallingford and PPL's equity interest in Safe Harbor; as well as dilution of $0.33 per share. 
Turning to Slide 32. As Jim already mentioned, we are announcing our 2011 earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with a midpoint of $2.50 per share. This slide provides an overview of the key factors expected to impact 2011 earnings. A significant earnings driver between 2010 and 2011 is dilution of $0.34 per share, reflecting a full year's impact of the 103 million shares of common equity issued in June 2010 to finance the Kentucky acquisition. The full year addition of our Kentucky-regulated business is the largest positive driver of 2011 earnings followed by increased delivery margins in our Pennsylvania-regulated segment, resulting from PPL Electrics' already approved distribution rate increase that became effective January 1 of this year. 
Offsetting these positive earnings drivers are lower supply margins, which are the net results of lower electricity prices, including lower basis and capacity prices in the East and higher fuel costs in the East and West. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors are higher expected generation and higher margins on load-following agreements. We expect higher O&M at our Supply segment, primarily due to increased outage cost at our fossil plants in the East and West, higher income taxes primarily in the Supply segment due to the 2010 release of the deferred tax valuation allowances and a lower Section 199 benefit, lower earnings as a result of the 2010 sale of non-core generating assets, higher depreciation in our supply in Pennsylvania-regulated segments and higher financing cost due to higher commitment fees and higher debt levels, including a full year of interest on the equity units that we issued in June. In addition, when excluding the impact of dilution, which we've captured as a single driver on this slide, we expect flat earnings in our international-regulated segment driven by higher delivery revenue and a more favorable currency exchange rate offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs.  
On Slide 33, we've detailed our 2010 free cash flow from operations before dividends. The 2010 free cash flow before dividends includes the operating results of the Kentucky-regulated segment, but not the cash used in the acquisition of these assets. Since last quarter, the most significant change in the 2010 free cash flow before dividends is the expected timing of the proceeds from the pending sale of Wallingford, UPark and our interest in Safe Harbor. We now expect to close that transaction and receive the proceeds in 2011. The change in cash from operations for 2010 is the net result of the return of third-party collateral, an increase in unbilled revenue and the impact of bonus tax depreciation. 
In addition to adding asset sale proceeds to 2011, the 2011 free cash flow before dividend is driven by higher expected cash from operations, primarily due to a full year impact of the Kentucky operating results; the cash benefit of bonus tax depreciation; and an expected income tax refund in 2011, which are expected to be partially offset by large pension contributions, both domestically and international; and the further return of collateral to third parties. This positive cash from operations is expected to be partially offset by large capital expenditure programs in all segments.
Turning to Slide 34. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on our dividend as a key element of total shareowner return. Our significantly more rate-regulated business mix provides strong support for the current dividend and for future dividend growth. As depicted on this chart, our regulated earnings alone nearly cover the current dividend. As our regulated earnings grow, we would expect to be able to enhance this dividend growth profile. 
Now moving to Slide 35. We're looking forward to 2012 and 2013. We expect higher domestic rate-regulated earnings due to higher rate basis directly tied to large capital expenditure programs and assumptions related to planned base rate filings during this period; increase in distribution revenue at WPD except during the 2009 DPCR5 process; lower supply margins as a result of depressed energy prices and our hedge profile; higher O&M in all business segments; positive fundamentals affecting the Supply segment that Bill previously discussed, including heat rate expansion; and increased load as the economy begins to recover. 
And with that, this concludes the prepared remarks for this morning. So I'll turn the call back to Jim for Q&A."

But we see somewhere around $700 million between the September 9, 2010 implementation and the end of 2012 when sunsets around $700 million in total cash benefit during that period versus what things would have looked like without the bonus depreciation. Now in a full year like 2011, yes, it's nice that it's FFO. It helps credit metrics. It's cash. We likely will push out the need for equity at least to the very back end of the year. The net impact, though, on earnings is still a negative since we were in a position where we should have gotten around $0.05 to $0.06 of Section 199 benefit. The manufacturers' deduction that affects both the Kentucky and Pennsylvania-based competitive generation, Montana generation. So all in all, it's a net negative from an earnings perspective, slightly, including the impact of pushing back equity financing needs. However, it does provide significant cash surplus or cash benefit."

And so I tend to think that much of the intent of the regulations will become evident through this calendar year, either by laying them out in great clarity or enough information on the table to know that they will happen. So I think our view has been looking at our fleets and our level of economic spend that we've already accomplished on our generating fleets. We stand to be in a very good position going forward and that we've already spent the money and spent it at the right time. We, in fact, will benefit from additional small coal unit shutdowns, as I think Bill mentioned, our supercritical fleet here and then out West and Kentucky. Obviously, that will be recovered under the ECR. But in our merchant markets in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, we're positioned very well for the EPA regs as we see them unfolding.

What we were trying to indicate on the dividend slide is showing that and combining this response with how I responded to Jonathan's question, we'll very clearly be able to more than sufficiently to cover the dividend with the regulated earnings. I think it depends upon where we see mid-cycle gas prices driving power, which drives margins and maintaining our three-year hedge profile. I think it's difficult until we get up into that 75%-ish range that I'd I feel comfortable talking about payout ratios, and as well, getting through the last part of our generation build around the Susquehanna operates, the Holtwood and Rainbow construction projects and get into more of a normalized level of maintenance CapEx spend as well."

I think that it would be reasonable amounts of equity, not unlike other companies that have to fund programs in this way.

In Kentucky, I think when we get down into the 9% kind of ROE levels, that would historically have and how we think about it trigger the need for filings there. Now we do have a committed stay out from the change of control filing that we cannot file until '12 for new rates to be effective earlier than 1113.

I think probably the most significant thing is and the reason why you don't see with a very large CapEx program a bigger increase in rev over the five-year horizon is that the current regulatory depreciation rate, which ends up in revenue in the U.K., is 20 years, and that's likely to be extended to 40 years. In addition, the regulatory review period, and we'll get our first opportunity to see this upcoming in the gas cycle here is expected to be extended from five years to eight years. So this kind of formula rate treatment and the predictability and forecastability should go out over a longer period of time to be determined what happens in the intervening years, though, because eight years is a long period to commit to a capital structure as to what they will permit or what they will do with the cap structure, meaning interest rate, assumed interest rates in your model cap structure over that eight year period of time. I think there's more to come on that.

We've got a lot to cover today, so we'll jump right into it. Today, we plan to discuss our 2010 results and our 2011 earnings forecast as well as provide you a more in-depth discussion of the strength of our platform that we feel is well-positioned, I should say, to grow shareowner value over the next few years. 
Obviously, the past few years have been very challenging for our sector, especially those with significant competitive generation. At PPL, we've used this period as an opportunity to strengthen our business mix and focus capital on the rate-regulated sector of our industry. As a result, we've reduced our earnings risk profile and retained the upside inherent to our Supply business when wholesale electricity markets recover from our current down cycle. We already see proof that the steps we've taken over the past few years have significantly strengthened our company while improving our flexibility to thrive in a variety of market scenarios. This morning, we'll provide you with our normal year-end update and also discuss our 2011 earnings forecast.
Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide you with a detailed operational overview; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial details with you. And of course, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. 
Before launching into the discussion, however, I'd like to talk briefly about some recent M&A trade press rumors mentioning PPL. You're all aware it's our long-standing and appropriate policy not to discuss market rumors or speculation, and we won't deviate from that today. As we've said many times before, the company continuously explores opportunities to enhance value whether it be acquisitions, divestitures, improved operations of our existing businesses. There's something to discuss in regards to one of those potential opportunities, we do it when the time is appropriate. So until that time comes, we'll not respond to questions on that matter today. 
Now let's move on to the earnings announcement we've made this morning. Driven by a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with reported earnings of $2.17 per share and ongoing earnings of $3.13 per share. These results are higher than our most recent forecast range, even excluding the $0.12 share contribution from the Kentucky operations, which were not included in our prior forecast. 
Considering the continued headwinds of very low wholesale electricity prices driven by low natural gas prices, we're very pleased with our 2010 results. Fully factoring in dilution from the E.ON U.S. acquisition, our 2010 earnings from ongoing operations are 60% higher than our 2009 results. While the combination of our very beneficial hedging profile and depressed energy and capacity prices results in a lower earnings-per-share forecast for 2011 than we achieved in 2010, we expect strong growth in our utility segments in the future.
This earnings growth is based on immediate infrastructure improvements in these companies, which will result in significant rate base growth over the next several years. We expect compound annual growth rate or rate base growth of our combined regulated businesses to be approximately 9.5% from 2011 to 2015. We're confident in our ability to earn reasonable returns on this rate base because these utilities are best-in-class performers, and they operate in jurisdictions with highly constructive regulatory frameworks. Also, it's important not to overlook the superb competitive generation assets that we have in the mid-Atlantic region and in Montana. While margins have fallen because of lower natural gas and capacity pricing, our units continue to be among the most competitive in the PJM Interconnection.
This position has been enhanced by the significant environmental investments that have already been made in our coal units and the investments to expand capacity in our nuclear and hydro units. Our diverse mix of coal, natural-gas-fired hydro and nuclear generation in this region means that we are well-positioned to benefit from proposed EPA regulations.
In Montana, our balanced portfolio of coal-fired and hydroelectric generation puts us in a very good competitive position. As I alluded to earlier, we're confident that prices will eventually rebound, and we do begin to see some industrial growth throughout our territories. When they do, our shareowners will benefit significantly. Our strategic actions for the past year have strengthened our financial position, increasing the proportionate size of our regulated business and lowering our exposure to commodity market volatility. 
Today, we're announcing that our earnings forecast for 2011 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and Paul will walk you through the major year-on-year drivers in his prepared remarks. Within the forecast, I'd like to highlight that we're projecting 50% of our 2011 earnings will come from our regulated businesses, a substantial increase over 2010. We've also tightened our range compared with previous earnings forecasts, reflecting a higher mix of rate-regulated businesses and my confidence in PPL's ability to execute on our business plan.
Beyond the excellent assets that we have in place to grow shareowner value, we also have some significant strengths that differentiate us from our peers in the sector. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we have strong regulatory relationships built on foundations of transparency and meeting the commitments we make. We respect and value the role the regulators play in ensuring highly reliable electricity and gas services at reasonable prices while providing a fair return to shareowners. Our communicative, cooperative approach has led us to a mutual respect among PPL reps and regulators, a respect that makes us a credible voice in the policy-making process. Our regulated companies are among the best in terms of cost competitiveness, reliability and customer service, earning very high customer satisfaction and regulatory recognition.
We intend to retain that distinction by making necessary and prudent investments that will maintain our strong reliability in customer service. In the U.K., for example, we're recognized as an efficiency and customer service leader, benchmarks by which others are judged. This commitment to operational excellence also incorporates disciplined cost management practices to ensure that we're getting the most out of the money we spend.
At the heart of our success are 14,000 highly trained, dedicated employees in our business. We rely on these experts to deliver on the promises that we make to our customers and shareowners. Finally, we're clearly remain committed to a strong dividend, which we view as a key element of total shareowner return. Our acquisition this past year fortified our dividend and the rate base growth potential that Bill will discuss in a minute. I think this clearly puts us in a much stronger position to grow the dividend in the future. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for a business and operational review."
185508,117935595,99671,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to review four of our key business segments, with a focus on the value drivers for each one. I believe you'll see that PPL has a compelling growth story in each of our regulated businesses, and we",2881,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to review four of our key business segments, with a focus on the value drivers for each one. I believe you'll see that PPL has a compelling growth story in each of our regulated businesses, and we have a highly competitive generation fleet that is very well-positioned. Jim mentioned that our regulated growth and rate base is now estimated at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% over the next five years. That's a full 2% higher than we had previously forecast. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and start with an overview of LG&E and KU, which forms our largest regulated business segment. Going forward, we will refer to this segment as the Kentucky-regulated segment. The segment consists of two vertically integrated utilities. LG&E is a gas and electric utility, while KU is electric-only. Our regulated generation fleet has a capacity of about 8,100 megawatts with the recent addition of the Trimble County 2 coal plant. LG&E and KU commissioned this 800-megawatt plant in January at a cost of just over $1,500 per kW. This is an exceptionally low cost for a state-of-the-art facility like this.
Like our other regulated operations, LG&E and KU have a history of outstanding customer satisfaction and efficient, reliable and safe operations. Vic Staffieri and his team have earned the trust and respect of regulators where they have constructive and supportive working relationships. The combination of efficient and effective operations and this constructive regulatory environment have resulted in these utilities having some of the lowest rates in the nation. These rates are a significant economic development tool for our service territories as well. The growth prospects driven by this economic development coupled with pending changes in EPA environmental regulations will lead to further growth in rate base and returns on that investment. 
As noted on Slide 10, the Kentucky environmental cost recovery mechanism, or ECR, is provided by a statute enacted in Kentucky in 1992. It allows for near real-time recovery of costs associated with environmental compliance for coal-fired generation. Currently, about 85% of the applicable environmental costs, including investment and operating costs, are being recovered through the ECR. Since inception, over $2.9 billion of environmental capital spending, including CWIP, has been recovered through the ECR mechanism. The remaining 15% of environmental costs represent the cost associated or allocated to all system sales, sales to Virginia retail customers and sales to Kentucky municipal utility, served by KU under FERC-approved, full requirements contracts. These remaining costs are recoverable through general rate cases. 
As you know, increased regulations being issued and proposed by the EPA are expected to impact coal-fired generation. We expect the majority of our compliance costs in Kentucky will be recovered through the ECR mechanism. Dependent upon final EPA regulations and our evaluation of the lease cost options, we believe the various compliance costs for air and coal combustion residuals, CCRs, could be more than $2 billion over the next five years. This estimate does not assume a hazardous definition for CCR, nor does it include any incremental costs associated with CO2 compliance or new water-quality standards. Our estimate will continue to be refined as regulation and lease cost compliance analyses are finalized.
Slide 11 summarizes the environmental control equipment already installed on our coal plants in Kentucky. As you can see, significant environmental controls are already installed at these plants. But we do expect additional investment will be needed to comply with the evolving environmental regulations. LG&E and KU's rate base has grown by more than 50% over the past five years with the construction of Trimble Country 2 and the installation of scrubbers at KU's Brown and Ghent plants. As you can see from this slide, we expect a similar increase over the next five years.
We show environmental CapEx in two categories. We expect the spending designated by the orange bar to be needed regardless of the outcome of the new EPA regulations. The green bar represents the $2 billion estimated to comply with new and proposed EPA regulations, as I mentioned earlier. Since the majority of the environmental CapEx should be recovered through the ECR mechanism, the remainder of the environmental and non-environmental CapEx and O&M growth will drive the need for future rate cases.
As agreed in the Kentucky change of control proceeding, new base rates cannot be effective prior to January 1, 2013. We are able to offset regulatory lag to a degree using mechanisms that supplement traditional rate cases, and we believe our rates will remain competitive in light of similar activity at surrounding utilities and our favorable starting position. PPL continues to be very pleased with the addition of the newly acquired Kentucky operations. The rate base growth potential, transparent regulatory construct and economic prospects in the Kentucky region will provide earnings growth for this business well into the future.
Before turning to WPD, I'd like to comment briefly on the integration process. A significant amount of upfront work went into ensuring a smooth transition upon closing. Our day-one integration work went extremely well, and we will continue to pursue ways to operate the combined business in an efficient manner and within our regulatory commitments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for a review of WPD.  Our WPD business is regulated by the U.K. Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, or Ofgem. The U.K. enjoys a fully developed mature electricity market. The regulatory framework is well established and provides a favorable, efficient system where WPD has thrived for many years. Ofgem has approved a $2 billion expenditure program and the current five-year distribution price control review period, DPCR5, to fund maintenance, capital improvements and upgrades to WPD's network. This approved network investment is 31% higher than that provided in the last price control period.
A key element of the regulation is the multiyear formula-rate nature of revenue determination. There is no regulatory lag in expenditures over the entire price control period. They are fully factored into the determination of WPD's revenues during this regulatory cycle. Another key feature of the regulatory construct is the incentive nature of the scheme, whereby companies that are frontier performers can outperform peers on a revenue and ROE basis. Beyond the base revenues, each distribution network operator has the opportunity to earn incentive revenues related to performance and customer service, reliability and cost efficiencies, areas in which WPD has excelled.
We expect that our regulated asset value will increase from $2.8 billion at the end of 2010 to almost $3.5 billion by 2015, driven by the network investments I just mentioned. A key component of last year's price control review was recognition of WPD's readership in the area of operational performance. As shown here, we led the industry with the lowest number of customer complaints, best contact center performance, best capital unit cost and customer reliability. In fact, the degree to which WPD excelled in these areas led the U.K. regulator to increase WPD's revenues by over $240 million in this and future rate periods. This type of best-in-class service is nothing new to WPD. During the last price control review, WPD was awarded over $100 million in incentive revenues.
And finally for international, at the November EEI Conference, we committed to provide modeling parameters for WPD when we announced 2011 guidance. As a basis for helping model the U.K. operations, we thought that using the segment P&L format, already available to you in our published financial statements, would be the best option. So let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 6.9% per year plus inflation for the balance of the price control review period. 
Most of our operating costs increased with inflation, although depreciation expense increases at a higher rate due to the increased levels of CapEx. Pension expense is expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 55 million in 2012 and beyond, primarily due to projected amortization of prior actuarial losses. For calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed, except for about 20% that is inflation-linked. And over the longer term, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 25%. With these factors and applying the foreign currency rate, you should be able to more accurately model the inherent growth in WPD's future earnings contribution. 
In summary, the goal for the international segment is to continue to add value for shareholders to frontier performance and customer service and business efficiency, achieving significant growth in rate base and being a source of growing earnings and cash flow for PPL. 
Now let's move on to our Pennsylvania-regulated segments, starting on Slide 19. Like our Kentucky and WPD operations, PPL Electric Utilities is also known for its superior customer service and well-established, constructive regulatory relationships in Pennsylvania. We have very visible investment opportunities, with rate base growth projected to rise from $3 billion to $4.8 billion, a 60% increase over the next five years. In fact, we expect to make sustained investments over the next 10 years to replace aging infrastructure largely built in the 1960s and 1970s, a good portion of which is now starting to reach the end of its useful life. 
On the Transmission side of our business, our projected CapEx investment of $1.9 billion through 2015 is nearly 5x higher than the prior five years. As you know, our Transmission business operates under an attractive formula rate structure with annual true-ups effective June 1 of each year, capturing rate base additions and O&M escalations on a very timely basis. The majority of EU's increased transmission spending is recoverable under the FERC formula rate structure, and there are added incentives for our Susquehanna-Roseland line. On the distribution side of our business, we're forecasting $1.5 billion of new investment, resulting from a combination of aging infrastructure, smart grid technology and more traditional CapEx.
Distribution costs are currently recovered through a base-rate filing. As we have noted in the past, we are interested in pursuing alternative rate mechanisms that would provide for more timely recovery of and on the capital deploy. Absent this, we anticipate filing rate cases in 2012 and 2014 to recover the increasing expenditures needed to maintain customer reliability and improve network efficiency. EU's CapEx profile on Slide 20 provides further information on those upcoming investments. 
We plan to increase our capital spending over the next two years before we hit an expected sustained level of capital investment, excluding the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line. As illustrated here and shown in light green, transmission is a predominant driver of our CapEx growth. The $1.9 billion in investment from 2011 to 2015 consists of $800 million in aging infrastructure replacements, $700 million for capacity and other projects, and the remaining $440 million is associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland line. 
Regarding Susquehanna-Roseland, the environmental review of the project by the National Park Service is ongoing, after which, we expect construction to resume in 2013 and 2014, with the project in service early 2015. The need for this project has been reaffirmed several times by PJM, and we expect the need for the project will continue to be reaffirmed. We do not expect the recent legislation in New Jersey and associated generation projects to eliminate the need for this line.
In summary, our capital investment opportunities  and distribution translate into an annualized rate base growth of 10%. Over the same period, transmission rate base growth is just over 20%, from 28% to 40% of total rate base, increasing the proportion of our earnings driven by the transmission formula rate structure. 
Let's move on to Slide 22 and take a closer look at our competitive Supply segment. We've discussed this segment and its investment highlights with you in great detail in the past, and today I'll provide a brief update. Importantly, we want to highlight our ability to control spending and optimize our operations during low commodity cycles and our ability to meet and benefit from evolving EPA regulations. 
Slide 23 details the environmental control equipment we've already installed on our fleet and the control equipment under consideration. Approximately 40% of annual output from the fleet is carbon-free, nuclear and hydro.  While approximately 50% of our output is coal-fired, the majority of our coal plants are large supercritical plants that are well controlled from an environmental perspective and highly efficient. Our proactive approach to environmental compliance positions the PPL fleet favorably for future EPA regulation. 96% of the competitive coal generation is scrub, 88% has NOx controls already installed. 
Since 2005, PPL has invested $1.6 billion in environmental control equipment, positioning us very well to meet many of the proposed EPA regulations. The additional control equipment that is under consideration can be installed at an expected cost of just $350 million to $400 million. 
At this low point in the commodity cycle, we are clearly focused on controlling our cost. We did reduce our 2010 capital spending by nearly $100 million compared to our original plan, and we've reduced our five-year plan by nearly $500 million. We're also focused on managing operating costs. We cut $30 million out of our operating budgets in both '10 and '11 despite the addition of new environmental control equipment and compliance with new security and work-hour regulations at our nuclear station. 
We have been operating our coal units at minimum output levels during certain off-peak hours and are working to achieve even lower minimum levels. In order to reduce fuel costs, we continue to analyze the types of fuel we're burning at each of our units. For example, we're continuing to prepare several units to burn Powder River Basin coal as well as Illinois Basin. And we look to burn off-spec coal during off-peak periods as another means to reduce costs.
We've maintained our disciplined three-year hedging program, which has captured significant value for shareholders. The hedging program added $700 million to our margins in 2010, and our hedges for '11 and '12 are in the money by $1.4 billion. While we're unable to completely eliminate volatility in this business, our hedging strategy has significantly reduced a substantial portion of that volatility. On this slide, we're preparing our asset hedge positions for 2011 and 2012. There are a few notable changes to this slide I'd like to point out from previous quarters. We've eliminated the base load fully loaded hedge price and instead provided the annual capacity revenue separately at the bottom of the slide. This provides more visibility on our expected PJM capacity revenues. 
As we discussed previously, given current market conditions and transmission work in the region, our forecast for 2011 does not include a basis premium over PJM West Hub for our units. We are also giving you a range for delivered coal prices in the East and now provide you with a range of our expected coal price in the West as well. As for 2013, we continue to be very lightly hedged, with less than 10% of our PJM generation under contract. We do, however, have about 80% of our coal under contract for 2013. When we enter into a more meaningful level of energy hedges for 2013, we'll provide you an update.
In 2010, we began to see signs of economic recovery and annual net energy requirements within PJM increase nearly 3% from 2009. This is roughly equivalent to the output of a 2,200-megawatt nuclear plant. PJM forecasts a similar level of increased demand over the next few years. At the same time, low current forward prices and the uncertainty that New Jersey and Maryland are adding to future capacity prices, there is little incentive to add new generation. We anticipate that the return of demand will drive forward market prices higher, as will the impact of the EPA's proposed regulations affecting the supply side of the equation. 
Our internal modeling estimates that approximately 12 gigawatts of generation could be retired within PJM by 2019. This assumes all uncontrolled units less than 200 megawatts are retired along with some inefficient uncontrolled units greater than 200 megawatts. Analyses by the Brattle Group, Credit Suisse and others have made similar assumptions and project retirements somewhat higher than our own analysis. The impact of those retirements should improve energy and capacity prices over the longer term.
Now before turning the call over to Paul, I'd like to conclude with the following. The new PPL, with the addition of the Kentucky-regulated segment, has a very strong group of regulated businesses. These utilities will provide a significant platform of growth for our regulated earnings well into the future. The leaders of these businesses clearly understand the importance of continuing our tradition of working with regulators to ensure reliable service while providing shareowners with solid returns. 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% in rate base. Over the next five years, PPL will be investing more than $11 billion in our delivery businesses in the U.S. and the U.K. Importantly, of this $11 billion, we expect 55%, or $6.4 billion, will be recoverable using the near-real-time mechanisms in the U.K., Kentucky and under our FERC formula rates. We believe this clearly differentiates PPL from others in our sector.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."
185508,117935595,99671,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 28 to review our financial results for 2010. Our earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter and year reflect the earnings contribution of our Kentucky-regulated segment due to the successful",1275,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 28 to review our financial results for 2010. Our earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter and year reflect the earnings contribution of our Kentucky-regulated segment due to the successful close of the transaction on November 1. 
For the full year 2010, we earned $3.13 per share, exceeding the $2.87 per share midpoint of our 2010 forecast of earnings per share from ongoing operations. The two largest contributors of our outperformance versus forecast for the quarter were the operating earnings from Kentucky of $0.12 per share and several tax items that net benefited the quarter by just about $0.12 per share. On a segment basis, we fully allocated dilution from the equity units, which was incorporated into our forecast, resulting in a $0.07-per-share net contribution from Kentucky for the quarter.
The tax items that net benefited the quarter included a positive impact from evaluation adjustment for Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards and the negative impact of bonus depreciation that decreased our Section 199 deduction, both of which impacted supply, as well as the negative tax impact of the tax restructuring that took place in international. 
I'll review the segment earnings drivers for 2010 and then discuss our earnings forecast for 2011. Turning to Slide 29. Our international regulated segment earned $0.53 per share in 2010, a $0.19-per-share decrease from 2009. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1, 2010 under DPCR5; higher pension expense; higher interest expense, primarily due to the GBP-400-million debt issuance in March of 2010; and higher interest expense on WPD's inflation index bonds on the back of higher inflation later in the year; the favorable impact of currency exchange rates; higher income taxes; and dilution of $0.07 per share. 
Moving to Slide 30. Our Pennsylvania-regulated segment earned $0.27 per share in 2010, an $0.08 decline compared to 2009. This decrease was the net result of higher O&M expenses primarily due to expanded vegetation management activities and higher staffing costs, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances, higher depreciation and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Supply. The Supply segment earned $2.27 per share in 2010, an increase of $1.39 per share compared to last year, driven by significantly higher realized sales prices for our Eastern baseload generation, lower margins on load-following agreements due to customer migration and the economic downturn and higher average fuel costs and higher energy margins in the West, primarily due to higher net sales prices partially offset by lower sales volumes.
2010 was also impacted by higher O&M, primarily at our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the Unit 1 forced outage in the third quarter; higher refueling outage costs and higher payroll costs; higher depreciation driven by the Brunner Island scrubbers that were placed in service in 2009; lower income taxes, primarily due to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances related to the PA net operating loss carryforwards I just mentioned; and the impact of investment tax credits for the Holtwood and Rainbow hydro expansion projects; discontinued operations, which includes operating results of the Long Island generation and the Maine hydros; and the pending sale of UPark, Wallingford and PPL's equity interest in Safe Harbor; as well as dilution of $0.33 per share. 
Turning to Slide 32. As Jim already mentioned, we are announcing our 2011 earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with a midpoint of $2.50 per share. This slide provides an overview of the key factors expected to impact 2011 earnings. A significant earnings driver between 2010 and 2011 is dilution of $0.34 per share, reflecting a full year's impact of the 103 million shares of common equity issued in June 2010 to finance the Kentucky acquisition. The full year addition of our Kentucky-regulated business is the largest positive driver of 2011 earnings, followed by increased delivery margins in our Pennsylvania-regulated segment, resulting from PPL Electrics' already approved distribution rate increase that became effective January 1 of this year. 
Offsetting these positive earnings drivers are lower supply margins, which are the net results of lower electricity prices, including lower basis and capacity prices in the East and higher fuel costs in the East and West. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors are higher expected generation and higher margins on load-following agreements. We expect higher O&M at our Supply segment, primarily due to increased outage costs at our fossil plants in the East and West, higher income taxes primarily in the Supply segment due to the 2010 release of the deferred tax valuation allowances and a lower Section 199 benefit, lower earnings as a result of the 2010 sale of non-core generating assets, higher depreciation in our supply in Pennsylvania-regulated segments and higher financing costs due to higher commitment fees and higher debt levels, including a full year of interest on the equity units that we issued in June. In addition, when excluding the impact of dilution, which we've captured as a single driver on this slide, we expect flat earnings in our international-regulated segment driven by higher delivery revenue and a more favorable currency exchange rate offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs.  
On Slide 33, we've detailed our 2010 free cash flow from operations before dividends. The 2010 free cash flow before dividends includes the operating results of the Kentucky-regulated segment but not the cash used in the acquisition of these assets. Since last quarter, the most significant change in the 2010 free cash flow before dividends is the expected timing of the proceeds from the pending sale of Wallingford, UPark and our interest in Safe Harbor. We now expect to close that transaction and receive the proceeds in 2011. The change in cash from operations for 2010 is the net result of the return of third-party collateral, an increase in unbilled revenue and the impact of bonus tax depreciation. 
In addition to adding asset sale proceeds to 2011, the 2011 free cash flow before dividend is driven by higher expected cash from operations, primarily due to a full year impact of the Kentucky operating results; the cash benefit of bonus tax depreciation and an expected income tax refund in 2011, which are expected to be partially offset by large pension contributions, both domestically and international; and the further return of collateral to third parties. This positive cash from operations is expected to be partially offset by large capital expenditure programs in all segments.
Turning to Slide 34. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue  to focus on our dividend as a key element of total shareowner return. Our significantly more rate-regulated business mix provides strong support for the current dividend and for future dividend growth. As depicted on this chart, our regulated earnings alone nearly cover the current dividend. As our regulated earnings grow, we would expect to be able to enhance this dividend growth profile. 
Now moving to Slide 35. We're looking forward to 2012 and 2013. We expect higher domestic rate-regulated earnings due to higher rate basis directly tied to large capital expenditure programs and assumptions related to planned base rate filings during this period; increasing distribution revenue at WPD except during the 2009 DPCR5 process; lower supply margins as a result of depressed energy prices and our hedge profile; higher O&M in all business segments; positive fundamentals affecting the Supply segment that Bill previously discussed, including heat rate expansion; and increased load as the economy begins to recover. 
And with that, this concludes the prepared remarks for this morning. So I'll turn the call back to Jim for Q&A."

But we see somewhere around $700 million between the September 9, 2010 implementation and the end of 2012 when in sunsets around $700 million in total cash benefit during that period versus what things would have looked like without the bonus depreciation. Now in a full year like 2011, yes, it's nice that it's FFO. It helps credit metrics. It's cash. We likely will push out the need for equity at least to the very back end of the year. The net impact, though, on earnings is still a negative since we were in a position where we should have gotten around $0.05 to $0.06 of Section 199 benefit. The manufacturers' deduction that affects both the Kentucky and Pennsylvania-based competitive generation, Montana generation. So all in all, it's a net negative from an earnings perspective, slightly, including the impact of pushing back equity financing needs. However, it does provide significant cash surplus or cash benefit."

And so I tend to think that much of the intent of the regulations will become evident through this calendar year, either by laying them out in great clarity or enough information on the table to know that they will happen. So I think our view has been looking at our fleets and our level of economic spend that we've already accomplished on our generating fleets. We stand to be in a very good position going forward in that we've already spent the money and spent it at the right time. We, in fact, will benefit from additional small coal-unit shutdowns, as I think Bill mentioned, our supercritical fleet here and then out West and Kentucky. Obviously, that will be recovered under the ECR. But in our merchant markets in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, we're positioned very well for the EPA regs as we see them unfolding.

What we were trying to indicate on the dividend slide is showing that, and combining this response with how I responded to Jonathan's question, we'll very clearly be able to more than sufficiently to cover the dividend with the regulated earnings. I think it depends upon where we see mid-cycle gas prices driving power, which drives margins, and maintaining our three-year hedge profile. I think it's difficult until we get up into that 75%-ish range that I'd I feel comfortable talking about payout ratios, and as well, getting through the last part of our generation build around the Susquehanna operates, the Holtwood and Rainbow construction projects and get into more of a normalized level of maintenance CapEx spend as well."

Again, if the regulated utilities are kind of fully paying for the dividend, and the generation business is using its surplus cash flow to fund some small capital expansion projects, we've got to be able to fund that CapEx growth at the utilities in some way, and it would be through a balance of debt and equity. I think that it would be reasonable amounts of equity, not unlike other companies that have to fund programs in this way. And again, what I'd say is the biggest driver there is maintaining the investment-grade credit rating in those businesses but as well as Supply. So that's really what drives the timing and amounts.

So what we're really talking about, what's left, if you will, is Pennsylvania distribution and then the Kentucky assets that that's not recovered in the ECR in Kentucky.

In Kentucky, I think when we get down into the 9% kind of ROE levels, that would historically have, in how we think about it, triggered the need for filings there. Now we do have a committed stay-out from the change of control filing that we cannot file until '12 for new rates to be effective earlier than 1/1/13.

I think probably the most significant thing is, and the reason why you don't see with a very large CapEx program a bigger increase in rev over the five-year horizon is that the current regulatory depreciation rate, which ends up in revenue in the U.K., is 20 years, and that's likely to be extended to 40 years. In addition, the regulatory review period, and we'll get our first opportunity to see this upcoming in the gas cycle here, is expected to be extended from five years to eight years. So this kind of formula rate treatment and the predictability and forecastability should go out over a longer period of time, to be determined what happens in the intervening years, though, because eight years is a long period to commit to a capital structure as to what they will permit or what they will do with the cap structure, meaning interest rates, assumed interest rates in your model cap structure over that eight-year period of time. I think there's more to come on that. They've issued kind of, if you will, position papers early, thought papers around that in early last year and late last year, but I think we'll get our first real opportunity once the gas distribution folks go through the process, and then they'll be expanded to us."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We'll follow our normal practices this morning. I will provide a general business outlook and commentary on our first quarter results and then Paul Farr, our CFO, will provide a little more detail on the financial review. And then Bill Spencer, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide you with an operational overview. 
As always, we look forward to going through some Q&A when we finish our prepared remarks. Today, we announced a reported earnings of $0.82 per share, up from $0.66 a year ago and ongoing earnings of $0.84 per share versus $0.94 a year ago. On a straight net income basis, which excludes the impact to the equity issuance to fund that Kentucky acquisition, reported earnings rose 60%. On an ongoing basis, net income rose 14%. 
The earnings improvement was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky Regulated segment and a PPL Electric Utilities distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. These improvements were partially offset by expected lower energy margins in our Supply segment as higher-priced hedges continue to roll off. 
In the first quarter, we also announced and subsequently closed a significant immediate accretive expansion of our Electricity Delivery business in the United Kingdom. By mid-April, we completed key elements for the permanent financing plan for this acquisition, including the equity portion of the financing and the U.K. holding company debt issuance. Most of the proceeds from these issuances were used to repay a significant portion of the bridge facility that we generally want to close on the acquisition. Based on the successful equity issuance, Standard & Poor's took PPL and its grade of its subsidiaries of a negative outlook. We took the final piece of the permanent financing, the operating company debt issuances will occur next week, enabling final repayment of the bridge facility. 
On the integration front for WPD Midlands, all activities are proceeding fully according to plan. We remain on target to achieve our 2011 ongoing earnings forecast, which you remember we increased last month to reflect the expected accretion from this U.K. acquisition. We're forecasting ongoing earnings per share $2.50 to $2.75 for this year. 
Based on the successful acquisitions and permanent financings of our new operations in Kentucky and in the U.K., we've accomplished our strategic objective of achieving a much heavier weighting of rate regulated earnings and cash flow in our business. And significant regulated infrastructure investment should lead to sustained growth in each of our regular the businesses for years to come. Based on immediate infrastructure spending in Pennsylvania and the U.K., coupled with updated assessment of Kentucky environmental compliance investments, we now expect our regulated asset base to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 9% over the next 5 years. And more than 2/3 of our planned CapEx spending in these regulated businesses will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near-realtime recovery of and on those expenditures. So this should give PPL a more predictable and transparent earnings profile going forward. 
Based on projected rate base growth, our expectations regarding earned or lease in the timing of general rate cases, we anticipate that by 2013, a significant majority of our earnings and cash flow will come from our regulated businesses. We've accomplished this derisking in the PPL without giving up the significant upside potential of our competitive generation business, and we remain confident that competitive wholesale capacity and counter prices will eventually rebound. And when they do, we believe our shareholders will benefit significantly. 
This has clearly been a transformational and successful year for PPL. We've migrated from a company with more than 60% of EBITDA dependent on commodity markets to one that will by 2013, derive only 25% of its expected EBITDA from that business. We issued a significant amount of equity and equity units to fund these acquisitions and the response by investors has been very strong. 
We're fully committed to delivering the results we've projected into earning appropriate returns in our regulated businesses. A particularly strong response to the most recent equity offering and the performance of our stock price since that offering make it clear to us that investors like the transformed PPL and that indeed we can deliver. And I'm confident that the we'll do exactly that. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul for comments on some of the financial results. Paul?"

Let's move to Slide 6 to review our first quarter financial results.

Let's move to Slide 6 to review our first quarter financial results. PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are higher than last year driven by earnings from the Kentucky segment and the impact of the distribution rate increase at PPL Electric Utilities, partially offset by expected lower margins of the Supply segment. Per share earnings from our ongoing operations are lower due to dilution of $0.23 per share, driven by the 2010 common stock issuance to fund the Kentucky acquisition. 
I'd like to highlight that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of LKE each, interest expense associated with the equity to use and finance that acquisition and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Let's move to the International segment earnings driver on Slide 7. Our International segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 decrease from last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices and more favorable customer mix, higher interest expense resulting from the GBP 400 million debt issuance in March of last year, higher income taxes and $0.04 of dilution. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2011, a $0.01 increase over last year. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins primarily due to new distribution base rates that went into effect on January 1 and favorable weather. Higher O&M expenses primarily due to higher plan spending and higher storm response cost, lower income taxes as a result of the state income tax benefit of bonus depreciation and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Supply. This segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.22 per share compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower energy margins resulting from lower hedge prices in the east and dilution of $0.12 per share. 
Turning to Slide 10. We reaffirmed our forecast of $2.50 to $2.75 per share in earnings from ongoing operations. This slide walks you from 2010 actual to forecast 2011, updating the key factors driving the change. We've changed the format of the slide to provide the factors that drive each segment's earnings between 2010 and the midpoint of our 2011 forecast, excluding the impact of dilution, which is broken out separately. 
The increase in the Kentucky regulated segment reflects the full year of its earnings results and a full year of interest expense associated with the equity units issued in June 2010 to finance that acquisition. The $0.57 increase in the International Regulated segment earnings reflects a partially year of earnings from WPD Midlands and interest expense associated with the equity unit issued in April to finance that acquisition. We expect an increase in earnings from that legacy U.K. business, primarily due to higher delivery revenue and a more favorable currency exchange rate, partially offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. 
The intent increase from the Pennsylvania regulated segment is primarily due to the distribution rate increase that went into effect on January. We expect that the Supply segment to deliver earnings from ongoing operations that are $0.87 per share lower than 2010. This decrease is primarily driven by $0.51 of lower energy margins, including an estimated $20 million to $30 million after tax impact to turbine and repair turbine blades at Susquehanna. will discuss the Susquehanna outage extension in more detail in his remarks. 
Also impacting margins are lower electricity prices, lower basis and lower capacity prices in the east and higher delivered fuel cost in the east and west. We also expect higher income taxes primarily due to the 2010 release of Pennsylvania deferred tax valuation allowances at a lower Section 199 benefit. Higher O&M due to increased outage costs at our fossil plants in the east and west, and finally, $0.75 per share of dilution will result from the shares issued to fund both acquisitions. 
On Slide 11, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow from operations before dividends. The change in cash from operations for 2011 since the year end earnings call is driven by a partial year of earnings from WPD Midlands, offset by acquisition-related expenses, the return of collateral to third parties and the lower-than-expected income tax refunds. The change in free cash flow before dividends is also impacted by projected capital expenditures of WPD Midlands and the remarketing of control bonds in Kentucky. 
Turning to Slide 12. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on our dividend as the key elements of our total shareholder return. Our significantly more rate regulated business platform provides strong support for our current dividend, as well as our future dividend growth. This chart shows the improvement in earnings contribution of our regulated businesses that's a result of the recent acquisitions. Projected ongoing earnings per share from our regulated businesses has now more than cover our current dividend and the Midlands acquisition, clearly, permits dividend more flexibility in the future. 
With that I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on our operations"
185508,130947201,122718,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone.

Let's turn to Slide 13 and start with an operational review of the first quarter. 
Overall, we had a very good quarter in all of our business segments but let me start by first addressing the nuclear outage. At our Susquehanna know for a plant nuclear plant, we are currently in a scheduled outstanding on Unit #2 and have discovered defective pressure turbine blades during a plant inspection. Replacement of these blades was not anticipated as part of our original scope, this will extend the unit to outage by an estimated 4 to 6 weeks to ensure safe, reliable operations for the upcoming cycle. 
As a precaution, we will also bring Susquehanna Unit 1 offline in the coming weeks to do a similar turbine blade inspection. However, given the strong first quarter performance of the Supply segment and based on our preliminary expectations on the length of these outages, we believe that our Supply earnings for 2011 will still be achieved. 
Moving to our Kentucky regulated segment, LG&E and KU filed their integrated resource plan or IRT with the Kentucky PSC last week. This plan is provided for the PSC every 3 years and is intended to give the commission, at a point of time where we meet our expectations for resource needs into the future. It does not represent a commitment or a decision by the company nor does it represent a request for approval. The key takeaways from the IRP, are: one, an average annual growth of about 1.5%; 500 megawatts of demand side management capability; the closing of 3 older coal plants with the combined capacity of approximately 800 megawatts due to proposed environmental regulations; and new generation in the form of combined cycle gas units. 
Our current capital projections are consistent with the IRP. However, prior to moving forward on any resource, we have to make additional regulatory filings with the Kentucky Commission. Our revised capital expenditure forecast for LG&E and KU also reflects our projected spending on environmental control equipment to meet the most recent proposed EPA rules. We have informed the Kentucky PSC of our intent to file a new environmental cost for recovery or ECR plan to address proposed regulations. An ECR filing is expected to be made in the second quarter. 
Finally, KU filed a rate case in Virginia on April 1, requesting a $9.3 million annual revenue increase based on 2010 results and return on equity of 11%. The drivers of the, are incremental capital investments and recovery of storm-related costs. If approved, the increase will take effect at the beginning of 2012. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. PPL Electric Utilities won its ninth J.D. Power and Associates award for Customer Satisfaction by business customers. This is PPL Electric Utilities 17th J.D. Power award, which is more than any other power utility in the country. The employees of PPL Electric Utilities, just as our employees in Kentucky and the United Kingdom, take pride in providing the highest level of customer service and we congratulate them on a job well done. 
Finally, in our International Regulated segment, as you know, we completed the acquisition of the Midlands operation. And as Jim said, the integration process is moving ahead as planned. 
Let's move to Slide 14 and take a look at sales volumes in Kentucky. Residential and commercial volumes were down from the quarter due principally to mild weather, while industrial volumes increased, reflecting continued economic recovery in the service territory. Volumes for the trailing 12 month period were up across the board, reflecting both economic growth recovery and weather effects. 
LG&E and KU had the hottest summer in the past 20 years in 2010 followed by one of the coldest Decembers. The modeled weather-normalized volume reductions in the residential and commercial classes reflect energy efficiency measures which have not yet been offset by customer growth. 
For 2011, we're projecting load growth of approximately 1.2% on a weather-normalized basis. However, given extreme weather in 2010, we're forecasting an actual load decline of 2.4% compared with last year. 
Moving to Slide 15. We provide details on sales volume brands for PPL utilities. Our PA utility has experienced slight growth in industrial sales for the first quarter and trailing 12 months. This industrial demand reflects the gradual economic recovery that we are seeing in the service territory but it still remains below levels prior to the recession. Residential sales are higher on an actual business, reflecting higher weather-related sales compared to the prior period. But on the weather adjusted basis, we've experienced a decline in sales. The weather-adjusted decline in residential sales is primarily driven by higher energy prices, increased energy efficiency, energy conservation and a slow housing market.  For 2011, we project overall load growth of less than 1% with higher industrial and commercial sales partially offset by continued lower residential sales. 
On Slide 16, we provide our usual detail on the Supply segment hedges. The big float hedge levels and prices for 2011 are essentially the same as our fourth quarter disclosure. During this last quarter, we layered on additional power hedges in the east for 2012. Our average hedged price for 2012 has declined somewhat as the recent transactions have been completed and energy prices are lower than previous hedges. Since these hedges were put on at prices near the levels we saw at year end, our internal projections for 2012 total gross margins have not changed materially since the mark of the end of the first quarter 2010. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jim, and we look forward to your questions."

I'll provide a general business update and commentary on the first quarter results, and then Paul Farr, our CFO, will provide a little more detail on the financial review. And then Bill Spencer, Chief Operating Officer, will provide you with an operational overview. As always, we look forward to going through some Q&A when we finish our prepared remarks. 
Today, we announced a reported earnings of $0.82 per share, up from $0.66 a year ago and ongoing earnings of $0.84 per share versus $0.94 a year ago. On a straight net income basis, which excludes the impact to the equity issuance last June to fund the Kentucky acquisition, reported earnings rose 60%. On an ongoing basis, net income rose 14%. The earnings improvement was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment and a PPL Electric Utilities' distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. These improvements were partially offset by expected lower energy margins in our Supply segment as higher priced hedges continue to roll off. 
In the first quarter, we also announced and subsequently closed a significant immediate accretive expansion of our electricity delivery business in the United Kingdom. By mid-April, we completed key elements with a permanent financing plan for this acquisition, including the equity portion of the financing and the U.K. holding company debt issuance. Most of the proceeds from these issuances were used to repay a significant portion of the bridge facility that we drew on to close the acquisition. Based on the successful equity issuance, Standard & Poor's took PPL and its rated subsidiaries of negative outlook. We expect the final piece of the permanent financing, the operating company debt issuances will occur next week, enabling final repayment of the bridge facility. 
On the integration front for WPD Midlands, all activities are proceeding fully according to plan. We remain on target to achieve our 2011 ongoing earnings forecast, which you remember we increased last month to reflect the expected accretion from this U.K. acquisition. We're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.75 for this year. 
Based on the successful acquisitions and permanent financings of our new operations in Kentucky and in the U.K., we've accomplished our strategic objective of achieving a much heavier weighting of rate regulated earnings and cash flow in our business, and significant regulated infrastructure investment should lead to sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for years to come. Based on immediate infrastructure spending in Pennsylvania and the U.K., coupled with updated assessment of Kentucky environmental compliance investments, we now expect our regulated asset base to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 9% over the next 5 years. And more than 2/3 of our planned CapEx spending in these regulated businesses will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near-realtime recovery of and on those expenditures. So this should give PPL a more predictable and transparent earnings profile going forward. 
Based on projected rate base growth, our expectations regarding earned or lease in the timing of general rate cases, we anticipate that by 2013, a significant majority of our earnings and cash flow will come from our regulated businesses. We've accomplished this derisking of PPL without giving up the significant upside potential of our competitive generation business and we remain confident that competitive wholesale capacity and counter prices will eventually rebound. And when they do, we believe our shareholders will benefit significantly. 
This has clearly been a transformational and successful year for PPL. We've migrated from a company with more than 60% of EBITDA dependent on commodity markets to one that will by 2013, derive only 25% of its expected EBITDA from that business. We issued a significant amount of equity and equity units to fund these acquisitions and the response by investors has been very strong. 
We're fully committed to delivering the results we've projected into earning appropriate returns in our regulated businesses. A particularly strong response to the most recent equity offering and the performance of our stock price since that offering make it clear to us that investors like the transformed PPL and that they believed we can deliver. And I'm confident that we'll do exactly that. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul for comments on some of the financial results. Paul?"
185508,130947201,123221,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our first quarter financial results.

Let's move to Slide 6 to review our first quarter financial results. PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are higher than last year driven by earnings from the Kentucky segment and the impact of the distribution rate increase at PPL Electric Utilities, partially offset by expected lower margins of the Supply segment. Per share earnings from ongoing operations are lower due to dilution of $0.23 per share, driven by the 2010 common stock issuance to fund the Kentucky acquisition. I'd like to highlight that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of the LKE, interest expense associated with the equity to use to finance that acquisition and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Let's move to the International segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our International segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 decrease from last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices and a more favorable customer mix, higher interest expense resulting from the GBP 400 million debt issuance in March of last year, higher income taxes and $0.04 of dilution. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2011, a $0.01 increase over last year. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins primarily due to new distribution base rates that went into effect on January 1 and favorable weather. Higher O&M expenses primarily due to higher plan spending and higher storm response cost, lower income taxes as a result of the state income tax benefit of bonus depreciation and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Supply. This segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.22 per share compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower energy margins resulting from lower hedge prices in the east and dilution of $0.12 per share. 
Turning to Slide 10. We reaffirmed our forecast of $2.50 to $2.75 per share in earnings from ongoing operations. This slide walks you from 2010 actual to forecast 2011, updating the key factors driving the change. We've changed the format of this slide to provide the factors that drive each segment's earnings between 2010 and the midpoint of our 2011 forecast, excluding the impact of dilution, which is broken out separately. 
The increase in the Kentucky regulated segment reflects a full year of its earnings results and a full year of interest expense associated with the equity units issued in June 2010 to finance that acquisition. The $0.57 increase in the International regulated segment earnings reflects a partial year of earnings from WPD Midlands and interest expense associated with the equity units issued in April to finance that acquisition. We expect an increase in earnings from the legacy U.K. business, primarily due to higher delivery revenue and a more favorable currency exchange rate, partially offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. 
The $0.08 increase from the Pennsylvania regulated segment is primarily due to the distribution rate increase that went into effect on January. We expect the Supply segment to deliver earnings from ongoing operations that are $0.87 per share lower than 2010. This decrease is primarily driven by $0.51 of lower energy margins, including an estimated $20 million to $30 million after tax impact to inspect and repair turbine blades at Susquehanna. Bill will discuss the Susquehanna outage extension in more detail in his remarks. 
Also impacting margins are lower electricity prices, lower basis and lower capacity prices in the east and higher delivered fuel cost in the east and west. We also expect higher income taxes primarily due to the 2010 release of Pennsylvania deferred tax valuation allowances at a lower Section 199 benefit. Higher O&M due to increased outage costs at our fossil plants in the east and west. And finally, $0.75 per share of dilution will result from the shares issued to fund both acquisitions. 
On Slide 11, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow from operations before dividends. The change in cash from operations for 2011 since the year end earnings call is driven by a partial year of earnings from WPD Midlands, offset by acquisition-related expenses, the return of collateral to third parties and the lower-than-expected income tax refunds. The change in free cash flow before dividends is also impacted by a projected capital expenditures of WPD Midlands and the remarketing of pollution control bonds in Kentucky. 
Turning to Slide 12. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on our dividend as a key element of total shareholder return. Our significantly more rate regulated business platform provides strong support for our current dividend, as well as our future dividend growth. This chart shows the improvement in earnings contribution of our regulated businesses that's a result of the recent acquisitions. Projected ongoing earnings per share from our regulated businesses now more than cover our current dividend and the Midlands acquisition, clearly, permits more dividend flexibility in the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations"
185508,130947201,123221,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 13 and start with an operational review of the first quarter.

Let's turn to Slide 13 and start with an operational review of the first quarter. 
Overall, we had a very good quarter in all of our business segments but let me start by first addressing the nuclear outage. At our Susquehanna nuclear plant, we're currently in a scheduled outage on Unit #2 and have discovered defective low pressure turbine blades during a plant inspection. Replacement of these blades was not anticipated as part of our original scope, this will extend the unit to outage by an estimated 4 to 6 weeks to ensure safe, reliable operations for the upcoming cycle. As a precaution, we will also bring Susquehanna Unit 1 offline in the coming weeks to do a similar turbine blade inspection. However, given the strong first quarter performance of the Supply segment and based on our preliminary expectations on the length of these outages, we believe that our Supply earnings for 2011 will still be achieved. 
Moving to our Kentucky regulated segment, LG&E and KU filed their integrated resource plan or IRP with the Kentucky PSC last week. This plan is provided to the PSC every 3 years and is intended to give the Commission a poignant time to look at our expectations for resource needs into the future. It does not represent a commitment or a decision by the company nor does it represent a request for approval. The key takeaways from the IRP are: one, average annual low growth of about 1.5%; 500 megawatts of demand side management capability; the closing of 3 older coal plants with a combined capacity of approximately 800 megawatts due to proposed environmental regulations; and new generation in the form of combined cycle gas units.
Our current capital projections are consistent with the IRP. However, prior to moving forward on any resource, we'll have to make additional regulatory filings with the Kentucky Commission. Our revised capital expenditure forecast for LG&E and KU also reflects our projected spending on environmental control equipment to meet the most recent proposed EPA rules. We have informed the Kentucky PSC of our intent to file a new environmental cost recovery or ECR plan to address proposed regulations. That ECR filing is expected to be made in the second quarter. 
Finally, KU filed a rate case in Virginia on April 1, requesting a $9.3 million annual revenue increased based on 2010 results and return on equity of 11%. The drivers of the case, are incremental capital investments and recovery of storm-related costs. If approved, the increase will take effect at the beginning of 2012. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania regulated segment. PPL Electric Utilities won its ninth J.D. Power and Associates' award for customer satisfaction by business customers. This is PPL Electric Utilities' 17th J.D. Power award, which is more than any other utility in the country. The employees of PPL Electric Utilities, just like our employees in Kentucky and the United Kingdom, take pride in providing the highest level of customer service and we congratulate them on a job well done. 
Finally, in our International regulated segment, as you know, we completed the acquisition of the Midlands operations. And as Jim said, the integration process is moving ahead as planned. 
Let's move to Slide 14 and take a look at sales volumes in Kentucky. Residential and commercial volumes were down for the quarter due principally to mild weather while industrial volumes increased, reflecting continued economic recovery in the service territory. Volumes for the trailing 12-month period were up across the board, reflecting both economic growth recovery and weather effects. 
LG&E and KU had the hottest summer in the past 30 years in 2010 followed by one of the coldest Decembers. The modeled weather-normalized volume reductions in the residential and commercial classes reflect energy efficiency measures which have not yet been offset by customer growth. 
For 2011, we're projecting load growth of approximately 1.2% on a weather-normalized basis. However, given the extreme weather in 2010, we're forecasting an actual load decline of 2.4% compared with last year. 
Moving to Slide 15. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Our PA utility has experienced slight growth in industrial sales for the first quarter and trailing 12 months. This industrial demand reflects the gradual economic recovery that we're seeing in the service territory but it still remains below levels prior to the recession. Residential sales are higher on an actual business, reflecting higher weather-related sales compared to the prior period. But on a weather-adjusted basis, we've experienced a decline in sales. The weather-adjusted decline in residential sales is primarily driven by higher energy prices, increased energy efficiency, energy conservation and a slow housing market. For 2011, we project overall load growth of less than 1% with higher industrial and commercial sales partially offset by continued lower residential sales. 
On Slide 16, we provide our usual detail on the Supply segment hedges. The baseload hedge levels and prices for 2011 are essentially the same as our fourth quarter disclosure. During this last quarter, we layered on additional power hedges in the east for 2012. Our average hedged price for 2012 has declined somewhat as the recent transactions have been completed and energy prices are lower than previous hedges. Since new hedges were put on at prices near the levels we saw at year end, our internal projections for 2012 total gross margins have not changed materially since the mark at the end of the first quarter 2010.

And then Bill Spencer, Chief Operating Officer, will provide you with an operational overview. As always, we look forward to going through some Q&A when we finish our prepared remarks. 
Today, we announced a reported earnings of $0.82 per share, up from $0.66 a year ago and ongoing earnings of $0.84 per share versus $0.94 a year ago. On a straight net income basis, which excludes the impact to the equity issuance last June to fund the Kentucky acquisition, reported earnings rose 60%. On an ongoing basis, net income rose 14%. The earnings improvement was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment and a PPL Electric Utilities' distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. These improvements were partially offset by expected lower energy margins in our Supply segment as higher priced hedges continue to roll off. 
In the first quarter, we also announced and subsequently closed a significant immediate accretive expansion of our electricity delivery business in the United Kingdom. By mid-April, we completed key elements with a permanent financing plan for this acquisition, including the equity portion of the financing and the U.K. holding company debt issuance. Most of the proceeds from these issuances were used to repay a significant portion of the bridge facility that we drew on to close the acquisition. Based on the successful equity issuance, Standard & Poor's took PPL and its rated subsidiaries of negative outlook. We expect the final piece of the permanent financing, the operating company debt issuances will occur next week, enabling final repayment of the bridge facility. 
On the integration front for WPD Midlands, all activities are proceeding fully according to plan. We remain on target to achieve our 2011 ongoing earnings forecast, which you remember we increased last month to reflect the expected accretion from this U.K. acquisition. We're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.75 for this year. 
Based on the successful acquisitions and permanent financings of our new operations in Kentucky and in the U.K., we've accomplished our strategic objective of achieving a much heavier weighting of rate regulated earnings and cash flow in our business, and significant regulated infrastructure investment should lead to sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for years to come. Based on needed infrastructure spending in Pennsylvania and the U.K., coupled with updated assessment of Kentucky environmental compliance investments, we now expect our regulated asset base to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 9% over the next five years. And more than two thirds of our planned CapEx spending in these regulated businesses will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near-realtime recovery of and on those expenditures. So this should give PPL a more predictable and transparent earnings profile going forward. 
Based on projected rate base growth, our expectations regarding earned [indiscernible] in the timing of general rate cases, we anticipate that by 2013, a significant majority of our earnings and cash flow will come from our regulated businesses. We've accomplished this de-risking of PPL without giving up the significant upside potential of our competitive generation business and we remain confident that competitive wholesale capacity and power prices will eventually rebound. And when they do, we believe our shareholders will benefit significantly. 
This has clearly been a transformational and successful year for PPL. We've migrated from a company with more than 60% of EBITDA dependent on commodity markets to one that will by 2013, derive only 25% of its expected EBITDA from that business. We issued a significant amount of equity and equity units to fund these acquisitions and the response by investors has been very strong. 
We're fully committed to delivering the results we've projected into earning appropriate returns in our regulated businesses. A particularly strong response to the most recent equity offering and the performance of our stock price since that offering make it clear to us that investors like the transformed PPL and that they believed we can deliver. And I'm confident that we'll do exactly that. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul for comments on some of the financial results. Paul?"
185508,130947201,123303,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our first quarter financial results.

Let's move to Slide 6 to review our first quarter financial results. PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are higher than last year driven by earnings from the Kentucky segment and the impact of the distribution rate increase at PPL Electric Utilities, partially offset by expected lower energy margins of the Supply segment. Per share earnings from ongoing operations are lower due to dilution of $0.23 per share, driven by the 2010 common stock issuance to fund the Kentucky acquisition. I'd like to highlight that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of the LKE, interest expense associated with the equity to use to finance that acquisition and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Let's move to the International segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our International segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 decrease from last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices and a more favorable customer mix, higher interest expense resulting from the GBP 400 million debt issuance in March of last year, higher income taxes and $0.04 of dilution. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2011, a $0.01 increase over last year. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins primarily due to new distribution base rates that went into effect on January 1 and favorable weather. Higher O&M expenses primarily due to higher plan spending and higher storm response cost, lower income taxes as a result of the state income tax benefit of bonus depreciation and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Supply. This segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.22 per share compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower energy margins resulting from lower hedge prices in the east and dilution of $0.12 per share. 
Turning to Slide 10. We reaffirmed our forecast of $2.50 to $2.75 per share in earnings from ongoing operations. This slide walks you from 2010 actual to forecast 2011, updating the key factors driving the change. We've changed the format of this slide to provide the factors that drive each segment's earnings between 2010 and the midpoint of our 2011 forecast, excluding the impact of dilution, which is broken out separately. 
The increase in the Kentucky regulated segment reflects a full year of its earnings results and a full year of interest expense associated with the equity units issued in June 2010 to finance that acquisition. The $0.57 increase in the International regulated segment earnings reflects a partial year of earnings from WPD Midlands and interest expense associated with the equity units issued in April to finance that acquisition. We expect an increase in earnings from the legacy U.K. business, primarily due to higher delivery revenue and a more favorable currency exchange rate, partially offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. 
The $0.08 increase from the Pennsylvania regulated segment is primarily due to the distribution rate increase that went into effect on January. We expect the Supply segment to deliver earnings from ongoing operations that are $0.87 per share lower than 2010. This decrease is primarily driven by $0.51 of lower energy margins, including an estimated $20 million to $30 million after tax impact to inspect and repair turbine blades at Susquehanna. Bill will discuss the Susquehanna outage extension in more detail in his remarks. 
Also impacting margins are lower electricity prices, lower basis and lower capacity prices in the east and higher delivered fuel cost in the east and west. We also expect higher income taxes primarily due to the 2010 release of Pennsylvania deferred tax valuation allowances at a lower Section 199 benefit. Higher O&M due to increased outage costs at our fossil plants in the east and west. And finally, $0.75 per share of dilution will result from the shares issued to fund both acquisitions. 
On Slide 11, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow from operations before dividends. The change in cash from operations for 2011 since the year end earnings call is driven by a partial year of earnings from WPD Midlands, offset by acquisition-related expenses, the return of collateral to third parties and the lower-than-expected income tax refunds. The change in free cash flow before dividends is also impacted by a projected capital expenditures of WPD Midlands and the remarketing of pollution control bonds in Kentucky. 
Turning to Slide 12. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on our dividend as a key element of total shareholder return. Our significantly more rate regulated business platform provides strong support for our current dividend, as well as our future dividend growth. This chart shows the improvement in earnings contribution of our regulated businesses that's a result of the recent acquisitions. Projected ongoing earnings per share from our regulated businesses now more than cover our current dividend and the Midlands acquisition, clearly, permits more dividend flexibility in the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations"

Let's turn to Slide 13 and start with an operational review of the first quarter. 
Overall, we had a very good quarter in all of our business segments but let me start by first addressing the nuclear outage. At our Susquehanna nuclear plant, we're currently in a scheduled outage on Unit #2 and have discovered defective low pressure turbine blades during a planned inspection. Replacement of these blades was not anticipated as part of our original scope, this will extend the unit to outage by an estimated 4 to 6 weeks to ensure safe, reliable operations for the upcoming cycle. As a precaution, we will also bring Susquehanna Unit #1 offline in the coming weeks to do a similar turbine blade inspection. However, given the strong first quarter performance of the Supply segment and based on our preliminary expectations on the length of these outages, we believe that our Supply earnings for 2011 will still be achieved. 
Moving to our Kentucky regulated segment, LG&E and KU filed their integrated resource plan or IRP with the Kentucky PSC last week. This plan is provided to the PSC every three years and is intended to give the Commission a poignant time to look at our expectations for resource needs into the future. It does not represent a commitment or a decision by the company nor does it represent a request for approval. The key takeaways from the IRP are: one, average annual low growth of about 1.5%; 500 megawatts of demand side management capability; the closing of three older coal plants with a combined capacity of approximately 800 megawatts due to proposed environmental regulations; and new generation in the form of combined cycle gas units.
Our current capital projections are consistent with the IRP. However, prior to moving forward on any resource, we'll have to make additional regulatory filings with the Kentucky Commission. Our revised capital expenditure forecast for LG&E and KU also reflects our projected spending on environmental control equipment to meet the most recent proposed EPA rules. We have informed the Kentucky PSC of our intent to file a new environmental cost recovery or ECR plan to address proposed regulations. That ECR filing is expected to be made in the second quarter. 
Finally, KU filed a rate case in Virginia on April 1, requesting a $9.3 million annual revenue increased based on 2010 results and return on equity of 11%. The drivers of the case, are incremental capital investments and recovery of storm-related costs. If approved, the increase will take effect at the beginning of 2012. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania regulated segment. PPL Electric Utilities won its ninth J.D. Power and Associates' award for customer satisfaction by business customers. This is PPL Electric Utilities' 17th J.D. Power award, which is more than any other utility in the country. The employees of PPL Electric Utilities, just like our employees in Kentucky and the United Kingdom, take pride in providing the highest level of customer service and we congratulate them on a job well done. 
Finally, in our International regulated segment, as you know, we completed the acquisition of the Midlands operations. And as Jim said, the integration process is moving ahead as planned. 
Let's move to Slide 14 and take a look at sales volumes in Kentucky. Residential and commercial volumes were down for the quarter due principally to mild weather while industrial volumes increased, reflecting continued economic recovery in the service territory. Volumes for the trailing 12-month period were up across the board, reflecting both economic growth recovery and weather effects. 
LG&E and KU had the hottest summer in the past 30 years in 2010 followed by one of the coldest Decembers. The modeled weather-normalized volume reductions in the residential and commercial classes reflect energy efficiency measures which have not yet been offset by customer growth. 
For 2011, we're projecting load growth of approximately 1.2% on a weather-normalized basis. However, given the extreme weather in 2010, we're forecasting an actual load decline of 2.4% compared with last year. 
Moving to Slide 15. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Our PA utility has experienced slight growth in industrial sales for the first quarter and trailing 12 months. This industrial demand reflects the gradual economic recovery that we're seeing in the service territory but it still remains below levels prior to the recession. Residential sales are higher on an actual business, reflecting higher weather-related sales compared to the prior period. But on a weather-adjusted basis, we've experienced a decline in sales. The weather-adjusted decline in residential sales is primarily driven by higher energy prices, increased energy efficiency, energy conservation and a slow housing market. For 2011, we project overall load growth of less than 1% with higher industrial and commercial sales partially offset by continued lower residential sales. 
On Slide 16, we provide our usual detail on the Supply segment hedges. The baseload hedge levels and prices for 2011 are essentially the same as our fourth quarter disclosure. During this last quarter, we layered on additional power hedges in the east for 2012. Our average hedged price for 2012 has declined somewhat as the recent transactions have been completed at energy prices are lower than previous hedges. Since new hedges were put on at prices near the levels we saw at year end, our internal projections for 2012 total gross margins have not changed materially since the mark at the end of the first quarter 2010. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Jim, and we look forward to your questions."

And with me today, as usual, I have Bill Spencer, now President and COO; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and quick congratulations to Bill as we've expanded the company. Bill will certainly be busy",680,"Okay, thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. And with me today, as usual, I have Bill Spencer, now President and COO; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and quick congratulations to Bill as we've expanded the company. Bill will certainly be busy with working with the 2 new acquisitions in Kentucky and in the U.K., and we look forward to really driving significant value out of these 2 businesses as we grow the company. All these will cover some refer marks by myself. Paul Farr will go through our detailed financials, and Bill will go to the operational aspects, and then we'll go to Q&A. So with that, as you've seen by now in the announcement this morning, reported earnings of $0.35 per share, up from $0.22 a year ago. For the first half for the year, our reported earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.88 for the same period last year. Ongoing earnings and for the second quarter were $0.45 per share versus $0.62 in the second quarter last year. And ongoing earnings for the first half of 2011 were $1.26 per share compared to $1.56 in 2010. 
The 2011 earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment, strong International segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities distribution rate increase that took effect January 1 this year. These improvements, however, we're more than offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment driven by higher-priced hedges just rolling off, as well as unplanned outages to replace turbine blades at our Susquehanna nuclear units and dilution from the equity issued to finance our 2 large regulated utility acquisitions. 
During the second quarter, we did successfully complete the permanent financing for the Midlands acquisition, and the integration of this business is proceeding according to plan. While the integration is still at a relatively early stage, we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 4 months of ownership. For example, prior to our acquisitions, fewer than 65% of Midlands customers have power restored in under 60 minutes following a high voltage outage. By June, we've restored power following outage to more than 75% of customers in less than 60 minutes. This is only one statistic, but it's represented of the value our U.K. team is already delivering to the customers in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today we are reaffirming our 2011 forecast of $2.50 and $2.75 per share earnings for ongoing operations. I feel very good about our prospects for the year as we expect to largely mitigate $60 million to $65 million earnings impact of the Susquehanna outages with strong performance from our U.K. business and positive results in other aspects of our competitive Supply business. Our ability to absorb the impact of such a significant unplanned event illustrates the value of our larger business platform. And we expect to plan significant regulated infrastructure investment will lead to sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for years to come. 
Our Compound Annual Growth Rate in the consolidated regulated asset base is about 9% over the next 5 years and more than 2/3 of our planned capital spend will be made under structures that allow for near realtime recovery of those expenditures. Beyond the attractive growth related businesses Supply segment remains well-positioned for the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity and power prices. We now believe this rebound could even occur sooner than we previously expected. The recent finalization cross-state air pollution rules, the firming spark spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to higher power prices beginning in late 2013 or early 2014. 
So before turning it over to Paul, let me say that I'm very optimistic about the short- and long-term prospects for PPL. We've completed the 2 major acquisitions that allowed us to reposition our portfolio, and we've created a larger, stronger enterprise. So I look forward to the questions after we hear from Paul and Bill on the operational side. Now, I'll turn in the call over to Paul"
185508,138483750,153108,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning all. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our second quarter financial results. Second quarter earnings from ongoing operations in lower than last year primarily due to dilution resulting from common stock issued in June 2010 and",574,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning all. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our second quarter financial results. Second quarter earnings from ongoing operations in lower than last year primarily due to dilution resulting from common stock issued in June 2010 and April 2011 to fund our 2 larges acquisitions and lower margin that our Supply segment. These drivers were partially offset by the operating results in the acquired utilities and the impact of PPL distribution rate increase that Jim referred to already. 
While there's no comparative for 2010 performance for Kentucky as the deal hadn't yet closed for this period, I'd to highlight that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.02 per share. Let's move to the International segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our international regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the second quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This performance was the net result of the operating results of the Midlands utilities, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with the 2011 equity unit issuance and the Bridget facility draw. Higher earnings at WPDE's legacy businesses resulting from higher delivery revenue primarily due to higher prices, higher interest expense on our index and bonds, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.10 per share. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania related segment earned $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2011, a $0.02 increase over last year. This increase was the net result of higher Delivery margins, primarily due to the new distribution rate that went into effect at Jan 1 and higher transmission revenue due to both increased rate base and cost of capital benefits from additional equity investments there. Lower O&M expense and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning now to supply. This segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.31 per share compared to last year. The primary drivers of the lower Q2 earnings were the timing of Susquehanna planned refueling and operating outage and the financial impact of unplanned turbine blade replacement outages that affected both units. This quarter was also impacted by anticipated lower energy and capacity prices that just had rolled off and higher delivered coal prices. Partially offsetting the negative drivers were higher margin on refinement sales contracts and better month time to margins from our intermediate units. And finally, dilution impact of the segment by $0.06 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends forecast. This graph exclude the impact of the Midlands purchase as we're finalizing some of those details now. The change in cash from operations for 2011 since the first quarter earnings call is primarily driven by a higher than expected return of collateral to third parties, higher noncash income items and an additional pension payment at WPD. Cash flows are also impacted by slightly lower projected capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 11 we continue to focus on the dividend as a key obvious element of total share of return. We're very well-positioned to cover the dividend out of rate regulated debt maturities as we indicated on the slide, and clearly the combination of the Midlands acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility businesses from a dividend flexibility in the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update of our operations."

The units are running at full output, and we're online during the recent extreme hot weather we experienced in the region. With the update to Susquehanna Unit 2, we are now operating the 2 largest boiling water reactors in the U.S. In total, we have added another 217 megawatts at Susquehanna. 
As noted in an 8-K filed with the SEC, PPL discovered several crack plays during scheduled inspection of its low-pressure turbines during Unit 2's planned outage. Conservative actions were taken to not only replace several blade rows on Unit 2, but also to take Unit 1 off-line for inspection for a similar cracking was discovered. PPL installed enhanced monitoring equipment to help determine the cause of the blade cracking. 
Moving on to coal-related issues. As you know, the EPA recently finalized the rules related to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions. The rules apply to fossil fuel power plants in 28 states, including Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Montana is not affected by these rules. The competitive Supply segment compliance strategy for meeting the emission requirement of the former care rules have positioned the company well to meet the new requirements. Since 2005, about $1.6 billion has been invested in environmental upgrades in our coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania and Montana, including $1.3 billion for covers at the Keystone, Montour and Bernard Alan plants. We continue to evaluate the timing for potential addition of an FDR for Bernard Alan. The cost of this is included in the CapEx plans we provided to you in the past and in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Overall, we did not see the need to increase capital expenditures to comply with the Casper requirements. Overall, PPL's competitive fleet is well-positioned with respect to these rules and can clearly benefit form coal plant retirement that will tighten up the supply situation in PJM. We would expect to begin seeing benefits to our fleet by 2014. 
Let's move to Slide 13 for an update on the international regulated segment. The synergy plan for the integration of the Midlands operation is on track and the organizational structure and reorganization plans have been finalized. We are in the process of implementing our organizational plans to ensure the most efficient operations possible. The transition will result in a smaller support structure, the elimination of duplicate work and the implementation of streamlined work procedures. We plan to complete the vast majority of the organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14, we've outlined sales volumes by major customer class for Kentucky. Slower-than-expected economic growth, lowered energy sales over the past year and is apparent in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. In Kentucky, real disposable income decreased as inflation has outpaced income growth, and unemployment in the state continues to be above the national average. As a result, the number of residential customers is essentially flat year-over-year, and average consumption per customer is slightly down. While some indications have been hopeful for the commercial sector in Kentucky, commercial electricity sales indicate relatively slow economic growth. 
In the Industrial segment, Q2 sales in '11 were lower than prior year due mainly to customer-specific factory issues. Industrial sales are up for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2011, versus same period a year ago due to increased production over that period from a couple of utilities' largest customers. 
Moving to Slide 15. We provided details on sales for PPL electric utility. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest slow growth in addition of new customers. This was partially offset by the effect of higher energy prices on sales and increase energy efficiency and conservation. Commercial and industrial sales were higher for the quarter reflecting gradual, economic recovery in the region. For full year 2011, we projected overall load growth between 1% and 2% driven primarily by higher residential industrial and commercial sales. 
On Slide 16, we provide our normal on the detail on the competitive Supply segment hedges. The baseload hedge levels and prices for 2011 are essentially the same as our first quarter disclosure. We have adjusted our expected output levels for '11 to reflect actual results to June and our forecast for the remainder of the year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by Susquehanna nuclear outage, which is partially offset by higher intermediate and peaking generation. We expected Western generation reflects lower coal generation partially offset by higher hydro generation due to above normal river flows in the Pacific Northwest. 
During the quarter, we layered on additional power hedges in the East for 2012 and 2013, which we are providing today for the first time. As you can see, our 2013 hedge profile is approximately 70%. By the end of 2012, we would have expected to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. We're obviously currently ahead of that schedule as we took advantage of recent our price rallies motivated by firming gas forwards, as well as impact from EPA's Casper. Most of the 2013 hedges were done with collars, so we stand to capture upside on these hedges if prices move higher. While we have protected against the downside if was delayed or forward natural price has soften. That said, 30% of our projected baseload production and 80% of our gas for our capacity stands poised to capture the full benefit of any further strengthening of power prices in the 2013 Delivery year. As 2014 comes on our horizon, we are essentially fully open in our view that the confluence of the cash for implementation prospects for better economic recovery and firming gas prices will reduce reserve margins and further expand key rates. Our generation business is expected to do very well in that environment. Now let me turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."

So I'd focus more on the 12 months ended figures, which are on the bottom chart there. But I think relative to Kentucky, for example, the unemployment rate in Pennsylvania is better than the national average where it's actually reversing in Kentucky. I don't know that there's anything structurally in our service territory than in the TECO territory. The one caveat or exception to that is the Marcellus Shale drilling. There's some infrastructure being built in a very small section of our Western territory that has seen positive impact as a result of some more housing starts and other services coming into that territory. But we're on the very fringe of that, so I wouldn't expect that to drive the numbers significantly. But as I mentioned in my remarks, we are expecting about a 1% to 2% low growth year-over-year by year end."

I think in terms of just the overall big picture, clearly compared to where we were in 2007 and '08, our prices even though they looked to be much or somewhat improved if not much improved by '13, '14, '15, they're still low relative to those historical periods. So clearly, as we look at the economics of our coal plants, they're still some challenges out there. So I think both the coal suppliers, as well as the rail companies recognize the challenges that are there. I think the bigger driver to the energy price at the end of the day is really going to be -- and as Paul mentioned this, the SO2 and the NOx emissions credit levels. And we're assuming what could be a little bit on the low side, about $1,400 a ton of the SO2 side and about 500's on the NOx side. And we're seeing some pretty big spreads out there upwards of 5,000 in the SO2 case and 9,000 on the NOx case. So I think that's probably at the end of the day kind of the key driver to how much lift we see in prices when we get out to the '13, '14 timeframe."

And with me today, as usual, I have Bill Spence, now President and COO; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer. And a quick congratulations to Bill as we've expanded the company. Bill will certainly be bus",682,"Okay. Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. And with me today, as usual, I have Bill Spence, now President and COO; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer. And a quick congratulations to Bill as we've expanded the company. Bill will certainly be busy with working with the 2 new acquisitions in Kentucky and in the U.K., and we look forward to really driving significant value out of these 2 businesses as we've grown the company. 
Always, we'll cover some brief remarks by myself. Paul Farr will go through our detailed financials, and Bill will go through the operational aspects, and then we'll go to Q&A. So with that, as you've seen by now in the announcement this morning, reported earnings of $0.35 per share, up from $0.22 a year ago. For the first half of the year, our reported earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.88 for the same period last year. Ongoing earnings for the second quarter were $0.45 per share versus $0.62 in the second quarter last year. And ongoing earnings for the first half of 2011 were $1.26 per share compared to $1.56 in 2010. 
The 2011 earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky-regulated segment, strong International segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities distribution and rate increase that took effect January 1 this year. These improvements, however, we're more than offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment, driven by higher-priced hedges rolling off, as well as unplanned outages to replace turbine blades at our Susquehanna nuclear units and dilution from the equity issued to finance our 2 large regulated utility acquisitions. 
During the second quarter, we did successfully complete the permanent financing for the Midlands acquisition, and the integration of this business is proceeding according to plan. While the integration is still at a relatively early stage, we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 4 months of ownership. 
For example, prior to our acquisition, fewer than 65% of Midlands' customers had power restored in under 60 minutes following a high-voltage outage. By June, we'd restored power following such an outage to more than 75% of customers in less than 60 minutes. This is only one statistic, but it's representative of the value our U.K. team is already delivering to the customers in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today, we are reaffirming our 2011 forecast of $2.50 to $2.75 per share in earnings for ongoing operations. I feel very good about our prospects for the year as we expect to largely mitigate the $60 million to $65 million earnings impact of the Susquehanna outages with strong performance from our U.K. business and positive results in other aspects of our competitive supply business. 
Our ability to absorb the impact of such a significant unplanned event illustrates the value of our larger business platform. And we expect the planned significant regulated infrastructure investment will lead to sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for years to come. 
Our compound annual growth rate in the consolidated regulated asset base is about 9% over the next 5 years. And more than 2/3 of our planned capital spend will be made under structures that allow for near-realtime recovery of those expenditures. 
Beyond the attractive growth in our regulated businesses, Supply segment remains well-positioned for the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity and power prices. We now believe this rebound could even occur sooner than we previously expected. The recent finalization of cross-state air pollution rules, the firming spark spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to higher power prices beginning in late 2013 or early 2014. 
So before turning it over to Paul, let me say that I'm very optimistic about the short- and long-term prospects for PPL. We've completed the 2 major acquisitions that allowed us to reposition our portfolio, and we've created a larger, stronger enterprise. So I look forward to the questions after we hear from Paul and Bill on the operational side. Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul."
185508,138483750,153291,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning all. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our second quarter financial results. Second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily due to dilution resulting from the common stock issued in June",576,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning all. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our second quarter financial results. 
Second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily due to dilution resulting from the common stock issued in June 2010 and April 2011 to fund our 2 large acquisitions and lower margins at our Supply segment. These drivers were partially offset by the operating results of the acquired utilities and the impact of the PPL EU distribution rate increase that Jim referred to already. 
While there is no comparator for 2010 performance for Kentucky as the deal hadn't yet closed for this period, I'd like to highlight that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.02 per share. 
Let's move to the International segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our International regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the second quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This performance was the net result of the operating results of the Midlands utilities, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with the 2011 equity unit issuance and the bridge facility draw. 
Higher earnings at WPD's legacy business is resulting from higher delivery revenue, primarily due to higher prices, higher interest expense and our index-linked bonds, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.10 per share. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2011, a $0.02 increase over last year. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins, primarily due to the new distribution rate that went into effect on Jan 1 and higher transmission revenue due to both increased rate base and cost of capital benefits from additional equity investments there. Lower O&M expense and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning now to Supply. This segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.31 per share compared to last year. The primary drivers of the lower Q2 earnings were the timing of Susquehanna's planned refueling and upgrade outage and the financial impact of unplanned turbine blade replacement outages that affected both units. 
This quarter was also impacted by anticipated lower energy and capacity prices in the East as hedges rolled off and higher delivered coal prices. Partially offsetting the negative drivers were higher margins on full-requirement sales contracts and better runtimes and margins from our intermediate peaking units. And finally, dilution impact of the segment by $0.06 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends forecast. This graph excluded the impact of the Midlands purchase as we're finalizing some of those details now. The change in cash from operations for 2011 since the first quarter earnings call is primarily driven by a higher-than-expected return of collateral to third parties, higher non-cash income items and an additional pension payment at WPD. Cash flows are also impacted by slightly lower projected capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to focus on the dividend as a key obvious element of total shareowner return. We're very well positioned to cover the dividend out of rate-regulated business earnings, as we indicated on the slide, and clearly, the combination of the Midlands acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility businesses permit dividend flexibility into the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."
185508,138483750,153291,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 12 now and start with an operational review of the second quarter. In Kentucky, LG&E and KU both made environmental cost recovery, or ECR filings, with the Kentucky PSC in June. These filings c",1105,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 12 now and start with an operational review of the second quarter. In Kentucky, LG&E and KU both made environmental cost recovery, or ECR filings, with the Kentucky PSC in June. These filings cover a total of $2.5 billion of environmental costs, primarily as a result of the new EPA regulations. The proceeding is underway, and we are in the discovery phase of the process. We'd expect a decision by the KPSC by year end. 
Moving to the Supply segment. Both units at our Susquehanna nuclear facility returned to service following the unplanned turbine blade replacement outages. The units are running at full output, and we're online during the recent extreme hot weather we experienced in the region. With the update to Susquehanna Unit 2, we are now operating the 2 largest boiling water reactors in the U.S. In total, we have added another 217 megawatts at Susquehanna. 
As noted in an 8-K filed with the SEC, PPL discovered several crack plays during a scheduled inspection of its low-pressure turbines during Unit 2's planned outage. Conservative actions were taken to not only replace several blade rows on Unit 2, but also to take Unit 1 offline for an inspection where similar cracking was discovered. PPL has installed enhanced monitoring equipment to help determine the cause of the blade cracking. 
Moving on to coal-related issues. As you know, the EPA recently finalized the CSAPR rules related to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions. The rules apply to fossil fuel power plants in 28 states, including Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Montana is not affected by these rules. The competitive supply segment's compliance strategy for meeting the emission requirements of the former care rules have positioned the company well to meet the new CSAPR requirements. 
Since 2005, about $1.6 billion has been invested in environmental upgrades at our coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania and Montana, including $1.3 billion for scrubbers at the Keystone, Montour and Brunner Island plants. We continue to evaluate the timing for a potential addition of an FDR at Brunner Island. The cost of this is included in the CapEx plans we have provided to you in the past and in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Overall, we do not see the need to increase capital expenditures to comply with the CSAPR requirements. Overall, PPL's competitive sulfide fleet is well-positioned with respect to these roles and can clearly benefit form coal plant retirements that will tighten up the supply situation in PJM. We would expect to begin seeing benefits to our fleet by 2014. 
Let's move to Slide 13 for an update on the international regulated segment. The synergy plan for the integration of the Midlands operation is on track, and the organizational structure and reorganization plans have been finalized. We are in the process of implementing our organizational plans to ensure the most efficient operations possible. The transition will result in a smaller support structure, the elimination of duplicate work and the implementation of streamlined work procedures. We plan to complete the vast majority of the organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14, we've outlined sales volumes by major customer class for Kentucky. Slower-than-expected economic growth lowered energy sales over the past year and is apparent in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. In Kentucky, real disposable income decreased as inflation has outpaced income growth. And unemployment in the state continues to be above the national average. 
As a result, the number of residential customers is essentially flat year-over-year, and average consumption per customer is slightly down. While some indications have been hopeful for the commercial sector in Kentucky, commercial electricity sales indicate relatively slow economic growth. 
In the industrial segment, Q2 sales in '11 were lower than prior year due mainly to customer-specific factory issues. Industrial sales are up for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2011, versus the same period a year ago due to increased production over that period from a couple of the utilities' largest customers. 
Moving to Slide 15. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest load growth and the addition of new customers. This was partially offset by the effect of higher energy prices on sales and increased energy efficiency and conservation. Commercial and industrial sales were higher for the quarter reflecting gradual, economic recovery in the region. 
For the full year 2011, we project overall load growth between 1% and 2%, driven primarily by higher residential, industrial and commercial sales. 
On Slide 16, we provide our normal detail on the competitive supply segment hedges. The baseload hedge levels and prices for 2011 are essentially the same as our first quarter disclosure. We have adjusted our expected output levels for '11 to reflect actual results through June and our forecast for the remainder of the year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by the Susquehanna nuclear outage, which is partially offset by higher intermediate and peaking generation. 
The expected western generation reflects lower coal generation, partially offset by higher hydro generation due to above-normal river flows in the Pacific Northwest. 
During the quarter, we layered on additional power hedges in the East for 2012 and 2013, which we are providing today for the first time. As you can see, our 2013 hedge profile is approximately 70%. By the end of 2012, we would have expected to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. 
We're obviously currently ahead of that schedule, as we took advantage of recent power price rallies motivated by firming gas forwards, as well as impacts from EPA's CSAPR. Most of the 2013 hedges were done with collars, so we stand to capture upside on these hedges if prices move higher, but we have protected against the downside if CSAPR is delayed or forward natural gas price has softened.
That said, 30% of our projected baseload production and 80% of our gas forward capacity stands poised to capture the full benefits of any further strengthening of power prices in the 2013 delivery year. 
As 2014 comes on the horizon, we are essentially fully opened and are of the view that the confluence of the CSAPR implementation prospects for better economic recovery, and firming gas prices will reduce reserve margins and further expand key rates. Our generation business is expected to do very well in that environment. 
Now let me turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."

I think in terms of just the overall big picture, clearly, compared to where we were in 2007 and '08, our prices, even though they looked to be much or somewhat improved, it's not much improved by '13, '14, '15. They're still low relative to those historical periods. So clearly, as we look at the economics of our coal plants, there are still some challenges out there. So I think both the coal suppliers as well as the rail companies recognize the challenges that are there. I think the bigger driver to the energy price at the end of the day is really going to be, and Paul mentioned this, the SO2 and the NOx emissions credit levels. And we're assuming what could be a little bit on the low side, about $1,400 a ton on the SO2 side and about $500 on the NOx side. And we've seen some pretty big spreads out there, upwards of $5,000 in the SO2 case and $9,000 on the NOx case. So I think that's probably, at the end of the day, going to be a key driver to how much lift we see in prices when we get out to the '13, '14 timeframe."

And with me today, as usual, I have Bill Spence, our now President and COO; and Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer. And a quick congratulations to Bill. As we've expanded the company, Bill will certainly be busy with working with the 2 new acquisitions in Kentucky and in the U.K., and we look forward to really driving significant value out of those 2 businesses as we've grown the company. 
Always, we'll cover some brief remarks by myself. Paul Farr will go through our detailed financials, and Bill will go through the operational aspects, and then we'll go to Q&A. So with that, as you've seen by now in the announcement this morning, reported earnings of $0.35 per share, up from $0.22 a year ago. For the first half of the year, our reported earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.88 for the same period last year. Ongoing earnings for the second quarter were $0.45 per share versus $0.62 in the second quarter last year. And ongoing earnings for the first half of 2011 were $1.26 per share compared to $1.56 in 2010. 
The 2011 earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky-regulated segment, strong International segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities distribution and rate increase that took effect January 1 this year. These improvements, however, were more than offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment, driven by higher-priced hedges rolling off, as well as unplanned outages to replace turbine blades at our Susquehanna nuclear units and dilution from the equity issued to finance our 2 large regulated utility acquisitions. 
During the second quarter, we did successfully complete the permanent financing for the Midlands acquisition, and the integration of this business is proceeding according to plan. While the integration is still at a relatively early stage, we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 4 months of ownership. 
For example, prior to our acquisition, fewer than 65% of Midlands' customers had power restored in under 60 minutes following a high-voltage outage. By June, we'd restored power following such an outage to more than 75% of customers in less than 60 minutes. This is only one statistic, but it's representative of the value our U.K. team is already delivering to the customers in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today, we’re reaffirming our 2011 forecast of $2.50 to $2.75 per share in earnings for ongoing operations. I feel very good about our prospects for the year as we expect to largely mitigate the $60 million to $65 million earnings impact of the Susquehanna outages with strong performance from our U.K. business and positive results in other aspects of our competitive Supply business. 
Our ability to absorb the impact of such a significant unplanned event illustrates the value of our larger business platform. And we expect the planned significant regulated infrastructure investment will lead to sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for years to come. 
Our compound annual growth rate in the consolidated regulated asset base is about 9% over the next 5 years. And more than 2/3 of our planned capital spend will be made under structures that allow for near-realtime recovery of those expenditures. 
Beyond the attractive growth in our regulated businesses, the Supply segment remains well-positioned for the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity and power prices. We now believe this rebound could even occur sooner than we previously expected. The recent finalization of cross-state air pollution rules, the firming spark spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to higher power prices beginning in late 2013 or early 2014. 
So before turning it over to Paul, let me say that I'm very optimistic about the short- and long-term prospects for PPL. We've completed the 2 major acquisitions that allowed us to reposition our portfolio, and we've created a larger, stronger enterprise. So I look forward to the questions after we hear from Paul and Bill on the operational side. Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul."
185508,138483750,153349,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, all. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our second quarter financial results. Second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily due to dilution resulting from the common stock issued in June",576,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, all. Let's move to Slide 6 to review our second quarter financial results. 
Second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily due to dilution resulting from the common stock issued in June 2010 and April 2011 to fund our 2 large acquisitions and lower margins at our Supply segment. These drivers were partially offset by the operating results of the acquired utilities and the impact of the PPL EU distribution rate increase that Jim referred to already. 
While there is no comparator for 2010 performance for Kentucky as the deal hadn't yet closed for this period, I'd like to highlight that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.02 per share. 
Let's move to the International segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our International regulated segment earned $0.21 per share in the second quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This performance was the net result of the operating results of the Midlands utilities, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with the 2011 equity unit issuance and the bridge facility draw. 
Higher earnings at WPD's legacy business is resulting from higher delivery revenue, primarily due to higher prices, higher interest expense and our index-linked bonds, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.10 per share. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2011, a $0.02 increase over last year. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins, primarily due to the new distribution rate that went into effect on Jan 1, and higher transmission revenue due to both increased rate base and cost of capital benefits from additional equity investment there. Lower O&M expense and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Turning now to Supply. This segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.31 per share compared to last year. The primary drivers of the lower Q2 earnings were the timing of Susquehanna's planned refueling and upgrade outage and the financial impact of unplanned turbine blade replacement outages that affected both units. 
This quarter was also impacted by anticipated lower energy and capacity prices in the East as hedges rolled off and higher delivered coal prices. Partially offsetting the negative drivers were higher margins on full-requirement sales contracts and better runtimes and margins from our intermediate and peaking units. And finally, dilution impacted the segment by $0.06 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends forecast. This graph excluded the impact of the Midlands purchase as we're finalizing some of those details now. The change in cash from operations for 2011 since the first quarter earnings call is primarily driven by a higher-than-expected return of collateral to third parties, higher non-cash income items and an additional pension payment at WPD. Cash flows are also impacted by slightly lower projected capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to focus on the dividend as a key obvious element of total shareowner return. We're very well positioned to cover the dividend out of rate-regulated business earnings, as we indicate on the slide, and clearly, the combination of the Midlands acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility businesses permit dividend flexibility into the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."
185508,138483750,153349,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 12 now and start with an operational review of the second quarter. In Kentucky, LG&E and KU both made environmental cost recovery, or ECR filings, with the Kentucky PSC in June. These filings c",1106,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 12 now and start with an operational review of the second quarter. In Kentucky, LG&E and KU both made environmental cost recovery, or ECR filings, with the Kentucky PSC in June. These filings cover a total of $2.5 billion of environmental costs, primarily as a result of the new EPA regulations. The proceeding is underway, and we are in the discovery phase of the process. We'd expect a decision by the KPSC by year end. 
Moving to the Supply segment. Both units at our Susquehanna nuclear facility returned to service following the unplanned turbine blade replacement outages. The units are running at full output and were online during the recent extreme hot weather we experienced in the region. With the update to Susquehanna Unit 2, we are now operating the 2 largest boiling water reactors in the U.S. In total, we have added another 217 megawatts at Susquehanna. 
As noted in an 8-K filed with the SEC, PPL discovered several cracked blades during a scheduled inspection of its low-pressure turbines during Unit 2's planned outage. Conservative actions were taken to not only replace several blade rows on Unit 2, but also to take Unit 1 offline for an inspection where similar cracking was discovered. PPL has installed enhanced monitoring equipment to help determine the cause of the blade cracking. 
Moving on to coal-related issues. As you know, the EPA recently finalized the CSAPR rules related to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions. The rules apply to fossil fuel power plants in 28 states, including Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Montana is not affected by these rules. The competitive supply segment's compliance strategy for meeting the emission requirements of the former care rules have positioned the company well to meet the new CSAPR requirements. 
Since 2005, about $1.6 billion has been invested in environmental upgrades at our coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania and Montana, including $1.3 billion for scrubbers at the Keystone, Montour and Brunner Island plants. We continued to evaluate the timing for a potential addition of an FDR [ph] at Brunner Island. The cost of this is included in the CapEx plans we provided to you in the past and in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Overall, we do not see the need to increase capital expenditures to comply with the CSAPR requirements. Overall, PPL's competitive supply fleet is well-positioned with respect to these roles and can clearly benefit from coal plant retirements that will tighten up the supply situation in PJM. We would expect to begin seeing benefits to our fleet by 2014. 
Let's move to Slide 13 for an update on the international regulated segment. The synergy plan for the integration of the Midlands operation is on track, and the organizational structure and reorganization plans have been finalized. We are in the process of implementing our organizational plans to ensure the most efficient operations possible. The transition will result in a smaller support structure, the elimination of duplicate work and the implementation of streamlined work procedures. We plan to complete the vast majority of the organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14, we've outlined sales volumes by major customer class for Kentucky. Slower-than-expected economic growth lowered energy sales over the past year, and it’s apparent in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. In Kentucky, real disposable income decreased as inflation has outpaced income growth. And unemployment in the state continues to be above the national average. 
As a result, the number of residential customers is essentially flat year-over-year, and average consumption per customer is slightly down. While some indications have been hopeful for the commercial sector in Kentucky, commercial electricity sales indicate relatively slow economic growth. 
In the industrial segment, Q2 sales in '11 were lower than prior year due mainly to customer-specific factory issues. Industrial sales are up for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2011, versus the same period a year ago due to increased production over that period from a couple of the utilities' largest customers. 
Moving to Slide 15. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest load growth and the addition of new customers. This was partially offset by the effect of higher energy prices on sales and increased energy efficiency and conservation. Commercial and industrial sales were higher for the quarter, reflecting gradual, economic recovery in the region. 
For the full year 2011, we project overall load growth between 1% and 2%, driven primarily by higher residential, industrial and commercial sales. 
On Slide 16, we provide our normal detail on the competitive supply segment hedges. The baseload hedge levels and prices for 2011 are essentially the same as our first quarter disclosure. We have adjusted our expected output levels for '11 to reflect actual results through June and our forecast for the remainder of the year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by the Susquehanna nuclear outage, which is partially offset by higher intermediate and peaking generation.  
The expected Western generation reflects lower coal generation, partially offset by higher hydro generation due to above-normal river flows in the Pacific Northwest. 
During the quarter, we layered on additional power hedges in the East for 2012 and 2013, which we are providing today for the first time. As you can see, our 2013 hedge profile is approximately 70%. By the end of 2012, we would have expected to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. 
We're obviously currently ahead of that schedule, as we took advantage of recent power price rallies motivated by firming gas forwards, as well as impacts from EPA's CSAPR. Most of the 2013 hedges were done with collars, so we stand to capture upside on these hedges if prices move higher, but we have protected against the downside if CSAPR is delayed or forward natural gas price has softened.
That said, 30% of our projected baseload production and 80% of our gas forward [ph] capacity stands poised to capture the full benefits of any further strengthening of power prices in the 2013 delivery year. 
As 2014 comes on the horizon, we are essentially fully open and are of the view that the confluence of the CSAPR implementation, prospects for better economic recovery and firming gas prices will reduce reserve margins and further expand heat rates. Our generation business is expected to do very well in that environment. 
Now let me turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."

The problem is that, and I shouldn't say problem, but there's a big range of outcomes depending upon the years of service and the age of the personnel in the 600 to 800 people that leave organization. You'll notice, when you look at the Q, that we've given, so that people didn't think it was an uncapped number, if you will, in terms of exposure, that at the extreme, meaning if 800 people would leave, and they’re the 800 people that have the longest tenure with the organization and the highest age, it could be up to $120 million for that element. And I think we gave a number of around $110 million in the road show deck that included the ITPs as well. But if you go to the other end of the spectrum and it's younger folks that have fewer, less time in the organization, it could be less than $10 million.

And we're assuming what could be a little bit on the low side, about $1,400 a ton on the SO2 side and about $500 on the NOx side. And we've seen some pretty big spreads out there, upwards of $5,000 in the SO2 case and $9,000 on the NOx case. So I think that's probably, at the end of the day, going to be a key driver to how much lift we see in prices when we get out to the '13, '14 timeframe."

Today, we announced reported third quarter earnings of $0.76 per share, an increase of $0.25 from the same period a year ago. For the first 9 months, the year our reported earnings were $1.91 per share compared to $1.40 through the first 3 quarters of 2010. Ongoing earnings for the third quarter were also $0.76 per share versus $0.74 in the third quarter of '10, and ongoing earnings through the 3 quarters of 2011 are $2.02 per share compared with $2.29 a year ago. We noted in our release this morning that per share ongoing earnings for both periods were affected by the issuance of common stock to fund our recent acquisitions in Kentucky and the U.K. During the quarter, our solid performance from our newly acquired businesses in Kentucky and the United Kingdom helped overcome earnings pressure on our competitive Supply business and our Pennsylvania Delivery business. And we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve the economic performance we projected for the expanded U.K. business. Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment, strong international segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities' distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. The improvements were offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment driven by higher price hedges rolling off, unplanned outages to replace turbine blades and our Susquehanna nuclear units and store restorations expenses in Pennsylvania and the dilution I spoke of from the equity issuances for the acquisitions. The integration of our new operations in the U.K. has been extremely successful to date. Our operating models in place for WPD Midlands and our U.K. team are showing significant positive results for customers and shareholders. We remain on-track to complete this integration by the end of the year and at a cost below our estimate of the time we announced the acquisition in April. 
Let's turn to the 2011 forecast. We're pleased to announce that we're increasing the 2011 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.55 to $2.75 per share from the previous $2.50 to $2.75 per share. The increase was made possible by strong performance of our portfolio, our regulated businesses, coupled with the ability of our competitive Supply business to overcome the margin impact of the unexpected outages at the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So clearly, the larger more weak regulated PPL has provided significant advantages for our shareholders. And our significant regulated infrastructure investment opportunities are expected to provide sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for the years to come. 
Compound annual growth rate in the consolidated regulated asset base projected to be about 9% over the next 5 years. Further to that, more than 2/3 of plan CapEx as we've mentioned earlier will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near, realtime recovery of those expenditures. It's important to note that we made some progress in this quarter of legislation in Pennsylvania and allow the regulator to consider methods to reduce the frequency of rate cases and reduced regulatory lag on distribution investments made by utilities in the well. We're hopeful that this legislation, which already has past the state house the received Senate approval and government signature by the end of the year. Also, our Supply segment remains well-positioned to the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity in power prices. 
There's good news for our investors here as well. The recent finalization of cross-state air pollution rules, crack spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to higher power prices beginning in late '13 or early '14. And now I'll turn the call over to Paul for detailed financial results. Paul?"
185508,142141990,184191,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive",765,"Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive drivers were significantly offset by dilution resulting from the common stock issued in April of this year to fund our central networks acquisition, lower margins at our Supply segment and higher store restorations expenses in our Pennsylvania regulated segments. 
While there's no comparator for 2010 performance for Kentucky, that acquisition didn't close until November 1 of last year, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, holding company cost of LTE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Let's now move to the international segment drivers on Slide 7. Our international regulated segment earned $0.22 per share in the third quarter, a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results from utility, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses resulting from higher Delivery revenues primarily due to higher pricings, partially offset by higher pension and other operating expenses, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earn $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a $0.03 decline from last year. The decrease was a net result of higher Delivery margins primarily due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect on January 1, higher primarily due to higher store restorations expenses and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 9, office supply. This segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.18 per share compared to last year. Lower Q3 earnings were driven by lower energy and capacity pricings in the East and higher-delivered coal prices partially offset by higher margins on full requirements sales contract and higher baseload generation. Higher income taxes and finally dilution of $0.07 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends. A change in cash from operations in the second quarter earnings call is driven by slightly higher expected operating results and a change in working capital, including lower expected return collateral from third parties. Cash flow are also impacted by lower projected capital expenditures primarily in the Kentucky regulated and supply segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our dividend clearly remain the key element of total shareowner return, but as we outlined here, the current dividend is covered out of rate regulated business earnings. The combination of Midland acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility business, as Jim mentioned, clearly permit us flexibility to look at dividend growth. 
Moving over to Slide 12 now. And as we indicated, we were due in the second quarter earnings call the providing some modeling parameters for the enlarged WPD related to future earnings. I'd like to remind everyone that we provided WPD net income figures for 2011 to 2013 in the materials earlier this year. Let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 5.5% per year plus inflation for the balance the balance of the period ending March 31, 2015, plus any annual incentive awards for performance. 
After achieving the Midlands integration efficiencies from that acquisition, most of the operating cost should increase with inflation, although depreciation expense will increase at a higher rate due to increased levels of capital investment. Pension expense is expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 50 million by 2015 and decrease modestly thereafter. interest expense, most of our debt is fixed-rate debt except for about $365 million under inflation rate. I would expect that we will maintain our current cap structure as we drove the U.K. rate base and balance sheet, which is comprised of 65% debt throughout the -- and 80% debt to the curve levels. And for the foreseeable future, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 24% for that segment. Combining new drivers with the foreign currency translation rate, you should be reasonably determine the international regulated segment's future earnings contribution. Again, we provided the projected net income figures of for 2011 through '13 earlier this year when we announced the deal and subsequently issued the equity using a $1.60 per sterling transaction rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

Let's turn now to Slide 13 and start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of",1275,"Okay. Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 13 and start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of major regulatory developments this past month in both the distribution and transmission businesses. On October 4, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed House Bill 1294 with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 183 to 18. This bill is intended to clarify the authority of the Pennsylvania PUC to approve a request for alternative rate making mechanisms by regulated utility such as PPL. We strongly support the bill on its current performance as we believe that it will help reduce regulatory lag currently experienced on certain distribution-related capital expenditures and add meaningful benefits for our customers. House Bill 1294 has been referred to the state senate, while it will work through a similar process at the house. We are hopeful that the bill will pass the senate this year and will be sent to the governor for the signature. With respect to Pennsylvania transmission, on October 5, President Obama announced the initial list of projects under the newly formed federal rapid response team for transmission. PPL's Susquehanna Roseland power lines was named for this initial list. The rapid response team is expected to accelerate review and permitting of Transmission Line projects to increase reliability and save consumers' money by modernizing the grid. Susquehanna Roseland under review by the National Park Service, which is performing an environmental impact statement. We look forward to working with the rapid response team as we have been with the National Park Service to ensure a thorough and comprehensive review in a timely manner that will support availability of the new line by early 2015. 
The fact Susquehanna Roseland was added to the initial list shows the Obama administration recognizes the importance of the new power line and the need for swift action on federal permits. We continue to be very optimistic about an in-service date in the spring of 2015, with heavy construction to begin in 2013. In addition to positive regulatory developments in Pennsylvania, we also saw a positive operational execution during the quarter after some of the worst storms to East Coast has seen for quite sometime. In late August, Hurricane Irene left significant damage to the electrical equipment downing trees, wires and destroying -- It was the second worst storm our Pennsylvania utility has experienced in the past 20 years. Our skilled and dedicated workforce was up to the task of restoring power to more than 400,000 customers in a 3-day time period. We thank de crews from other utilities that came to assist in the restoration efforts, and in particular, we would like to think crews from LG&E and KU. Unfortunately, those same folks have been put to the test again this past week. We've experienced our fourth major storm of 2011 last Saturday with ice and heavy snow accumulation on trees and power lines, which affected 10 transmission lines and scores of distribution lines in the Lehigh Valley causing 320,000 total customers to lose firepower. Once again, crews have been doing a great job recovery from in some areas in even more devastating storm than Hurricane Irene. We did not expect a significant impact to our earnings as a result of all these storms. Some cost will be capitalized or covered by insurance. And for the remaining costs, we will seek deferral for future consideration. 
Moving to Kentucky. We filed a certificate of public convenience with the KPSC on September 15. This certificate requested approval to build our 640-megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating unit at the existing site, as well as approval to purchase 3 simple cycle natural gas turbines from Bluegrass Generation Company. These turbines will provide up to 495 megawatts of future generation. These requests were filed to cost-effectively meet new stricter EPA regulations. It will likely be necessary for us to retire 3 coal-fired generating station at Green River and Tyrone totaling 800 megawatts. We requested that the KPSC rule on the CKCN April of 2012. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for an update of the international regulated segments. Execution of integration plans for the Midlands operations remain solely on track in all respects. The organizational structure, reorganization plans have been finalized and implementation has already begun. The total estimated cost to reorganization is $102 million pretax. The integration is progressing as scheduled, and we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 7 months of ownership. As originally contemplated, we are on plan to complete the final organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. Completion of these work will allow us to achieve the efficiency savings that we shared with investors when we announced the acquisition in April. We will provide you with a more detailed update at the PPI financial conference next week. We plan to illustrate our U.K. team, including the Midlands employees are already beginning to deliver value to customers and shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 15. We've outlined sales volumes by major customer classes in Kentucky. In summary, retail sales for the quarter were relatively in line with the prior year on a weather-normalized basis but remain challenged by lackluster economic conditions. Residential and commercial volumes both declined somewhat over the most recent 12-month period. Customer growth has not materialized, and usage rates per customer have also decline. Industrial sales are generally driven by specific plant issues. For the 12-month period, we saw increased production at some of our larger industrial customers compared to the prior 12-month period. 
Moving to Slide 16. We provided details on sales volume variance as for PPL Electric Utilities. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest slow growth and the addition of new customers. Commercial industrial sales were lower for the quarter, reflecting slower economic recovery in the region from levels experienced in 2010. 
On Slide 17, we provide our normal detail on a competitive Supply segment hedges. The baseload power hedge levels for the remainder of 2011 are 100%, and prices are essentially the same as their previous disclosure. We've adjusted our expected generation outputs for 2011 to reflect actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we adjusted some power hedges in the East for 2012, but we anticipate being fully hedged before we start the year. For 2013 our hedge profile is now at 72% as we've layered in some additional hedges. By the end of this quarter, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. We're of course ahead of that schedule somewhat as we took advantage of favorable power price rallies. Over 50% of the 2013 hedges were done with callers, so we do spend the capture upside of these hedges should price move higher. But of course, we protected against the downside that the CSAPR impact is less than expected before natural gas prices softened further. Of course, we would still have the remainder of our unhedged 2013 baseload production and most of our gas-fired capacity available to capture benefit of strengthening our prices should that occur. As Jim mentioned, we maintained an optimistic view for 2014 believing that the confluence of CSAPR implementation, prospects for economic recovery and firming gas prices could further expand heat rates. Our generation business is expected to benefit in that type of environment. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."

Today, we announced reported third quarter earnings of $0.76 per share, an increase of $0.25 from the same period a year ago. For the first 9 months of the year our reported earnings are $1.91 per share compared to $1.40 through the first 3 quarters of 2010. Ongoing earnings for the third quarter were also $0.76 per share versus $0.74 in the third quarter of '10, and ongoing earnings through the 3 quarters of 2011 are $2.02 per share compared with $2.29 a year ago. We noted in our release this morning that per share ongoing earnings for both periods were affected by the issuance of common stock to fund our recent acquisitions in Kentucky and the U.K. During the quarter, our solid performance from our newly acquired businesses in Kentucky and the United Kingdom helped overcome earnings pressure on our competitive Supply business and our Pennsylvania Delivery business, and we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve the economic performance we projected for the expanded U.K. business. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment, strong international segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities' distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. The improvements were offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment driven by higher-priced hedges rolling off, unplanned outages to replace turbine blades and our Susquehanna nuclear units and higher storm restorations expenses in Pennsylvania and the dilution I spoke of from the equity issuances for the acquisitions. 
The integration of our new operations in the U.K. has been extremely successful to date. Our operating models in place for WPD Midlands and our U.K. team is showing significant positive results for customers and share owners. We remain on-track to complete this integration by the end of the year and at a cost below our estimate at the time we announce the acquisition in April. 
Let's turn to the 2011 forecast. We're pleased to announce that we're increasing the 2011 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.55 to $2.75 per share from the previous $2.50 to $2.75 per share. The increase was made possible by the strong performance of our portfolio of regulated businesses, coupled with the ability of our competitive Supply business to overcome the margin impact of the unexpected outages at the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So clearly, the larger more rate-regulated PPL has provided significant advantages for our share owners. And our significant regulated infrastructure investment opportunities are expected to provide sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for the years to come. 
Compound annual growth rate in the consolidated regulated asset base projected to be about 9% over the next 5 years. Further to that, more than 2/3 of plan CapEx as we've mentioned earlier, will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near, realtime recovery of those expenditures. It's important to note that we made some progress in this quarter on legislation in Pennsylvania and allow the regulator to consider methods to reduce the frequency of rate cases and reduced regulatory lag on distribution investments made by utilities in the Commonwealth. We're hopeful that this legislation, which already has passed the state house, will receive Senate approval and Governor Corbett's signature by the end of the year. Also, our Supply segment remains well-provisioned to the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity in power prices.
There's good news for our investors here as well. The recent finalization of cross-state air pollution rules, burning [ph] spark spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to higher power prices beginning in late '13 or early '14. And now I'll turn the call over to Paul for detailed financial results. Paul?"
185508,142141990,184534,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive",785,"Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive drivers were significantly offset by dilution resulting from the common stock issued in April of this year to fund our central networks acquisition, lower margins at our Supply segment and higher storm restoration expenses in our Pennsylvania regulated segment. 
While there's no comparator for 2010 performance for Kentucky, because that acquisition didn't close until November 1 of last year, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, holding company cost of LKE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Let's now move to the international segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our international regulated segment earned $0.22 per share in the third quarter, a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utility, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses resulting from higher Delivery revenues primarily due to higher pricings, partially offset by higher pension and other operating expenses, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a $0.03 decline from last year. The decrease was the net result of higher delivery margins primarily due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect on January 1, higher O&M primarily due to higher storm restoration expenses and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 9, for supply. This segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.18 per share compared to last year. Lower Q3 earnings were driven by lower energy and capacity pricings in the East and higher-delivered coal prices partially offset by higher margins on full requirements sales contracts and higher baseload generation, higher income taxes and finally dilution of $0.07 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends. The change in cash from operations since the second quarter earnings call is driven by slightly higher expected operating results and a change in working capital, including lower expected return of collateral from third parties. Cash flow are also impacted by lower projected capital expenditures primarily in the Kentucky regulated and Supply segments. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our dividend clearly remains the key element of total share owner return. And as we outlined here, the current dividend is covered out of rate-regulated business earnings. The combination of the Midlands acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility business that Jim mentioned clearly permit us flexibility to look at dividend growth. 
Moving over to Slide 12 now. And as we indicated, we were due in the second quarter earnings call. We're providing some modeling parameters for the enlarged WPD related to future earnings. I'd like to remind everyone that we provided WPD net income figures for 2011 to 2013 to the roadshow materials earlier this year. Let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 5.5% per year plus inflation for the balance the balance of the price-controller [ph] period that ends March 31, 2015, plus any annual incentive awards earned through performance. 
After achieving the Midlands integration efficiencies from that acquisition, most of the operating cost should increase with inflation, although depreciation expense will increase at a higher rate due to increased levels of capital investment. Pension expense is expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 50 million by 2013 and a decrease modestly thereafter. In calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed-rate debt except for about GBP 365 million that is inflation-linked. I would expect that we will maintain our current cap structure as we grow the U.K. rate base and balance sheet, which is comprised of 65% debt-to-RAV at the Yacos [ph] and 80% debt-to-RAV at the holdco [ph] levels. 
And for the foreseeable future, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 24% for that segment. Combining new drivers with a foreign currency translation rate, you should be able to reasonably determine the international regulated segment's future earnings contribution. Again, we provided the projected net income figures for 2011 through '13 back earlier this year when we announced the deal and subsequently issued the equity using a $1.60 per sterling translation rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

Let's turn now to Slide 13, start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of ma",1279,"Okay. Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 13, start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of major regulatory developments this past month in both the Distribution and Transmission businesses. On October 4, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed House Bill 1294 with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 183 to 18. This bill is intended to clarify the authority of the Pennsylvania PUC to approve a request for alternative rate-making mechanisms by regulated utilities such as PPL. 
We strongly support the bill on its current form as we believe that it will help reduce regulatory lag currently experienced on certain distribution-related capital expenditures and add meaningful benefits for our customers. House Bill 1294 has been referred to the State Senate, where it will work through a similar process at the House. We're hopeful the bill will pass the Senate this year and will be sent to the governor for the signature. 
With respect to Pennsylvania transmission, on October 5, President Obama announced the initial list of projects under the newly formed federal rapid response team for transmission. PPL's Susquehanna-Roseland power lines was named to this initial list. The rapid response team is expected to accelerate review and permitting of Transmission Line projects to increase reliability and save consumers' money by modernizing the grid. Susquehanna-Roseland remains under review by the National Park Service, which is performing an environmental impact statement. We look forward to working with the rapid response team as we have been with the National Park Service to ensure a thorough and comprehensive review in a timely manner that will support availability of the new line by early 2015. The fact Susquehanna-Roseland was added to the initial list shows the Obama administration recognizes the importance of the new power line and the need for swift action on federal permits. We continue to be very optimistic about an in-service date in the spring of 2015, with heavy construction to begin in 2013. 
In addition to positive regulatory developments in Pennsylvania, we also saw a positive operational execution during the quarter after some of the worst storms the East Coast has seen for quite sometime. In late August, Hurricane Irene left significant damage to the electrical equipment downing trees on wires and destroying  poles. It was the second worst storm our Pennsylvania utility has experienced in the past 20 years. Our skilled and dedicated workforce was up to the task of restoring power to more than 400,000 customers in a 3-day time period. We thank the crews from other utilities that came to assist in the restoration efforts, and in particular, we would like to think crews from LG&E and KU. 
Unfortunately, those same folks have been put to the test again this past week. We've experienced our fourth major storm of 2011 last Saturday with ice and heavy snow accumulation on trees and power lines, which affected 10 transmission lines and scores of distribution lines in the Lehigh Valley causing 320,000 total customers to lose power. Once again, crews have been doing a great job recovery from in some areas an even more devastating storm than Hurricane Irene. We did not expect a significant impact to our earnings as a result of all these storms. Some cost will be capitalized or covered by insurance. And for the remaining cost, we will seek deferral for future consideration. 
Moving to Kentucky. We filed a certificate of public convenience with the KPSC on September 15. This certificate requested approval to build our 640-megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating unit at the existing Cane Run site, as well as approval to purchase 3 simple cycle natural gas turbines from Bluegrass Generation Company. These turbines will provide up to 495 megawatts of future [ph] generation. These requests were filed to cost-effectively meet new stricter EPA regulations. It will likely be necessary for us to retire 3 coal-fired generating stations at cane Run, Green River and Tyrone, totaling 800 megawatts. We requested that the KPSC rule on the CKCN [ph] by April of 2012. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for an update of the International Regulated segments. Execution of integration plans for the Midlands operations remain solely on track in all respects. The organizational structure, reorganization plans have been finalized and implementation has already begun. The total estimated cost to reorganization is $102 million pretax. The integration is progressing as scheduled, and we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 7 months of ownership. As originally contemplated, we are on plan to complete the final organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. Completion of this work will allow us to achieve the efficiency savings that we shared with investors when we announced the acquisition in April. We will provide you with a more detailed update at the EEI Financial Conference next week. We plan to illustrate how our U.K. team, including the Midlands employees, are already beginning to deliver value to customers and shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 15. We've outlined sales volumes by major customer classes in Kentucky. In summary, retail sales for the quarter were relatively in line with the prior year on a weather-normalized basis but remain challenged by lackluster economic conditions. Residential and commercial volumes both declined somewhat over the most recent 12-month period. Customer growth has not materialized, and usage rates per customer have also declined. Industrial sales are generally driven by specific plant issues. For the 12-month period, we saw increased production at some of our larger industrial customers compared to the prior 12-month period. 
Moving to Slide 16. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest slow growth and the addition of new customers. Commercial industrial sales were lower for the quarter, reflecting slower economic recovery in the region from levels experienced in 2010. 
On Slide 17, we provide our normal detail on the competitive Supply segment hedges. The baseload power hedge levels for the remainder of 2011 are 100%, and prices are essentially the same as our previous disclosure. We've adjusted our expected generation outputs for 2011 to reflect actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we adjusted some power hedges in the East for 2012, but we anticipate being fully hedged before we start the year. For 2013 our hedge profile is now at 72% as we've layered in some additional hedges. 
By the end of this quarter, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. We're of course ahead of that schedule somewhat as we took advantage of favorable power price rallies. Over 50% of the 2013 hedges were done with callers, so we do stand to capture upside of these hedges should prices move higher. But of course, we protected against the downside if the CSAPR impact is less than expected or forward natural gas prices softened further. Of course, we would still have the remainder of our unhedged 2013 baseload production and most of our gas-fired capacity available to capture benefits of strengthening power prices should that occur. 
As Jim mentioned, we maintained an optimistic view for 2014 believing that the confluence of CSAPR implementation, prospects for an economic recovery and firming gas prices could further expand heat rates. Our generation business is expected to benefit in that type of environment. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."

Today, we announced reported third quarter earnings of $0.76 per share, an increase of $0.25 from the same period a year ago. For the first 9 months of the year our reported earnings are $1.91 per share compared to $1.40 through the first 3 quarters of 2010. Ongoing earnings for the third quarter were also $0.76 per share versus $0.74 in the third quarter of '10, and ongoing earnings through the 3 quarters of 2011 are $2.02 per share compared with $2.29 a year ago. We noted in our release this morning that per share ongoing earnings for both periods were affected by the issuance of common stock to fund our recent acquisitions in Kentucky and the U.K. During the quarter, our solid performance from our newly acquired businesses in Kentucky and the United Kingdom helped overcome earnings pressure on our competitive Supply business and our Pennsylvania Delivery business, and we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve the economic performance we projected for the expanded U.K. business. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment, strong international segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities' distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. The improvements were offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment driven by higher-priced hedges rolling off, unplanned outages to replace turbine blades and our Susquehanna nuclear units and higher storm restorations expenses in Pennsylvania and the dilution I spoke of from the equity issuances for the acquisitions. 
The integration of our new operations in the U.K. has been extremely successful to date. Our new operating models in place for WPD Midlands and our U.K. team is showing significant positive results for customers and share owners. We remain on-track to complete this integration by the end of the year and at a cost below our estimate at the time we announced the acquisition in April. 
Let's turn to the 2011 forecast. We're pleased to announce that we're increasing the 2011 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.55 to $2.75 per share from the previous $2.50 to $2.75 per share. The increase was made possible by the strong performance of our portfolio of regulated businesses, coupled with the ability of our competitive Supply business to overcome the margin impact of the unexpected outages at the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So clearly, the larger more rate-regulated PPL has provided significant advantages for our share owners. And our significant regulated infrastructure investment opportunities are expected to provide sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for the years to come. 
Compound annual growth rate in the consolidated regulated asset base projected to be about 9% over the next 5 years. Further to that, more than 2/3 of plan CapEx, as we've mentioned earlier, will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near, realtime recovery of those expenditures. It's important to note that we made some progress in this quarter on legislation in Pennsylvania that will allow the regulator to consider methods to reduce the frequency of rate cases and reduce regulatory lag on distribution investments made by utilities in the Commonwealth. We're hopeful that this legislation, which already has passed the state house, will receive Senate approval and Governor Corbett's signature by the end of the year. Also, our Supply segment remains well-positioned to the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity in power prices.
There's good news for our investors here as well. The recent finalization of cross-state air pollution rules, firming [ph] spark spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to how high power prices beginning in late '13 or early '14. And now I'll turn the call over to Paul for detailed financial results. Paul?"
185508,142141990,184622,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive",783,"Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive drivers were significantly offset by dilution resulting from the common stock issued in April of this year to fund our central networks acquisition, lower margins on our Supply segment and higher storm restoration expenses in our Pennsylvania regulated segment. 
While there's no comparator for 2010 performance for Kentucky, because that acquisition didn't close until November 1 of last year, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, holding company cost of LKE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Let's now move to the international segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our international regulated segment earned $0.22 per share in the third quarter, a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses resulting from higher Delivery revenues primarily due to higher prices, partially offset by higher pension and other operating expenses, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a $0.03 decline from last year. The decrease was the net result of higher delivery margins primarily due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect on January 1, higher O&M primarily due to higher storm restoration expenses and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 9, for supply. This segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.18 per share compared to last year. Lower Q3 earnings were driven by lower energy and capacity pricings in the East and higher-delivered coal prices partially offset by higher margins on full requirements sales contracts and higher baseload generation, higher income taxes and finally dilution of $0.07 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends. The change in cash from operations since the second quarter earnings call is driven by slightly higher expected operating results and a change in working capital, including lower expected return of collateral from third parties. Cash flows are also impacted by lower projected capital expenditures, primarily in the Kentucky regulated and Supply segments. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our dividend clearly remains the key element of total share owner return. And as we outlined here, the current dividend is covered out of rate-regulated business earnings. The combination of the Midlands acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility businesses that Jim mentioned clearly permit us flexibility to look at dividend growth. 
Moving over to Slide 12 now. And as we indicated, we would do in the second quarter earnings call, we're providing some modeling parameters for the enlarged WPD related to future earnings. I'd like to remind everyone that we provided WPD net income figures for 2011 to 2013 to the roadshow materials earlier this year. Let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 5.5% per year plus inflation for the balance of the price-controller [ph] period that ends March 31, 2015, plus any annual incentive awards earned through performance. 
After achieving the Midlands integration efficiencies from that acquisition, most of the operating cost should increase with inflation, although depreciation expense will increase at a higher rate due to increased levels of capital investment. Pension expense is expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 50 million by 2013 and then decrease modestly thereafter. In calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed-rate debt except for about GBP 365 million that is inflation-linked. I would expect that we will maintain our current cap structure as we grow the U.K. rate base and balance sheet, which is comprised of 65% debt-to-RAV at the Yacos [ph] and 80% debt-to-RAV at the holdco [ph] levels. 
And for the foreseeable future, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 24% for that segment. Combining new drivers with a foreign currency translation rate, you should be able to reasonably determine the international regulated segment's future earnings contribution. Again, we provided the projected net income figures for 2011 through '13 back earlier this year when we announced the deal and subsequently issued the equity using a $1.60 per sterling translation rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

Let's turn now to Slide 13, start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance.

Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of major regulatory developments this past month in both the Distribution and Transmission businesses. On October 4, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed House Bill 1294 with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 183 to 18. This bill is intended to clarify the authority of the Pennsylvania PUC to approve a request for alternative rate-making mechanisms by regulated utilities such as PPL. 
We strongly support the bill in its current form, as we believe that it will help reduce regulatory lag currently experienced on certain distribution-related capital expenditures and add meaningful benefits for our customers. House Bill 1294 has been referred to the State Senate, where it will work through a similar process as the House. We're hopeful the bill will pass the Senate this year and will be sent to the governor for the signature. 
With respect to Pennsylvania transmission, on October 5, President Obama announced the initial list of projects under the newly formed federal rapid response team for transmission. PPL's Susquehanna-Roseland power lines was named to this initial list. The rapid response team is expected to accelerate review and permitting of Transmission Line projects to increase reliability and save consumers' money by modernizing the grid. Susquehanna-Roseland remains under review by the National Park Service, which is performing an environmental impact statement. We look forward to working with the rapid response team, as we have been with the National Park Service, to ensure a thorough and comprehensive review in a timely manner that will support availability of the new line by early 2015. The fact Susquehanna-Roseland was added to the initial list shows the Obama administration recognizes the importance of the new power line and the need for swift action on federal permits. We continue to be very optimistic about an in-service date in the spring of 2015, with heavy construction to begin in 2013. 
In addition to positive regulatory developments in Pennsylvania, we also saw a positive operational execution during the quarter after some of the worst storms the East Coast has seen in quite some time. In late August, Hurricane Irene left significant damage to the electrical equipment, downing trees on wires and destroying  poles. It was the second worst storm our Pennsylvania utility has experienced in the past 20 years. Our skilled and dedicated workforce was up to the task of restoring power to more than 400,000 customers in a 3-day time period. We thank the crews from other utilities that came to assist in the restoration efforts, and in particular, we would like to thank the crews from LG&E and KU. 
Unfortunately, those same folks have been put to the test again this past week. We've experienced our fourth major storm of 2011 last Saturday with ice and heavy snow accumulation on trees and power lines, which affected 10 transmission lines and scores of distribution lines in the Lehigh Valley causing 320,000 total customers to lose power. Once again, crews have been doing a great job recovery from in some areas an even more devastating storm than Hurricane Irene. We do not expect a significant impact to our earnings as a result of all these storms. Some costs will be capitalized or covered by insurance. And for the remaining costs, we will seek deferral for future consideration. 
Moving to Kentucky. We filed a certificate of public convenience with the KPSC on September 15. This certificate requested approval to build a 640-megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating unit at the existing Cane Run site, as well as approval to purchase 3 simple cycle natural gas turbines from Bluegrass Generation Company. These turbines will provide up to 495 megawatts of DC [ph] generation. These requests were filed to cost-effectively meet new stricter EPA regulations. It will likely be necessary for us to retire 3 coal-fired generating stations at Cane Run, Green River and Tyrone, totaling 800 megawatts. We requested that the KPSC rule on the CKCN [ph] by April of 2012. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for an update of the International Regulated segments. Execution of integration plans for the Midlands operations remain solidly on track in all respects. The organizational structure, reorganizational plans have been finalized and implementation has already begun. The total estimated cost to reorganization is $102 million pretax. The integration is progressing as scheduled, and we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 7 months of ownership. As originally contemplated, we are on plan to complete the final organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. Completion of this work will allow us to achieve the efficiency savings that we shared with investors when we announced the acquisition in April. We will provide you with a more detailed update at the EEI Financial Conference next week. We plan to illustrate how our U.K. team, including the Midlands employees, are already beginning to deliver value to customers and share owners. 
Moving to Slide 15. We've outlined sales volumes by major customer classes in Kentucky. In summary, retail sales for the quarter were relatively in line with the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, but remain challenged by lackluster economic conditions. Residential and commercial volumes both declined somewhat over the most recent 12-month period. Customer growth has not materialized, and usage rates per customer have also declined. Industrial sales are generally driven by specific plant issues. For the 12-month period, we saw increased production at some of our larger industrial customers compared to the prior 12-month period. 
Moving to Slide 16. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest slow growth and the addition of new customers. Commercial industrial sales were lower for the quarter, reflecting slower economic recovery in the region from levels experienced in 2010. 
On Slide 17, we provide our normal detail on the competitive Supply segment hedges. The baseload power hedge levels for the remainder of 2011 are 100%, and prices are essentially the same as our previous disclosure. We've adjusted our expected generation outputs for 2011 to reflect actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we adjusted some power hedges in the East for 2012, but we anticipate being fully hedged before we start the year. For 2013 our hedge profile is now at 72% as we've layered in some additional hedges. 
By the end of this quarter, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. We're of course ahead of that schedule somewhat as we took advantage of favorable power price rallies. Over 50% of the 2013 hedges were done with callers, so we do stand to capture upside of these hedges should prices move higher. But of course, we protected against the downside if the CSAPR impact is less than expected or forward natural gas prices soften further. Of course, we would still have the remainder of our unhedged 2013 baseload production and most of our gas-fired capacity available to capture benefits of strengthening power prices, should that occur. 
As Jim mentioned, we maintained an optimistic view for 2014, believing that the confluence of CSAPR implementation, prospects for an economic recovery and firming gas prices could further expand heat rates. Our generation business is expected to benefit in that type of environment. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."

If we were to retire more generation on an NPB basis, that would result, in our view, in a much higher cost for the consumer. And that last plant that cleared the hurdle, if you will, in terms of making retrofits, again on an NPB basis, would not result in the most economic decision on the behalf of the customers. So I think we're in good shape there.

And that I would expect that we would be able to slightly or modestly outperform some of the synergy numbers that we outlined, given that the amount of cost that we're taking out is slightly ahead of plan as well."

Today, we announced reported third quarter earnings of $0.76 per share, an increase of $0.25 from the same period a year ago. For the first 9 months of the year our reported earnings are $1.91 per share compared to $1.40 through the first 3 quarters of 2010. Ongoing earnings for the third quarter were also $0.76 per share versus $0.74 in the third quarter of '10, and ongoing earnings through the 3 quarters of 2011 are $2.02 per share compared with $2.29 a year ago. We noted in our release this morning that per share ongoing earnings for both periods were affected by the issuance of common stock to fund our recent acquisitions in Kentucky and the U.K. During the quarter, our solid performance from our newly acquired businesses in Kentucky and the United Kingdom helped overcome earnings pressure on our competitive Supply business and our Pennsylvania Delivery business, and we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve the economic performance we projected for the expanded U.K. business. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, earnings performance was driven by the contribution of our Kentucky regulated segment, strong international segment performance and by the PPL Electric Utilities' distribution rate increase that took effect January 1. The improvements were offset by lower energy margins in our Supply segment driven by higher-priced hedges rolling off, unplanned outages to replace turbine blades and our Susquehanna nuclear units and higher storm restorations expenses in Pennsylvania and the dilution I spoke of from the equity issuances for the acquisitions. 
The integration of our new operations in the U.K. has been extremely successful to date. Our new operating models in place for WPD Midlands and our U.K. team is showing significant positive results for customers and share owners. We remain on-track to complete this integration by the end of the year and at a cost below our estimate at the time we announced the acquisition in April. 
Let's turn to the 2011 forecast. We're pleased to announce that we're increasing the 2011 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.55 to $2.75 per share from the previous $2.50 to $2.75 per share. The increase was made possible by the strong performance of our portfolio of regulated businesses, coupled with the ability of our competitive Supply business to overcome the margin impact of the unexpected outages at the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So clearly, the larger more rate-regulated PPL has provided significant advantages for our share owners. And our significant regulated infrastructure investment opportunities are expected to provide sustained growth in each of our regulated businesses for the years to come. 
Compound annual growth rate in the consolidated regulated asset base projected to be about 9% over the next 5 years. Further to that, more than 2/3 of plan CapEx, as we've mentioned earlier, will be made under regulatory structures that allow for near, real-time recovery of those expenditures. It's important to note that we made some progress in this quarter on legislation in Pennsylvania that will allow the regulator to consider methods to reduce the frequency of rate cases and reduce regulatory lag on distribution investments made by utilities in the Commonwealth. We're hopeful that this legislation, which already has passed the state house, will receive Senate approval and Governor Corbett's signature by the end of the year. Also, our Supply segment remains well-positioned to the eventual rebound of competitive wholesale capacity in power prices.
There's good news for our investors here as well. The recent finalization of cross-state air pollution rules, firming [ph] spark spreads and the potential for a recovering economy point to how -- higher power prices beginning in late '13 or early '14. And now I'll turn the call over to Paul for detailed financial results. Paul?"
185508,142141990,184887,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive",783,"Thanks, Jim and, good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 6 to review our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year primarily due to the performance of our newly acquired utility. These positive drivers were significantly offset by dilution resulting from the common stock issued in April of this year to fund our central networks acquisition, lower margins on our Supply segment and higher storm restoration expenses in our Pennsylvania regulated segment. 
While there's no comparator for 2010 performance for Kentucky, because that acquisition didn't close until November 1 of last year, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky segment earnings include the operating results of KU and LG&E, holding company cost of LKE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.03 per share. 
Let's now move to the international segment earnings drivers on Slide 7. Our international regulated segment earned $0.22 per share in the third quarter, a $0.10 increase over last year. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, including interest expense of $0.02 per share associated with 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses resulting from higher Delivery revenues primarily due to higher prices, partially offset by higher pension and other operating expenses, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a $0.03 decline from last year. The decrease was the net result of higher delivery margins primarily due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect on January 1, higher O&M primarily due to higher storm restoration expenses and dilution of $0.01 per share. 
Turning now to Slide 9, for supply. This segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.18 per share compared to last year. Lower Q3 earnings were driven by lower energy and capacity pricings in the East and higher-delivered coal prices partially offset by higher margins on full requirements sales contracts and higher baseload generation, higher income taxes and finally dilution of $0.07 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've updated our projected 2011 free cash flow before dividends. The change in cash from operations since the second quarter earnings call is driven by slightly higher expected operating results and a change in working capital, including lower expected return of collateral from third parties. Cash flows are also impacted by lower projected capital expenditures, primarily in the Kentucky regulated and Supply segments. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our dividend clearly remains the key element of total share owner return. And as we outlined here, the current dividend is covered out of rate-regulated business earnings. The combination of the Midlands acquisition and the growth prospects of our utility businesses that Jim mentioned clearly permit us flexibility to look at dividend growth. 
Moving over to Slide 12 now. And as we indicated, we would do in the second quarter earnings call, we're providing some modeling parameters for the enlarged WPD related to future earnings. I'd like to remind everyone that we provided WPD net income figures for 2011 to 2013 to the roadshow materials earlier this year. Let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 5.5% per year plus inflation for the balance of the price-controller [ph] period that ends March 31, 2015, plus any annual incentive awards earned through performance. 
After achieving the Midlands integration efficiencies from that acquisition, most of the operating cost should increase with inflation, although depreciation expense will increase at a higher rate due to increased levels of capital investment. Pension expense is expected to increase from GBP 20 million in 2011 to GBP 50 million by 2013 and then decrease modestly thereafter. In calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed-rate debt except for about GBP 365 million that is inflation-linked. I would expect that we will maintain our current cap structure as we grow the U.K. rate base and balance sheet, which is comprised of 65% debt-to-RAV at the Yacos [ph] and 80% debt-to-RAV at the holdco [ph] levels. 
And for the foreseeable future, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 24% for that segment. Combining new drivers with a foreign currency translation rate, you should be able to reasonably determine the international regulated segment's future earnings contribution. Again, we provided the projected net income figures for 2011 through '13 back earlier this year when we announced the deal and subsequently issued the equity using a $1.60 per sterling translation rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."
185508,142141990,184887,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 13, start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of ma",1282,"Okay. Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 13, start with an operational review of the third quarter. Overall, as Paul noted, we had another very good quarter of financial performance. In Pennsylvania, we had a couple of major regulatory developments this past month in both the Distribution and Transmission businesses. On October 4, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed House Bill 1294 with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 183 to 18. This bill is intended to clarify the authority of the Pennsylvania PUC to approve a request for alternative rate-making mechanisms by regulated utilities such as PPL. 
We strongly support the bill in its current form, as we believe that it will help reduce regulatory lag currently experienced on certain distribution-related capital expenditures and add meaningful benefits for our customers. House Bill 1294 has been referred to the State Senate, where it will work through a similar process as the House. We're hopeful the bill will pass the Senate this year and will be sent to the governor for the signature. 
With respect to Pennsylvania transmission, on October 5, President Obama announced the initial list of projects under the newly formed federal rapid response team for transmission. PPL's Susquehanna-Roseland power lines was named to this initial list. The rapid response team is expected to accelerate review and permitting of Transmission Line projects to increase reliability and save consumers' money by modernizing the grid. Susquehanna-Roseland remains under review by the National Park Service, which is performing an environmental impact statement. We look forward to working with the rapid response team, as we have been with the National Park Service, to ensure a thorough and comprehensive review in a timely manner that will support availability of the new line by early 2015. The fact Susquehanna-Roseland was added to the initial list shows the Obama administration recognizes the importance of the new power line and the need for swift action on federal permits. We continue to be very optimistic about an in-service date in the spring of 2015, with heavy construction to begin in 2013. 
In addition to positive regulatory developments in Pennsylvania, we also saw a positive operational execution during the quarter after some of the worst storms the East Coast has seen in quite some time. In late August, Hurricane Irene left significant damage to the electrical equipment, downing trees on wires and destroying  poles. It was the second worst storm our Pennsylvania utility has experienced in the past 20 years. Our skilled and dedicated workforce was up to the task of restoring power to more than 400,000 customers in a 3-day time period. We thank the crews from other utilities that came to assist in the restoration efforts, and in particular, we would like to thank the crews from LG&E and KU. 
Unfortunately, those same folks have been put to the test again this past week. We've experienced our fourth major storm of 2011 last Saturday with ice and heavy snow accumulation on trees and power lines, which affected 10 transmission lines and scores of distribution lines in the Lehigh Valley causing 320,000 total customers to lose power. Once again, crews have been doing a great job recovery from in some areas an even more devastating storm than Hurricane Irene. We do not expect a significant impact to our earnings as a result of all these storms. Some costs will be capitalized or covered by insurance. And for the remaining costs, we will seek deferral for future consideration. 
Moving to Kentucky. We filed a certificate of public convenience with the KPSC on September 15. This certificate requested approval to build a 640-megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating unit at the existing Cane Run site, as well as approval to purchase 3 simple cycle natural gas turbines from Bluegrass Generation Company. These turbines will provide up to 495 megawatts of DC [ph] generation. These requests were filed to cost-effectively meet new stricter EPA regulations. It will likely be necessary for us to retire 3 coal-fired generating stations at Cane Run, Green River and Tyrone, totaling 800 megawatts. We requested that the KPSC rule on the CKCN [ph] by April of 2012. 
Let's move to Slide 14 for an update of the International Regulated segments. Execution of integration plans for the Midlands operations remain solidly on track in all respects. The organizational structure, reorganizational plans have been finalized and implementation has already begun. The total estimated cost to reorganization is $102 million pretax. The integration is progressing as scheduled, and we've already seen positive movement in key operational metrics and financial results in the first 7 months of ownership. As originally contemplated, we are on plan to complete the final organizational and system changes during the fourth quarter. Completion of this work will allow us to achieve the efficiency savings that we shared with investors when we announced the acquisition in April. We will provide you with a more detailed update at the EEI Financial Conference next week. We plan to illustrate how our U.K. team, including the Midlands employees, are already beginning to deliver value to customers and share owners. 
Moving to Slide 15. We've outlined sales volumes by major customer classes in Kentucky. In summary, retail sales for the quarter were relatively in line with the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, but remain challenged by lackluster economic conditions. Residential and commercial volumes both declined somewhat over the most recent 12-month period. Customer growth has not materialized, and usage rates per customer have also declined. Industrial sales are generally driven by specific plant issues. For the 12-month period, we saw increased production at some of our larger industrial customers compared to the prior 12-month period. 
Moving to Slide 16. We provide details on sales volume variances for PPL Electric Utilities. Weather-normalized residential sales were higher for the quarter compared to the prior year due to modest slow growth and the addition of new customers. Commercial industrial sales were lower for the quarter, reflecting slower economic recovery in the region from levels experienced in 2010. 
On Slide 17, we provide our normal detail on the competitive Supply segment hedges. The baseload power hedge levels for the remainder of 2011 are 100%, and prices are essentially the same as our previous disclosure. We've adjusted our expected generation outputs for 2011 to reflect actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we adjusted some power hedges in the East for 2012, but we anticipate being fully hedged before we start the year. For 2013 our hedge profile is now at 72% as we've layered in some additional hedges. 
By the end of this quarter, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2013. We're of course ahead of that schedule somewhat as we took advantage of favorable power price rallies. Over 50% of the 2013 hedges were done with callers, so we do stand to capture upside of these hedges should prices move higher. But of course, we protected against the downside if the CSAPR impact is less than expected or forward natural gas prices soften further. Of course, we would still have the remainder of our unhedged 2013 baseload production and most of our gas-fired capacity available to capture benefits of strengthening power prices, should that occur. 
As Jim mentioned, we maintained an optimistic view for 2014, believing that the confluence of CSAPR implementation, prospects for an economic recovery and firming gas prices could further expand heat rates. Our generation business is expected to benefit in that type of environment. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim, and I look forward to your questions."
