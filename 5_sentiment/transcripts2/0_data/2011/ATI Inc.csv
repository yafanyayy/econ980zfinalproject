Overall, 2010 was a much better year than 2009 with sales up 33% to back over $4 billion in revenue. 2009 net income was up 125% to $0.72 a share. 2010 turned out to be the transition year we had forecasted. Improvements in our markets are the basis for our 2011 outlook. Disappointing as the fourth quarter may appear at $0.15 a share, it was a greatly improved bookings quarter and a good start for 2011. High-performance metals has increased its backlog by over 40% to over $650 million, and Flat-Rolled Products revenues are forecasted up 15% for the first quarter of 2011. Engineered Products bookings are stronger and continue to grow.
It was a quarter where we were impacted by $19.5 million in LIFO inventory reserve charges for nickel and other raw materials, and it was the quarter where we took added onetime charges on startup delays at our Raleigh titanium facility of $20 million. Overall, a negative $0.26 per share impact.
Our key global markets are performing well. And 2010 was the transition year to resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets beginning in 2011. We see the second half of 2011 as stronger than the first half due to a ramping aerospace market beginning in the third quarter and continuing in 2012.
For 2010, we saw strong year-on-year recovery in some key measures. ATI is now more global than ever before. Direct international sales were 32% of the total. Segment operating profit for 2010 was $356 million, a 26% increase compared to the previous year. 2010 results included a $60 million LIFO charge and a $62 million of idle facility and start-up costs. Gross cost reductions in 2010 were $135 million. We generated positive cash from operations in 2010, and we rebuilt $318 million in working capital necessary to meet increasing market demand for 2011. We also continue to modernize our facilities and enhance our manufacturing capabilities by investing $219 million of new capital.
While start-up costs were a short-term headwind in 2010, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond. The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty metal shop reduces our footprint and is expected to provide up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions. Our titanium and Superalloy Forge Facility in Bakers, North Carolina continues to obtain additional customer qualifications. It has much-needed forging and finishing capacity and new capabilities. The timing of the completion of this project looks good as demand increases from our aerospace, oil and gas and medical customers. 
The ramp up of our Raleigh, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. The sponge chemistry is meeting premium grade specifications. We are currently using Raleigh titanium production for industrial applications. We are focused on further reducing variability, standardizing the process and improving yields. We expect to be producing at a 20 million-pound annual rate by the second half of 2011. As we look at growth opportunities in 2011, our strategy continues to increase our participation in selected market sectors that demonstrate long-term secular growth trends greater than the average global GDP. These global markets represented 67% of ATI's sales in 2010. Aerospace and defense remained our largest market at over 25% of sales. Oil and gas, chemical processing industry grew to 20% of sales. Oil and gas stood out in this number, growing by over 50% compared to 2009.
Electrical energy was 17% of sales. Medical, at a record 6% of sales, was our fastest growing market, improving by over 90% in 2010 compared to 2009. This growth was driven through biomedical applications, which were mostly titanium. In addition, the new and more powerful MRI devices require considerably more of our niobium titanium wire than previous models. The performance of our key global growth markets in 2010 demonstrates the advantage of ATI's diversified global reach. As I've said, we can move our periscope to find the best available market for our products, and we do.
Strong fourth quarter order receipts provide a lot of momentum going into 2011. High Performance Metals segment's backlog at the end of 2010 increased over $650 million, 40% higher than the year-end 2009. Our titanium alloy, nickel-based alloy and specialty alloy backlog represents strong demand from the aerospace, oil and gas and medical markets. We are routinely quoting deliveries for most of these products well into the second quarter and even into the third quarter for certain product forms. The backlog of our Exotic Alloys business begun to recover during the fourth quarter, particularly when we received several orders from the chemical processing industry.
Our Flat-Rolled Products entered 2011 with a strong backlog of high-value products. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our Uniti joint venture announced the largest titanium order in its history. Uniti was chosen to supply a significant portion of the titanium strip required to make welded tubing for the world's largest seawater desalinization facility located in Saudi Arabia. In the oil and gas and chemical process industry, we booked several large orders for 2011 shipment. In addition, a number of very large orders are pending for our titanium, nickel-based alloy, specialty alloy sheet and plate. These projects are nearly all international sales for ATI.
ATI is benefiting from two alloys substitution trends that, if realized, could be significant to our sales for the next several years. First, titanium is replacing Cooper nickel alloys in large desalinization plants. Second, metallurgical bonded nickel-based alloy clad pipe is replacing conventional corrosion-resistant alloy pipe in sour gas applications. Other trends in the Flat-Rolled Products area. We improved our position in the aerospace market for titanium and nickel-based alloy sheet requirements. We also improved our position for precision rolled strip products with large global automotive parts makers. ATI is attractive to those customers because we're able to provide seamless service to their operations around the world. We also expect grain-oriented electrical steel shipments to be essentially flat in 2011 due to our long-term arrangements and a better mix of products as a result of growth in demand for high-efficiency transformers.
As global markets recover, first we see improved volume, then follows better pricing. We expect to see higher-based prices for most of our high-value products during 2011. For example, we recently announced two price increases for certain nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys and flat-rolled product forms. And also increased prices for these alloys in long product forms. In addition, Uniti, our industrial titanium joint venture, recently announced that it is increasing prices for its commercial grade titanium products.
We believe demand will increase for our stainless sheet and plate products during 2011 as the economy continues to grow. Service center activity is currently improving, and seasonally adjusted inventory levels remain below three months. In addition, pipe and tube activity continues to improve, particularly in the oil and gas, chemical processing industry, electrical energy markets. Most of the markets served by our Engineered Products segment continue to recover in 2010. Our Steel Forgings business stands out. Sales increased by over 80% compared to 2009. 78% of sales were to the transportation markets, mostly Class A trucks and to the construction and mining market, mostly large off-road vehicles and equipment. Of note, forging business has in the past cycles been a leading indicator of U.S. economic recovery.
We continue to have a strong balance sheet. Cash on hand was $432 million at the end of the year. Net debt to total capitalization improved to 24%. Total debt to capitalization improved to 34%. On January 7 of this year, ATI issued $500 million of investment grade senior notes. The new senior notes, along with $432 million of cash on hand at the end of the year and a $400 million undrawn, unsecured domestic credit facility, provide ATI with ample liquidity to meet our cash needs in 2011. These cash needs we expect to include nearly $400 million to complete the Ladish acquisition, additional investments in receivables with expected sales growth, capital investments, which are forecasted to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million in 2011, and debt maturities of approximately $125 million. Strengthen our key markets give us confidence for 2011. We believe aerospace remains a growth market for ATI, and we remain bullish. Both Boeing and Airbus have one, announced planned increases to their production schedules and two, have indicated that further production increases are being considered. Their backlogs are strong with nearly 7,000 large aircraft, and backlogs are being extended by new orders.
In 2010, both Boeing and Airbus recorded unit book to build rates greater than one. Single-aisle aircraft production rates are growing. Double-aisle aircraft production rates such as for Boeing's 777 and 747-8 are also growing. Recently, Boeing reset the first delivery for its 787 Dreamliner to the third quarter of 2011, and restarted the flight test schedule. We continue to believe that the 787 will be one of the great innovations of our time. We also believe that Boeing will ramp production of this airplane as fast as it can, and that it will challenge the supply chain. ATI will be ready to accept the challenge.
For ATI, demand is being driven by all of the aircraft production schedules mentioned. In addition, Arrow Engine spares demand is being driven by strong recovery in the passenger and freight traffic and the growing size of the global fleet. ATI is innovating for the future of aerospace. We've introduced new products to improve our customers' productivity and cost. In 2010, we announced the first long-term agreement for our use of our new seven ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications. This innovative new alloys is now being used for more parts and continues to gain share on the newest of jet engines. Following technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 alloy for titanium sheet and plate in 2010, the team is working with several aerospace, defense and non-aerospace customers who are interested in using this innovative new material. Several Fast Track development opportunities are now underway.
Turning to the oil and gas market and chemical process industry. We believe our second largest market remains a strong growth market for ATI. We've established ourselves as a global leader and a reliable source of complex, difficult to produce specialty metals. ATI is known for our industry-leading product quality, reliability and delivery performance. As a result, sales grew over 50% last year compared to 2009. ATI is well positioned in this business to provide our high-value products for downhaul cable, for piping requirements and for structural requirements used in offshore rigs. We have won and are well positioned to win additional orders for our nickel-based alloy, specialty alloys plate products for use in oil and gas pipelines. Downhole drilling and complex bookings remain very strong.
The global shale gas story creates demand for our tungsten carbide drill bit bodies and compacts, as well as directional steering tools made from our data alloy tube callers in Sheffield in the U.K. ATI is innovating for the future of the oil and gas and chemical process industry. We have industry-leading range of stainless steels. Our customers can choose the optimum alloy containing the mix of nickel and moly best suited for a wide variety of corrosive environments. 
Bookings are strong, and customers are showing high interest in machine parts made out of our new precision machine facility in Sheffield in the U.K. Those parts are being made our proprietary data specialty steels and are used for nonmagnetic drill colors. The strategic growth initiatives that we had taken allow us to first of all, improve our share and second, grow our total products in 2011. We expect 2011 total titanium shipments to increase by approximately 30% to 50 million pounds. We have, again, targeted a minimum of $100 million in cost reductions. Capital expenditures are forecast at $300 million to $350 million as of construction of our hot rolling and processing facility moves forward in Flat-Rolled Products. Our U.S. defined pension plan is fully funded, and we expect retirement benefit expense to be $13 million lower in 2011 than in 2010. In total, we expect 2011 revenue growth of 15% to 20% compared to 2010. We expect to realize the benefits of our improving efficiencies and new facilities, products and capabilities, and we expect the segment operating profit to be approximately 15% of sales.

That's one thing that may have a pause on the airframe side. Moving out of that to jet engines, there's been no pause but only increasing and increasing sales for us into the first quarter and beyond, so the jet engine market is quite strong. And for us, I don't know about others. And as we look at the industrial side of titanium, what I mentioned in the Flat-Rolled Products side when we look at the projects that are happening around the world today and desalinization and gas production and chemical processing back to certain kinds of chemical plants, as well as some oil and gas for the nickel side of the business, these markets will pull material and keep that entire sector of High Performance Metals pretty tight."

Secondly, with this strong entry for us to ramp to that, I think that the first quarter will be lighter than the second quarter, and the third quarter continue to build, and then we have the fourth quarter where we are starting to ramp up on some of these issues. If you just take a look at the projected builds of large airplanes that crank up in the second half -- beginning in the fourth quarter of next year and start to move into the 2012 time frames and back that up in terms of lead times for engines, some of these planes that are production models that are and whitetail form, I don't have the engines hung out on them yet. There's a lot of weight and a lot of big tonnage coming in the engines, and when you couple that with the part fleet being reduced, the amount of traffic that airlines have now and pushing utilization and the upcoming increase in single-aisle schedules, you start to see where the second half is going to be driven by the aerospace side of the business. And for us, probably more on the jet engine side than the airframe side until 2012 and then as 2012 starts to crank up, we'll be back balancing out but we have a very strong load coming I think on the jet engine and big jet engine side of the company. So we see that, and we also see this project that I talked about in the schedules that we can book it, the schedule that we can deliver it in and crank to that level of production will be in the second half too. So get pricing and we get more tonnage in the second half."

It's a little different of an alloy approach for us some of our 700 Series alloys go into that. We will welcome that business. There's a couple of things. When we look at the Clean Energy Act and we look at which portion of our business that it might affect, I think natural gas is probably the bridge in power to nuclear sometime down the road, maybe some of the smaller nuclear modules that we've been hearing about. But in order to wait for that time to get those plans set, you have to bridge that with energy especially if you're not permitting or building new coal power plants. So three things have to happen. One, you have to bridge it with natural gas, which is gas turbine business, which I think will be a very strong ramp again for x amount of time, and I couldn't tell you how long that could be. But it will bridge us to a nuclear power additions. And the other part of that is if you're going to run the coal plants that exist and meet those same standards, then you need recuperation units and modernization of the coal facilities that are currently operating in the United States probably as much as 70% of them. So anyway that shakes out, it'll be good for ATI. And again, as we mentioned, our ability to diversify the mix and move our assets to different areas will move them to where they go. We would love to see some orders for some wind energy, some windmills for our casting business. Our Forging business is pretty full, and you could have some supply chain issues along the way because people haven't planned far enough ahead as these things all come together. So usually in our circumstances, with the amount of new equipment we've put in, the amount of new capacities we've put, the amount of new melting we've put in, our ability to swing back into operation of our melting facilities and primary plants, I think we're looking forward to the challenge.

Usually in these kinds of markets when we get rid of the startup cost and some of these idle facilities that we've been pushing into our segment margins, we should be returning to margins in our High Performance Metals that are at least 25%. And on the flat-rolled side, we would look at margins in the 10% to 12% range as we continue to move up the value chain and move some of this 20 million pounds of titanium into that business and nickel-based alloys, as well as improvements that we've made in our melt shops and eliminating one of our primary facilities so down from three to two for those commodity-type products. So we should see those margins there. On the bookings side, let's go back to High Performance Metals. We're very sure of where we are as we move through the first half, and so we're beginning to book the second half. Obviously, some things would have to change the wrong way to change our projections.

We can tell you that none of it was equipment write-offs, none because the equipment that we put in is what was designed or has been some tweaking to the design, but that just affects the overall capitalization. I think fundamental, you're right in saying that and surmising that not all of the start-up cost associated with Rowley. That's absolutely correct. We had a number of major, the other big fixed asset that we brought on stream in 2010 was the titanium Superalloy Forge Facility, and there were start-up costs associated with that. I think when you look at 2010 in the first half of the year, Rowley was running at about $4 million of start-up costs a quarter. That increased in the third quarter to almost double that, and that was even more increased by another factor of $4 million in the fourth quarter. And the issues for that if you think about it, is with the delay in the ramp up, we were hiring people. We are hiring people. We're training people. So there's more people employed in the second half of the year than there was in the first half of the year. And the training associated with that. We did have with one of our raw material supplier, we did have just as we have take or pay arrangements with some of our customers, we had a take or pay arrangement with one of the suppliers of the raw material for producing titanium sponge. It was based on the level that we thought we were going to producing the sponge at in 2010. We didn't hit that level. So that's a production cost that increases our cost of producing sponge, and that was a big impact to us in the fourth quarter, primarily. The primary reason why the fourth quarter was $4 million higher than the third quarter in terms of the start up in Rowley. So really, as we look at that start up, the key points that Pat has made is we are producing very pleased with the chemistry of the sponge. It more than rate from a chemistry standpoint, it is premium grade. What we're doing now is stabilizing that production, ensuring that it can be done in a repeatable basis. We are then ramping up and will be ramping up through the first half of 2011 into the second half. We're continuing to train our people as we bring them online. We are producing sponge today that we are using for industrial, and I think once we get really beyond the first quarter, we're not expecting any kind of significant start-up costs in Rowley beyond the first quarter."

And I think in general, the sense is that nickel today at over $11, $11.50 whatever it close today is overpriced. As a matter fact, some producers are even making that comment, believe it or not. So it's our sense that from a fundamental standpoint that nickel would tend to trend down over the balance of 2011 and by the fourth quarter, be in the range of perhaps around $10, maybe a little bit lower than that. So to put a broader range, $9 to $10 in there. Where it ends up is anybody's guess. There's a lot of financial players in the LME market not only for nickel, but for other commodities as well. And that tends to be a pretty big driver in a very short time horizon of where the LME ends up. But we would expect it to go down.

Overall, 2010 was a much better year than 2009 with sales up 33% to back over $4 billion in revenue. 2009 net income was up 125% to $0.72 a share. 2010 turned out to be the transition year we had forecasted. Improvements in our markets are the basis for our 2011 outlook. Disappointing as the fourth quarter may appear at $0.15 a share, it was a greatly improved bookings quarter and a good start for 2011. High-performance Metals has increased its backlog by over 40% to over $650 million, and Flat-Rolled Products revenues are forecasted up 15% for the first quarter of 2011. Engineered Products bookings are stronger and continue to grow.
It was a quarter where we were impacted by $19.5 million in LIFO inventory reserve charges for nickel and other raw materials, and it was the quarter where we took added one-time charges on startup delays at our Raleigh titanium facility of $20 million. Overall, a negative $0.26 per share impact.
Our key global markets are performing well. And 2010 was the transition year to resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets beginning in 2011. We see the second half of 2011 as stronger than the first half due to a ramping aerospace market beginning in the third quarter and continuing in 2012.
For 2010, we saw strong year-on-year recovery in some key measures. ATI is now more global than ever before. Direct international sales were 32% of the total. Segment operating profit for 2010 was $356 million, a 26% increase compared to the previous year. 2010 results included a $60 million LIFO charge and $62 million of idle facility and start-up cost. Gross cost reductions in 2010 were $135 million. We generated positive cash from operations in 2010, and we rebuilt $318 million in working capital necessary to meet increasing market demand for 2011. We also continue to modernize our facilities and enhance our manufacturing capabilities by investing $219 million of new capital.
While start-up costs were a short-term headwind in 2010, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond. The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty metal shop reduces our footprint and is expected to provide up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions. Our Titanium and Superalloy Forge Facility in Bakers, North Carolina continues to obtain additional customer qualifications. It has much-needed forging and finishing capacity and new capabilities. The timing of the completion of this project looks good as demand increases from our aerospace, oil and gas and medical customers. 
The ramp up of our Raleigh, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. The sponge chemistry is meeting premium-grade specifications. We are currently using Raleigh titanium production for industrial applications. We're focused on further reducing variability, standardizing the process and improving yields. We expect to be producing at a 20 million-pound annual rate by the second half of 2011. 
As we look at growth opportunities in 2011, our strategy continues to increase our participation in selected market sectors that demonstrate long-term secular growth trends greater than the average global GDP. These global markets represented 67% of ATI sales in 2010. Aerospace and defense remained our largest market at over 25% of sales. Oil and gas, chemical processing industry grew to 20% of sales. Oil and gas stood out in this number, growing by over 50% compared to 2009.
Electrical energy was 17% of sales. Medical, at a record 6% of sales, was our fastest-growing market, improving by over 90% in 2010 compared to 2009. This growth was driven through biomedical applications, which were mostly titanium. In addition, the new and more powerful MRI devices require considerably more of our niobium titanium wire than previous models. The performance of our key global growth markets in 2010 demonstrates the advantage of ATI's diversified global reach. As I've said, we can move our periscope to find the best available market for our products, and we do.
Strong fourth quarter order receipts provide a lot of momentum going into 2011. High Performance Metals segment's backlog at the end of 2010 increased over $650 million, 40% higher than the year-end 2009. Our titanium alloy, nickel-based alloy and specialty alloy backlog represents strong demand from the aerospace, oil and gas and medical markets. We are routinely quoting deliveries for most of these products well into the second quarter and even into the third quarter for certain product forms. The backlog of our Exotic Alloys business began to recover during the fourth quarter, particularly when we received several orders from the chemical processing industry.
Our Flat-Rolled Products enters 2011 with a strong backlog of high-value products. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our Uniti joint venture announced the largest titanium order in its history. Uniti was chosen to supply a significant portion of the titanium strip required to make welded tubing for the world's largest seawater desalinization facility located in Saudi Arabia. In the oil and gas and chemical process industry, we booked several large orders for 2011 shipment. In addition, a number of very large orders are pending for our titanium, nickel-based alloy, specialty alloy sheet and plate. These projects are nearly all international sales for ATI.
ATI is benefiting from two alloy substitution trends that, if realized, could be significant to our sales for the next several years. First, titanium is replacing copper-nickel alloys in large desalinization plants. Second, metallurgical-bonded, nickel-based alloy clad pipe is replacing conventional corrosion-resistant alloy pipe in sour gas applications. 
Other trends in the Flat-Rolled Products area. We improved our position in the aerospace market for titanium and nickel-based alloy sheet requirements. We also improved our position for Precision Rolled Strip products with large global automotive parts makers. ATI is attractive to those customers because we're able to provide seamless service to their operations around the world. We also expect Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel shipments to be essentially flat in 2011 due to our long-term arrangements and a better mix of products as a result of growth in demand for high-efficiency transformers.
As global markets recover, first we see improved volume, then follows better pricing. We expect to see higher-based prices for most of our high-value products during 2011. For example, we recently announced two price increases for certain nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in flat-rolled product forms and also increased prices for these alloys in long product forms. In addition, Uniti, our industrial titanium joint venture, recently announced that it is increasing prices for its commercial-grade titanium products.
We believe demand will increase for our stainless sheet and plate products during 2011 as the economy continues to grow. Service center activity is currently improving, and seasonally adjusted inventory levels remain below three months. In addition, pipe and tube activity continues to improve, particularly in the oil and gas, chemical processing industry, electrical energy markets. Most of the markets served by our Engineered Products segment continued to recover in 2010. Our Steel Forgings business stands out. Sales increased by over 80% compared to 2009. 78% of sales were to the transportation market, mostly Class A trucks and to the construction and mining market, mostly large off-road vehicles and equipment. Of note, this Forging business has, in the past cycles, been a leading indicator of U.S. economic recovery.
We continue to have a strong balance sheet. Cash on hand was $432 million at the end of the year. Net debt to total capitalization improved to 24%. Total debt to capitalization improved to 34%. On January 7 of this year, ATI issued $500 million of investment grade senior notes. The new senior notes, along with $432 million of cash on hand at the end of the year and a $400 million undrawn, unsecured domestic credit facility, provide ATI with ample liquidity to meet our cash needs in 2011. These cash needs we expect to include nearly $400 million to complete the Ladish acquisition, additional investments in receivables with expected sales growth, capital investments, which are forecasted to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million in 2011, and debt maturities of approximately $125 million. Strength in our key markets give us confidence for 2011. We believe aerospace remains a growth market for ATI, and we remain bullish. Both Boeing and Airbus have one, announced planned increases to their production schedules; and two, have indicated that further production increases are being considered. Their backlogs are strong with nearly 7,000 large aircraft, and backlogs are being extended by new orders.
In 2010, both Boeing and Airbus recorded unit book to build rates greater than one. Single-aisle aircraft production rates are growing. Double-aisle aircraft production rates such as for Boeing's 777 and 747-8 are also growing. Recently, Boeing reset the first delivery for its 787 Dreamliner to the third quarter of 2011, and restarted the flight test schedule. We continue to believe that the 787 will be one of the great innovations of our time. We also believe that Boeing will ramp production of this airplane as fast as it can, and that it will challenge the supply chain. ATI will be ready to accept the challenge.
For ATI, aero engine demand is being driven by all of the aircraft production schedules mentioned. In addition, aero engine spares demand is being driven by strong recovery in the passenger and freight traffic and the growing size of the global fleet. ATI is innovating for the future of aerospace. We've introduced new products to improve our customers' productivity and cost. 
In 2010, we announced the first long-term agreement for our use of our new ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications. This innovative new alloys is now being used for more parts and continues to gain share on the newest of jet engines. Following technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 alloy for titanium sheet and plate in 2010, the team is working with several aerospace, defense and non-aerospace customers who are interested in using this innovative new material. Several fast track development opportunities are now underway.
Turning to the oil and gas market and chemical process industry. We believe our second largest market remains a strong growth market for ATI. We've established ourselves as a global leader and a reliable source of complex, difficult to produce specialty metals. ATI is known for our industry-leading product quality, reliability and delivery performance. As a result, sales grew over 50% last year compared to 2009. ATI is well positioned in this business to provide our high-value products for downhole cable, for piping requirements and for structural requirements used in offshore rigs. We have won and are well positioned to win additional orders for our nickel-based alloy, specialty alloy plate products for use in oil and gas pipelines. Downhole drilling and complex bookings remain very strong.
The global shale gas story creates demand for our tungsten carbide drill bit bodies and compacts, as well as directional steering tools made from our Datalloy 2 collars in Sheffield in the U.K. ATI is innovating for the future of the oil and gas and chemical process industry. We have an industry-leading range of duplex stainless steels. Our customers can choose the optimum alloy containing the mix of nickel and moly, best suited for a wide variety of corrosive environments. 
Bookings are strong, and customers are showing high interest in machine parts made out of our new precision machine facility in Sheffield in the U.K. Most parts are being made using our proprietary Data 2 specialty steels and are used for non-magnetic drill collars. The strategic growth initiatives that we had taken allow us to, first of all, improve our share and second, grow our total products in 2011. We expect 2011 total titanium shipments to increase by approximately 30% to 50 million pounds. We have, again, targeted a minimum of $100 million in cost reductions. Capital expenditures are forecasted at $300 million to $350 million as the construction of our hot rolling and processing facility moves forward in flat-rolled products. 
Our U.S.-defined pension plan is fully funded, and we expect retirement benefit expense to be $13 million lower in 2011 than in 2010. In total, we expect 2011 revenue growth of 15% to 20% compared to 2010. We expect to realize the benefits of our improving efficiencies and new facilities, products and capabilities, and we expect the segment operating profit to be approximately 15% of sales.

I think the 787 pushed out to the third quarter, maybe is when you did your channel checks for some people especially in general distribution that have specific programs on that particular aircraft. You would see that type of a lull, and I think that those people probably have some good feeling of relief with the current six aircraft back flying in Boeing, quoting this qualification first delivery into the third quarter. That's one thing that may have a pause on the airframe side. Moving out of that to jet engines, there's been no pause but only increasing and increasing sales for us into the first quarter and beyond. So the jet engine market is quite strong for us, I don't know about others. And as we look at the industrial side of titanium, what I mentioned in the Flat-Rolled Products side, when we look at the projects that are happening around the world today, in desalinization, in gas production, in chemical processing back to certain kinds of chemical plants as well as some oil and gas for the nickel side of the business, these markets will pull material and keep that entire sector of High Performance Metals pretty tight."

I mean, as we book things to finish out the first quarter of short delivery, we'll see some better pricing. But most of that starts in the second quarter and extends in the third and fourth quarters. So that's one area of improvement is on the pricing side. Secondly, with this strong entry for us to ramp to that, I think that the first quarter will be lighter than the second quarter, and the third quarter continued to build, and then we have the fourth quarter where we are starting to ramp up on some of these issues. If you just take a look at the projected builds of large airplanes that crank up in the second half of -- beginning in the fourth quarter of next year and start to move into the 2012 time frames and back that up in terms of lead times for engines, some of these planes that are production models that are in wide tail form now, don't have the engines hung on them yet. There's a lot of weight and a lot of big tonnage coming in the engines, and when you couple that with the part fleet being reduced, the amount of traffic that the airlines have now and pushing utilization and the upcoming increase in single-aisle schedules, you start to see where the second half is going to be driven by the aerospace side of the business. And for us, probably more on the jet engine side than the airframe side, until 2012. And then as 2012 starts to crank up, we'll be back balancing out. But we have a very strong load coming, I think, on the jet engine and big jet engine side of the company. So we see that, and we also see this project work that I talked about in the schedules that we can book it in, the schedule that we can deliver it in and crank to that level of production will be in the second half too.

When we look at the Clean Energy Act and we look at which portion of our business that it might affect, I think natural gas, your thought there is probably the bridge in power to nuclear sometime down the road, maybe some of the smaller nuclear modules that we've been hearing about. But in order to wait for that time to get those plans set, you have to bridge that with energy especially if you're not permitting or building new coal power plants. So three things have to happen. One, you have to bridge it with natural gas, which is gas turbine business, which I think will be a very strong ramp again for x amount of time, and I couldn't tell you how long that could be. But it will bridge us to a nuclear power additions. And the other part of that is, if you're going to run the coal plants that exist and meet those same standards, then you need recuperation units and modernization of the coal facilities that are currently operating in the United States, probably as much as 70% of them. So anyway this shakes out, it'll be good for ATI. And again, as we mentioned, our ability to diversify the mix and move our assets to different areas will move them to where they go.

We can tell you that none of it was equipment write-offs, none. Because the equipment that we put in is what was designed. There has been some tweaking to the design, but that just affects the overall capitalization. I think you're right in saying that and surmising that not all of the start-up cost are associated with Raleigh. That's absolutely correct. We had a number of major -- the other big fixed asset that we brought on stream in 2010 was the Titanium and Superalloy Forge Facility. And there were start-up costs associated with that. I think when you look at 2010 in the first half of the year, Raleigh was running at about $4 million of start-up costs a quarter. That increased in the third quarter to almost double that, and then was even more increased by another factor of $4 million in the fourth quarter. And the issues for that, if you think about it, is with the delay in the ramp up, we were hiring people. We are hiring people. We're training people. So there's more people employed in the second half of the year than there was in the first half of the year and the training associated with that. With one of our raw material supplier, we did have, just as we have take-or-pay arrangements with some of our customers, we had a take-or-pay arrangement with one of the suppliers of the raw material for producing titanium sponge. It was based on the level that we thought we were going to producing the sponge at in 2010. We didn't hit that level, so that's a production cost that increases our cost of producing sponge. And that was a big impact to us in the fourth quarter, primarily. The primary reason why the fourth quarter was $4 million higher than the third quarter in terms of the start up in Raleigh. So really, as we look at that start up, the key points that Pat has made, is we are producing -- we are very pleased with the chemistry of the sponge. More the industrial grade from a chemistry standpoint, it is premium grade. What we are doing now is stabilizing that production, ensuring that it can be done in a repeatable basis. We are then ramping up, and will be ramping up, through the first half of 2011 into the second half. We're continuing to train our people as we bring them online.

And I think in general, the sense is that nickel today, at over $11, $11.50 whatever it close today, is overpriced. As a matter fact, some producers are even making that comment, believe it or not. So it's our sense that from a fundamental standpoint, that nickel would tend to trend down over the balance of 2011 and by the fourth quarter, be in the range of perhaps around $10, maybe a little bit lower than that. So to put a broader range, $9 to $10 in there. Where it ends up is anybody's guess. There's a lot of financial players in the LME market. Not only for nickel, but for other of the commodities as well. And that tends to be a pretty big driver in a very short time horizon of where the LME ends up. But we would expect it to go down. Our guidance that we gave from a segment operating profit standpoint assumes that LIFO is not a significant impact, one way or another for ATI in 2011."

Overall, 2010 was a much better year than 2009 with sales up 33% to back over $4 billion in revenue. 2009 net income was up 125% to $0.72 a share. 2010 turned out to be the transition year we had forecasted. Improvements in our markets are the basis for our 2011 outlook. 
Disappointing as the fourth quarter may appear at $0.15 a share, it was a greatly improved bookings quarter and a good start for 2011. High Performance Metals has increased its backlog by over 40% to over $650 million, and Flat-Rolled Products revenues are forecasted up 15% for the first quarter of 2011. Engineered Products bookings are stronger and continue to grow.
It was a quarter where we were impacted by $19.5 million in LIFO inventory reserve charges for nickel and other raw materials, and it was the quarter where we took added one-time charges on startup delays at our Raleigh titanium facility of $20 million. Overall, a negative $0.26 per share impact.
Our key global markets are performing well. And 2010 was the transition year to resumption of strong secular growth in our key global markets beginning in 2011. We see the second half of 2011 as stronger than the first half due to a ramping aerospace market beginning in the third quarter and continuing in 2012.
For 2010, we saw strong year-on-year recovery. Some key measures. ATI is now more global than ever before. Direct international sales were 32% of the total. Segment operating profit for 2010 was $356 million, a 26% increase compared to the previous year. 2010 results included a $60 million LIFO charge and the $62 million of idle facility and start-up cost. Gross cost reductions in 2010 were $135 million. We generated positive cash from operations in 2010, and we rebuilt $318 million in working capital necessary to meet increasing market demand for 2011. We also continue to modernize our facilities and enhance our manufacturing capabilities by investing $219 million of new capital.
While start-up costs were a short-term headwind in 2010, we expect our strategic capital projects to benefit ATI performance in 2011 and beyond. The melt shop consolidation at our Brackenridge, Pennsylvania specialty metal shop reduces our footprint and is expected to provide up to $30 million of annualized cost reductions. Our Titanium and Superalloy Forge Facility in Bakers, North Carolina continues to obtain additional customer qualifications. It has much-needed forging and finishing capacity and new capabilities. The timing of the completion of this project looks good as demand increases from our aerospace, oil and gas and medical customers. 
The ramp up of our Raleigh, Utah premium titanium sponge facility is continuing. The sponge chemistry is meeting premium-grade specifications. We are currently using Raleigh titanium production for industrial applications. We're focused on further reducing variability, standardizing the process and improving yields. We expect to be producing at a 20 million-pound annual rate by the second half of 2011. 
As we look at growth opportunities in 2011, our strategy continues to increase our participation in selected market sectors that demonstrate long-term secular growth trends greater than the average global GDP. These global markets represented 67% of ATI sales in 2010. Aerospace and defense remained our largest market at over 25% of sales. Oil and gas, chemical processing industry grew to 20% of sales. Oil and gas stood out in this number, growing by over 50% compared to 2009.
Electrical energy was 17% of sales. Medical, at a record 6% of sales, was our fastest-growing market, improving by over 90% in 2010 compared to 2009. This growth was driven through biomedical applications, which were mostly titanium. In addition, the new and more powerful MRI devices require considerably more of our niobium titanium wire than previous models. The performance of our key global growth markets in 2010 demonstrates the advantage of ATI's diversified global reach. As I've said, we can move our periscope to find the best available market for our products, and we do.
Strong fourth quarter order receipts provide a lot of momentum going into 2011. High Performance Metals segment's backlog at the end of 2010 increased over $650 million, 40% higher than the year-end 2009. Our titanium alloy, nickel-based alloy and specialty alloy backlog represents strong demand from the aerospace, oil and gas and medical markets. We are routinely quoting deliveries for most of these products well into the second quarter and even into the third quarter for certain product forms. The backlog of our Exotic Alloys business began to recover during the fourth quarter, particularly when we received several orders from the chemical processing industry.
Our Flat-Rolled Products enters 2011 with a strong backlog of high-value products. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our Uniti joint venture announced the largest titanium order in its history. Uniti was chosen to supply a significant portion of the titanium strip required to make welded tubing for the world's largest seawater desalinization facility located in Saudi Arabia. 
In the oil and gas and chemical process industry, we booked several large orders for 2011 shipment. In addition, a number of very large orders are pending for our titanium, nickel-based alloy, specialty alloy sheet and plate. These projects are nearly all international sales for ATI.
ATI's benefiting from two alloy substitution trends that, if realized, could be significant to our sales for the next several years. First, titanium is replacing copper-nickel alloys in large desalinization plants. Second, metallurgical-bonded, nickel-based alloy clad pipe is replacing conventional corrosion-resistant alloy pipe in sour gas applications. 
Other trends in the Flat-Rolled Products area. We improved our position in the aerospace market for titanium and nickel-based alloy sheet requirements. We also improved our position for Precision Rolled Strip products with large global automotive parts makers. ATI is attractive to those customers because we're able to provide seamless service to their operations around the world. We also expect grain-oriented electrical steel shipments to be essentially flat in 2011 due to our long-term arrangements and a better mix of products as a result of growth in demand for high-efficiency transformers.
As global markets recover, first we see improved volume, then follows better pricing. We expect to see higher-based prices for most of our high-value products during 2011. For example, we recently announced two price increases for certain nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in flat-rolled product forms and also increased prices for these alloys in long product forms. In addition, Uniti, our industrial titanium joint venture, recently announced that it is increasing prices for its commercial-grade titanium products.
We believe demand will increase for our stainless sheet and plate products during 2011 as the economy continues to grow. Service center activity is currently improving, and seasonally adjusted inventory levels remain below three months. In addition, pipe and tube activity continues to improve, particularly in the oil and gas, chemical processing industry, electrical energy markets. 
Most of the markets served by our Engineered Products segment continued to recover in 2010. Our Steel Forgings business stands out. Sales increased by over 80% compared to 2009. 78% of sales were to the transportation market, mostly Class A trucks, and to the construction and mining market, mostly large off-road vehicles and equipment. Of note, this Forging business has, in the past cycles, been a leading indicator of U.S. economic recovery.
We continue to have a strong balance sheet. Cash on hand was $432 million at the end of the year. Net debt to total capitalization improved to 24%. Total debt to capitalization improved to 34%. On January 7 of this year, ATI issued $500 million of investment grade senior notes. The new senior notes, along with $432 million of cash on hand at the end of the year and a $400 million undrawn, unsecured domestic credit facility, provide ATI with ample liquidity to meet our cash needs in 2011. These cash needs we expect to include nearly $400 million to complete the Ladish acquisition; additional investments in receivables with expected sales growth; capital investments, which are forecasted to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million in 2011; and debt maturities of approximately $125 million. 
Strength in our key markets give us confidence for 2011. We believe aerospace remains a growth market for ATI, and we remain bullish. Both Boeing and Airbus have, one, announced planned increases to their production schedules; and two, have indicated that further production increases are being considered. Their backlogs are strong with nearly 7,000 large aircraft, and backlogs are being extended by new orders.
In 2010, both Boeing and Airbus recorded unit book-to-build rates greater than one. Single-aisle aircraft production rates are growing. Double-aisle aircraft production rates such as for Boeing's 777 and 747-8 are also growing. Recently, Boeing reset the first delivery for its 787 Dreamliner to the third quarter of 2011, and restarted the flight test schedule. We continue to believe that the 787 will be one of the great innovations of our time. We also believe that Boeing will ramp production of this airplane as fast as it can and that it will challenge the supply chain. ATI will be ready to accept the challenge.
For ATI, aero engine demand is being driven by all of the aircraft production schedules mentioned. In addition, aero engine spares demand is being driven by strong recovery in the passenger and freight traffic and the growing size of the global fleet. ATI is innovating for the future of aerospace. We've introduced new products to improve our customers' productivity and cost. 
In 2010, we announced the first long-term agreement for our use of our new ATI 718Plus alloy for jet engine applications. This innovative new alloy is now being used for more parts and continues to gain share on the newest of jet engines. Following technical and commercial rollouts of ATI 425 alloy for titanium sheet and plate in 2010, the team is working with several aerospace, defense and non-aerospace customers who are interested in using this innovative new material. Several fast track development opportunities are now underway.
Turning to the oil and gas market and chemical process industry. We believe our second largest market remains a strong growth market for ATI. We've established ourselves as a global leader and a reliable source of complex, difficult to produce specialty metals. ATI is known for our industry-leading product quality, reliability and delivery performance. As a result, sales grew over 50% last year compared to 2009. ATI is well positioned in this business to provide our high-value products for down-hole cable, for piping requirements and for structural requirements used in offshore rigs. We have won and are well positioned to win additional orders for our nickel-based alloy, specialty alloy plate products for use in oil and gas pipelines. Down-hole drilling and complex bookings remain very strong.
The global shale gas story creates demand for our tungsten carbide drill bit bodies and compacts, as well as directional steering tools made from our Datalloy 2 collars in the Sheffield in the U.K. ATI is innovating for the future of the oil and gas and chemical process industry. We have an industry-leading range of duplex stainless steels. Our customers can choose the optimum alloy containing the mix of nickel and moly [molybdenum] best suited for a wide variety of corrosive environments. 
Bookings are strong, and customers are showing high interest in machine parts made at our new precision machine facility in Sheffield, the U.K. Most parts are being made using our proprietary Data 2 specialty steels and are used for non-magnetic drill collars. 
The strategic growth initiatives that we have taken allow us to, first of all, improve our share and second, grow our total products in 2011. We expect 2011 total titanium shipments to increase by approximately 30% to 50 million pounds. We have again targeted a minimum of $100 million in cost reductions. Capital expenditures are forecasted at $300 million to $350 million as the construction of our hot rolling and processing facility moves forward in Flat-Rolled products. 
Our U.S.-defined pension plan is fully funded, and we expect retirement benefit expense to be $13 million lower in 2011 than in 2010. In total, we expect 2011 revenue growth of 15% to 20% compared to 2010. We expect to realize the benefits of our improving efficiencies and new facilities, products and capabilities, and we expect segment operating profit to be approximately 15% of sales.

I think the 787 push-out to the third quarter maybe is when you did your channel checks for some people, especially in general distribution that have specific programs on that particular aircraft. You would see that type of a lull, and I think that those people probably have some good feeling of relief with the current six aircraft back flying in Boeing, quoting this qualification first delivery into the third quarter. That's one thing that may have a pause on the airframe side. Moving out of that to jet engines, there's been no pause but only increasing, and increasing sales for us into the first quarter and beyond. So the jet engine market is quite strong for us; I don't know about others. And as we look at the industrial side of titanium, what I mentioned in the Flat-Rolled Products side, when we look at the projects that are happening around the world today, in desalinization, in gas production, in chemical processing back to certain kinds of chemical plants as well as some oil and gas for the nickel side of the business, these markets will pull material and keep that entire sector of High Performance Metals pretty tight."

I mean, as we book things to finish out the first quarter short delivery, we'll see some better pricing. But most of that starts in the second quarter and extends in the third and fourth quarters. So that's one area of improvement is on the pricing side. Secondly, with this strong entry for us to ramp to that, I think that the first quarter will be lighter than the second quarter, and the third quarter continue to build, and then we have the fourth quarter where we're sort of starting to ramp up on some of these issues. If you just take a look at the projected builds of large airplanes that crank up in the second half of -- beginning in the fourth quarter of next year and start to move into the 2012 time frames and back that up in terms of lead times for engines, some of these planes that are production models that are in white tail form now, don't have the engines hung on them yet. There's a lot of weight and a lot of big tonnage coming in engines, and when you couple that with the part fleet being reduced, the amount of traffic that the airlines have now and pushing utilization and the upcoming increase in single-aisle schedules, you start to see where the second half is going to be driven by the aerospace side of the business. And for us, probably more on the jet engine side than the airframe side until 2012. And then as 2012 starts to crank up, we'll be back balancing out. But we have a very strong load coming, I think, on the jet engine and big jet engine side of the company. So we see that, and we also see this project work that I talked about in the schedules that we can book it in, the schedule that we can deliver it in and crank to that level of production will be in the second half too.

Some of our 700-series alloys go into that. We will welcome that business. There's a couple things. When we look at the Clean Energy Act and we look at which portion of our business that it might affect, I think natural gas, your thought there is probably the bridge in power to nuclear sometime down the road, maybe some of the smaller nuclear modules that we've been hearing about. But in order to wait for that time to get those plans set, you have to bridge that with energy, especially if you're not permitting or building new coal-fired plants. So three things have to happen: One, you have to bridge it with natural gas, which is gas turbine business, which I think will be a very strong ramp again for x amount of time, and I couldn't tell you how long that could be. But it will bridge us to a nuclear power additions. And the other part of that is, if you're going to run the coal plants that exist and meet those same standards, then you need recuperation units and modernization of the coal facilities that are currently operating in the United States, probably as much as 70% of them. So any way this shakes out, it'll be good for ATI. And again, as we mentioned, our ability to diversify the mix and move our assets to different areas will move them to where they go. We would love to see some orders for some wind energy, some windmills for our casting business. Our Forging business is pretty full, and you could have some supply chain issues along the way because people haven't planned far enough ahead as these things all come together. So usually, in our circumstances, with the amount of new equipment we've put in, the amount of new capacities we've put, the amount of new melting we've put in, our ability to swing back into operation of our melting facilities and primary plants, I think we're looking forward to the challenge.

We can tell you that none of it was equipment write-offs, none. Because the equipment that we put in is what was designed. There has been some tweaking to the design, but that just affects the overall capitalization. I think you're right in saying that and surmising that not all of the start-up costs are associated with Raleigh. That's absolutely correct. We had a number of major -- the other big fixed asset that we brought on stream in 2010 was the Titanium and Superalloy Forge Facility. And there were start-up costs associated with that. I think when you look at 2010 in the first half of the year, Raleigh was running at about $4 million of start-up costs a quarter. That increased in the third quarter to almost double that, and then was even more increased by another factor of $4 million in the fourth quarter. And the issues for that, if you think about it, is with the delay in the ramp up, we were hiring people. We are hiring people. We're training people. So there's more people employed in the second half of the year than there was in the first half of the year, and the training associated with that. With one of our raw material supplier, we did have, just as we have take-or-pay arrangements with some of our customers, we had a take-or-pay arrangement with one of the suppliers of the raw material for producing titanium sponge. It was based on the level that we thought we were going to producing the sponge at in 2010. We didn't hit that level, so that's a production cost that increases our cost of producing sponge. And that was a big impact to us in the fourth quarter, primarily. The primary reason why the fourth quarter was $4 million higher than the third quarter in terms of the start up in Raleigh. So really, as we look at that start up, the key points that Pat has made, is we are producing -- we are very pleased with the chemistry of the sponge. More than industrial grade, from a chemistry standpoint, it is premium grade. What we're doing now is stabilizing that production, ensuring that it can be done in a repeatable basis. We are then ramping up, and will be ramping up, through the first half of 2011 into the second half. We're continuing to train our people as we bring them online. We are producing sponge today that we are using for industrial. And I think once we get really beyond the first quarter, we're not expecting any kind of significant start-up costs in Raleigh beyond the first quarter."

And I think in general, the sense is that nickel today at over $11, $11.50 whatever it closed today, is overpriced. As a matter fact, some producers are even making that comment, believe it or not. So it's our sense that from a fundamental standpoint, that nickel would tend to trend down over the balance of 2011 and by the fourth quarter, be in the range of perhaps around $10, maybe a little bit lower than that. So to put a broader range, $9 to $10 in there. Where it ends up is anybody's guess. There's a lot of financial players in the LME market. Not only for nickel, but for other of the commodities as well. And that tends to be a pretty big driver in a very short time horizon of where the LME ends up. But we would expect it to go down.

I said that 2010 was a transition year and 2011 would be the year when strong secular growth resumes. We're off to a great start. Sales increased 36% to $1.23 billion, putting ATI on track to return the company with over $5 billion in sales. Segment operating profit increased nearly 85% to $162 million, which is 13.2% of sales. Earnings per share were $0.54, including $0.05 of special charges. This represents the highest quarterly percentage 2008. Our key global markets are strong and represent 70% of ATI first quarter sales. At 25% of first quarter revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 33%, compared to the same period last year. At 23% of first quarter revenue, sales to the oil and gas chemical process industry grew 51% compared to the first quarter of 2010 and also grew by 400 basis points to 23% of total sales, up from 19% of sales for the full year. Electrical energy market represented 16% of ATI first quarter sales. At 6% of first quarter sales, medical was once again our fastest growing market. This market more than doubled since the first quarter of last year. Historically, the medical market has run at about 4% of sales across the business cycle. There is a real change here, demonstrating differentiation and the quality of ATI-produced products. 
Orders continue to be strong in the first quarter. Backlog in our High Performance Metals segment at the end of the first quarter is approaching levels reached in early 2008 and 2008 as a result of the major project wins, we also have a solid backlog for 2011 segment. Market strength, along with ATI's improved capabilities and expanded capacities, give me confidence in our belief that strong secular growth resumes in 2011. 2012 will be better than 2011 and 2013 is shaping up to far better than 2012. This extraordinary time in the specialty metals business. It is the beginning of a period of sustained growth, unlike anything I've seen in my 40 plus years. ATI is now very well-positioned for the future and for profitable growth. 
As you know, I will retire after our annual meeting. This is the right time for the change. I am confident that Rich Harshman is the right person for the job. Rich and I have been working together for nearly 8 years, developing and implementing ATI strategies for profitable growth. We have on outstanding team in place to support Rich. I'm confident that under Rich's leadership, ATI can continue the transformation that we started in 2004 and take ATI to new levels of performance.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me just say how much I've enjoyed my time leading ATI. I've enjoyed the many conversations that I've had with you, our investors and our analysts. I particularly like those of you who questioned our strategies in our theories. Good management must be open to opinions that test our thinking. You required us to be more thoughtful and to look at our positions from every perspective. ATI is a better company because of you, my personal thanks. Now here is Rich Harshman."

We are optimistic that 2011 will indeed be the year in which strong secular growth resumes for ATI. This optimism is supported by our performance in the first quarter. It is important to note that, while are focused on our four key global",1821,"Thank you, Pat. We are optimistic that 2011 will indeed be the year in which strong secular growth resumes for ATI. This optimism is supported by our performance in the first quarter. It is important to note that, while are focused on our four key global markets, 48% of our first quarter 2011 revenue came from our 2 largest markets, aerospace and defense and oil and gas chemical process industry. This becomes 54% of sales when the medical market is included. These 3 markets require high-value, high-quality products. They are global. They have current robust demand and are expected to get stronger over the next several years and ATI is very well-positioned to continue to grow in these markets. First, let's look at the aerospace market. We and the other members of the supply chain are being told to get ready for unprecedented production rate increases between now and 2013. Boeing has set aggressive targets to build more 737s than ever, build more 777s than ever, deliver the first 787 in the third quarter and then significantly and quickly ramp up its production rate. 
Airbus has set aggressive targets to build more A320s to build for the A330s family. These build rates are supported by record backlogs of about 7,000 airplanes. In addition, Airbus plans to complete the development and begin ramping production of the A350 extra widebody later in the decade. For ATI, these build rates translate into greater demand for our specialty metals, for both airframes and engines than during any previous cycle. The larger global fleet also increases demand for our high-value rotating quality titanium alloys and nickel-based superalloys, used in jet engine spare parts and engine replacement kits. ATI is very well-positioned and ready for these higher production rates. We have been and are continuing to invest in unsurpassed capabilities and capacities. We have been and are continuing to innovate with new alloys, products and technologies. Some examples: There is significant interest in our game changing ATI 425 alloy with much qualification activity ongoing. Our ATI 718Plus nickel-based superalloys is growing a new aeroengine applications. We are making good progress in developing a significant position in stock. ATI is the only supplier capable of producing melt to finished products all 3 alloy systems used to make fastness, titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys and we have proprietary alloys for unique fastener applications. And finally, we are well-positioned to grow as a key supplier of the powder alloys for the jet engine market. 
We offer customers a secure and stable integrated supply chain. Our ATI aerospace market sector team allies all company resources to this market. We are integrated in titanium raw materials with our Raleigh, Utah premium grade titanium sponge facility. We are now offering more value added processing through our new Sheffield England precision machining technology. With expected completion of the lavish acquisition, we have the capability to produce highly engineered and technically complex parts.
Concerning titanium raw material supply needed for the expected aerospace production rate increase, our Raleigh facility is now producing sponge at higher volumes and improving yields. We have commissioned 34 of the 36 furnace sets. The sponge chemistry is outstanding and is meeting premium grade specifications. We are using the Raleigh sponge to feed our West Coast melting operations for industrial applications, and we expect to be producing titanium sponge at a 20 million pound annualized rate during the second half of this year.
Titanium sponge and scrap availability is tight. We understand the Chinese titanium sponge prices are now about $7 per pound and we know that 6 for premium scrap is at the same level. The ability to have our own titanium sponge supply with the Raleigh facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponsor operations will enable ATI to continue to grow.
Turning to the oil and gas and chemical process industry. We expect our second largest segment to remain a strong growth market for ATI. Since we first begin to focus the companywide capabilities of ATI on this market in 2008, we have established ourselves as the global leader and a reliable supplier of complex, difficult-to-produce specialty metals. ATI is known for our industry-leading product quality, reliability and delivery performance. We serve the oil and gas chemical process industry through each of our business segments. In our High Performance Metals segment, it was the second-largest market in the first quarter at 12% of segment sales. It was the largest market served by our Flat-Rolled Products and Engineered Products segments at 28% and 29% of sales, respectively. The global oil and gas market is expected to grow as demand increases from developing countries and the economies of developed countries recover and grow. The international energy administration recently announced the results of their global shale gas reserves study and reported total recoverable natural gas reserves increased more than 40% when shale gas is included. As drilling for shale gas increases, we expect demand to grow for ATI products such as our tungsten materials for drills and bits, ATI alloys for horizontal and directional drilling and nickel and titanium alloys for completion systems. Many new oil and gas discoveries contain sour gas is making exploration in production more demanding. In addition, oil fields, once though to be depleted, are now being extended through the use of new drilling technologies. These results in the form or specialty models that ATI produces. For example, we have won and are well-positioned to win additional orders for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloy Flat-Rolled Products for use in oil and gas pipelines. During the first quarter, ATI was chosen to supply large volume of nickel-based alloys played for a large sour gas pipeline being constructed in Abi Dhabi as part of the shawl gas field. More recently, ATI was selected to supply the nickel-based alloy sheet sheep to be used in subsea flowlines for a large deep water project in Brazil. These projects are in addition to the order for approximately 6 million tons of CP titanium that our Uniti joint venture was awarded late last year for the world's largest seawater desalinization plan. These order is being produced and delivered throughout 2011.
Turning to the Electrical Energy market. Demand from this market remained steady with slight improvement during the first quarter for 2011, pretty much in line with the economic recovery. Shipments of our grain electrical steel were flat year-over-year. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately 10% higher than the first quarter. Product mix continued to improve as demand for lower loss grades as a result of the tightened and transformer efficiency standards in the United States. Demand has begun to increase for our nickel-based alloys specialty alloys used for gas turbines, and we continue to work with a number of customers in the alternative energy markets and are optimistic that growth opportunities exist for ATI in these markets.
We believe an inflection point to secular growth from the electrical market could develop as Japan recovers and rebuilds. We expect the global demand should begin to improve as the grid is rebuilt in the affected area. Assuming Japan increases its use of natural gas for power generation, which is widely speculated, ATI sales could grow to the gas turbine market and to markets for exploration, processing and transportation of LNG or liquid natural gas.
For Nuclear Energy, although it is too early to determine the impact from recent events, we do expect refueling and maintenance to continue. We also expect increased interest in safe and secure spent fuel storage and processing. This uses many of the specialty metals made by ATI and finally, we eventually expect the resumption of new nuclear plant construction in Asia.
All of these factors point to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key markets. In addition, we are seeing cyclical recovery in most of our other markets. As a result, we are seeing improved volume. First quarter shipments for nearly all of our products increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period last year. As we have said, first demand improves resulting in increased volume than better pricing follows. We expect to see higher-based prices for most of our products going forward. These prices our increasing for our titanium alloy and nickel-based alloys. In our Flat-Rolled Products segment, two base price increases have been announced for our nickel-based alloys. Effective January 4, 2011, base prices increased 7% to 9% and effective February 3, 2011, base prices increased 5% to 8%. In addition, a 6% to 9% increase was effective April 1 for our standard stainless product. The market is supporting this price increase as U.S. service center activity has been improving driven by better demand from the transportation, energy in food equipment markets and the pipe and tube market is improving due to increased demand from the oil and gas, chemical process industry and electrical energy market. Although end market demands and fundamentals are getting better, customers for our stainless products continues to be cautious and closely watch the raw material surcharge as part of the timing of their buying decision.
Moving to our Engineered Products segment. The first quarter was strong. Sales increased over 45% compared to the first quarter 2010 as a result of improved demand and higher prices for our tungsten products and carbon steel forgings. More importantly, segment operating profit was a respectable 11.4% of sales. Sales of our tungsten products were 34%. Of note, the market price for APT or ammonium paradox the raw material used for tungsten powder increased significantly since the first quarter 2010. In addition, APT is in short supply due to restricted exports to China and tungsten scrap supply is also type. Fortunately for ATI, we expanded our a PT capacity, the ability to produce our APT supply enables ATI to continue to grow our tungsten bass materials business. Sales of our carbon alloy forgings grew nearly 85% compared to the same period last year due to strong demand from oil and gas, transportation, particularly class 8 trucks and large construction and mining equipment.
In summary, we are building momentum across our businesses and continue to see 2011 as the year where secular growth returns in our key global markets. We remain focused on improving our cost structure with $26 million of gross cost reductions in the first quarter. This, combined with growing demand and improved pricing for most of our specialty metals results in our expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 20% in 2011 compared to 2010 and segment operating profit of 15% of total sales for the full year 2011. These expectations do not include any impact of the pending acquisition of Lavish. Before we move to the question-and-answer session, I hope everyone stays online after the Q&A session for some special closing comments about Pat Hassey. Keisha, we will now open the call for any questions."

So we share the optimism there in terms of armor applications going forward. The other thing that we're looking forward to is the completion of our fabricated components business outside of Chicago where we're putting in some manufacturing capability that's really value add to do some fabricated components out of the mill products that we make from a value-added point and that we expect that facility to be online and up and running by early third quarter, perhaps even late second quarter this year.

We would expect, given the dynamics of the market that '12 would be a substantial increase of '11 and '13 is probably where you get back to or closer to the base prices that we saw at the last peak of the cycle and the other way we look at it is that we're certainly facilitized to have a higher volume in 2012 and '13 than we did before because of all the capital investments that we've made. We also have a lower cost structure because of all the costs that we've continued to take out. I'm talking variable cost, mainly depreciation expense would be higher because of all the investments that we've made but I think when we look at base prices if you want a generality, we think there's opportunity for 25% to 30% upside in base prices over the next couple of years.

As we ramp that up, I would expect that, that number would be cut in half in the second quarter and if not be completely gone in the third quarter, certainly be cut in half again if not more and then the fourth quarter we are not expecting any startup because we are expecting to be running at an annualized rate approaching 20 million pounds.

I've said that 2010 was the transition year and 2011 would be the year when strong secular growth resumes. 
We're off to a great start. Sales increased 36% to $1.23 billion, putting ATI on track to return the company with over $5 billion in sales. Segment operating profit increased nearly 85% to $162 million, which is 13.2% of sales. Earnings per share were $0.54 including $0.05 of special charges. This represents the highest quarterly percentage 2008. 
Our key global markets are strong and represent 70% of ATI first quarter sales. At 25% of first quarter revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 33%, compared to the same period last year. At 23% of first quarter revenue, sales to the oil and gas/chemical process industry grew 51% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and also grew by 400 basis points to 23% of total sales, up from 19% of sales for the full year. Electrical energy market represented 16% of ATI first quarter sales. At 6% of first quarter sales, medical was once again our fastest-growing market. This market more than doubled since the first quarter of last year. Historically, the medical market has run at about 4% of sales across the business cycles. There is a real change here, demonstrating differentiation and the quality of ATI-produced products. 
Orders continue to be strong in the first quarter. Backlog in our High Performance Metals segment at the end of the first quarter is approaching levels reached in early 2007 and 2008. As a result of the major project wins, we also have a solid backlog for 2011 in our Flat-Rolled Products segment. Market strength, along with ATI's improved capabilities and expanded capacities, give me confidence in our beliefs that strong secular growth resumes in 2011. 2012 will be better than 2011, and 2013 is shaping up to far better than 2012. This extraordinary time in the specialty metals business -- this is an extraordinary time in the specialty metals business. It is the beginning of a period of sustained growth unlike anything I've seen in my 40-plus years. ATI is now very well-positioned for the future and for profitable growth. 
As you know, I will retire after our annual meeting. This is the right time for the change. I am confident that Rich Harshman is the right person for the job. Rich and I have been working together for nearly 8 years, developing and implementing ATI strategies for profitable growth. We have on outstanding team in place to support Rich. I'm confident that under Rich's leadership, ATI can continue the transformation that we started in 2004 and take ATI to new levels of performance.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me just say how much I've enjoyed my time leading ATI. I've enjoyed the many conversations that I've had with you, our investors and our analysts. I particularly liked those of you who questioned our strategies and our theories. Good management must be open to opinions that test our thinking. You required us to be more thoughtful and to look at our positions from every perspective. ATI is a better company because of you. My personal thanks.

348893,129808615,118434,"Allegheny Technologies Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","ATI Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat. We are optimistic that 2011 will indeed be the year in when strong secular growth resumes for ATI. This optimism is supported by our performance in the first quarter. It is important to note that while are focused on our four key global ma",1832,"Thank you, Pat. We are optimistic that 2011 will indeed be the year in when strong secular growth resumes for ATI. This optimism is supported by our performance in the first quarter. It is important to note that while are focused on our four key global markets, 48% of our first quarter 2011 revenue came from our 2 largest markets: Aerospace and defense and oil and gas/chemical process industry. This becomes 54% of sales when the medical market is included. These 3 markets require high-value, high-quality products. They are global. They have current robust demand and are expected to get stronger over the next several years. And ATI is very well-positioned to continue to grow in these markets. 
First, let's look at the aerospace market. We, and the other members of the supply chain are being told to get ready for unprecedented production rate increases between now and 2013. Boeing has set aggressive targets to build more 737s than ever, build more 777s than ever, deliver the first 787 in the third quarter 2001, and then significantly and quickly ramp up its production rate. 
Airbus has set aggressive targets to build more A320s than ever and increase the build rate for the A330 family. These build rates are supported by record backlogs of about 7,000 airplanes. In addition, Airbus plans to complete the development and begin ramping production of the A350 extra widebody later in the decade. 
For ATI, these build rates translate into greater demand for our specialty metals for both airframes and engines than during any previous cycle. The larger global fleet also increases demand for our high-value rotating-quality titanium alloys and nickel-based superalloys used in jet engine spare parts and engine replacement kits. 
ATI is very well-positioned and ready for these higher production rates. We have been and are continuing to invest in unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities and capacities. We have been and are continuing to innovate with new alloys, products and technologies. 
Some examples. There is significant interest in our game-changing ATI 425 alloy, with much qualification activity ongoing. Our ATI 718Plus nickel-based superalloy is growing in new aero engine applications. We are making good progress in developing a significant position in fastener stock. ATI is the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finished product, all three alloy systems used to make fastness: Titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. And we have proprietary alloys for unique fastener applications. And finally, we are well-positioned to grow as a key supplier of the powder alloys for the jet engine market. 
We offer customers a secure and stable integrated supply chain. Our ATI aerospace market sector team allies all company resources to this market. We are integrated in titanium raw materials with our Raleigh, Utah premium-grade titanium sponge facility. We are now offering more value-added processing through our new Sheffield, England precision machining technology. With expected completion of the Ladish acquisition, we have the capability to produce highly engineered and technically complex parts.
Concerning titanium raw material supply needed for the expected aerospace production rate increase. Our Raleigh facility is now producing sponge at higher volumes and improving yields. We have commissioned 34 of the 36 furnace sets. The sponge chemistry is outstanding, and is meeting premium-grade specifications. We are using the Raleigh sponge to feed our West Coast melting operations for industrial applications, and we expect to be producing titanium sponge at a 20-million-pound annualized rate during the second half of this year.
Titanium sponge and scrap availability is tight. We understand that Chinese titanium sponge prices are now about $7 per pound, and we know that 6-4 premium grade bulk weldable scrap is at the same level. The ability to have our own titanium sponge supply with the Raleigh facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations will enable ATI to continue to grow.
Turning to the oil and gas and chemical process industry. We expect our second-largest market to remain a strong growth market for ATI. Since we first began to focus the company-wide capabilities of ATI on this market in 2008, we have established ourselves as a global leader and a reliable supplier of complex, difficult-to-produce specialty metals. ATI is known for our industry-leading product quality, reliability and delivery performance. We serve the oil and gas/chemical process industry through each of our business segments. In our High Performance Metals segment, it was the second-largest market in the first quarter at 12% of segment sales. It was the largest market served by our Flat-Rolled Products and Engineered Products segments, at 28% and 29% of sales, respectively. 
The global oil and gas market is expected to grow as demand increases from developing countries and the economies of developed countries recover and grow. The international energy administration recently announced the results of their global shale gas reserve study and reported total recoverable natural gas reserves increased more than 40% when shale gas is included. As drilling for shale gas increases, we expect demand to grow for ATI products, such as our tungsten materials for drills and bits, ATI Datalloy 2 collars for horizontal and directional drilling and nickel and titanium alloys for completion systems. 
Many new oil and gas discoveries contain sour gases, making exploration and production more demanding. In addition, older fields once thought to be depleted are now being extended through the use of new drilling technologies. This results in the need for more of the specialty models that ATI produces. For example, we have won and are well positioned to win additional orders for our nickel-based-alloy and specialty-alloy flat-rolled products for use in oil and gas pipelines. During the first quarter, ATI was chosen to supply a large volume of nickel-based alloy plate for a large sour gas pipeline being constructed in Abu Dhabi as part of the Shah gas field. 
More recently, ATI was selected to supply the nickel-based alloy sheet to be used in sub-sea flowlines for a large deepwater project in Brazil. These projects are in addition to the order for approximately 6 million pounds of CP titanium that our Uniti joint venture was awarded late last year for the world's largest seawater desalinization plant. This order is being produced and delivered throughout 2011.
Turning to the electrical energy market. Demand from this market remains steady, with slight improvement during the first quarter for 2011 pretty much in line with the economic recovery. Shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steel were flat year-over-year. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately 10% higher than the first quarter. Product mix continued to improve as demand for lower loss grades rose as a result of the tightened transformer efficiency standards in the United States. Demand has begun to increase for our nickel-based and specialty alloys used for gas turbines. And we continue to work with a number of customers in the alternative energy markets, and are optimistic that growth opportunities exist for ATI in these markets.
We believe an inflection point to secular growth from the electrical energy market could develop as Japan recovers and rebuilds. We expect that global demand for grain-oriented electrical steel should begin to improve as the grid is rebuilt in the affected area. Assuming Japan increases its use of natural gas for power generation, which is widely speculated, ATI sales could grow to the gas turbine market and to markets for exploration, processing and transportation of LNG, or liquid natural gas.
For Nuclear Energy, although it is too early to determine the impact from recent events, we do expect refueling and maintenance to continue. We also expect increased interest in safe and secure spent-fuel storage and processing. This uses many of the specialty metals made by ATI. And finally, we eventually expect the resumption of new nuclear plant construction in Asia.
All of these factors point to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key markets. In addition, we are seeing cyclical recovery in most of our other markets. As a result, we are seeing improved volume. First quarter shipments for nearly all of our products increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period last year. 
As we have said, first, demand improves, resulting in increased volume, then better pricing follows. We expect to see higher base prices for most of our products going forward. Base prices are increasing for our High Performance Metal's titanium alloys and nickel-based alloys. In our Flat-Rolled Products segment, two base price increases have been announced for our nickel-based alloys. Effective January 4, 2011, base prices increased 7% to 9%. And effective February 23, 2011, base prices increased 5% to 8%. 
In addition, a 6% to 9% price increase was effective April 1 for our standard stainless products. The market is supporting this price increase as U.S. service center activity has been improving, driven by better demand from the transportation, energy and food equipment markets. And the pipe and tube market is improving due to increased demand from the oil and gas/chemical process industry and electrical energy market. Although end market demand and fundamentals are getting better, customers for our stainless products continue to be cautious and closely watch the raw material surcharge as part of the timing of their buying decision.
Moving to our Engineered Products segment. The first quarter was strong. Sales increased over 45% compared to the first quarter 2010 as a result of improved demand and higher prices for our tungsten products and carbon-alloy steel forgings. More importantly, segment operating profit was a respectable 11.4% of sales. Sales of our tungsten increased 34%. Of note, the market price for APT, or ammonium paratungstate, the raw material used to produce tungsten powder, increased significantly since the first quarter 2010. In addition, APT is in short supply due to restricted exports from China. And tungsten scrap supply is also tight. 
Fortunately for ATI, we expanded our APT capacity. The ability to produce our own APT supply enables ATI to continue to grow our tungsten-based materials business. Sales of our carbon alloy forgings grew nearly 85% compared to the same period last year due to strong demand from oil and gas, transportation, particularly Class 8 trucks and large construction and mining equipment.
In summary, we are building momentum across our businesses and continue to see 2011 as the year where secular growth returns in our key global markets. We remain focused on improving our cost structure, with $26 million of gross cost reductions in the first quarter. This, combined with growing demand and approved pricing for most of our specialty metals, results in our expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 20% in 2011 compared to 2010, and segment operating profit of 15% of total sales for the full year 2011. These expectations do not include any impact of the pending acquisition of Ladish.

We have a tremendous amount of activity going on with a number of the primes dealing with a number of the alloy systems that we make, including ATI 425, including some of the high-hard steel armors that we make, as well as 6-4, ATI 6-4 titanium plate. The other -- so we share the optimism there in terms of armor applications going forward. The other thing that we're looking forward to is the completion of our Fabricated Components business outside of Chicago, where we're putting in some manufacturing capability that's really value-add, to do some fabricated components out of the mill products that we make from a value-add standpoint. And that -- we expect that facility to be online and up and running by early third quarter, perhaps even late second quarter of this year. So this is -- we share the optimism in the armor side. The process there is a little bit longer because of qualification and the customers are really looking at a wide variety of designs to meet the missions that the U.S. DoD is looking for."

So as I said, we're trending towards the upper end of that range, and we're not going to let ourselves be range bound. Some of the impact that we're seeing here is from surcharges, but not all of them. I mean certainly, base prices are improving and only now beginning to improve. Volume is improved. The mix is more the way we like it. It's s a richer product mix. I think that in some of these end markets, not the real major ones that we would view as our key global oriented end markets, but there is some level of seasonality in some of the business, especially in the third quarter. When you look traditionally at stainless, when you look at the tungsten-based materials, have a trend to be stronger in the first half of the year than they are in the second half of the year. So there are some puts and takes on that, but I think we are clearly trending towards the upper end of the range, and I think we'll all be disappointed if we don't do better than that range."

One of the things that we don't expect to have every quarter is $6 million of startup costs in Raleigh as we ramp that up. I would expect that, that number would be cut in half in the second quarter. And if not, be completely gone in the third quarter, certainly be cut in half again if not more. And then in the fourth quarter, we're not expecting any startup because we're expecting to be running at an annualized rate approaching 20 million pounds.

I've said that 2010 was the transition year and 2011 would be the year when strong secular growth resumes. 
We're off to a great start. Sales increased 36% to $1.23 billion, putting ATI on track to return the company with over $5 billion in sales. Segment operating profit increased nearly 85% to $162 million, which is 13.2% of sales. Earnings per share were $0.54 including $0.05 of special charges. This represents the highest quarterly percentage 2008. 
Our key global markets are strong and represent 70% of ATI first quarter sales. At 25% of first quarter revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 33%, compared to the same period last year. At 23% of first quarter revenue, sales to the oil and gas/chemical process industry grew 51% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and also grew by 400 basis points to 23% of total sales, up from 19% of sales for the full year. Electrical energy market represented 16% of ATI first quarter sales. At 6% of first quarter sales, medical was once again our fastest-growing market. This market more than doubled since the first quarter of last year. Historically, the medical market has run at about 4% of sales across the business cycles. There is a real change here, demonstrating differentiation and the quality of ATI-produced products. 
Orders continue to be strong in the first quarter. Backlog in our High Performance Metals segment at the end of the first quarter is approaching levels reached in early 2007 and 2008. As a result of the major project wins, we also have a solid backlog for 2011 in our Flat-Rolled Products segment. Market strength, along with ATI's improved capabilities and expanded capacities, give me confidence in our beliefs that strong secular growth resumes in 2011. 2012 will be better than 2011, and 2013 is shaping up to far better than 2012. This extraordinary time in the specialty metals business -- this is an extraordinary time in the specialty metals business. It is the beginning of a period of sustained growth unlike anything I've seen in my 40-plus years. ATI is now very well-positioned for the future and for profitable growth. 
As you know, I will retire after our annual meeting. This is the right time for the change. I am confident that Rich Harshman is the right person for the job. Rich and I have been working together for nearly 8 years, developing and implementing ATI strategies for profitable growth. We have on outstanding team in place to support Rich. I'm confident that under Rich's leadership, ATI can continue the transformation that we started in 2004 and take ATI to new levels of performance.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me just say how much I've enjoyed my time leading ATI. I've enjoyed the many conversations that I've had with you, our investors and our analysts. I particularly liked those of you who questioned our strategies and our theories. Good management must be open to opinions that test our thinking. You required us to be more thoughtful and to look at our positions from every perspective. ATI is a better company because of you. My personal thanks. 
Now here is Rich Harshman."
348893,129808615,118524,"Allegheny Technologies Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","ATI Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat.

It is important to note that while are focused on our four key global ma",1832,"Thank you, Pat. We are optimistic that 2011 will indeed be the year in when strong secular growth resumes for ATI. This optimism is supported by our performance in the first quarter. It is important to note that while are focused on our four key global markets, 48% of our first quarter 2011 revenue came from our 2 largest markets: Aerospace and defense and oil and gas/chemical process industry. This becomes 54% of sales when the medical market is included. These 3 markets require high-value, high-quality products. They are global. They have current robust demand and are expected to get stronger over the next several years. And ATI is very well-positioned to continue to grow in these markets. 
First, let's look at the aerospace market. We, and the other members of the supply chain are being told to get ready for unprecedented production rate increases between now and 2013. Boeing has set aggressive targets to build more 737s than ever, build more 777s than ever, deliver the first 787 in the third quarter 2001, and then significantly and quickly ramp up its production rate. 
Airbus has set aggressive targets to build more A320s than ever and increase the build rate for the A330 family. These build rates are supported by record backlogs of about 7,000 airplanes. In addition, Airbus plans to complete the development and begin ramping production of the A350 extra widebody later in the decade. 
For ATI, these build rates translate into greater demand for our specialty metals for both airframes and engines than during any previous cycle. The larger global fleet also increases demand for our high-value rotating-quality titanium alloys and nickel-based superalloys used in jet engine spare parts and engine replacement kits. 
ATI is very well-positioned and ready for these higher production rates. We have been and are continuing to invest in unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities and capacities. We have been and are continuing to innovate with new alloys, products and technologies. 
Some examples. There is significant interest in our game-changing ATI 425 alloy, with much qualification activity ongoing. Our ATI 718Plus nickel-based superalloy is growing in new aero engine applications. We are making good progress in developing a significant position in fastener stock. ATI is the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finished product, all three alloy systems used to make fastness: Titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. And we have proprietary alloys for unique fastener applications. And finally, we are well-positioned to grow as a key supplier of the powder alloys for the jet engine market. 
We offer customers a secure and stable integrated supply chain. Our ATI aerospace market sector team allies all company resources to this market. We are integrated in titanium raw materials with our Raleigh, Utah premium-grade titanium sponge facility. We are now offering more value-added processing through our new Sheffield, England precision machining technology. With expected completion of the Ladish acquisition, we have the capability to produce highly engineered and technically complex parts.
Concerning titanium raw material supply needed for the expected aerospace production rate increase. Our Raleigh facility is now producing sponge at higher volumes and improving yields. We have commissioned 34 of the 36 furnace sets. The sponge chemistry is outstanding, and is meeting premium-grade specifications. We are using the Raleigh sponge to feed our West Coast melting operations for industrial applications, and we expect to be producing titanium sponge at a 20-million-pound annualized rate during the second half of this year.
Titanium sponge and scrap availability is tight. We understand that Chinese titanium sponge prices are now about $7 per pound, and we know that 6-4 premium grade bulk weldable scrap is at the same level. The ability to have our own titanium sponge supply with the Raleigh facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations will enable ATI to continue to grow.
Turning to the oil and gas and chemical process industry. We expect our second-largest market to remain a strong growth market for ATI. Since we first began to focus the company-wide capabilities of ATI on this market in 2008, we have established ourselves as a global leader and a reliable supplier of complex, difficult-to-produce specialty metals. ATI is known for our industry-leading product quality, reliability and delivery performance. We serve the oil and gas/chemical process industry through each of our business segments. In our High Performance Metals segment, it was the second-largest market in the first quarter at 12% of segment sales. It was the largest market served by our Flat-Rolled Products and Engineered Products segments, at 28% and 29% of sales, respectively. 
The global oil and gas market is expected to grow as demand increases from developing countries and the economies of developed countries recover and grow. The international energy administration recently announced the results of their global shale gas reserve study and reported total recoverable natural gas reserves increased more than 40% when shale gas is included. As drilling for shale gas increases, we expect demand to grow for ATI products, such as our tungsten materials for drills and bits, ATI Datalloy 2 collars for horizontal and directional drilling and nickel and titanium alloys for completion systems. 
Many new oil and gas discoveries contain sour gases, making exploration and production more demanding. In addition, older fields once thought to be depleted are now being extended through the use of new drilling technologies. This results in the need for more of the specialty metals that ATI produces. For example, we have won and are well positioned to win additional orders for our nickel-based-alloy and specialty-alloy flat-rolled products for use in oil and gas pipelines. During the first quarter, ATI was chosen to supply a large volume of nickel-based alloy plate for a large sour gas pipeline being constructed in Abu Dhabi as part of the Shah gas field. 
More recently, ATI was selected to supply the nickel-based alloy sheet to be used in sub-sea flowlines for a large deepwater project in Brazil. These projects are in addition to the order for approximately 6 million pounds of CP titanium that our Uniti joint venture was awarded late last year for the world's largest seawater desalinization plant. This order is being produced and delivered throughout 2011.
Turning to the electrical energy market. Demand from this market remains steady, with slight improvement during the first quarter for 2011 pretty much in line with the economic recovery. Shipments of our grain-oriented electrical steel were flat year-over-year. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately 10% higher than the first quarter. Product mix continued to improve as demand for lower loss grades rose as a result of the tightened transformer efficiency standards in the United States. Demand has begun to increase for our nickel-based and specialty alloys used for gas turbines. And we continue to work with a number of customers in the alternative energy markets, and are optimistic that growth opportunities exist for ATI in these markets.
We believe an inflection point to secular growth from the electrical energy market could develop as Japan recovers and rebuilds. We expect that global demand for grain-oriented electrical steel should begin to improve as the grid is rebuilt in the affected area. Assuming Japan increases its use of natural gas for power generation, which is widely speculated, ATI sales could grow to the gas turbine market and to markets for exploration, processing and transportation of LNG, or liquid natural gas.
For Nuclear Energy, although it is too early to determine the impact from recent events, we do expect refueling and maintenance to continue. We also expect increased interest in safe and secure spent-fuel storage and processing. This uses many of the specialty metals made by ATI. And finally, we eventually expect the resumption of new nuclear plant construction in Asia.
All of these factors point to the resumption of strong secular growth in our key markets. In addition, we are seeing cyclical recovery in most of our other markets. As a result, we are seeing improved volume. First quarter shipments for nearly all of our products increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period last year. 
As we have said, first, demand improves, resulting in increased volume, then better pricing follows. We expect to see higher base prices for most of our products going forward. Base prices are increasing for our High Performance Metal's titanium alloys and nickel-based alloys. In our Flat-Rolled Products segment, two base price increases have been announced for our nickel-based alloys. Effective January 4, 2011, base prices increased 7% to 9%. And effective February 23, 2011, base prices increased 5% to 8%. 
In addition, a 6% to 9% price increase was effective April 1 for our standard stainless products. The market is supporting this price increase as U.S. service center activity has been improving, driven by better demand from the transportation, energy and food equipment markets. And the pipe and tube market is improving due to increased demand from the oil and gas/chemical process industry and electrical energy market. Although end market demand and fundamentals are getting better, customers for our stainless products continue to be cautious and closely watch the raw material surcharge as part of the timing of their buying decision.
Moving to our Engineered Products segment. The first quarter was strong. Sales increased over 45% compared to the first quarter 2010 as a result of improved demand and higher prices for our tungsten products and carbon-alloy steel forgings. More importantly, segment operating profit was a respectable 11.4% of sales. Sales of our tungsten increased 34%. Of note, the market price for APT, or ammonium paratungstate, the raw material used to produce tungsten powder, increased significantly since the first quarter 2010. In addition, APT is in short supply due to restricted exports from China. And tungsten scrap supply is also tight. 
Fortunately for ATI, we expanded our APT capacity. The ability to produce our own APT supply enables ATI to continue to grow our tungsten-based materials business. Sales of our carbon alloy forgings grew nearly 85% compared to the same period last year due to strong demand from oil and gas, transportation, particularly Class 8 trucks and large construction and mining equipment.
In summary, we are building momentum across our businesses and continue to see 2011 as the year where secular growth returns in our key global markets. We remain focused on improving our cost structure, with $26 million of gross cost reductions in the first quarter. This, combined with growing demand and approved pricing for most of our specialty metals, results in our expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 20% in 2011 compared to 2010, and segment operating profit of 15% of total sales for the full year 2011. These expectations do not include any impact of the pending acquisition of Ladish. 
Before we move to the question-and-answer session, I hope everyone stays online after the Q&A session for some special closing comments about Pat Hassey. 
Keisha, we will now open the call for any questions."

Everything is below that, from titanium to nickel to stainless to grain-oriented to exotic alloys. I think the prices have only recently, quite frankly, begun to recover. But I think that, in our view, that 2011 is the beginning of the recovery of base prices. We would expect, given the dynamics of the market, that '12 would be a substantial increase over '11, and '13 is probably where you get back to or closer to the base prices that we saw at the last peak of the cycle. And the other way we look at it is that we're certainly facilitized to have a higher volume in 2012 and '13 than we did before because of all the capital investments that we've made. We also have a lower cost structure because of all the costs that we've continued to take out. I'm talking variable costs, mainly things like depreciation expense will be higher because of all the investments that we've made. But I think when we look at base prices, if you want a generality, we think that there's opportunity for 25% to 30% more upside in base prices over the next couple of years."

While the second quarter was impacted by costs related to the Ladish acquisition, overall performance was good and continue to support our view that 2011 is the year when strong secular growth",2463,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. While the second quarter was impacted by costs related to the Ladish acquisition, overall performance was good and continue to support our view that 2011 is the year when strong secular growth resumes in our key global markets. Sales increased to $1.35 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter 2010 and 10% higher than in the first quarter 2011. Segment operating profit increased nearly 60%, compared to the second quarter 2010 to $187 million, excluding costs related to the Ladish acquisition. That is nearly 14% of sales. Earnings per share were $0.70 excluding acquisition expenses, 94% higher than the second quarter 2010 and nearly 19% higher than the first quarter of 2011 even though average common shares outstanding are nearly 5% higher due to the Ladish acquisition.
We continued to benefit from our diversified global markets and our diversified product mix. Our key global markets, aerospace and defense, oil and gas chemical processing industry, electrical energy and medical are strong and represent 70% of ATI first half 2011 sales. Direct international sales were nearly 33% of sales during the first half 2011. Let's look at each of these key global markets in greater detail.
At 27% of revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 43% compared to the first 6 months of 2010. ATI's investments over the last several years of manufacturing capabilities, innovative new alloys and strategic acquisitions leaves the company well-positioned to benefit from the expected unprecedented strong growth and aerospace demand and production rates over the next 3 to 5 years. 
We had a successful Paris Air Show in June. Those who visited ATI at the air show saw our expanded capabilities to produce highly engineered technically complex components. These capabilities add to ATI's long-standing reputation as a global leader in producing a wide range of specialty metals products.
On display at the Air Show where a number of component products and ally forms, including ATI Ladish aero engine rotating forgings made of plasma arc melted ATI titanium 17 and ATI 6-4 titanium alloys and rotary forgings made of ATI 718 nickel-based superalloy, ATI wasp alloy and Powder Metals. Also on display at the Air Show were large structural titanium investment castings from ATI Ladish for airframe and jet engine applications, landing gear and helicopter forgings made by ATI Ladish, a large jet engine turbine case made of our new ATI 718Plus alloy, prototype components made of our unique new titanium product ATI 425 alloy, including super plastic form components made from ATI 425 sheet, tubing made of ATI 425 strip, honeycomb made of ATI 45 precision road strip. In addition, we displayed titanium near net shapes and exclusions, titanium nickel-based alloy and specialty alloy fastener stock and expanded cutting tool and precision machining capabilities. These products have ATI well-positioned for growth in the aerospace market. The already record backlogs at the airframe OEMs continue to get even larger. Last week, AMR announced what has been called, ""The Largest Order in Aircraft Industry History."" This could be an inflection point for the aerospace industry as many U.S. carriers finally enter the market to upgrade their aging noncompetitive high-cost fleets.
Moving onto our second largest market. Sales to the oil and gas process industry grew 53% compared to the first half of 2010. Sales to the oil and gas and CPI markets represented 23% of total ATI sales in the first 6 months of 2011, 400 basis points higher than sales for the full year 2010. Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. Today's rig count has 6 our of 10 rigs drilling directionally and horizontally. This requires the use of our tungsten drill bodies and nonmagnetic Datalloy 2 collars as well as ATI oilpatch, a nickel alloy and titanium alloys for completion systems. We continue to grow our position in this global market. We received another large order for our nickel alloy plate for clad subsea flowlines for sour gas, again, our customers in Japan for a project being constructed in the Middle East. Our proprietary ATI 2003 lean duplex alloy was selected for several sections of a large offshore platform being built for use in the North Sea. In addition, we are scheduled to ship ATI 2003 alloy strip for use in a large subsea flowlines project in the Irish Sea. We received a significant order for nickel-based alloy sheet for a large offshore project in Brazil. These orders and others add to a strong backlog for our high-value flat-rolled products. 
We have performed very well on the [indiscernible] desalination job booked by our Uniti titanium joint venture. This has positioned Uniti for the next round of cell jobs. The sell market for CP titanium sheet products is expected to be strong for the next several years.
In addition, we are seeing several new opportunities for our industrial titanium products, both CP titanium and titanium alloy from the global corrosion markets. It is important to note that ATI has been meeting and exceeding customer expectations on these large global projects. We continue to win orders because of our performance and our customers confidence in ATI as a supplier. Electrical Energy market represents 15% of ATI first half sales and grew 12% compared to the first half of 2010. Order activity in power generation picked up during the second quarter for nuclear energy, natural gas turbine and solar applications. Shipments of grainery and electrical steel were flat for the first 6 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. We expect shipments of this product to be somewhat softer in the third quarter due to seasonal summer shutdowns at some of our customers.
At 5.5% of first half sales, the medical market grew by over 20% compared to the same period in 2010. There's a real change here demonstrating the differentiation in the quality of ATI's products. We are improving our position with the major medical OEMs by offering titanium products in a wide range of alloys and products sizes. Our ability to control the titanium manufacturing process from raw materials to the finished mill product makes ATI attractive to the medical equipment customers just as it does to the aerospace OEMs.
In addition, due to faster scan rates and better resolution, demand for 3 MRI systems is growing, creating strong demand for our niobium titanium alloys.
In summary, our order backlog is strong. Backlog in the high performance metals segment at the end of the second quarter was over $1.38 billion and as a result of major project wins, we also have a solid backlog for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys for the second half of 2011 in our Flat-Rolled Products segment. 
We continue to benefit from our differentiated product mix. We continue to innovate with new alloys, products and technologies. Some examples. There is significant interest in our ATI 425 titanium alloy, with much qualification activity ongoing. It is important to note that although ATI 425 alloy has been around for a few years, it was qualified as a direct replacement for 6-4 titanium in aerospace airframe applications just 15 months ago and was introduced to the aerospace market about 1 year ago as the Farnborough Airshow. We are pleased with the significant interest in qualification efforts currently ongoing for this game-changing new alloy in such a short period of time.
At the May 2011 Aero Met Conference, the industry's largest aerospace materials conference, a joint presentation of industry experts confirmed that ATI 425 alloy has significant advantages over 6-4 titanium for hot fabrication of aerospace parts. This has resulted in even greater interest from a variety of aerospace customers. During the Paris Air Show, customer meetings were held to discuss current and future trials of ATI 425 alloys. We exhibited several hot form parts made of ATI 425 alloy that further stimulated interest in this new product. Our ATI 718Plus nickel-based super alloy achieved another milestone during the second quarter. ATI announced a long-term agreement with Rolls-Royce for the supply of ATI 718Plus alloy. Rolls-Royce is the first jet engine manufacturer to use this innovative new alloy for rotating applications.
ATI is continuing to expand participation into the aerospace fastener market. OEM qualification programs are in process and we are shipping orders to fastener producers. We are the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finish, all 3 alloy systems used to make fasteners, that is titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. In addition, we have several proprietary alloys that offer advantages for the more common alloys used to make fasteners.
And finally, ATI Allegheny Ludlum and ATI Powder Metals are developing a line of bull rated steel for barrier to neutrons and nuclear spent fuel storage. Interest in these applications significantly since the Fukushima event in Japan.
Beneath the long-term growth expected from our key growth markets, ATI is continuing to invest for the future. We have a defined vision of the future and a strategic plan to continue to enhance our competitive position, while creating value for our shareholders and customers. I'd like to update you on some of the strategic initiatives.
First, an update on our acquisition of Ladish. On May 9, we completed the acquisition of Ladish, though our second quarter contained only 8 weeks of ATI Ladish results. In the short time period, we were very encouraged by the opportunities that exist for ATI shareholders and customers. We are pleased with the customer acceptance of the combination. ATI Ladish, which is a business unit of our High Performance Metals segment has advanced forgings, titanium investment castings and precision finishing capability to ATI's product portfolio. ATI Ladish enhances ATI's position on supply chain to create greater customer value by providing the capabilities to meet OEM desires or near net shapes for finished components. We expect sales through ATI Ladish to grow greater than the secular growth expected from the upcoming aerospace build ramp. ATI Ladish is well-positioned on the next generation and future generation jet engines in addition. ATI Ladish is capable of forging ATI's proprietary new alloys and Powder Metals and technically advanced components. We also expect growth from our focus to expand ATI Ladish capabilities into our non-aerospace growth markets such as oil and gas, Chemical Process industry and Electrical Energy.
Next an update on our Rowley, Utah titanium sponge facility. Our Rowley facility has now produced over 5 million pounds of titanium sponge in the first half of 2011 or an annualized rate of 10 million pounds. We expect to continue an orderly increase for the production rate in the second half of 2011. This sponge is being used to produce industrial titanium products. The chemistry of the Rowley sponge is outstanding and is consistently meeting premium grade specifications. We have made good progress in standardizing manufacturing practices, which is key to the aerospace grade qualification process. Our focus is to achieve standard grade qualification by early 2012. We will then begin the premium grade qualification program.
As we have said many times, ATI's ability to produce titanium sponge with the Rowley facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operation enables ATI to maximize profitable growth opportunities for titanium products. To support our production of titanium sponge, we have long-term raw material supply agreements in place to provide stable input pricing. On the titanium melting side, our new plasma arc melt, or PAM, furnaced in Bakers, North Carolina has begun melt trials. This is ATI's fourth PAM furnace and is coming on line in time to support the record Aerospace backlog and the expected unprecedented aerospace production rate ramp as well as the strong growth expected from the medical market. Finally, we expect to begin construction of our Flat-Rolled Products segment, hot rolling and processing facility later this summer. Site preparation is essentially complete and final engineering drawings are nearing completion. As a result, we now expect 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $275 million to $300 million.
Concerning our stainless products. Our Flat-Rolled Products segment provides a good view into today's economic realities. On the one hand, demand for our high-value products from our key global growth markets is strong. On the other had, demand for our standard stainless products has been soft due in large part to weakness in consumer durables and weak consumer confidence. Industry reports indicate that the service center inventories for stainless products with 2.7 months in June, down from 2.9 months in May. Most service center customers have been focused on reducing their inventories due to the declining surcharges and uncertainty in the domestic market. Demand for our stainless products has been soft in July. We used this slow period to accelerate maintenance on our equipment, which will impact third quarter results by approximately $6 million. Looking beyond the third quarter, we expect demand for our standard stainless products to improve in the fourth quarter.
ATI Allegheny Ludlum recently announced the new surcharge calculations that is designed to better align raw materials costs with the surcharge and bring added stability to an increasingly volatile market. This surcharge calculation change is effective with shipments beginning October 2, 2011. We announced late yesterday that the tentative agreements reached on June 30, 2011, with the USW represented employees at ATI's Allegheny Ludlam and Albany Oregon titanium operations were not ratified. We will continue to work with the U.S. W to reach an agreement.
In summary, in spite of the uncertainties resulting from the ongoing debate about how to deal with the U.S. budget deficits and debt ceiling, combined with the European debt crisis, we remain optimistic about the current demand for most of our major markets and the secular growth opportunities over the next several years. We are building momentum across our businesses and continue to see 2011 as the year when secular growth returns in our key global markets. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect ATI to continue to benefit from our new alloys and products, diversified global markets and differentiated product mix. With the Ladish acquisition now complete, we now expect 2011 revenues of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion, compared to our previous expectation up $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion and segment operating profit of 13% to 14% of revenues, excluding the impact of purchase inventory accounting charges. These expectations are based on the strength in our key global markets, improving shipments and base prices for many of our high-value a segments in base prices for many of our high-value products, the expectation of improved demand for our standard stainless products and the view fourth quarter and the view that certain raw material costs will moderate slightly or at least remain at current levels.

The answer is we think that these investments are coming on right at the right time and the qualification process is different obviously for furnace for melt versus titanium sponge production",468,"Well, I'll answer the first part of the question, Steve, first. The answer is we think that these investments are coming on right at the right time and the qualification process is different obviously for furnace for melt versus titanium sponge production. The reason, one of the reasons why we're really accelerating and focusing the sponge qualification program for standard grade, once we achieve that standard great qualification, which is more of an internal certification, that opens up the nonrotating aerospace market as well as the medical market for use of the Rowley sponge and the process that we're on is really one that by the end of the first quarter, we expect to achieve the standard grade qualification. The rotating or premium grade qualification is tied into qualification programs run with the engine manufacturers and that is dependent upon, not only us and us performing but also the engine manufacturers and their qualification process so that takes a little bit longer but with the flexibility we have with using the Rowley sponge, we'll be quite happy with how we use that sponge across all of our applications. On the melt side, as you know, we now have, this will be our fourth PAM furnace, it is essentially a sister furnace to PAm 3 that we went through that a qualification process from mid-2010 into early 2011 and so we know what to do there and we know what timeframe it is and we think that, that furnace is coming on right at the right time to meet the expected ramp of for the OEM builds and obviously the necessity of the Aero engine side. 
Now as far as somebody new bringing on the capacity. It really depends upon what alloy systems you were talking about, what is the application for that, is it a[ph], is it ESR, isn't VAR, is plasma, we're the only plasma qualitative with the materials I think we have a pretty good knowledge of how that process works. Is the material going into static components or is it going into rotating Coble components, we're getting qualification longer so it is highly dependent upon what the melt technology is and what the end application is. But it isn't something that first of all, to make those investments, you're looking at lead times that are easily more than a year and in some cases could be up to as low as 18 to 24 months for the furnace so your talking about a couple of years at least of construction time and then beyond that your talking about a qualification process so it's not something that happens easily that's why we like the approach we've taken of where the timing of these investments and coming on right at what we think is the right time."

I think that some of the uncertainty over the economy and the slowdown in the GDP growth in the second quarter and as I said, it's clear to us that this uncertainty in Washington is impacting consumer confidence and that business on the standard stainless sheet side is a consumer confidence driven gain and all of those factors were combining to see a significant weakening in that business throughout the second quarter, which we saw in our view bottoming out in terms of order entry and shipment levels for July, August is beginning to look a little bit better, one month does not make a trend so we'll see what happens but as we look fundamentally through to the end markets, the end markets don't appear to be in that bad of a ship, the end market demand appears to us to be poised for some increase in growth in demand as we get into the fourth quarter and inventories are lean throughout the supply chain so those are the factors that give us the confidence to make the statements we have about the fourth quarter."

The rotating grade qualification will be at least that long, if not longer and a lot of it depends upon how well the process goes and what the market conditions are, quite frankly. So what we do for the raw material needs as the Aero engine market ramps is, as you know, we're currently buying sponge and leave by sponge from several suppliers who might have that rotating quality qualification in place and we will continue to do that. We'll continue to do that, quite frankly, Sal, after the 24 million pounds even if we had 24 million pounds of certified rotating quality sponge out of Raleigh, whenever that date is, it's our expectation that our raw material needs for sponge will be greater than that for all of our mill product so we will continue to buy to our expectation that we will continue to by sponge from third parties and the good thing about rotating quality sponge is that it is the most flexible.

That weakness we expect to continue here through the third quarter. We expect it to get better in the fourth quarter. We'll see. That's more of a short cycle business and very dependent on the consumer confidence that we talked about earlier so there's a number of factors that worked into that but those are the 2 biggest ones."

There are generally speaking and historically in our business. For titanium, LTAs were not firm fixed price. I mean on the Aero engine side they had surcharge mechanisms in place to protect against the volatility of raw material costs that we had no control over and the raw materials are either titanium raw material units, either a sponge or a scrap and vanadium and aluminum because that's the preponderance of the alloying elements going into titanium alloys. As you move forward in some of these markets with multiyear LTAs in place because of how the business model works for air frame or other end markets, they're really looking more for some price certainty from their standpoint so they want to eliminate the volatility of that tipping the raw material surcharges. That's an important reason to be in a 100% of the market, it's just pieces of the market opportunity that we think will exist. There's 2 ways for a producer to deal with that, a company like ATI, one is you can just quote three, one is, you can say, we'll we can't quote firm fixed right because we don't have any way of controlling sponge cost 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 years from now and therefore you won't get the business or you can quote it and hope that you don't get hurt by the volatility of sponge or you can make your own sponge and control the costs and therefore, have the confidence in your ability to price something firm that you have an effective risk management process in place that won't damage the shareholders and that's how we think about it and that's one of the reasons why we built Rowley."

Obviously, we can ramp it up quicker and reduce some of the nonrecurring startup cost that we're experiencing but then we're producing sponge that only has industrial grade application to it and you are investing that those dollars in inventory that might be there for a while or you could strike a balance where you minimize not eliminate but minimize the startup cost due to the ramp up in a less aggressive way and we focused a higher priority on achieving the standard way qualification and that's what we've done so as we look at, if you look at the first quarter in this country produced in the first quarter we were running about a 9 million pound annualized run rate, the second quarter we were running at a little over 11 million pounds annualized rate. The third quarter, we expect to be in the range of 15 million to 16 million pound rate and in the fourth quarter we expect to be in the range of 16.5 million to 17.5 million pound rate and we'll continue in 2012 to gradually ramp it up to full productive capacity of 24 million pounds."

It was our view and the reason why we made the leading move is it provides some added stability to a market that was becoming increasingly volatile and is actually is a better alignment with ever material cost based upon what we have to declare our raw material needs and what we pay for our raw materials versus how the surcharge works so we didn't look at it quite frankly, as a revenue generator, anything like that.

While the second quarter was impacted by costs related to the Ladish acquisition, overall performance was good and continue to support our view that 2011 is the year when strong secular growth",2471,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. While the second quarter was impacted by costs related to the Ladish acquisition, overall performance was good and continue to support our view that 2011 is the year when strong secular growth resumes in our key global markets. Sales increased to $1.35 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter 2010 and 10% higher than the first quarter 2011. Segment operating profit increased nearly 60% compared to the second quarter 2010 to $187 million, excluding costs related to the Ladish acquisition. That is nearly 14% of sales. Earnings per share were $0.70 excluding acquisition expenses, 94% higher than the second quarter 2010 and nearly 19% higher than the first quarter 2011 even though average common shares outstanding are nearly 5% higher due to the Ladish acquisition.
We continued to benefit from our diversified global markets and our diversified product mix. Our key global markets, aerospace and defense, oil and gas chemical processing industry, electrical energy and medical are strong and represented 70% of ATI first half 2011 sales. Direct international sales were nearly 33% of sales during the first half 2011. Let's look at each of these key global markets in greater detail.
At 27% of revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 43% compared to the first 6 months of 2010. ATI's investments over the last several years in manufacturing capabilities, innovative new alloys and strategic acquisitions leaves the company well positioned to benefit from the expected unprecedented strong growth in aerospace demand and production rates over the next 3 to 5 years. 
We had a successful Paris Air Show in June. Those who visited ATI at the air show saw our expanded capabilities to produce highly engineered technically complex components. These capabilities add to ATI's long-standing reputation as a global leader in producing a wide range of specialty metals products.
On display at the Air Show where a number of component products and alloy forms, including ATI Ladish aero engine rotating forgings made of plasma arc melted ATI titanium 17 and ATI 6-4 titanium alloys. And rotary forgings made of ATI 718 nickel-based superalloy, ATI Waspaloy and Powder Metals. Also on display at the Air Show were large structural titanium investment castings from ATI Ladish for airframe and jet engine applications, landing gear and helicopter forgings made by ATI Ladish, a large jet engine low-pressured turbine case made of our new ATI 718Plus alloy, prototype components made of our unique new titanium product ATI 425 alloy, including super plastic form components made from ATI 425 sheet, tubing made of ATI 425 strip, honeycomb made of ATI 425 precision road strip. In addition, we displayed titanium near-net shapes and extrusions, titanium nickel-based alloy and specialty alloy fastener stock and expanded cutting tool and precision machining capabilities. 
These products have ATI well positioned for growth in the aerospace market. The already record backlogs at the airframe OEMs continue to get even larger. Last week, AMR announced what has been called the largest order in aircraft industry history. This could be an inflection point for the aerospace industry as many U.S. carriers finally entered the market to upgrade their aging noncompetitive high-cost fleets.
Moving onto our second largest market. Sales to the oil and gas chemical process industry grew 53% compared to the first half of 2010. Sales to the oil and gas and CPI markets represented 23% of total ATI sales in the first 6 months of 2011, 400 basis points higher than sales for the full year 2010. Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. Today's rig count has 6 out of 10 rigs drilling directionally and horizontally. This requires the use of our tungsten drill bodies and non-magnetic Datalloy 2 collars, as well as ATI 718 oil patch, a nickel alloy, and titanium alloys for completion systems. We continue to grow our position in this global market. We received another large order for our nickel alloy plate for clad subsea flow lines for sour gas, again, our customers in Japan for a project being constructed in the Middle East. Our proprietary ATI 2003 lean duplex alloy was selected for several sections of a large offshore platform being built for use in the North Sea. In addition, we are scheduled to ship ATI 2003 alloy strip for use in a large subsea flow line project in the Irish Sea. We received a significant order for nickel-based alloy sheet for a large offshore project in Brazil. These orders and others add to a strong backlog for our high-value flat-rolled products. 
We have performed very well on the Ras Az Zawr desalination job booked by our Uniti titanium joint venture. This has positioned Uniti for the next round of diesel jobs. The diesel market for CP titanium sheet products is expected to be strong for the next several years.
In addition, we are seeing several new opportunities for our industrial titanium products, both CP titanium and titanium alloy from the global corrosion markets. It is important to note that ATI has been meeting and exceeding customer expectations on these large global projects. We continue to win orders because of our performance and our customers confidence in ATI as a supplier. 
The electrical energy market represents 15% of ATI first half sales and grew 12% compared to the first half of 2010. Order activity in power generation picked up during the second quarter for nuclear energy, natural gas turbine and solar applications. Shipments of grainery and electrical steel were flat during the first 6 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. We expect shipments of this product to be somewhat softer in the third quarter due to seasonal summer shutdowns at some of our customers.
At 5.5% of first half sales, the medical market grew by over 20% compared to the same period in 2010. There's a real change here demonstrating the differentiation in the quality of ATI's products. We are improving our position with the major medical OEMs by offering titanium products in a wide range of alloys and products sizes. Our ability to control the titanium manufacturing process from raw materials to the finished mill product makes ATI attractive to the medical equipment customers just as it does to the aerospace OEMs. In addition, due to faster scan rates and better resolution, demand for 3 Tesla MRI Systems is growing, creating strong demand for our niobium titanium alloys.
In summary, our order backlog is strong. Backlog in the High Performance Metals segment at the end of the second quarter was over $1.38 billion. And as a result of major project wins, we have also -- we also have a solid backlog for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys for the second half of 2011 in our Flat-Rolled Products segment. 
We continue to benefit from our differentiated product mix. We continue to innovate with new alloys, products and technologies. Some examples. There is significant interest in our ATI 425 titanium alloy, with much qualification activity ongoing. It is important to note that although ATI 425 alloy has been around for a few years, it was qualified as a direct replacement for 6-4 titanium in aerospace airframe applications just 15 months ago and was introduced to the aerospace market about one year ago as the Farnborough Airshow. We are pleased with the significant interest and qualification efforts currently ongoing for this game-changing new alloy in such a short period of time.
At the May 2011 Aero Met Conference, the industry's largest aerospace materials conference, a joint presentation of industry experts confirmed that ATI 425 alloy has significant advantages over 6-4 titanium for hot fabrication of aerospace parts. This has resulted in even greater interest from a variety of aerospace customers. During the Paris Air Show, customer meetings were held to discuss current and future trials of ATI 425 alloy. We exhibited several hot form parts made of ATI 425 alloy that further stimulated interest in this new product. 
Our ATI 718Plus nickel-based super alloy achieved another milestone during the second quarter. ATI announced a long-term agreement with Rolls-Royce for the supply of ATI 718Plus alloy. Rolls-Royce is the first jet engine manufacturer to use this innovative new alloy for rotating applications.
ATI is continuing to expand participation into the aerospace fastener market. OEM qualification programs are in process and we are shipping orders to fastener producers. We are the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finish, all 3 alloy systems used to make fasteners, that is titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. In addition, we have several proprietary alloys that offer advantages for the more common alloys used to make fasteners.
And finally, ATI Allegheny Ludlum and ATI Powder Metals are developing a line of bull rated stainless steel for uses of barrier to neutrons and nuclear spent fuel storage. Interest in these applications has increased significantly since the Fukushima event in Japan.
To meet the long-term growth expected from our key growth markets, ATI is continuing to invest for the future. We have a defined vision of the future and a strategic plan to continue to enhance our competitive position, while creating value for our shareholders and customers. I'd like to update you on some of the strategic initiatives.
First, an update on our acquisition of Ladish. On May 9, we completed the acquisition of Ladish, so our second quarter 2011 results contained only 8 weeks of ATI Ladish results. In the short time period, we were very encouraged by the opportunities that exist for ATI shareholders and customers. We are pleased with the customer acceptance of the combination. ATI Ladish, which is a business unit of our High Performance Metals segment adds advanced forgings, titanium investment castings and precision finishing capabilities to ATI's product portfolio. ATI Ladish enhances ATI's position on the supply chain to create greater customer value by providing the capabilities to meet OEM desires or near-net shapes for finished components. We expect sales through ATI Ladish to grow greater than the secular growth expected from the upcoming aerospace build ramp. ATI Ladish is well positioned on the next generation and future generation jet engines in addition. ATI Ladish is capable of forging ATI's proprietary new alloys and Powder Metals into technically advanced components. We also expect growth from our focus to expand ATI Ladish capabilities into our non-aerospace growth markets such as oil and gas, chemical processing industry and electrical energy.
Next is an update on our Rowley, Utah titanium sponge facility. Our Rowley facility has now produced over 5 million pounds of titanium sponge in the first half of 2011 or an annualized rate of 10 million pounds. We expect to continue an orderly increase for the production rate in the second half of 2011. This sponge is being used to produce industrial titanium products. The chemistry of the Rowley sponge is outstanding and is consistently meeting premium grade specifications. We have made good progress in standardizing manufacturing practices, which is key to the aerospace grade qualification process. Our focus is to achieve standard grade qualification by early 2012. We will then begin the premium grade qualification program.
As we have said many times, ATI's ability to produce titanium sponge with the Rowley facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations enables ATI to maximize profitable growth opportunities for titanium products. To support our production of titanium sponge, we have long-term raw material supply agreements in place to provide stable input pricing. 
On the titanium melting side, our new plasma arc melt or PAM, furnaced in Bakers, North Carolina has begun melt trials. This is ATI's fourth PAM furnace and is coming online in time to support the record aerospace backlog and the expected unprecedented aerospace production rate ramp, as well as the strong growth expected from the medical market. 
Finally, we expect to begin construction of our Flat-Rolled Products segment, hot rolling and processing facility later this summer. Site preparation is essentially complete and final engineering drawings are nearing completion. As a result, we now expect 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $275 million to $300 million.
Concerning our stainless products, our Flat-Rolled Products segment provides a good view into today's economic realities. On the one hand, demand for our high-value products from our key global growth markets is strong. On the other had, demand for our standard stainless products has been soft due in large part to weakness in consumer durables and weak consumer confidence. Industry reports indicate that the service center inventories for stainless products were 2.7 months in June, down from 2.9 months in May. Most service center customers have been focused on reducing their inventories due to the declining surcharges and uncertainty in the domestic market. Demand for our stainless products has been soft in July. We used this slow period to accelerate maintenance on our equipment, which will impact third quarter results by approximately $6 million. Looking beyond the third quarter, we expect demand for our standard stainless products to improve in the fourth quarter.
ATI Allegheny Ludlum recently announced the new surcharge calculation that is designed to better align raw materials costs with the surcharge and bring added stability to an increasingly volatile market. This surcharge calculation change is effective with shipments beginning October 2, 2011. We announced late yesterday that the tentative agreements reached on June 30, 2011, with the USW-represented employees at ATI's Allegheny Ludlam and Albany Oregon titanium operations were not ratified. We will continue to work with the USW to reach an agreement.
In summary, in spite of the uncertainties resulting from the ongoing debate about how to deal with the U.S. budget deficits and debt ceiling, combined with the European debt crisis, we remain optimistic about the current demand for most of our major markets and the secular growth opportunities over the next several years. We are building momentum across our businesses and continue to see 2011 as the year when secular growth returns in our key global markets. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect ATI to continue to benefit from our new alloys and products, diversified global markets and differentiated product mix. 
With the Ladish acquisition now complete, we now expect 2011 revenues of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion compared to our previous expectations of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, and segment operating profit of 13% to 14% of revenues, excluding the impact of purchase inventory accounting charges. These expectations are based on the strength in our key global markets, improving shipments and base prices for many of our high-value products, the expectation of improved demand for our standard stainless products in the fourth quarter and the view that certain raw material costs will moderate slightly or at least remain at current levels.
Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Yes, the answer is we're -- we think that these investments are coming on right at the right time and the qualification process is different, obviously, for furnace -- for melt versus titaniu",493,"Well, I'll answer the first part of the question, Steve, first. Yes, the answer is we're -- we think that these investments are coming on right at the right time and the qualification process is different, obviously, for furnace -- for melt versus titanium sponge production. The reason -- one of the reasons why we're really accelerating and focusing the sponge qualification program for standard grade, once we achieve that standard grade qualification, which is more of an internal certification, that opens up the non-rotating aerospace market as well as the medical market for use of the Rowley sponge. And the process that we're on is really one that by the end of the first quarter, we expect to achieve the standard grade qualification. The rotating or premium grade qualification is tied into the qualification programs run with the engine manufacturers and that is dependent upon, not only us and us performing but also the engine manufacturers and their qualification process so that takes a little bit longer but with the flexibility we have of using the Rowley sponge, we'll be quite happy with how we use that sponge across all of our applications. On the melt side, as you know, we've -- we now have -- this will be our fourth PAM furnace. It is essentially a sister furnace to PAM 3 that we went through the qualification process from mid-2010 into mid-2000 -- early 2011. And so we know what to do there and we know what the timeframe is. And we think that, that furnace is coming on right at the right time to meet the expected ramp for the OEM builds and obviously the necessity of the aero engine side.
Now as far as somebody new bringing on melt capacity, it really depends upon what alloy system are you talking about. What is the application for that? Is it a VEM, is it ESR, isn't VAR, is it plasma arc melt? We're the only plasma arc melter in the world qualified for rotating materials, so I think we have a pretty good knowledge of how that process works. Is the material going into static components or is it going into rotating components? If it's rotating, the qualification process is longer. So it is highly dependent upon what the melt technology is and what the end application is. But it isn't something that -- first of all, to make those investments, you're looking at lead times that are easily more than a year and in some cases, could be up to as long as 18 to 24 months for the furnace. So you're talking about a couple of years at least of construction time. And then beyond that, you're talking about a qualification process. So it's not something that happens easily, that's why we like the approach we've taken of where these -- the timing of these investments and coming on right at what we think is the right time."

The purchase funds, and we still do buy sponge from outside and will continue to do so, is under LPAs that I wouldn't say are firm fixed price. I mean, they have quantity mins and maxes, and they have pricing mins and maxes by formula. And one of the reasons why it's very difficult in some of these markets, primarily airframe and increasingly in aero engine, selectively, where the customers want a 5- or 10-year LTA. Unless you have the ability to produce some of your own sponge, it's very difficult to quote firm 5- and 10-year LTAs when you're making titanium mill products because you can't buy the raw material, that is the sponge, firm over that kind of a time period."

I think that we did have used the phrase that has been used by some. There's a lot of noise here in our second quarter, which typically happens when you have an acquisition, especially under the purchase accounting rules. So we dealt with that in the quarter and we'll have some of that in the third quarter. But once we get through the third quarter, that will work its way out. I think when you remove that even with Ladish in there, which is only 8 weeks of performance, when you remove those non-recurring costs that should not be there beyond the third quarter. And I would include in that -- I think that over the second half of the year as we ramp up in an orderly way the production at Rowley, we'll have less startup cost impact the Rowley facility at well -- as well. I think you, can come up very quickly to a 23% type of segment operating profit on sales and that includes a LIFO charge in there. Without the LIFO, it's closer to 24%.

I mean I think that, that business is more of a short cycle business, if you will. The lead times are pretty short. Even in the best of markets, the lead times are much shorter than the high-value products. I think that the volatility of nickel and the fact that nickel on the LME was in a continued month-over-month decline for about 4 months, and it's a lot like no one wanted to catch the falling ice. And so the inventories were kept very lean. I think that some of the uncertainty over the economy and the slowdown in the GDP growth in the second quarter -- and as I said, it's clear to us that this uncertainty in Washington is impacting consumer confidence. And that business on the standard stainless sheet side is a consumer confidence driven gain. And all of those factors were combining to see a significant weakening in that business throughout the second quarter, which we saw in our view bottoming out in terms of order entry and shipment levels for July. August is beginning to look a little bit better. One month does not make a trend so we'll see what happens. But as we look fundamentally through to the end markets, the end markets don't appear to be in that bad of a shape. The end market demand appears to us to be poised for some increase in growth and demand as we get into the fourth quarter and inventories are lean throughout the supply chain so those are the factors that give us the confidence to make the statements we have about the fourth quarter."

That is a different manufacturing process than what we're using in Rowley. The Rowley qualification, as I've said, for rotating quality material is working with the aero engine OEMs. And we have to produce a certain quantity of product using that sponge and produce it all the way down the bar, and you go through sonic inspection and everything to ensure that the material is compliant with rotating quality specifications. So that process is longer than the standard grade qualification, which from the time that we have what I would say frozen manufacturing processes in place, which is just around midyear of this year, it's about a 6 to a 8-month process for standard grade qualification. The rotating grade qualification will be at least that long, if not longer. And a lot of it depends upon how well the process goes and what the market conditions are, quite frankly. So what we do for the raw material needs as the aero engine market ramps is, as you know, we are currently buying sponge and we buy sponge from several suppliers who might have that rotating quality qualification in place and we will continue to do that. We'll continue to do that quite frankly, Sal, after the 24 million pounds. Even if we had 24 million pounds of certified rotating quality sponge out of Rowley, whenever that date is, it's our expectation that our raw material needs for sponge will be greater than that for all of our mill products. So we will continue to buy -- so our expectation that we will continue to by sponge from third parties. And the good thing about rotating quality sponge is that it is the most flexible. You can use it for any application. If its qualified for rotating quality, it can be used anywhere. You can't say that about standard grade sponge or non-aerospace grade sponge.

So that's a normal part of the process that most of it on yield side, the vast majority, a very high percent will be rotating quality. But you will, just by nature of the process, have non-rotating quality sponge produced."

Also, I just want to understand the guidance a little better because presumably, you had $19 million pretax of Ladish cost, $13 million at high performance and $6 million in corporate. And it's guided to be $8 million to $9 million of kind of inventory step up related to segment cost in Q3. So that's a $10 million positive pre-tax swing sequentially. Yet, the comments on standard grade sound a little more ominous. Should we be thinking that the earnings per share will be below 59, the printed number in Q2 or should we think of 70 as our starting point?

And Ladish -- at this point in time, Ladish's segment operating profit margins are not at the level that the whole segment is. And I say at this point in time, because that's one of the opportunities we believe we have is to using the available capacity that exists at Ladish and growing them in markets that they haven't historically or at least recently been in to increase the level of growth and profitability at Ladish. So that's -- longer term, that's number one. And number two, it's certainly the second quarter and in our view, the third quarter and the flat-rolled side on stainless is weaker than our view it would be at the beginning of the year, and even weaker than our view was in April. The deterioration in demand and the competitiveness in pricing as you recall, we tried to raise to lead a price increase on commodity stainless steel sheet earlier in the year effective April 1, and it was effective for exactly one month before it collapsed. And it collapsed because of the demand and the weakness in demand for standard sheet and standard plate. That weakness we expect to continue here through the third quarter, we expected to get better in the fourth quarter. We'll see. That's more of a short cycle business and very dependent on the consumer confidence that we talked about earlier. So I think there's a number of factors that work into that, but those are the 2 biggest ones."

I mean, there are -- generally speaking and historically in our business, for titanium, LTAs were not firm fixed price. I mean they -- on the aero engine side, they had surcharge mechanisms in place to protect against the volatility of raw material costs that we had no control over. And the raw materials are either titanium raw material units, either a sponge or a scrap and vanadium and aluminum because that's the preponderance of the alloying elements going into titanium alloys. As you move forward in some of these markets with multiyear LTAs in place because of how the business model works for air framers or other end markets, they're really looking more for some price certainty from their standpoint so they want to eliminate the volatility of having the raw material surcharges. That's an important reason to be -- and it won't be for 100% of the market, it's just pieces of the market opportunity that we think will exist. There's 2 ways for a producer to deal with that, a company like ATI. One is you can just quote -- or 3, I guess. One is you can say we'll we can't quote firm fixed price because we don't have any way of controlling sponge cost 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 years from now and therefore, you won't get the business. Or you can quote it and hope that you don't get hurt by the volatility of sponge or you can make your own sponge and control the costs. And therefore, have the confidence in your ability to price something firm that you have an effective risk management process in place that won't damage the shareholders. And that's how we think about it, and that's one of the reasons why we built Rowley."

I mean, one of the things that we continue to look at is balancing the ramp up and -- in an orderly way with the importance of a timely certification achievement of standard grade certification. So we're constantly kind of trying to balance that to reach the right framework. Obviously, we can -- we could ramp it up quicker and reduce some of the non-recurring startup cost that we're experiencing. But then we're producing sponge that only has industrial grade application to it, and you're investing that those dollars in inventory that might be there for a while. Or you could strike a balance where you minimize the -- don't eliminate, but minimize the startup cost due to ramp up in a less aggressive way and refocus a higher priority on achieving the standard grade qualification, and that's what we've done. So as we look at, if you look at the first quarter in the sponge we produced in the first quarter, we were running at about a 9 million pound annualized run rate. The second quarter, we were running at a little over 11 million pounds annualized rate. The third quarter, we expect to be in the range of 15 million to 16 million pound rate.

So it's -- and since 2 of our largest competitors in stainless are European, they have a lot of familiarity with how the surcharge work. It was our view, and the reason why we made the leading move is it provides some added stability to a market that was becoming increasingly volatile. And it actually has a better alignment of raw material cost with the surcharge based upon when we have to declare our raw material needs and what we pay for our raw materials versus how the surcharge works.

While the second quarter was impacted by costs related to the Ladish acquisition, overall performance was good and continued to support our view that 2011 is the year when strong secular growth",2467,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. While the second quarter was impacted by costs related to the Ladish acquisition, overall performance was good and continued to support our view that 2011 is the year when strong secular growth resumes in our key global markets. Sales increased to $1.35 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter 2010 and 10% higher than the first quarter 2011. Segment operating profit increased nearly 60% compared to the second quarter 2010 to $187 million, excluding costs related to the Ladish acquisition. That is nearly 14% of sales. Earnings per share were $0.70 excluding acquisition expenses, 94% higher than the second quarter 2010 and nearly 19% higher than the first quarter 2011 even though average common shares outstanding are nearly 5% higher due to the Ladish acquisition.
We continued to benefit from our diversified global markets and our diversified product mix. Our key global markets, aerospace and defense, oil and gas chemical processing industry, electrical energy and medical are strong and represented 70% of ATI first half 2011 sales. Direct international sales were nearly 33% of sales during the first half 2011. Let's look at each of these key global markets in greater detail.
At 27% of revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 43% compared to the first 6 months of 2010. ATI's investments over the last several years in manufacturing capabilities, innovative new alloys and strategic acquisitions leaves the company well positioned to benefit from the expected unprecedented strong growth in aerospace demand and production rates over the next 3 to 5 years. 
We had a successful Paris Air Show in June. Those who visited ATI at the air show saw our expanded capabilities to produce highly engineered technically complex components. These capabilities add to ATI's long-standing reputation as a global leader in producing a wide range of specialty metals products.
On display at the Air Show where a number of component products and alloy forms, including ATI Ladish aero engine rotating forgings made of plasma arc melted ATI titanium 17 and ATI 6-4 titanium alloys. And rotary forgings made of ATI 718 nickel-based superalloy, ATI Waspaloy and Powder Metals. Also on display at the Air Show were large structural titanium investment castings from ATI Ladish for airframe and jet engine applications, landing gear and helicopter forgings made by ATI Ladish, a large jet engine low-pressured turbine case made of our new ATI 718Plus alloy, prototype components made of our unique new titanium product ATI 425 alloy, including super plastic form components made from ATI 425 sheet, tubing made of ATI 425 strip, honeycomb made of ATI 425 precision road strip. In addition, we displayed titanium near-net shapes and extrusions, titanium nickel-based alloy and specialty alloy fastener stock and expanded cutting tool and precision machining capabilities. 
These products have ATI well positioned for growth in the aerospace market. The already record backlogs at the airframe OEMs continue to get even larger. Last week, AMR announced what has been called the largest order in aircraft industry history. This could be an inflection point for the aerospace industry as many U.S. carriers finally entered the market to upgrade their aging noncompetitive high-cost fleets.
Moving onto our second largest market. Sales to the oil and gas chemical process industry grew 53% compared to the first half of 2010. Sales to the oil and gas and CPI markets represented 23% of total ATI sales in the first 6 months of 2011, 400 basis points higher than sales for the full year 2010. Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. Today's rig count has 6 out of 10 rigs drilling directionally and horizontally. This requires the use of our tungsten drill bodies and non-magnetic Datalloy 2 collars, as well as ATI 718 oil patch, a nickel alloy, and titanium alloys for completion systems. We continue to grow our position in this global market. We received another large order for our nickel alloy plate for clad subsea flow lines for sour gas, again, our customers in Japan for a project being constructed in the Middle East. Our proprietary ATI 2003 lean duplex alloy was selected for several sections of a large offshore platform being built for use in the North Sea. In addition, we are scheduled to ship ATI 2003 alloy strip for use in a large subsea flow line project in the Irish Sea. We received a significant order for nickel-based alloy sheet for a large offshore project in Brazil. These orders and others add to a strong backlog for our high-value flat-rolled products. 
We have performed very well on the Ras Az Zawr desalination job booked by our Uniti titanium joint venture. This has positioned Uniti for the next round of de-sal jobs. The de-sal market for CP titanium sheet products is expected to be strong for the next several years.
In addition, we are seeing several new opportunities for our industrial titanium products, both CP titanium and titanium alloy from the global corrosion markets. It is important to note that ATI has been meeting and exceeding customer expectations on these large global projects. We continue to win orders because of our performance and our customers confidence in ATI as a supplier. 
The electrical energy market represents 15% of ATI first half sales and grew 12% compared to the first half of 2010. Order activity in power generation picked up during the second quarter for nuclear energy, natural gas turbine and solar applications. Shipments of grain-oriented and electrical steel were flat during the first 6 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. We expect shipments of this product to be somewhat softer in the third quarter due to seasonal summer shutdowns at some of our customers.
At 5.5% of first half sales, the medical market grew by over 20% compared to the same period in 2010. There's a real change here demonstrating the differentiation in the quality of ATI's products. We are improving our position with the major medical OEMs by offering titanium products in a wide range of alloys and products sizes. Our ability to control the titanium manufacturing process from raw materials to the finished mill product makes ATI attractive to the medical equipment customers just as it does to the aerospace OEMs. In addition, due to faster scan rates and better resolution, demand for 3 Tesla MRI Systems is growing, creating strong demand for our niobium titanium alloys.
In summary, our order backlog is strong. Backlog in the High Performance Metals segment at the end of the second quarter was over $1.38 billion. And as a result of major project wins, we also have a solid backlog for our nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys for the second half of 2011 in our Flat-Rolled Products segment. 
We continue to benefit from our differentiated product mix. We continue to innovate with new alloys, products and technologies. Some examples. There is significant interest in our ATI 425 titanium alloy, with much qualification activity ongoing. It is important to note that although ATI 425 alloy has been around for a few years, it was qualified as a direct replacement for 6-4 titanium in aerospace airframe applications just 15 months ago and was introduced to the aerospace market about one year ago at the Farnborough Airshow. We are pleased with the significant interest and qualification efforts currently ongoing for this game-changing new alloy in such a short period of time.
At the May 2011 Aero Met Conference, the industry's largest aerospace materials conference, a joint presentation of industry experts confirmed that ATI 425 alloy has significant advantages over 6-4 titanium for hot fabrication of aerospace parts. This has resulted in even greater interest from a variety of aerospace customers. During the Paris Air Show, customer meetings were held to discuss current and future trials of ATI 425 alloy. We exhibited several hot form parts made of ATI 425 alloy that further stimulated interest in this new product. 
Our ATI 718Plus nickel-based super alloy achieved another milestone during the second quarter. ATI announced a long-term agreement with Rolls-Royce for the supply of ATI 718Plus alloy. Rolls-Royce is the first jet engine manufacturer to use this innovative new alloy for rotating applications.
ATI is continuing to expand participation into the aerospace fastener market. OEM qualification programs are in process and we are shipping orders to fastener producers. We are the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finish, all 3 alloy systems used to make fasteners. That is titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. In addition, we have several proprietary alloys that offer advantages for the more common alloys used to make fasteners.
And finally, ATI Allegheny Ludlum and ATI Powder Metals are developing a line of bull [ph] rated stainless steel for uses of barrier to neutrons and nuclear spent fuel storage. Interest in these applications has increased significantly since the Fukushima event in Japan.
To meet the long-term growth expected from our key growth markets, ATI is continuing to invest for the future. We have a defined vision of the future and a strategic plan to continue to enhance our competitive position, while creating value for our shareholders and customers. I'd like to update you on some of the strategic initiatives.
First, an update on our acquisition of Ladish. On May 9, we completed the acquisition of Ladish, so our second quarter 2011 results contained only 8 weeks of ATI Ladish results. In the short time period, we were very encouraged by the opportunities that exist for ATI shareholders and customers. We are pleased with the customer acceptance of the combination. ATI Ladish, which is a business unit of our High Performance Metals segment, adds advanced forgings, titanium investment castings and precision finishing capabilities to ATI's product portfolio. ATI Ladish enhances ATI's position on the supply chain to create greater customer value by providing the capabilities to meet OEM desires or near-net shapes for finished components. We expect sales through ATI Ladish to grow greater than the secular growth expected from the upcoming aerospace build ramp. ATI Ladish is well positioned on the next generation and future generation jet engines. In addition, ATI Ladish is capable of forging ATI's proprietary new alloys and Powder Metals into technically advanced components. We also expect growth from our focus to expand ATI Ladish capabilities into our non-aerospace growth markets such as oil and gas, chemical processing industry and electrical energy.
Next is an update on our Rowley, Utah titanium sponge facility. Our Rowley facility has now produced over 5 million pounds of titanium sponge in the first half of 2011 or an annualized rate of 10 million pounds. We expect to continue an orderly increase for the production rate in the second half of 2011. This sponge is being used to produce industrial titanium products. The chemistry of the Rowley sponge is outstanding and is consistently meeting premium grade specifications. We have made good progress in standardizing manufacturing practices, which is key to the aerospace grade qualification process. Our focus is to achieve standard grade qualification by early 2012. We will then begin the premium grade qualification program.
As we have said many times, ATI's ability to produce titanium sponge with the Rowley facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations enables ATI to maximize profitable growth opportunities for titanium products. To support our production of titanium sponge, we have long-term raw material supply agreements in place to provide stable input pricing. 
On the titanium melting side, our new plasma arc melt, or PAM, furnace in Bakers, North Carolina has begun melt trials. This is ATI's fourth PAM furnace and is coming online in time to support the record aerospace backlog and the expected unprecedented aerospace production rate ramp, as well as the strong growth expected from the medical market. 
Finally, we expect to begin construction of our Flat-Rolled Products segment hot rolling and processing facility later this summer. Site preparation is essentially complete and final engineering drawings are nearing completion. As a result, we now expect 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $275 million to $300 million.
Concerning our stainless products, our Flat-Rolled Products segment provides a good view into today's economic realities. On the one hand, demand for our high-value products from our key global growth markets is strong. On the other hand, demand for our standard stainless products has been soft due in large part to weakness in consumer durables and weak consumer confidence. Industry reports indicate that the service center inventories for stainless products were 2.7 months in June, down from 2.9 months in May. Most service center customers have been focused on reducing their inventories due to the declining surcharges and uncertainty in the domestic market. Demand for our stainless products has been soft in July. We used this slow period to accelerate maintenance on our equipment, which will impact third quarter results by approximately $6 million. Looking beyond the third quarter, we expect demand for our standard stainless products to improve in the fourth quarter.
ATI Allegheny Ludlum recently announced the new surcharge calculation that is designed to better align raw materials costs with the surcharge and bring added stability to an increasingly volatile market. This surcharge calculation change is effective with shipments beginning October 2, 2011. We announced late yesterday that the tentative agreements reached on June 30, 2011, with the USW-represented employees at ATI's Allegheny Ludlam and Albany Oregon titanium operations were not ratified. We will continue to work with the USW to reach an agreement.
In summary, in spite of the uncertainties resulting from the ongoing debate about how to deal with the U.S. budget deficits and debt ceiling, combined with the European debt crisis, we remain optimistic about the current demand for most of our major markets and the secular growth opportunities over the next several years. We are building momentum across our businesses and continue to see 2011 as the year when secular growth returns in our key global markets. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect ATI to continue to benefit from our new alloys and products, diversified global markets and differentiated product mix. 
With the Ladish acquisition now complete, we expect 2011 revenues of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion compared to our previous expectations of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, and segment operating profit of 13% to 14% of revenues, excluding the impact of purchase inventory accounting charges. These expectations are based on the strength in our key global markets, improving shipments and base prices for many of our high-value products, the expectation of improved demand for our standard stainless products in the fourth quarter and the view that certain raw material costs will moderate slightly or at least remain at current levels.

Yes, the answer is we're -- we think that these investments are coming on right at the right time and the qualification process is different, obviously, for furnace -- for melt versus titaniu",492,"Well, I'll answer the first part of the question, Steve, first. Yes, the answer is we're -- we think that these investments are coming on right at the right time and the qualification process is different, obviously, for furnace -- for melt versus titanium sponge production. One of the reasons why we're really accelerating and focusing the sponge qualification program for standard grade, once we achieve that standard grade qualification, which is more of an internal certification, that opens up the non-rotating aerospace market as well as the medical market for use of the Rowley sponge. And the process that we're on is really one that by the end of the first quarter, we expect to achieve the standard grade qualification. The rotating or premium grade qualification is tied into the qualification programs run with the engine manufacturers and that is dependent upon, not only us and us performing but also the engine manufacturers and their qualification process so that takes a little bit longer but with the flexibility we have of using the Rowley sponge, we'll be quite happy with how we use that sponge across all of our applications. On the melt side, as you know, we've -- we now have -- this will be our fourth PAM furnace. It is essentially a sister furnace to PAM 3 that we went through the qualification process from mid-2010 into mid-2000 -- early 2011. And so we know what to do there and we know what the timeframe is. And we think that, that furnace is coming on right at the right time to meet the expected ramp for the OEM builds and obviously the necessity of the aero engine side.
Now as far as somebody new bringing on melt capacity, it really depends upon what alloy system are you talking about. What is the application for that? Is it a VEM [ph], is it ESR, is it VAR, is it plasma arc melt? We're the only plasma arc melter in the world qualified for rotating materials, so I think we have a pretty good knowledge of how that process works. Is the material going into static components or is it going into rotating components? If it's rotating, the qualification process is longer. So it is highly dependent upon what the melt technology is and what the end application is. But it isn't something that -- first of all, to make those investments, you're looking at lead times that are easily more than a year and in some cases, could be up to as long as 18 to 24 months for the furnace. So you're talking about a couple of years at least of construction time. And then beyond that, you're talking about a qualification process. So it's not something that happens easily, that's why we like the approach we've taken of where these -- the timing of these investments and coming on right at what we think is the right time."

The purchased sponge, and we still do buy sponge from outside and will continue to do so, is under LTAs that I wouldn't say are firm fixed price. I mean, they have quantity mins and maxes, and they have pricing mins and maxes by formula. And one of the reasons why it's very difficult in some of these markets, primarily airframe and increasingly in aero engine, selectively, where the customers want a 5- or a 10-year LTA. Unless you have the ability to produce some of your own sponge, it's very difficult to quote firm 5- and 10-year LTAs when you're making titanium melt products because you can't buy the raw material, that is the sponge, firm over that kind of a time period."

So we dealt with that in the quarter and we'll have some of that in the third quarter. But once we get through the third quarter, that will work its way out. I think when you remove that even with Ladish in there, which is only 8 weeks of performance, when you remove those non-recurring costs that should not be there beyond the third quarter. And I would include in that -- I think that over the second half of the year as we ramp up in an orderly way the production at Rowley, we'll have less startup cost impact at the Rowley facility as well. I think you, can come up very quickly to a 23% type of segment operating profit on sales and that includes a LIFO charge in there. Without the LIFO, it's closer to 24%. And at this point in the cycle, which in our view is pretty early, that's pretty good."

I mean I think that, that business is more of a short cycle business, if you will. The lead times are pretty short. Even in the best of markets, the lead times are much shorter than the high-value products. I think that the volatility of nickel and the fact that nickel on the LME was in a continued month-over-month decline for about 4 months, and it's a lot like no one wanted to catch the falling ice. And so the inventories were kept very lean. I think that some of the uncertainty over the economy and the slowdown in the GDP growth in the second quarter -- and as I said, it's clear to us that this uncertainty in Washington is impacting consumer confidence. And that business on the standard stainless sheet side is a consumer confidence-driven gain. And all of those factors were combining to see a significant weakening in that business throughout the second quarter, which we saw, in our view, bottoming out in terms of order entry and shipment levels for July. August is beginning to look a little bit better. One month does not make a trend so we'll see what happens. But as we look fundamentally through to the end markets, the end markets don't appear to be in that bad of a shape. The end market demand appears to us to be poised for some increase in growth and demand as we get into the fourth quarter and inventories are lean throughout the supply chain so those are the factors that give us the confidence to make the statements we have about the fourth quarter."

That is a different manufacturing process than what we're using in Rowley. The Rowley qualification, as I've said, for rotating quality material is working with the aero engine OEMs. And we have to produce a certain quantity of product using that sponge and produce it all the way down the bar, and you go through sonic inspection and everything to ensure that the material is compliant with rotating quality specifications. So that process is longer than the standard grade qualification, which from the time that we have what I would say frozen manufacturing processes in place, which is just around midyear of this year, it's about a 6 to a 9-month process for standard grade qualification. The rotating grade qualification will be at least that long, if not longer. And a lot of it depends upon how well the process goes and what the market conditions are, quite frankly. So what we do for the raw material needs as the aero engine market ramps is, as you know, we are currently buying sponge and we buy sponge from several suppliers who might have that rotating quality qualification in place and we will continue to do that. We'll continue to do that quite frankly, Sal, after the 24 million pounds. Even if we had 24 million pounds of certified rotating quality sponge out of Rowley, whenever that date is, it's our expectation that our raw material needs for sponge will be greater than that for all of our mill products. So we will continue to buy -- so our expectation that we will continue to by sponge from third parties. And the good thing about rotating quality sponge is that it is the most flexible. You can use it for any application. If its qualified for rotating quality, it can be used anywhere. You can't say that about standard grade sponge or non-aerospace grade sponge.

And number two, it's certainly the second quarter and in our view, the third quarter and the flat-rolled side on stainless is weaker than our view it would be at the beginning of the year, and even weaker than our view was in April. The deterioration in demand and the competitiveness in pricing, as you recall, we tried to raise to lead a price increase on commodity stainless steel sheet earlier in the year effective April 1, and it was effective for exactly one month before it collapsed. And it collapsed because of the demand and the weakness in demand for standard sheet and standard plate. That weakness we expect to continue here through the third quarter, we expect it to get better in the fourth quarter. We'll see. That's more of a short cycle business and very dependent on the consumer confidence that we talked about earlier.

I mean, there are -- generally speaking and historically in our business, for titanium, LTAs were not firm fixed price. I mean they -- on the aero engine side, they had surcharge mechanisms in place to protect against the volatility of raw material costs that we had no control over. And the raw materials are either titanium raw material units, either a sponge or a scrap and vanadium and aluminum because that's the preponderance of the alloying elements going into titanium alloys. As you move forward in some of these markets with multiyear LTAs in place because of how the business model works for air framers or other end markets, they're really looking more for some price certainty from their standpoint so they want to eliminate the volatility of having the raw material surcharges. That's an important reason to be -- and it won't be for 100% of the market, it's just pieces of the market opportunity that we think will exist. There's 2 ways for a producer to deal with that, a company like ATI. One is you can just quote -- or 3, I guess. One is you can say we'll we can't quote firm fixed price because we don't have any way of controlling sponge cost 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 years from now and therefore, you won't get the business. Or you can quote it and hope that you don't get hurt by the volatility of sponge or you can make your own sponge and control the costs. And therefore, have the confidence in your ability to price something firm that you have an effective risk management process in place that won't damage the shareholders. And that's how we think about it, and that's one of the reasons why we built Rowley."

I mean, one of the things that we continue to look at is balancing the ramp up in an orderly way with the importance of a timely certification achievement of standard grade certification. So we're constantly kind of trying to balance that to reach the right framework. Obviously, we can -- we could ramp it up quicker and reduce some of the non-recurring startup cost that we're experiencing. But then we're producing sponge that only has industrial grade application to it, and you're investing that those dollars in inventory that might be there for a while. Or you could strike a balance where you minimize the -- don't eliminate, but minimize the startup cost due to ramp up in a less aggressive way and refocus a higher priority on achieving the standard grade qualification, and that's what we've done. So as we look at, if you look at the first quarter in the sponge we produced in the first quarter, we were running at about a 9 million pound annualized run rate. The second quarter, we were running at a little over 11 million pounds annualized rate. The third quarter, we expect to be in the range of 15 million to 16 million pound rate. And the fourth quarter, we expect to be in the range of 16.5 million to 17.5 million pound rate, and then we'll continue in 2012 to gradually ramp it up to full productive capacity of 24 million pounds."

You're probably familiar that this change is pretty much in line, pretty close to what has been the surcharge mechanism in Europe. So it's -- and since 2 of our largest competitors in stainless are European, they have a lot of familiarity with how the surcharge work. It was our view, and the reason why we made the leading move is it provides some added stability to a market that was becoming increasingly volatile. And it actually is a better alignment of raw material cost with the surcharge based upon when we have to declare our raw material needs and what we pay for our raw materials versus how the surcharge works.

Our third quarter and year-to-date 2011 results during a time of global economic uncertainty demonstrates the benefits of ATI's recent strategic investments and our focus on key global markets and high-value technologically differentiated products. In the aerospace market, the first Boeing 787 and 747-8 airplanes were recently delivered than the first rate increase for the 737 from 31.5 per month to 35 per month occurred last week. Demand from the oil and gas/chemical process industry remains strong, particularly from projects for deepwater, sour gas and unconventional sources such as shale oil and gas and oil sands deposits. Demand remains strong for the medical market for our titanium used in implants and our niobium titanium alloys used in the latest technology MRI equipment. Demand is improving from the electrical energy market. On the negative side, weakness, uncertainty and caution best describes most domestic consumer and general industrial markets that drive demand for our standard stainless products.
Comparing the third quarter 2011 to the third quarter 2010, sales were nearly 28% higher. Segment Operating profit including inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Ladish acquisition increased 157%, and increased 177% excluding Ladish acquisition costs. For the 9 months 2011, sales were 31% higher than the comparable 2010 period. Segment operating profit, excluding Ladish acquisition costs, was $523 million or 13% of ATI's sales which was within our expected range. That is a 95% increase over the first 9 months of 2010. Net income, excluding special items, was $209 million, more than 3x higher than the first 9 months of 2010. And finally, direct international sales were 34% of ATI sales.
Our order backlog is strong. Backlog in our High Performance Metals segment at the end of the third quarter was over $1.4 billion and total ATI backlog was $2.2 billion, both high by any historical comparison. Demand remains strong from Asian markets. We expect record sales to Asia in 2011 and year-to-date orders are running significantly ahead of the same period last year. Most of the demand is from diversified projects, particularly in the oil and gas/chemical process industry and the Electrical Energy markets. Some examples of recent significant orders include nickel-based alloys for an oil and gas project being fabricated in Japan for use in the Middle East, specialty alloys for an electrical power generation facility pollution control project in Korea, DP titanium for condenser tubing and electrical power generation facility in India; and zirconium alloy for a chemical process industry facility in China. It is important to note that ATI has been meeting and exceeding customer expectations on large global projects. We continue to win orders because of our capabilities and our performance from a quality, delivery and technical support perspective. This gives our customers confidence in ATI as a key strategic supplier.
It is also important to note that the majority of our sales to Europe or to the aerospace and oil and gas Markets, which are driven by global secular growth trends and less influence by short-term European GDP. Our financial position remains strong, with cash on hand of over $430 million and net debt to total capitalization of about 30% at the end of September. We expect 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $275 million to $300 million, and we continued to improve our cost structure with year-to-date cost reductions of over $87 million. We expect to exceed our 2011 cost reduction goal of $100 million.
From an end market perspective, our key global markets, Aerospace and Defense, oil and gas/chemical process industry, Electrical Energy and medical grew 36% compared to the first 9 months of 2010 and represented 70% of ATI's sales. Let's look at each of these key global markets in greater detail.  
At $1.1 billion, or 28% of ATI is the first 9 months revenue, Aerospace and Defense sales grew 46% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Commercial airframe OEMs have record backlogs and have announced unprecedented production rate increases that are expected to be implemented over the next several years. In addition, ATI benefits from the secular shift to more titanium-intensive airframes, new energy-efficient engines and an expanding aftermarket. On September 26, 2011, Boeing delivered the first 787 Dreamliner to ANA, marking a significant milestone in aviation history. The inaugural commercial flight of the 787 occurred today. The first 747-8 was delivered to cargo Lux on October 12. The transition to higher production rates have begun. Last week, Boeing announced that it began building the next-generation 737 at the program's new production rate of 35 airplanes per month. That rate is up from 35.5 per month. Boeing's announced target for the 737 build rate is to reach 42 per month in 2014. Airbus plans to increase the A320 build rate from its current 38 per month rate to 40 per month by early 2012, and then to 44 per month. ATI's recent investments in manufacturing capabilities, innovative new alloys and strategic acquisitions improve our position in the aerospace supply chain. We are well positioned to benefit from the expected unprecedented strong growth in aerospace demand and production rates over the next 3 to 5 years.
We continue to make good progress at our Raleigh, Utah titanium sponge operation. Sponge production has increased to more than 9 million pounds year-to-date and we're well into standard grade qualification program. We remain on track for completing this qualification process by the end of the first quarter 2012. As we have said many times, ATI's ability to produce titanium sponge with the Raleigh facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations enables ATI to maximize growth opportunities for titanium products. To support our production titanium sponge, we have long-term raw material supply agreements in place for both and magnesium to provide stable input costs. We began melting with our fourth plasma arc melt, or PAM, furnace in Bakers, North Carolina. This premium aerospace qualification process takes some time, we're using this PAM furnace to melt CP titanium heat for industrial market and standard grade applications. We expect to complete the standard grade aerospace qualification process for this new furnace in early 2012. 
On the air frame side, on October 5, we announced a 3-year extension of our long-term continue product supply agreement with the Boeing Company. The agreement now runs through 2018. We are pleased with this extended supply agreement. It recognizes today's supply chain requirement to provide more value-added titanium products such as near net shapes. The agreement covers our mill products and provides opportunities for greater use of ATI's highly engineered titanium castings and forgings.
The extent of the agreement with Boeing is one of the many ways in which we are improving our position in the airframe supply chain to achieve our goal growing faster than the market. Through ATI Ladish, we offer advanced complex large-scale near net shape titanium castings. Our castings have good content on most Boeing and the Airbus models, particularly on the large 787, 777, 747-8, A380 and A350. We also have titanium passing content on most jet engines. We expect this business to grow significantly over the next several years as aircraft build rates increase and through increased content on the newer and larger models. Also through ATI Ladish, ATI is a major supplier of aerospace forgings used in landing gear components for commercial, regional and business aircraft. This application is expected to grow with increased aircraft build rates.
We continue to develop our position in a faster stock supply chain. We are the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finished product form, all 3 alloys systems used to make fasteners. That is titanium alloys where we are integrated from sponge to finished product, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. We also have several proprietary alloys that offer advantages to the more common alloys used to make fasteners. In addition, trials are moving forward on several new applications for use of our ATI 425 titanium alloy in both Aerospace and Defense applications.
On the jet engine side, ATI is well positioned to benefit from the unprecedented production rate increases, particularly from the new, large next-generation and future generation, energy efficient jet engines. These new engines burn hotter to improve fuel efficiency and require more complex titanium alloys and nickel-based superalloys including Powder Metals. For titanium-based products, ATI is uniquely positioned with our PAM melt technology which is the premium melt technology for advanced titanium alloys used in jet engine rotating parts and components. In addition, ATI is a premiere producer of titanium alumina alloys that take titanium, more than ever before, into the hot section of the jet engine. 
For nickel-based alloys and superalloys, our ATI 718-plus alloy is being selected for more static and rotating parts as OEMs recognize the value of this new product. Our new large forge press in Bakers, North Carolina, allows ATI to produce fine-grained properties never before achieved in some of the most complex nickel-based alloys.
Through ATI Ladish, we now have advanced capabilities for isothermal forging and hot closed forging which are the processes of choice for the most advanced technologies and nickel-based super alloys including nickel-based powders used in the latest ecology jet engines.
Moving on to our second largest and fastest growing end market, sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were over $860 million to the oil and gas/chemical process industry and grew 47% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Sales to this market represented 22% of total ATI sales. Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. According to the International Energy Agency's October 2011 report, oil demand has continued to run ahead of supply so far this year and oil inventories are well below their five-year averages. Our oilfield service customers have optimistic long-range forecast and strong order backlogs. We continue to grow our position in this global market and our backlog remains solid. Demand remains strong for our ATI Datalloy 2 nonmagnetic drill collars for horizontal and directional drilling in challenging, unconventional environments such as oil and gas shale and oil sands deposits. 
For our ATI 718 oilpatch, a nickel-based alloy for completion systems in highly corrosive environments and for our tungsten-based materials for earth-boring bits.
In addition, we have seen a shift, especially in  nickel-based alloy grades for use in subsea flowlines and umbilicals in sour and oil and gas projects. Our family of duplex alloys, including ATI 2003 lean duplex, the new 2102 lean duplex and Zeron 100 super duplex have been selected for use in offshore platforms, umbilical tubing and other tubing applications. 
We have performed very well on the big desalinization job booked by our Uniti titanium joint venture. We expect to complete required shipments in mid-November which exceeds the original delivery timeframe. Our quality and delivery performance on this project has positioned Uniti for the next round of desal jobs, many of which are expected to continue to use titanium rather than copper-nickel alloys. We expect growth for CP titanium to continue from the oil and gas/chemical process industry, particularly for the desal projects, downhole oil and gas and LNG applications, agriculture chemical facilities and shipbuilding and from the electrical energy market particularly for water systems and power generation facilities.
Sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were nearly $600 million to the electrical energy market, our third-largest end market, and grew 15% compared to the first 9 months of 2010 and represented 15% of total ATI sales. Demand from the power generation side of electrical energy continued to improve, particularly for industrial gas turbines and the nuclear applications. 
In Nuclear Energy, in addition to new builds, we are seeing new demand from upgrading and extending the life of existing reactors. Activity is picking up for spent nuclear fuel as emphasis moves to dry storage from wet storage as a result of the Fukushima event. We have also received orders for pollution control equipment for coal-fired power plants.
Finally, shipments of and electrical steel were basically flat during the first 9 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 as this market continues to struggle with a weak housing market and weak GDP growth. 
Sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were over $200 million to the medical market and grew 16% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. The medical market represents 5% of ATI sales. There is real change here demonstrating how ATI products are differentiated by their quality and technology. We continue to improve our position with the major medical OEMs by offering titanium products and a wide range of alloys and product. Our ability to control the titanium manufacturing process from raw materials to the finished mill product makes ATI attractive to the medical equipment customers just like it does to the aerospace OEMs. 
The MRI market continues to grow in developing countries. In addition, due to faster scan rates and better resolution, demand for 3 Tesla MRI systems is growing, creating strong demand for our niobium titanium alloys.
In summary, we expect to deliver quality growth in the future. In spite of the current economic uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe, we remain optimistic about the secular global growth opportunities for ATI over the next several years. In the short-term, concerns about the U.S. and European economies, including stubbornly high unemployment rates, appear to be negatively impacting consumer and business . This is clearly evidenced in the short cycle GDP-sensitive markets for our standard stainless products. Demand for these products is also be negatively impacted by rapidly falling raw material surcharges. In the near term, customers are delaying purchases and managing inventory levels. In addition, some of these factors appear to be influencing short-term demand in some of our key markets cautious and keeping inventories lean as year-end approaches. These customers do not want to fall behind expected growth but they do not want to get too far ahead of demand either. In our view, this is very likely to cause pent-up demand especially in the aerospace market when production rate ramps accelerate across the supply chain.
As a result of these conditions, we now expect 2011 revenues of approximately $5.2 billion, which would represent a 28% increase compared to 2010 and we expect segment operating profit as a percent of revenues to be in the range of that achieved in the 2011 9-month year to date level. 
Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect ATI to continue to benefit from our strong technology base, our new alloys and products, our focus on diversified global markets and our differentiated product mix. This expectation is fueled by our belief that a global recession will be averted and that the secular growth trends in our key global markets remain firmly in place. We expect demand to be strong in 2012 from the aerospace market. Commercial OEMs have record backlogs and have announced unprecedented production ramps through 2014. We expect strong demand in 2012 to continue from oil and gas/chemical process industry market. Global demand is expected to grow for many of our products used in the electrical energy market. Demand from the medical market is also expected to continue to grow significantly.
In addition, we expect business conditions to gradually improve in 2012 for our standard stainless products. As inventories appear to be in line, the price of nickel has fallen significantly this year and is now more in line with our expectations and end market demand recovers as GDP growth returns.
In summary, our focus is to maximize performance in the short-term in spite of economic uncertainties and to take the necessary actions to keep ATI well positioned and prepared to achieve earnings growth in 2012 and beyond as secular growth in our key global markets continues and general economic conditions improve. Operator, we will now open for any questions."

I think there's been some speculation that maybe with copper having fallen in price that that makes titanium less attractive, but from our perspective, this is a project-by-project decision. There are factors other than cost, believe it or not, that drive some of these decisions in terms of in a particular desal project depending upon where it's located. Most of those projects are really government-focused outside the U.S. and they actually pay attention to lifecycle costs and things like that as opposed to the initial upfront acquisition costs. So we actually see titanium moving into some applications in the industrial side where historically they had not been. Obviously, with -- titanium has been a major substitution factor in the aerospace market replacing aluminum on the 787 aluminum and aluminum, in some ways in the airframe on the 787 as well the A350 extra wide body and you're familiar with all the technical drivers behind that of why titanium was selected as opposed to aluminum. So I think customers across the alloys spectrum will continue to look at what is the best alloy to use for the selected application and the selected operating environment. And in some cases, we work with those customers in terms of helping them understand what their best alloy is, not only from a standpoint of the upfront acquisition cost, but also the fabrication ability and the lifecycle costs. And that's quite frankly, one of the benefits of being very diversified in terms of the alloy systems that we make and not just being a single metal company."

And we'll melt and we're melting, using that furnace well. We still worked to the qualification on the premium side. We have -- I think we've talked before about, we have 2 new ESR furnaces that we're in the process of installing because we have been constrained throughout most of the 2011 on ESR remote capacity from not only the aerospace market but the oil and gas and CPI markets as well.

I think that -- we were at the AUSA show a couple of weeks ago in Washington DC and had some meetings with DOD personnel and there is still a very strong interest in ATI 425 alloy plate for some armor applications because of the ability to cold form it and very unique radiuses, or radii, I guess, that eliminate wells. And they also have very good antiballistic characteristics. So those actions continue and the excitement level is still there. We're also working with governments outside the U.S and in Europe, for example, on armor applications where there's tests being conducted from a ballistic standpoint and the results are very good and very favorable. I think that the uncertainty really exists on a programmatic basis, which programs are going to move forward, which was are going to get funded and until the super committee really comes up with a solution, there's tremendous uncertainty as to what approach is going to happen on the funding side. So there's a lot of blocking and tackling going on right now in terms of us working with customers for ATI 425 as well as some of our high hard steels in armor applications. I still think that there are significant opportunities there. We have started up our fabrication components business just outside of Chicago that really is facilitized to make some of the fabrications out of that plate targeted armor market, and there's a lot of interest there. We've actually won some contracts there to make some fabricated components out of those products. So we're going to keep moving forward because we think that the product itself is good and provides value to the customer.

And so if we expect the production schedule on some of these big aircraft builds by Boeing, start to say pickup at the end of the year and accelerate into 2012. You mentioned that from a titanium perspective, Boeing is going to just hit their minimum again, so they clearly have enough for 2012 probably into 2013. But could you talk about the rest of the supply chain for aerospace outside the titanium and how much inventory you think is in there and how long of a lag before you start to feel kind of a meaningful pickup in demand to catch up with the inventories there?"

I think we've seen very meaningful pickup in demand this year. I mean, it's impossible to grow Aerospace and Defense and most of that is aerospace, let's be frank.

I mean, it's impossible to grow Aerospace and Defense and most of that is aerospace, let's be frank. Both of that is Aerospace. 46 or 47% year-over-year without seeing that pick-up and that didn't come from the Boeing contract because Boeing has been taking the minimum. So all of that is really from the other alloy systems going into the airframe as -- which is nickel and specialty alloys, et cetera, and the jet engine market. So we have seen that, really, this year and we'll continue to see that given the rate ramps that are forecasted and committed to publicly by both Boeing and Airbus assuming all the fundamentals from a macro standpoint stay intact, that we'll see that continuing in 2012 and 2013, and quite frankly, in 2014. So I think the  demand growth from the jet engine side has been there. We've been saying consistently this year and we'll say it again today that I don't think that there is a significant inventory build that has happened in the jet engine supply chain. I think that that supply chain looks pretty well and balanced and to the extent that there's any -- what you're not seeing may be that you would be seeing it at this point in time, is a building of a safety stock, if you will which historically, I think, has extended in the supply chain to be prudent because of the complexity of the supply chain, and therefore, interruptions that can't happen in that supply chain. I think there, it's just the overall cautious approach that everybody is taking, that they're all supporting the announced production, and therefore, the demand is coming from the airframers. It's just a little bit of extra, there's no sense that now is the right time to do that. I think that the slightly to happen, quite frankly, in 2012 as some of the economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe hopefully begins to fade away and the ramps that are being discussed by both the OEMs on the airframer side actually take place and are demonstrated and that's when I think you'll see it. But make no mistake, we've seen the growth this year, we wouldn't achieved a 46% revenue increase."

So I don't think it's really all that disruptive at this point. I mean if there's some disruption happening because you have a new, significant manufacturing capability in the U.S. and some producers might be taking the position that, that they have to be more aggressive on pricing. I don't know. I think when you look at specifically, what they've said, the investment here will do is really displace or replace the imports that they are bringing in from all over the world in a non- cost-efficient way, right? So it probably improves their cost position. Is it going to make a meaningful difference in their position in the marketplace in the U.S.? I don't believe so, no. So I think, we look at the U.S. market today the same as we have consistently over the past 3 to 5 to 6 years. We are selling commodity stainless sheet in Europe in a bigger way than we have in the past and that's -- we view the European market as a good market for us. So I don't think that it's all that disruptive at this point or is it ever will be, quite frankly. I think the bigger issue is the weakness in demand fundamentally. I couldn't tell you that, I don't think that the new surcharge formula, for example, has had much of any impact on the buying behavior. I think over the long-term, that surcharge formula is makes sense for the market and that's why we did it. And so I don't think that's having any impact today. I think the fundamentals today are the end market demand is really very weak. By any historical standards base pricing is really very low, actually the lowest ever for standard gauge service center-type sheet quite frankly, unsustainable for any producer to earn an acceptable return on capital deployed. So as the market and as the U.S. economy begins to recover, albeit the year modestly in 2012, which is our expectation, the inventory and the supply chain is not expensive, I can tell you that there's a lot of hand to mouth going on, the mills have but not excessive. And as the demand recovers, I think you'll see the market recover."

I think one of them is that historically when you look at -- you remember you're selling a forging now and some cases could be a $40,000 or $50,000 or $60,000 $70,000 forging. So the margins, as a percent of revenue, may be different than selling a mill product. So I think over time, those things will become clear and straighten themselves out. I think the other issue is that as you have seen some reduction in the cost of nickel, for example, the cycle time for our nickel alloy products are such that you could have higher-cost nickel units flowing through cost of sales matching up against a lower surcharge because the surcharges done on a quarter lag and our inventory turns are less than 4x a year. So that means you have some higher cost of raw materials flowing through that are out of sync with the surcharge mechanism in a follow the market. So that has impact as well."

Our third quarter and year-to-date 2011 results during a time of global economic uncertainty demonstrates the benefits of ATI's recent strategic investments and our focus on key global markets",2661,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Our third quarter and year-to-date 2011 results during a time of global economic uncertainty demonstrates the benefits of ATI's recent strategic investments and our focus on key global markets and high-value technologically differentiated products. In the aerospace market, the first Boeing 787 and 747-8 airplanes were recently delivered and the first rate increase for the 737 from 31.5 per month to 35 per month occurred last week. Demand from the oil and gas/chemical process industry remains strong, particularly from projects for deepwater, sour gas and unconventional sources such as shale oil and gas and oil sands deposits. Demand remains strong from the medical market for our titanium alloys used in implants and our niobium titanium alloys used in the latest technology MRI equipment. Demand is improving from the electrical energy market. On the negative side, weakness, uncertainty and caution best describe most domestic consumer and general industrial markets that drive demand for our standard stainless products.
Comparing the third quarter 2011 to the third quarter 2010, sales were nearly 28% higher. Segment operating profit including inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Ladish acquisition increased 157%, and increased 177% excluding Ladish acquisition costs. For the 9 months 2011, sales were 31% higher than the comparable 2010 period. Segment operating profit, excluding Ladish acquisition costs, was $523 million or 13% of ATI's sales which was within our expected range. That is a 95% increase over the first 9 months of 2010. Net income, excluding special items, was $209 million, more than 3x higher than the first 9 months of 2010. And finally, direct international sales were 34% of ATI sales.
Our order backlog is strong. Backlog in our High Performance Metals segment at the end of the third quarter was over $1.4 billion and total ATI backlog was $2.2 billion, both high by any historical comparison. Demand remains strong from Asian markets. We expect record sales to Asia in 2011 and year-to-date orders are running significantly ahead of the same period last year. Most of the demand is from diversified projects, particularly in the oil and gas/chemical process industry and the electrical energy markets. Some examples of recent significant orders include nickel-based alloys for an oil and gas project being fabricated in Japan for use in the Middle East, specialty alloys for an electrical power generation facility pollution control project in Korea, CP titanium for condenser tubing and electrical power generation facility in India and zirconium alloy for a chemical process industry facility in China. It is important to note that ATI has been meeting and exceeding customer expectations on large global projects. We continue to win orders because of our diversified capabilities and our performance from a quality, delivery and technical support perspective. This gives our customers confidence in ATI as a key strategic supplier.
It is also important to note that the majority of our sales to Europe or to the aerospace and oil and gas markets, which are driven by global secular growth trends and less influence by short-term European GDP. Our financial position remains strong, with cash on hand of over $430 million and net debt to total capitalization of about 30% at the end of September. We expect 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $275 million to $300 million, and we continue to improve our cost structure with year-to-date cost reductions of over $87 million. We expect to exceed our 2011 cost reduction goal of $100 million.
From an end market perspective, our key global markets, aerospace and defense, oil and gas/chemical process industry, electrical energy and medical grew 36% compared to the first 9 months of 2010 and represented 70% of ATI's sales. Let's look at each of these key global markets in greater detail.  
At $1.1 billion, or 28% of ATI as the first 9 months revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 46% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Commercial airframe OEMs have record backlogs and have announced unprecedented production rate increases that are expected to be implemented over the next several years. In addition, ATI benefits from the secular shift to more titanium-intensive airframes, new energy-efficient engines and an expanding aftermarket. On September 26, 2011, Boeing delivered the first 787 Dreamliner to ANA, marking a significant milestone in aviation history. The inaugural commercial flight of the 787 occurred today. The first 747-8 was delivered to Cargolux on October 12. The transition to higher production rates has begun. Last week, Boeing announced that it began building the next-generation 737 at the program's new production rate of 35 airplanes per month. That rate is up from 35.5 per month. Boeing's announced target for the 737 build rate is to reach 42 per month in 2014. Airbus plans to increase the A320 build rate from its current 38 per month rate to 40 per month by early 2012, and then to 44 per month. ATI's recent investments in manufacturing capabilities, innovative new alloys and strategic acquisitions improve our position in the aerospace supply chain. We are well positioned to benefit from the expected unprecedented strong growth in aerospace demand and production rates over the next 3 to 5 years.
We continue to make good progress at our Raleigh, Utah titanium sponge operation. Sponge production has increased to more than 9 million pounds year-to-date, and we are well into standard grade qualification program. We remain on track for completing this qualification process by the end of the first quarter 2012. As we have said many times, ATI's ability to produce titanium sponge with the Raleigh facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations enables ATI to maximize profitable growth opportunities for titanium products. To support our production of titanium sponge, we have long-term raw material supply agreements in place for both nickel [ph] and magnesium to provide stable input costs. We began melting with our fourth plasma arc melt, or PAM, furnace in Bakers, North Carolina. This premium aerospace qualification process takes some time, we're using this PAM furnace to melt CP titanium heat for industrial market and standard grade applications. We expect to complete the standard grade aerospace qualification process for this new furnace in early 2012. 
On the airframe side, on October 5, we announced a 3-year extension of our long-term titanium product supply agreement with the Boeing Company. The agreement now runs through 2018. We are pleased with this extended supply agreement. It recognizes today's supply chain requirement to provide more value-added titanium products such as near net shapes. The agreement covers our mill products and provides opportunity for greater use of ATI's highly engineered titanium castings and forgings.
The extent of agreement with Boeing is one of the many ways in which we are improving our position in the airframe supply chain to achieve our goal of growing faster than the market. Through ATI Ladish, we offer advanced complex large-scale near net shape titanium castings. Our castings have good content on most Boeing and the Airbus models, particularly on the large 787, 777, 747-8, A380 and A350. We also have titanium casting content on most jet engines. We expect this business to grow significantly over the next several years as aircraft build rates increase and through increased content on the newer and larger models. Also through ATI Ladish, ATI is a major supplier of aerospace forgings used in landing gear components for commercial, regional and business aircraft. This application is expected to grow with increased aircraft build rates.
We continue to develop our position in a fastener stock supply chain. We are the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finished product form, all 3 alloys systems used to make fasteners. That is titanium alloys where we are integrated from sponge to finished product, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. We also have several proprietary alloys that offer advantages to the more common alloys use to make fasteners. In addition, trials are moving forward on several new applications for use of our ATI 425 titanium alloy in both aerospace and defense applications.
On the jet engine side, ATI is well positioned to benefit from the unprecedented production rate increases, particularly from the new, large next-generation and future generation, energy efficient jet engines. These new engines burn hotter to improve fuel efficiency and require more complex titanium alloys and nickel-based superalloys including Powder Metals. For titanium-based products, ATI is uniquely positioned with our PAM melt technology which is the premium melt technology for advanced titanium alloys used in jet engine rotating parts and components. In addition, ATI is a premiere producer of titanium aluminide alloys that take titanium, more than ever before, into the hot section of the jet engine. 
For nickel-based alloys and superalloys, our ATI 718-plus alloy is being selected for more static and rotating parts as OEMs recognize the value of this new product. Our new large forge press in Bakers, North Carolina, allows ATI to produce fine-grained properties never before achieved in some of the most complex nickel-based alloys.
Through ATI Ladish, we now have advanced capabilities for isothermal forging and hot closed dye forging which are the processes of choice for the most advanced titanium alloys and nickel-based super alloys including nickel-based powders used in the latest technology jet engines.
Moving on to our second largest and fastest growing end market, sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were over $860 million to the oil and gas/chemical process industry and grew 47% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Sales to this market represented 22% of total ATI sales. Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. According to the International Energy Agency's October 2011 report, oil demand has continued to run ahead of supply so far this year and oil inventories are well below their 5-year averages. Our oilfield service customers have optimistic long-range forecast and strong order backlogs. We continue to grow our position in this global market and our backlog remains solid. Demand remains strong for our ATI Datalloy 2 nonmagnetic drill collars for horizontal and directional drilling in challenging unconventional environments such as oil and gas shale and oil sands deposits. 
For our ATI 718 oil patch, a nickel-based alloy for completion systems in highly corrosive environments and for our tungsten-based materials for earth-boring bits.
In addition, we have seen a shift, especially in  nickel-based alloy grades for use in subsea flow lines and umbilicals in sour and oil and gas projects. Our family of duplex alloys, including ATI 2003 lean duplex, the new 2102 lean duplex and Zeron 100 Super Duplex have been selected for use in offshore platforms, umbilical tubing and other tubing applications. 
We have performed very well on the big desalinization job booked by our Uniti titanium joint venture. We expect to complete required shipments in mid-November which exceeds the original delivery timeframe. Our quality and delivery performance on this project has positioned Uniti for the next round of desal jobs, many of which are expected to continue to use titanium rather than copper-nickel alloys. We expect growth for CP titanium to continue from the oil and gas/chemical process industry, particularly for desal projects, downhole oil and gas and LNG applications, agriculture chemical facilities and shipbuilding and from the electrical energy market particularly for water systems and power generation facility.
Sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were nearly $600 million to the electrical energy market, our third-largest end market, and grew 15% compared to the first 9 months of 2010 and represented 15% of total ATI sales. Demand from the power generation side of electrical energy continued to improve, particularly for industrial gas turbines and the nuclear applications. 
In nuclear energy, in addition to new builds, we are seeing demand from upgrading and extending the life of existing reactors. Activity is picking up for spent nuclear fuel as emphasis moves to dry storage from wet storage as a result of the Fukushima event. We have also received orders for pollution control equipment for coal-fired power plants.
Finally, shipments of grain-oriented electrical steel were basically flat during the first 9 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 as this market continues to struggle with a weak housing market and weak GDP growth. 
Sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were over $200 million to the medical market and grew 16% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. The medical market represents 5% of ATI sales. There is real change here demonstrating how ATI products are differentiated by their quality and technology. We continue to improve our position with the major medical OEMs by offering titanium products and a wide range of alloys and product sizes. Our ability to control the titanium manufacturing process from raw materials to the finished mill product makes ATI attractive to the medical equipment customers just like it does to the aerospace OEMs. 
The MRI market continues to grow in developing countries. In addition, due to faster scan rates and better resolution, demand for 3 Tesla MRI systems is growing, creating strong demand for our niobium titanium alloys.
In summary, we expect to deliver quality growth in the future. In spite of the current economic uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe, we remain optimistic about the secular global growth opportunities for ATI over the next several years. In the short-term, concerns about the U.S. and European economies, including stubbornly high unemployment rates, appear to be negatively impacting consumer and business confidence. This is clearly evident in the short cycle GDP-sensitive markets for our standard stainless products. Demand for these products is also being negatively impacted by rapidly falling raw material surcharges. In the near term, customers are delaying purchases and managing inventory levels. In addition, some of these factors appear to be influencing short-term demand in some of our key-end markets as many customers are being cautious and keeping inventories lean as year-end approaches. These customers do not want to fall behind expected growth, but they do not want to get too far ahead of demand either. In our view, this is very likely to cause pent-up demand especially in the aerospace market when production rate ramps accelerate across the supply chain.
As a result of these conditions, we now expect 2011 revenues of approximately $5.2 billion, which would represent a 28% increase compared to 2010, and we expect segment operating profit as a percent of revenues to be in the range of that achieved in the 2011 9-month year-to-date level. 
Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect ATI to continue to benefit from our strong technology base, our new alloys and products, our focus on diversified global markets and our differentiated product mix. This expectation is fueled by our belief that a global recession will be averted and that the secular growth trends in our key global markets remain firmly in place. We expect demand to be strong in 2012 from the aerospace market. Commercial OEMs have record backlogs and have announced unprecedented production ramps through 2014. We expect strong demand in 2012 to continue from the oil and gas/chemical process industry market. Global demand is expected to grow for many of our products used in the electrical energy market. Demand from the medical market is also expected to continue to grow significantly.
In addition, we expect business conditions to gradually improve in 2012 for our standard stainless products. As inventories appear to be in line, the price of nickel has fallen significantly this year and is now more in line with our expectations and end market demand recovers as GDP growth returns.
In summary, our focus is to maximize performance in the short-term in spite of economic uncertainties and to take the necessary actions to keep ATI well positioned and prepared to achieve earnings growth in 2012 and beyond as secular growth in our key global markets continues and general economic conditions improve. Operator, we will now open for any questions."

I think there's been some speculation that maybe with copper having fallen in price that, that makes titanium less attractive, but from our perspective, this is a project-by-project decision. There are factors other than cost, believe it or not, that drive some of these decisions in terms of placing titanium in a particular desal project depending upon where it's located. Most of those projects are really government-focused outside the U.S. and they actually pay attention to life cycle costs and things like that as opposed to the initial upfront acquisition costs. So we actually see titanium moving into some applications in the industrial side where historically they had not been. Obviously, with -- titanium has been a major substitution factor in the aerospace market replacing aluminum on the 787 aluminum in some ways in the airframe on the 787 as well as the A350 extra wide body, and you're familiar with all the technical drivers behind that of why titanium was selected as opposed to aluminum. So I think customers across the alloys spectrum will continue to look at what is the best alloy to use for the selected application and the selected operating environment. And in some cases, we work with those customers in terms of helping them understand what their best alloy is, not only from a standpoint of the upfront acquisition cost, but also the fabrication ability and the life cycle costs. And that's quite frankly, one of the benefits of being very diversified in terms of the alloy systems that we make and not just being a single metal company."

So that tells me that the inventories are pretty lean and as these production rate ramps continue to be elevated in a stair-step away, that you're going to see some significant demand increases as we head into and throughout 2012, and I would think that, that would lead to an extension of lead times."

I commented on PAM IV, which is now melting and operating so we will -- we typically don't put in a PAM IV just for standard grade because it's really targeted for the premium rotating quality in high-end medical markets but that qualification takes a little while so that capacity is available to meet the current needs and the growing needs in industrial as well as standard non-premium applications, so we now have that up and running. And we'll melt and we are melting using that furnace well. We still work to the qualification on the premium side. We have -- I think we've talked before about we have 2 new ESR remelt furnaces that we are in the process of installing because we have been constrained throughout most of 2011 on ESR remelt capacity from not only the aerospace market but the oil and gas and CPI markets as well.

I think that -- we were at the AUSA show a couple of weeks ago in Washington DC and had some meetings with DOD personnel, and there is still a very strong interest in ATI 425 alloy plate for some armor applications because of the ability to cold form it and very unique radiuses, or radii, I guess, that eliminate wells. And they also have very good antiballistic characteristics. So I mean, those actions continue and the excitement level is still there. We're also working with governments outside the U.S and in Europe, for example, on armor applications where there's tests being conducted from a ballistic standpoint and the results are very good and very favorable. I think that the uncertainty really exists on a programmatic basis, right, which programs are going to move forward, which ones are going to get funded, and until the super committee really comes up with a solution, there's tremendous uncertainty as to what approach is going to happen on the defense funding side. So there's a lot of blocking and tackling going on right now in terms of us working with customers for ATI 425 as well as some of our high hard steels in armor applications. I still think that's -- there are significant opportunities there. We have started up our fabrication components business just outside of Chicago that really is facilitized to make some of the fabrications out of that plate targeted specifically to some of the armor market, and there's a lot of interest there. And we've actually won some contracts there to make some fabricated components out of those products. So we're going to keep moving forward because we think that the product itself is good and provides value to the customer.

So we have seen that, really, this year and we'll continue to see that given the rate ramps that are forecasted and committed to publicly by both Boeing and Airbus assuming all the fundamentals from a macro standpoint stay intact, that we'll see that continuing in 2012 and 2013, and quite frankly, in 2014. So I think the demand growth from the jet engine side has been there. I don't -- we've been saying consistently this year and we'll say it again today that I don't think that there is a significant inventory build that has happened in the jet engine supply chain. I think that supply chain looks pretty well and balanced and to the extent that there's any -- what you're not seeing may be that you would be seeing at this point in time is a building of a safety stock, if you will, which historically, I think, has existed in the supply chain to be prudent because of the complexity of the supply chain, and therefore, interruptions that can't happen in that supply chain. And I think there, it's just the overall cautious approach that everybody is taking, that they're all supporting the announced production, and therefore, the demand is coming from the airframers. It's just that a little bit of extra. There's no sense that now is the right time to do that. I think that that's like to happen, quite frankly, in 2012 as some of the economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe hopefully begins to fade away and the ramps that are being discussed by both the OEMs on the airframer side actually take place and are demonstrated and that's when I think you'll see it. But make no mistake, we've seen the growth this year, we wouldn't achieved the 46% revenue increase."

Usually when you build a brand-new stainless plant, it's a pretty big slug of capacity relative to the size of the market where it's located and -- what impact is the Thyssenkrupp plant having on stainless, on the commodity stainless business?

So I don't think it's really all that disruptive at this point. I mean if there's some disruption happening because you have a new, significant manufacturing capability in the U.S. and some producers might be taking the position that they have to be more aggressive on pricing, I don't know. I think when you look at Thyssenkrupp specifically, what they've said the investment here will do is really displace or replace the imports that they're bringing in from all over the world in a non-cost-efficient way, right? So it probably improves their cost position. Is it going to make a meaningful difference in their position in the marketplace in the U.S.? I don't believe so, no. So I think, we look at the U.S. market today the same as we have consistently over the past 3 to 5 to 6 years. We are selling commodity stainless sheet in Europe in a bigger way than we have in the past and that's -- we view the European market as a good market for us. So I don't think that it's all that disruptive at this point, I mean, or is it ever will be, quite frankly. I think the bigger issue is the weakness in demand fundamentally. I mean, I couldn't tell you that the -- I don't think that the new surcharge formula, for example, has had much of any impact on the buying behavior. I think over the long-term, that surcharge formula is -- makes sense for the market and that's why we did it. And so -- but I don't think that that's having any impact today. I think the fundamentals today are -- the end market demand is really very weak. By any historical standards, base pricing is really very low, actually the lowest ever for standard gauge service center-type sheet, and quite frankly, is it a price that is unsustainable for any producer to earn an acceptable return on capital employed. So I think that as the market and as the U.S. economy begins to recover, albeit modestly in 2012, which is our expectation, the inventory and the supply chain is not expensive, I can tell you that. There's a lot of hand to mouth going on. The mills have reasonable amounts of ready coil, but not excessive. And as the demand recovers, I think you'll see the market recover."

So the margins, as a percent of revenue, may be different than selling a mill product. So I think over time, those things will become clear and straighten themselves out. I think the other issue is that as you have seen some reduction in the cost of nickel, for example, the cycle time for our nickel alloy products are such that you could have higher-cost nickel units flowing through cost of sales matching up against a lower surcharge because the surcharges done on a quarter lag and our inventory turns are less than 4x a year. So that means you have some higher cost raw materials flowing through that are out of sync with the surcharge mechanism in a following market. So that has an impact as well."

Our third quarter and year-to-date 2011 results during a time of global economic uncertainty demonstrates the benefits of ATI's recent strategic investments and our focus on key global markets",2662,"Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Our third quarter and year-to-date 2011 results during a time of global economic uncertainty demonstrates the benefits of ATI's recent strategic investments and our focus on key global markets and high-value technologically differentiated products. In the aerospace market, the first Boeing 787 and 747-8 airplanes were recently delivered and the first rate increase for the 737 from 31.5 per month to 35 per month occurred last week. Demand from the oil and gas/chemical process industry remains strong, particularly from projects for deepwater, sour gas and unconventional sources such as shale oil and gas and oil sands deposits. Demand remains strong from the medical market for our titanium alloys used in implants and our niobium titanium alloys used in the latest technology MRI equipment. Demand is improving from the electrical energy market. On the negative side, weakness, uncertainty and caution best describe most domestic consumer and general industrial markets that drive demand for our standard stainless products.
Comparing the third quarter 2011 to the third quarter 2010, sales were nearly 28% higher. Segment operating profit including inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Ladish acquisition increased 157%, and increased 177% excluding Ladish acquisition costs. For the 9 months 2011, sales were 31% higher than the comparable 2010 period. Segment operating profit, excluding Ladish acquisition costs, was $523 million or 13% of ATI's sales which was within our expected range. That is a 95% increase over the first 9 months of 2010. Net income, excluding special items, was $209 million, more than 3x higher than the first 9 months of 2010. And finally, direct international sales were 34% of ATI sales.
Our order backlog is strong. Backlog in our High Performance Metals segment at the end of the third quarter was over $1.4 billion and total ATI backlog was $2.2 billion, both high by any historical comparison. Demand remains strong from Asian markets. We expect record sales to Asia in 2011 and year-to-date orders are running significantly ahead of the same period last year. Most of the demand is from diversified projects, particularly in the oil and gas/chemical process industry and the electrical energy markets. Some examples of recent significant orders include nickel-based alloys for an oil and gas project being fabricated in Japan for use in the Middle East, specialty alloys for an electrical power generation facility pollution control project in Korea, CP titanium for condenser tubing and electrical power generation facility in India and zirconium alloy for a chemical process industry facility in China. It is important to note that ATI has been meeting and exceeding customer expectations on large global projects. We continue to win orders because of our diversified capabilities and our performance from a quality, delivery and technical support perspective. This gives our customers confidence in ATI as a key strategic supplier.
It is also important to note that the majority of our sales to Europe are to the aerospace and oil and gas markets, which are driven by global secular growth trends and less influence by short-term European GDP. Our financial position remains strong, with cash on hand of over $430 million and net debt to total capitalization of about 30% at the end of September. We expect 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $275 million to $300 million, and we continue to improve our cost structure with year-to-date cost reductions of over $87 million. We expect to exceed our 2011 cost reduction goal of $100 million.
From an end market perspective, our key global markets; aerospace and defense, oil and gas/chemical process industry, electrical energy and medical grew 36% compared to the first 9 months of 2010 and represented 70% of ATI's sales. Let's look at each of these key global markets in greater detail.  
At $1.1 billion, or 28% of ATI as the first 9 months revenue, aerospace and defense sales grew 46% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Commercial airframe OEMs have record backlogs and have announced unprecedented production rate increases that are expected to be implemented over the next several years. In addition, ATI benefits from the secular shift to more titanium-intensive airframes, new energy-efficient engines and an expanding aftermarket. On September 26, 2011, Boeing delivered the first 787 Dreamliner to ANA, marking a significant milestone in aviation history. The inaugural commercial flight of the 787 occurred today. The first 747-8 was delivered to Cargolux on October 12. The transition to higher production rates has begun. Last week, Boeing announced that it began building the next-generation 737 at the program's new production rate of 35 airplanes per month. That rate is up from 35.5 per month. Boeing's announced target for the 737 build rate is to reach 42 per month in 2014. Airbus plans to increase the A320 build rate from its current 38 per month rate to 40 per month by early 2012, and then to 44 per month. ATI's recent investments in manufacturing capabilities, innovative new alloys and strategic acquisitions improve our position in the aerospace supply chain. We are well positioned to benefit from the expected unprecedented strong growth in aerospace demand and production rates over the next 3 to 5 years.
We continue to make good progress at our Raleigh, Utah titanium sponge operation. Sponge production has increased to more than 9 million pounds year-to-date, and we are well into standard grade qualification program. We remain on track for completing this qualification process by the end of the first quarter 2012. As we have said many times, ATI's ability to produce titanium sponge with the Raleigh facility and the available additional capacity from our Albany sponge operations enables ATI to maximize profitable growth opportunities for titanium products. To support our production of titanium sponge, we have long-term raw material supply agreements in place for both tickle [ph] and magnesium to provide stable input costs. We began melting with our fourth plasma arc melt, or PAM, furnace in Bakers, North Carolina. This premium aerospace qualification process takes some time, we're using this PAM furnace to melt CP titanium heat for industrial market and standard grade applications. We expect to complete the standard grade aerospace qualification process for this new furnace in early 2012. 
On the airframe side, on October 5, we announced a 3-year extension of our long-term titanium product supply agreement with the Boeing Company. The agreement now runs through 2018. We are pleased with this extended supply agreement. It recognizes today's supply chain requirement to provide more value-added titanium products such as near net shapes. The agreement covers our mill products and provides opportunity for greater use of ATI's highly engineered titanium castings and forgings.
The extent of the agreement with Boeing is one of the many ways in which we are improving our position in the airframe supply chain to achieve our goal of growing faster than the market. Through ATI Ladish, we offer advanced complex large-scale near net shape titanium castings. Our castings have good content on most Boeing and the Airbus models, particularly on the large 787, 777, 747-8, A380 and A350. We also have titanium casting content on most jet engines. We expect this business to grow significantly over the next several years as aircraft build rates increase and through increased content on the newer and larger models. Also through ATI Ladish, ATI is a major supplier of aerospace forgings used in landing gear components for commercial, regional and business aircraft. This application is expected to grow with increased aircraft build rates.
We continue to develop our position in a fastener stock supply chain. We are the only supplier capable of producing, from melt to finished product form, all 3 alloy systems used to make fasteners. That is titanium alloys where we are integrated from sponge to finished product, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys. We also have several proprietary alloys that offer advantages to the more common alloys used to make fasteners. In addition, trials are moving forward on several new applications for use of our ATI 425 titanium alloy in both aerospace and defense applications.
On the jet engine side, ATI is well positioned to benefit from the unprecedented production rate increases, particularly from the new, large next-generation and future generation, energy efficient jet engines. These new engines burn hotter to improve fuel efficiency and require more complex titanium alloys and nickel-based superalloys including Powder Metals. For titanium-based products, ATI is uniquely positioned with our PAM melt technology which is the premium melt technology for advanced titanium alloys used in jet engine rotating parts and components. In addition, ATI is a premiere producer of titanium aluminide alloys that take titanium, more than ever before, into the hot section of the jet engine. 
For nickel-based alloys and superalloys, our ATI 718-plus alloy is being selected for more static and rotating parts as OEMs recognize the value of this new product. Our new large forge press in Bakers, North Carolina, allows ATI to produce fine-grained properties never before achieved in some of the most complex nickel-based alloys.
Through ATI Ladish, we now have advanced capabilities for isothermal forging and hot closed dye forging which are the processes of choice for the most advanced titanium alloys and nickel-based super alloys including nickel-based powders used in the latest technology jet engines.
Moving on to our second largest and fastest growing end market, sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were over $860 million to the oil and gas/chemical process industry and grew 47% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Sales to this market represented 22% of total ATI sales. Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. According to the International Energy Agency's October 2011 report, oil demand has continued to run ahead of supply so far this year and oil inventories are well below their 5-year averages. Our oilfield service customers have optimistic long-range forecasts and strong order backlogs. We continue to grow our position in this global market and our backlog remains solid. Demand remains strong for our ATI Datalloy 2 nonmagnetic drill collars for horizontal and directional drilling in challenging unconventional environments such as oil and gas shale and oil sands deposits. 
For our ATI 718 oil patch, a nickel-based alloy for completion systems in highly corrosive environments and for our tungsten-based materials for earth-boring bits.
In addition, we have seen a shift, especially in  nickel-based alloy grades for use in subsea flow lines and umbilicals in sour and oil and gas projects. Our family of duplex alloys, including ATI 2003 lean duplex, the new 2102 lean duplex and Zeron 100 Super Duplex have been selected for use in offshore platforms, umbilical tubing and other tubing applications. 
We have performed very well on the big desalinization job booked by our Uniti titanium joint venture. We expect to complete required shipments in mid-November which exceeds the original delivery timeframe. Our quality and delivery performance on this project has positioned Uniti for the next round of desal jobs, many of which are expected to continue to use titanium rather than copper-nickel alloys. We expect growth for CP titanium to continue from the oil and gas/chemical process industry, particularly for desal projects, downhole oil and gas and LNG applications, agriculture chemical facilities and shipbuilding and from the electrical energy market particularly for water systems at power generation facilities.
Sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were nearly $600 million to the electrical energy market, our third-largest end market, and grew 15% compared to the first 9 months of 2010 and represented 15% of total ATI sales. Demand from the power generation side of electrical energy continued to improve, particularly for industrial gas turbines and the nuclear applications. 
In nuclear energy, in addition to new builds, we are seeing demand from upgrading and extending the life of existing reactors. Activity is picking up for spent nuclear fuel as emphasis moves to dry storage from wet storage as a result of the Fukushima event. We have also received orders for pollution control equipment for coal-fired power plants.
Finally, shipments of grain-oriented electrical steel were basically flat during the first 9 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 as this market continues to struggle with a weak housing market and weak GDP growth. 
Sales in the first 9 months of 2011 were over $200 million to the medical market and grew 16% compared to the first 9 months of 2010. The medical market represents 5% of ATI sales. There is real change here demonstrating how ATI products are differentiated by their quality and technology. We continue to improve our position with the major medical OEMs by offering titanium products in a wide range of alloys and product sizes. Our ability to control the titanium manufacturing process from raw materials to the finished mill product makes ATI attractive to the medical equipment customers just like it does to the aerospace OEMs. 
The MRI market continues to grow in developing countries. In addition, due to faster scan rates and better resolution, demand for 3 Tesla MRI systems is growing, creating strong demand for our niobium titanium alloys.
In summary, we expect to deliver quality growth in the future. In spite of the current economic uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe, we remain optimistic about the secular global growth opportunities for ATI over the next several years. In the short-term, concerns about the U.S. and European economies, including stubbornly high unemployment rates, appear to be negatively impacting consumer and business confidence. This is clearly evident in the short cycle GDP-sensitive markets for our standard stainless products. Demand for these products is also being negatively impacted by rapidly falling raw material surcharges. In the near term, customers are delaying purchases and managing inventory levels. In addition, some of these factors appear to be influencing short-term demand in some of our key-end markets as many customers are being cautious and keeping inventories lean as year-end approaches. These customers do not want to fall behind expected growth, but they do not want to get too far ahead of demand either. In our view, this is very likely to cause pent-up demand especially in the aerospace market when production rate ramps accelerate across the supply chain.
As a result of these conditions, we now expect 2011 revenues of approximately $5.2 billion, which would represent a 28% increase compared to 2010, and we expect segment operating profit as a percent of revenues to be in the range of that achieved in the 2011 9-month year-to-date level. 
Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect ATI to continue to benefit from our strong technology base, our new alloys and products, our focus on diversified global markets and our differentiated product mix. This expectation is fueled by our belief that a global recession will be averted and that the secular growth trends in our key global markets remain firmly in place. We expect demand to be strong in 2012 from the aerospace market. Commercial OEMs have record backlogs and have announced unprecedented production ramps through 2014. We expect strong demand in 2012 to continue from the oil and gas/chemical process industry market. Global demand is expected to grow for many of our products used in the electrical energy market. Demand from the medical market is also expected to continue to grow significantly.
In addition, we expect business conditions to gradually improve in 2012 for our standard stainless products. As inventories appear to be in line, the price of nickel has fallen significantly this year and is now more in line with our expectations and end market demand recovers as GDP growth returns.
In summary, our focus is to maximize performance in the short-term in spite of economic uncertainties and to take the necessary actions to keep ATI well positioned and prepared to achieve earnings growth in 2012 and beyond as secular growth in our key global markets continues and general economic conditions improve. Operator, we will now open for any questions."

I think there's been some speculation that maybe with copper having fallen in price that, that makes titanium less attractive, but from our perspective, this is a project-by-project decision. There are factors other than cost, believe it or not, that drive some of these decisions in terms of placing titanium in a particular desal project depending upon where it's located. Most of those projects are really government-focused outside the U.S. and they actually pay attention to life cycle costs and things like that as opposed to the initial upfront acquisition costs. So we actually see titanium moving into some applications in the industrial side where historically they had not been. Obviously, with -- titanium has been a major substitution factor in the aerospace market replacing aluminum on the 787 aluminum in some ways in the airframe on the 787 as well as the A350 extra wide body, and you're familiar with all the technical drivers behind that of why titanium was selected as opposed to aluminum. So I think customers across the alloys spectrum will continue to look at what is the best alloy to use for the selected application and the selected operating environment. And in some cases, we work with those customers in terms of helping them understand what their best alloy is, not only from a standpoint of the upfront acquisition costs, but also the fabrication ability and the life cycle costs. And that's quite frankly, one of the benefits of being very diversified in terms of the alloy systems that we make and not just being a single metal company."

And those are always hard to predict because all we have is the release schedule of what we're committed to deliver to, to the customers. And in some cases, they accelerate that and pull ahead for a variety of factors that, quite frankly, only they know. We haven't seen any pushouts, let me put it to you that way, in 2011. The only thing we've seen is pull forward. So that tells me that the inventories are pretty lean and as these production rate ramps continue to be elevated in a stair-step way, that you're going to see some significant demand increases as we head into and throughout 2012, and I would think that, that would lead to an extension of lead times."

I commented on PAM IV, which is now melting and operating so we will -- we typically don't put in a PAM IV just for standard grade because it's really targeted for the premium rotating quality in high-end medical markets but that qualification takes a little while so that capacity is available to meet the current needs and the growing needs in industrial as well as standard non-premium applications, so we now have that up and running. And we'll melt and we are melting using that furnace well. We still work to the qualification on the premium side.

I think that -- we were at the AUSA show a couple of weeks ago in Washington DC and had some meetings with DOD personnel, and there is still a very strong interest in ATI 425 alloy plate for some armor applications because of the ability to cold form it in very unique radiuses, or radii, I guess it would be, that eliminate well. And they also have very good antiballistic characteristics. So I mean, those actions continue and the excitement level is still there. We're also working with governments outside the U.S and in Europe, for example, on armor applications where there's tests being conducted from a ballistic standpoint and the results are very good and very favorable. I think that the uncertainty really exists on a programmatic basis, right, which programs are going to move forward, which ones are going to get funded, and until the super committee really comes up with a solution, there's tremendous uncertainty as to what approach is going to happen on the defense funding side. So there's a lot of blocking and tackling going on right now in terms of us working with customers for ATI 425 as well as some of our high hard steels in armor applications. I still think that's -- there are significant opportunities there. We have started up our fabrication components business just outside of Chicago that really is facilitized to make some of the fabrications out of that plate targeted specifically to some of the armor market, and there's a lot of interest there. And we've actually won some contracts there to make some fabricated components out of those products. So we're going to keep moving forward because we think that the product itself is good and provides value to the customer.

So all of that is really from the other alloy systems going into the airframe as -- which is nickel and specialty alloys, et cetera, and the jet engine market. So we have seen that, really, this year and we'll continue to see that given the rate ramps that are forecasted and committed to publicly by both Boeing and Airbus assuming all the fundamentals from a macro standpoint stay intact, that we'll see that continuing in 2012 and 2013, and quite frankly, in 2014. So I think the demand growth from the jet engine side has been there. I don't -- we've been saying consistently this year and we'll say it again today that I don't think that there is a significant inventory build that has happened in the jet engine supply chain. I think that that supply chain looks pretty well in balanced and to the extent that there's any -- what you're not seeing may be that you would be seeing at this point in time is a building of a safety stock, if you will, which historically, I think, has existed in the supply chain to be prudent because of the complexity of the supply chain, and therefore, interruptions that can happen in that supply chain. And I think there, it's just the overall cautious approach that everybody is taking, that they're all supporting the announced production, and therefore, the demand is coming from the airframers. It's just that little bit of extra -- there's no sense that now is the right time to do that. I think that that's likely to happen, quite frankly, in 2012 as some of the economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe hopefully begins to fade away and the ramps that are being discussed by both the OEMs on the airframer side actually take place and are demonstrated and that's when I think you'll see it.

Usually when you build a brand-new stainless plant, it's a pretty big slug of capacity relative to the size of the market where it's located and -- what impact is the Thyssenkrupp plant having on stainless, on the commodity stainless business? And how do you see that playing out in 2012?"

So I don't think it's really all that disruptive at this point. I mean is there's some disruption happening because you have a new, significant manufacturing capability in the U.S. and some producers might be taking the position that they have to be more aggressive on pricing, I don't know. I think when you look at Thyssenkrupp specifically, what they've said the investment here will do is really displace or replace the imports that they're bringing in from all over the world in a non-cost-efficient way, right? So it probably improves their cost position. Is it going to make a meaningful difference in their position in the marketplace in the U.S.? I don't believe so, no. So I think, we look at the U.S. market today the same as we have consistently over the past 3 to 5 to 6 years. We are selling commodity stainless sheet in Europe in a bigger way than we have in the past and that's -- we view the European market as a good market for us. So I don't think that it's all that disruptive at this point, I mean, or if it ever will be, quite frankly. I think the bigger issue is the weakness in demand fundamentally. I mean, I couldn't tell you that the -- I don't think that the new surcharge formula, for example, has had much of any impact on the buying behavior. I think over the long-term, that surcharge formula is -- makes sense for the market and that's why we did it. And so -- but I don't think that that's having any impact today. I think the fundamentals today are -- the end market demand is really very weak. By any historical standards, base pricing is really very low, actually the lowest ever for standard gauge service center-type sheet, and quite frankly, is it a price that is unsustainable for any producer to earn an acceptable return on capital employed. So I think that as the market and as the U.S. economy begins to recover, albeit modestly in 2012, which is our expectation, the inventory and the supply chain is not expensive, I can tell you that. There's a lot of hand to mouth going on. The mills have reasonable amounts of ready coil, but not excessive. And as the demand recovers, I think you'll see the market recover."

So the margins, as a percent of revenue, may be different than selling a mill product. So I think over time, those things will become clear and straighten themselves out. I think the other issue is that as you have seen some reduction in the cost of nickel, for example, the cycle time for our nickel alloy products are such that you could have higher-cost nickel units flowing through cost of sales matching up against a lower surcharge because the surcharges done on a quarter lag and our inventory turns are less than 4x a year.
