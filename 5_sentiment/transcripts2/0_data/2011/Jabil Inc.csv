I ask you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the second quarter, $3.9 billion, an increase of 30.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $104.6 million. This compares to $61.8 million of GAAP o",1184,"Thank you, Beth and hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the second quarter, $3.9 billion, an increase of 30.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $104.6 million. This compares to $61.8 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $3 billion for the same period in the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, charges associated with the acquisition of sites in France and Italy increased 76.2%, $168.4 million. It represents 4.3% of revenue. This compares to $95.6 million or 3.2% for the same period in the prior year. As expected, on a sequential basis, revenue decreased 3.8% in the second quarter while core operating income decreased by 7.4%. Core diluted earnings per share $0.54, an increase of 86.2% over the prior year. 
Please now refer to Slides 5 and 6 for revenue mix and core operating income by each of the segments on our second fiscal quarter. Our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew by 0.5% sequentially. On a yearly basis, the segment grew 47%. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, representing 35% of total company revenue in the second quarter. Core operating income was 6.1% of revenue. Revenue and core operating income performance were impacted in the quarter as a result of semi-cap equipment revenues below our previous expectations and incremental investments within Specialized Services to support ongoing program wins and ramps in the second half of the fiscal year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased by 6% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 19%. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 32% of total company revenue in the second quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 4.6% of revenue. Our High Velocity segment decreased by 15% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 27%. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 33% of total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 2% of revenue. We are pleased with the progress we are making as we move this segment as part of our operating income range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Now, I ask you to refer to Slides 7, 8 and 9, which accompany my commentary on elements of our second quarter operating and balance sheet performance. Selling, general and administration expenses were $121.5 million and represented 3.1% of revenue. The section development costs, $6.5 million in the quarter, tangible common amortization was $5.7 million. Stock-based compensation was $20.3 million in the quarter. Charges associated with the recently acquired sites in France and Italy was $37.6 million. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $25.9 million. At the current rate, our net core operating income is 16.4%. Our sales cycle in the second quarter decreased by five days in the previous quarter to 11 days. Inventory turns remained consistent at seven. Cash flow from operations was $458.3 million. The core return on invested capital for the quarter was 25.8% and cash and cash equivalents were $902.3 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, there were no outstanding balances on our revolver. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $106 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support our targeted markets and capabilities. $56 million was associated with our Diversified Manufacturing Services group, $13 million in our Enterprise & Infrastructure, $7 million in our high velocity and $30 million in our IT and building infrastructure. Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $71.3 million and core EBITDA was $239.6 million or 6.1% of revenue, consistent with that of our first fiscal quarter. 
In summary, we are extremely pleased with the results of our second quarter. Our goal and plan to fundamentally shift the revenue and income profile of the company to provide overall sustainable operating performance positions to accelerate as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. 
I will now ask you to refer to slides 11 and 12. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the recent events in Japan and the recent acquisition of sites in France and Italy. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all those impacted by the recent natural disaster in Japan. Our operations and employees in Tokyo were not directly impacted by the events. We immediately established the supply chain command center and continued to work with customers and suppliers to assess the full scope of any impact to the continuity of supply and assess best strategies to mitigate any such impact. Towards the end of our second fiscal quarter, we acquired operations in France and Italy, with the primary motivation being to sustain customer relationships. We are currently in the process of developing a long-term business plan for these sites. We expect revenues to represent approximately 1.5% of overall quarterly revenue guidance in the third fiscal quarter. The acquisition of these sites is not expected to impact our ability to hit our 2011 and long-term goals. 
I'd now like to provide you with our third quarter fiscal 2011 guidance. The natural disaster in Japan may have an impact on supply components to our global manufacturing operations. However, the extent of this impact is not known at this time. Therefore, the guidance I'm providing excludes the impact of potential supply disruptions on these results. Now, I ask you to refer to Slides 13 and 14. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 21% or 6% sequentially to a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services group is expected to increase by 6% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure group is expected to increase by 8% sequentially, of which approximately half of this growth is associated with the acquisition of operations in France and Italy. The balance reflects new business awards in existing customer, the wireless telecommunications programs, which will ramp over the next two quarters, while our high velocity segment is expected to increase 3% sequentially. 
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million. Please keep in mind that this includes the range of $5 million to $10 million of operating losses associated with the sites in France and Italy. Core operating margin is expected to be in the range of 4.3% to 4.4%. And as a result, core earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 per diluted share. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be 3.1% of revenue. Research and development costs $10.5 million in the fiscal quarter, intangible amortization is expected to be approximately $5 million, stock-based compensation $20 million, interest expense of $26 million in the third fiscal quarter. Based upon the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income is expected to be approximately 17% for the year. Our capital expenditures are estimated to be $100 million in the quarter. The majority of this expenditure is associated with investments, Diversified Manufacturing Services and Enterprise & Infrastructure segments to support ongoing multi-quarter program runs. At this point, I shall hand the call over to Tim Main."

The first half of fiscal 2011 has been a great start to the full fiscal year. Revenues increased 31% year-over-year and a little over $8 billion. All three business segments that we report today, Diversified Man",1675,"Thank you, Forbes. Please turn to Slide 15. The first half of fiscal 2011 has been a great start to the full fiscal year. Revenues increased 31% year-over-year and a little over $8 billion. All three business segments that we report today, Diversified Manufacturing Services, High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure are exceeding their long-term growth targets, particularly in Diversified Manufacturing Services, the most recent quarter grew 47% year-over-year. We're particularly happy by the fact that Diversified Manufacturing Services has increased to 35% of our overall business. That's from 30% about a year ago. So a very rapid growth in this area and increasing the richness of our portfolio mix. Enterprise & Infrastructure is resuming its growth rate and again, we'll likely exceed our long-term targets this year. The new wins are improving the diversification of this segment. I'll talk about that in a few moments. High velocity, we were challenged in fiscal '10 to drive operating margins to the targeted range of 2% to 2.5% and we now have two consecutive quarters that High Velocity area performed within the long-term targeted range. And we're very happy. Forbes and I are both pleased to report that free cash flow in the first half of this year is significantly above where it was in the first half of fiscal '10. Cash flow from operations in the most recent quarter $450 million, which is a pretty good performance. 
Turning to Slide 16, please, to recap Diversified Manufacturing Services. In the second fiscal quarter, we enjoyed 47% growth over the same period in fiscal 2010. 2011 growth is very likely to exceed our long-term growth target of 20% to 30%. Operating margin remains in the targeted range of 6% to 8% and we're seeing continued growth with guidance of 6% sequential growth in terms of our guidance in Q3. So, very pleased with performance in Diversified Manufacturing Services. On Page 17, Enterprise & Infrastructure is starting to demonstrate significant growth and we enjoyed 19% year-over-year growth in our second fiscal quarter. Operating margins continue to be at the high end of our targeted range of 4% to 4.5%, actually exceeded that margin in our second fiscal quarter and expectations are that we'll continue to operate within that range. We're seeing an increase in contribution of business mix from our storage and telecommunications sector. In fact, we would look for this storage and telecommunications portion of Enterprise & Infrastructure to grow to as high as 70% of the overall sector's business combined with second half of the year. And expect 8% sequential growth in fiscal Q3. So very, very strong growth there based on some new business wins in the targeted areas particularly Telecommunications and storage. 
Turning to Slide 18, please. In high velocity, we did see 27% year-over-year growth, operating margins at 2% are within the range, so for consecutive two quarters of being within the targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. And we're particularly happy with that performance given that our second fiscal quarter is typically a very poor quarter because of the seasonal down and going through a 15% sequential decline and being able to maintain operating margins at 2% and within the range is I think underscores our ability to run the full fiscal year within our targeted long-term range. Expect the second half to show consistent results with the first half and forecasting guidance of 2% to 3% sequential growth rate. 
So taking that all into account, we turn to Slide 19 please. This provides a look at our portfolio in growth, mix and how we look at the second half of the year. Hopefully, will help you out how to characterize the second half of the year relative to the first half. Our first-half actual results are a little over $8 billion, and taking the midpoint of our guidance in the third quarter and applying our long-term growth rates to the fourth fiscal quarter, with a resulting second half revenue level of $8.4 billion. This is consistent with the chart that we reviewed in the last quarter's conference call. Just helping you build a model for this year. That result in a full fiscal year of about $16.4 billion. I think it's interesting to note that if we applied the long-term growth targets to that $16.4 billion, 5% to 10% in high velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure, 20% to 30% in Diversified Manufacturing Services, and based on the business mix we'll have at the end of this fiscal year, the company would reach $20 billion revenue level by fiscal 2013. So we're very happy to be moving in that direction and seeing significant growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services in particular. Turning to Slide 20, please. Our business transformation is well underway and I think showing up in the results. The chart on the right depicts our core operating margin, our core EBITDA margin and tracking that from fiscal '09 through the first half of fiscal 2011, an over 200 basis point improvement in both metrics and a very significant growth year-over-year. Very stressing a great deal on customer service and operational performance. Some of the improvement in margins, particularly from the '09 levels that was due to growth in the business of scale and some of it is due to portfolio mix but a significant part of the improvement in margins is due to really focusing on operational excellence, lean manufacturing and higher levels of productivity. We continue to focus on differentiated services and capabilities, particularly in targeted markets like Healthcare & Life Sciences and other areas of Diversified Manufacturing Services. And we see a growing scale, an advancing scare in targeted markets, which tends to be a virtuous cycle of lower costs, greater capabilities and greater share. 
Turning to Slide 21, please. Kind of recap near term, our challenges and opportunities, clearly the near-term challenges, one significant near-term challenge could be the significant potential for near-term supply disruptions due to the natural disaster in Japan. Right now, it's too early to accurately assess the impact to supply. We're working very closely with our suppliers and customers to mitigate any potential impact. Information, we are now in the 11th day since the tragic event took place. I think you should appreciate that some suppliers are simply scrambling to get there employees back to work, determine if and what level of damage has been done to their operations and when they can resume supply. Information is coming in rapidly and we are getting better information. But again, it's too early to accurately assess what this might do to our results in the third fiscal quarter. We thought the best thing for us to do was to give you an honest appraisal using our conventional, conservative guidance. Gives as we can of the shape and the health of the business today, excluding the potential impact that this might have. We'll be baking that just to talk about the Q&A session today, we will not be making any specific comments regarding particular customers or suppliers. I know you're very interested to know what suppliers might be most impacted, what business sectors might be most impacted, what customers might be to suffer the highest level of consequence. That is completely speculative at this point. There's no reason for us to think that Jabil's experience, if there is significant supply chain disruption, in our experience would be any different than anybody else in the electronics industry, no better and no worse. In fact, I think our diversification probably helps us in that regard. And we're not in a position to predict or help you predict what areas of the industry may be least affected or most affected. So we will have no responses to these specific questions in that regard. 
Second near-term challenge in Italy and France, we're working on sustainable profitable business plan. The impact of margins will be minimal and this was the typical decision that we made on behalf of the significant strategic customers, as well as protecting our reputation within the communities that we do business. I think it provides a significant opportunity for us though, to differentiate Jabil's customer service during a period of high stress, both in terms of acquiring sites that were struggling on behalf of strategic customers, as well as proactively working with our customers and suppliers to mitigate, minimize any supply chain disruption due to the events in Japan. I think it's an opportunity for Jabil to use its skilled resources in the area of component engineering and design resources, as well as our global supply chain management capabilities, particularly those capabilities in Asia. Jabil's also well capitalized to support customers during this period of high stress and we think it's a great reason for the customers that we serve to do business with. Our scale well capitalized and well-funded companies like Jabil over other players in the history that may not be as well positioned to support them during this period of high stress. We take this opportunity to point to our, support customers and pursuant to that, build market share and scale in targeted markets. Our growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services is exceeding our long-term targets and we're building share in Enterprise infrastructure and very gratified by that. So in summary, there are some near-term challenges. There's no reason to think that those near-term challenges will be extended at any time. The permanent challenge, in fact, Jabil has operated and reallocated component markets many times, in my experience at Jabil, and there'll be short-term disruptions, may or may not be severe. We don't know at this point. They are temporary descriptions and there's no reason to think that it will be any better or worse for Jabil and no reason to think that it will extend beyond the next quarter or two. So it's great opportunity for Jabil to differentiate ourselves with customers and the industry and to continue to grow on target markets. And our long-term strategic is on track. We're very pleased with our progress."

Let me talk about first the actions that we take and then maybe some experiences that might be instructive. In the short term, the first things that we can do are focused on productivity and cost reduction within the sites themselves and we'll be working on that diligently, immediately. Secondly, is to make sure that the present customers in the sites are well served and hopefully enhance those relationships in order to give them confidence that we cannot always supply their current requirements but also potentially expand the business. Thirdly, if you look at the unique characteristics of the sites and develop a business plan that is sustainable and target customers and markets that can support the cost structure and take advantage of any unique capabilities that the sites might have. What our experience for Jabil is our U.S. operations today are profitable. I believe every single site in the United States is profitable. So even through we went through a period of retrenchment in the U.S., we closed a site in Massachusetts, by working on middle market accounts aggressively and we've been working on things like MPI services and plans like Michigan and really working in healthcare and areas of the business that need a U.S. presence, that actually developed a pretty robust and profitable business here in the U.S. We decided to forgo that opportunity in Europe because the market is a little bit different, a little more challenging to make those things work in Western Europe but now that we own the sites again, we're going to have revisit all of those plans and really aggressively go after it. Initially, short-term it's cost reduction, the current customers and then longer-term over the next three, four, five quarters it's really working diligently on new markets for the sites."

What that does is add about $6 million of expense there, $4 million fully paid to the plants in France and Italy and a little bit of room for growth there to support the continuing growth across our Enterprise. R&D, nothing in particular there. We've droid various activities and programs. I think as you know, design can be a little bit more challenging to predict exactly where some of these programs launch and finish. So nothing in particular there and we'll continue to see that as we move forward. In terms of the tax rate, that came in lower than we expected and that's really being driven by the sources of revenue and income on a geographic basis.

That is a little bit less than anticipated and making investments, particularly in Specialized Services to support continued growth in Specialized Services in the second half of the year. So if you take a look at where the margins were in the second quarter versus the midpoint, it's about $10 million of additional income and you consider $3 million or $4 million in semi cap and some of the other areas of Instrumentation, a little bit weaker in Q2 with the balance of it being expenses and investments to support more aggressive ramp of production in the second half of the year.

Net revenue for the second quarter is $3.9 billion, an increase of 30.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $104.6 million. This compares to $61.8 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $3 billion for the same period in the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and charges associated with the acquisition of sites in France and Italy increased 76.2% to $168.4 million. It represents 4.3% of revenue. This compares to $95.6 million or 3.2% for the same period in the prior year. As expected, on a sequential basis, revenue decreased 3.8% in the second quarter while core operating income decreased by 7.4%. Core diluted earnings per share $0.54, an increase of 86.2% over the prior year. 
Please now refer to Slides 5 and 6 for revenue mix and core operating income by each of the segments on our second fiscal quarter. 
Our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew by 0.5% sequentially. On a yearly basis, the segment grew 47%. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, representing 35% of total company revenue in the second quarter. Core operating income was 6.1% of revenue. Revenue and core operating income performance were impacted in the quarter as a result of semi-cap equipment revenues below our previous expectations and incremental investments within Specialized Services to support ongoing program wins and ramps in the second half of the fiscal year. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased by 6% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 19%. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 32% of total company revenue in the second quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 4.6% of revenue. 
Our High Velocity segment decreased by 15% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 27%. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 33% of total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 2% of revenue. We are pleased with the progress we are making as we move this segment with our targeted core operating income range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Now, I ask you to refer to Slides 7, 8 and 9, which accompany my commentary on elements of our second quarter operating and balance sheet performance. Selling, general and administration expenses were $121.5 million and represented 3.1% of revenue. Research and development costs was $6.5 million in the quarter, intangibles amortization was $5.7 million, stock based compensation was $20.3 million in the quarter and charges associated with the recently acquired sites in France and Italy was $37.6 million. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $25.9 million, and the tax rate on net core operating income was 16.4%. 
Our sales cycle in the second quarter decreased by five days from the previous quarter to 11 days. Inventory turns remain consistent at seven. Cash flow from operations was $458.3 million. The core return on invested capital for the quarter was 25.8% and cash and cash equivalents were $902.3 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, there were no outstanding balances on our revolver. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $106 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support our targeted markets and capabilities. $56 million was associated with our Diversified Manufacturing Services group, $13 million in our Enterprise & Infrastructure, $7 million in our High Velocity and $30 million in our IT and building infrastructure. Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $71.3 million and core EBITDA was $239.6 million or 6.1% of revenue, consistent with that of our first fiscal quarter. 
In summary, we're extremely pleased with the results of our second quarter. Our goal and plan is to fundamentally shift the revenue and income profile of the company to provide overall sustainable operating performance, a  provision to accelerate as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. 
I will now ask you to refer to Slides 11 and 12, where I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the recent events in Japan and the recent acquisition of sites in France and Italy. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all those impacted by the recent natural disaster in Japan. Our operations and employees in Gotemba and Tokyo were not directly impacted by the events. We immediately established the supply chain command center and continued to work with customers and suppliers to assess the full scope of any impact to the continuity of supply and assess best strategies to mitigate any such impact. Towards the end of our second fiscal quarter, we acquired operations in France and Italy, with the primary motivation being to sustain customer relationships. We are currently in the process of developing a long-term business plan for these sites and expect revenues to represent approximately 1.5% of overall quarterly revenue guidance in the third fiscal quarter. The acquisition of these sites is not expected to impact our ability to meet our 2011 and long-term goals. 
I'd now like to provide you with our third quarter fiscal 2011 guidance. The natural disaster in Japan may have an impact on the supply of components to our global manufacturing operations. However, the extent of this impact is not known at this time. Therefore, the guidance I'm providing excludes the impact of potential supply disruptions on these results. 
Now, I ask you to refer to Slides 13 and 14. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 21% or 6% sequentially to a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services group is expected to increase by 6% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure group is expected to increase by 8% sequentially, of which approximately half of this growth is associated with the acquisition of operations in France and Italy. The balance reflects new business awards from an existing customer and the wireless telecommunications programs, which will ramp over the next two quarters, while our High Velocity segment is expected to increase 3% sequentially. 
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million. Please keep in mind that this includes the range of $5 million to $10 million of operating losses associated with the sites in France and Italy. Core operating margin is expected to be in the range of 4.3% to 4.4%. And that will result to core earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 per diluted share. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be 3.1% of revenue. Research and development costs, $7.5 million in the fiscal quarter, intangibles amortization is expected to be approximately $5 million, stock based compensation, $20 million, and interest expense of $26 million in the third fiscal quarter. Based upon the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income is expected to be approximately 17% for the year. 
Our capital expenditures are estimated to be $100 million in the quarter. The majority of this expenditure, being associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services and Enterprise & Infrastructure segments to support ongoing multi-quarter program runs. At this point, I shall hand the call over to Tim Main."

The first half of fiscal 2011 has been a great start to the full fiscal year. Revenues increased 31% year-over-year and a little over $8 billion. All three business segments that we report today, Diversified Man",1699,"Thank you, Forbes. Please turn to Slide 15. The first half of fiscal 2011 has been a great start to the full fiscal year. Revenues increased 31% year-over-year and a little over $8 billion. All three business segments that we report today, Diversified Manufacturing Services, High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure are exceeding their long-term growth targets, particularly Diversified Manufacturing Services, in the most recent quarter grew 47% year-over-year. We're particularly heartened by the fact that Diversified Manufacturing Services has increased to 35% of our overall business, and that's from 30% about a year ago. So a very rapid growth in this area and increasing the richness of our portfolio mix. Enterprise & Infrastructure is resuming its growth rate and again, will likely exceed our long-term targets this year. The new wins are improving the diversification in this segment. I'll talk about that in a few moments. High velocity, we were challenged in fiscal '10 to drive operating margins to the targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. We now have two consecutive quarters where the High Velocity area performed within the long-term targeted range. And we're very happy. Forbes and I are both pleased to report that free cash flow in the first half of this year is significantly above where it was in the first half of fiscal '10, with cash flow from operations in the most recent quarter $450 million, which is, I think, a pretty good performance. 
Turning to Slide 16, please, on the recap in Diversified Manufacturing Services. In the second fiscal quarter, we enjoyed 47% growth over the same period in fiscal 2010. 2011 growth is very likely to exceed now our long-term growth target of 20% to 30%. Operating margin remains in the targeted range of 6% to 8%, and we're seeing continued growth with guidance of 6% sequential growth in terms of our guidance in Q3. So we're very pleased with the performance in Diversified Manufacturing Services. 
Turn to Page 17, Enterprise & Infrastructure is starting to demonstrate significant growth, and we enjoyed 19% year-over-year growth in our second fiscal quarter. Operating margins continue to be at the high end of our targeted range of 4% to 4.5%, actually we exceeded that margin in our second fiscal quarter and expectations are that we'll continue to operate within that range. We're seeing an increase in contribution of business mix from our storage and telecommunications sector. In fact, we would look for this storage and telecommunications portion of Enterprise & Infrastructure to grow to as high as 70% of the overall sectors business by the second half of the year. And expect 8% sequential growth in fiscal Q3. So very, very strong growth there based on some new business wins in the targeted areas, particularly telecommunications and storage. 
Slide 18, please. In High Velocity, we did see 27% year-over-year growth. Operating margins at 2% are within the range, so two consecutive quarters of being within the targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. We're particularly happy with that performance given our second fiscal quarter is typically a very poor quarter because of the seasonal down and going through a 15% sequential decline and being able to maintain operating margins at 2% and within the range I think underscores our ability to run the full fiscal year within our targeted long-term range. Expect the second half to show consistent results with the first half and forecasting guidance to a 3% sequential growth rate. 
So taking that all into account, we turn to Slide 19 please. This provides a look at our portfolio and growth mix and how we look at the second half of the year. Hopefully, help you how to characterize the second half of the year relative to the first half. Our first half actual results are a little over $8 billion, and taking the midpoint of our guidance in the third quarter and applying our long-term growth rates to the fourth fiscal quarter, that results in the second half revenue level of $8.4 billion. This is consistent with the chart that we reviewed in the last quarter's conference call. Just helping you build a model for this year. That results in a full fiscal year of about $16.4 billion. I think it's interesting to note that if we applied the long-term growth targets onto that $16.4 billion, 5% to 10% in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure, 20% to 30% in Diversified Manufacturing Services, and based on the business mix we'll have, at the end of this fiscal year, the company would reach $20 billion revenue level by fiscal 2013. So we're very happy to be moving in that direction and seeing significant growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services in particular. 
Turning to Slide 20, please. Our business transformation is well underway and I think showing up in the results, the chart on the right, depicts our core operating margin and core EBITDA margin and tracking that from fiscal '09 through the first half of fiscal 2011, over a 200 basis point improvement in both metrics and a very significant growth year-over-year. Very stressing a great deal on customer service and operational performance. Some of the improvement in margins, particularly from the '09 levels was due to growth in the business of scale and some of it is due to portfolio mix, but a significant part of the improvement in margins is due to really focusing on operational excellence, lean manufacturing and higher levels of productivity. We continue to focus on differentiated services and capabilities, particularly in targeted markets like Healthcare & Life Sciences and other areas of Diversified Manufacturing Services. And we see a growing scale and advancing share in targeted markets, which tends to be a virtuous cycle of lower costs, higher capabilities and greater share. 
Turning to Slide 21, please. Just to kind of recap near term our challenges and opportunities, clearly the near-term challenges, one significant near-term challenge could be the potential for near-term supply disruptions due to the natural disaster in Japan. Right now, it's too early to accurately assess the impact to supply. We're working very closely with our suppliers and customers to mitigate any potential impact, information that we are now in the 11th day since the tragic event took place. I think you should appreciate that some suppliers are simply scrambling to get their employees back to work, determine if and what level of damage has been done to their operations and when they can resume supply. Information is coming in rapidly, and we are getting better information. But again, it's too early to accurately assess what impact this might have to our results in the third fiscal quarter. We thought the best thing for us to do was to give you an honest appraisal using our conventional, conservative guidance, give you as accurate a picture as we can of the shape and health of the business today, and excluding the potential impact that this might have. We'll be making, just to talk about the Q&A session today, we will not be making any specific comments regarding particular customers or suppliers. I know you're very interested to know what suppliers might be most impacted, what business sectors might be most impacted, what customers might be suffered to the highest level of consequence. That is completely speculative at this point. There's no reason for us to think that Jabil's experience, if there is a significant supply chain disruption, that our experience would be any different than anybody else in the electronics industry, no better and no worse. In fact, I think our diversification probably helps us in that regard. And we're not in a position to predict or help you predict what areas of the industry may be least affected or most affected. So we will be making -- we will have no responses in these specific questions in that regard. 
Second near-term challenge in Italy and France. We're working on the sustainable profitable business plan. But the impact of margins will be minimal, and this was a difficult decision that we made on behalf of significant strategic customers, as well as protecting our reputation within the communities that we do business. I think it provides a significant opportunity for us though to differentiate Jabil's customer service during a period of high stress, both in terms of acquiring sites that were struggling on behalf of strategic customers, as well as proactively working with our customers and suppliers to mitigate and minimize any supply chain disruption due to the events in Japan. I think it's an opportunity for Jabil to use its skilled resources in the area of component engineering and design resources as well as our global supply chain management capabilities, particularly those capabilities in Asia. 
Jabil's also well capitalized to support customers during this period of high stress, and we think it's a great reason for the customers that we serve to do business with large scale, well-capitalized and well-funded companies like Jabil over other players in the industry that may not be as well positioned to support them during this period of high stress. We take this opportunity to fine-tune our service, support customers and pursuant to that, build market share and scale in targeted markets. Our growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services is exceeding our long-term targets and we're building share in Enterprise & Infrastructure and very gratified by that. 
So in summary, there are some near-term challenges. There's no reason to think that those near-term challenges will be extended in any time for a permanent challenge. In fact, Jabil has operated in highly-allocated component markets many times, in my experience at Jabil, and there will be short-term disruptions, may or may not be severe. We don't know at this point. They are temporary disruptions, and there's no reason to think that it will be any better or worse for Jabil, and no reason to think that it will extend beyond the next quarter or two. So it's a great opportunity for Jabil to differentiate ourselves with customers and the industry and to continue to grow on target markets. And in summary, our long-term strategic plan is on track. We're very pleased with our progress."

Let me talk about first the actions that we take and then maybe some experiences that might be instructive. In the short term, the first things that we can do are focused on productivity and cost reduction within the sites themselves, and we'll be working on that diligently immediately. Secondly, is to make sure that the present customers in the sites are well served and hopefully enhance those relationships in order to give them confidence that we cannot only supply their current requirements, but also potentially expand the business. Third, we look at the unique characteristics of the sites and develop a business plan that is sustainable and target customers and markets that can support the cost structure and take advantage of any unique capabilities that the sites might have. Another experience for Jabil is our U.S. operations today are profitable. I believe every single site in the United States is profitable. So even through we went through a period of retrenchment in the U.S., we closed a site in Billerica, Massachusetts by working on middle market accounts aggressively and working on things like NPI [new product introduction] services and plans like Michigan and really working in healthcare and areas of the business that need a U.S. presence, we've actually developed a pretty robust and profitable business here in the U.S. We decided to forgo that opportunity in Europe because the market is a little bit different, a little more challenging to make those things work in Western Europe but now that we own the sites again, we're going to have to revisit all of those plants and really aggressively go after it. So initially, short-term, it's cost reduction in the current customers and then longer-term over the next three, four, five quarters it's really working diligently on new markets for the sites."

What that does is add about $6 million of expense there, $4 million associated with the plants in France and Italy and a little bit of room for growth there to support the continuing growth across our Enterprise. R&D, nothing in particular there. We got various activities and programs that move in and out. I think as you know, design can be a little bit more challenging to predict exactly where some of these program to launch and finish. So nothing in particular there, and we'll continue to see that as we move forward. In terms of the tax rate, that came in lower than what we've expected and that's really being driven by the sources of revenue and income on a geographic basis. So we'd expect that given what we see today as we move forward to be in right about 17% as we move forward to the balance of this fiscal year.

In terms of the last quarter, we did have a little weakness in semiconductor capital equipment  that was a little bit less than anticipated and making investments, particularly in Specialized Services to support continued growth in Specialized Services in the second half of the year. So if you take a look at where the margins were in the second quarter versus the midpoint, it's about $10 million of additional income and you consider $3 million to $4 million in semi-cap and some of the other areas of Instrumentation that might be a little bit weaker in Q2 with the balance of it being expenses and investments to support more aggressive ramp of production in the second half of the year.

There's a reason that we don't provide guidance on a gross margin basis because for years, for the last 10 years and we've said we really don't regard that as a meaningful metric for us. There is a significant change with business-to-business, program to program, customer to customer in terms of the material content of revenue stream, and that's really the primary determinative of gross margin. We're really focused on operating margins as diversified manufacturing services increase from 30% to 35% of our operating margins have followed suit from 3.7% to 4.4% for the first half of this year. So very significant improvement in the operating performance of the business. And really, gross margin is not a metric that we track. We don't regard it as significantly meaningful."

I think there's opportunity that we would certainly grow beyond the high end of that long-term target this fiscal year given the first half performance and our Q3 guidance. So on an overall basis, I think there is certainly opportunity to drive free cash flow to around about the 20% level. If one sort of backs into the math there on a consistent growth rate, 10% to 15%.

Then suddenly, you're able to run 24/7 and recover those deliveries. So it's really difficult even over the course of the quarter to provide any type of quantification.

I ask you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the second quarter is $3.9 billion, an increase of 30.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $104.6 million. This compares to $61.8 million GAAP o",1199,"Thank you, Beth, and hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the second quarter is $3.9 billion, an increase of 30.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $104.6 million. This compares to $61.8 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $3 billion for the same period in the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and charges associated with the acquisition of sites in France and Italy increased 76.2% to $168.4 million. It represents 4.3% of revenue. This compares to $95.6 million or 3.2% for the same period in the prior year. As expected, on a sequential basis, revenue decreased 3.8% in the second quarter while core operating income decreased by 7.4%. Core diluted earnings per share $0.54, an increase of 86.2% over the prior year. 
Please now refer to Slides 5 and 6 for revenue mix and core operating income by each of the segments for our second fiscal quarter. 
Our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew by 0.5% sequentially. On a yearly basis, the segment grew 47%. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, representing 35% of total company revenue in the second quarter. Core operating income was 6.1% of revenue. Revenue and core operating income performance were impacted in the quarter as a result of semi-cap equipment revenues below our previous expectations and incremental investments within Specialized Services to support ongoing program wins and ramps in the second half of the fiscal year. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased by 6% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 19%. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 32% of total company revenue in the second quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 4.6% of revenue. 
Our High Velocity segment decreased by 15% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 27%. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 33% of total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 2% of revenue. We are pleased with the progress we are making as we move this segment with our targeted core operating income range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Now, I ask you to refer to Slides 7, 8 and 9, which accompany my commentary on elements of our second quarter operating and balance sheet performance. Selling, general and administration expenses were $121.5 million and represented 3.1% of revenue. Research and development costs was $6.5 million in the quarter, intangibles amortization was $5.7 million, stock based compensation was $20.3 million in the quarter and charges associated with the recently acquired sites in France and Italy was $37.6 million. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $25.9 million, and the tax rate on net core operating income was 16.4%. 
Our sales cycle in the second quarter decreased by five days from the previous quarter to 11 days. Inventory turns remain consistent at seven. Cash flow from operations was $450.3 million. The core return on invested capital for the quarter was 25.8% and cash and cash equivalents were $902.3 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, there were no outstanding balances on our revolver. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $106 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support our targeted markets and capabilities. $56 million was associated with our Diversified Manufacturing Services group, $13 million in our Enterprise & Infrastructure, $7 million in our High Velocity and $30 million in our IT and building infrastructure. Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $71.3 million and core EBITDA was $239.6 million or 6.1% of revenue, consistent with that of our first fiscal quarter. 
In summary, we're extremely pleased with the results of our second quarter. Our goal and plan is to fundamentally shift the revenue and income profile of the company to provide overall sustainable operating performance, a provision to accelerate as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. 
I will now ask you to refer to Slides 11 and 12, where I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the recent events in Japan and the recent acquisition of sites in France and Italy. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all those impacted by the recent natural disaster in Japan. Our operations and employees in Gotemba and Tokyo were not directly impacted by the events. We immediately established a supply chain command center and continue to work with customers and suppliers to assess the full scope of any impact to the continuity of supply and assess best strategies to mitigate any such impact. 
Towards the end of our second fiscal quarter, we acquired operations in France and Italy, with the primary motivation being to sustain customer relationships. We are currently in the process of developing a long-term business plan for these sites and expect revenues to represent approximately 1.5% of overall quarterly revenue guidance in the third fiscal quarter. The acquisition of these sites is not expected to impact our ability to meet our 2011 and long-term goals. 
I'd now like to provide you with our third quarter fiscal 2011 guidance. The natural disaster in Japan may have an impact on the supply of components to our global manufacturing operations. However, the extent of this impact is not known at this time. Therefore, the guidance I'm providing excludes the impact of potential supply disruptions on these results. 
Now, I ask you to refer to Slides 13 and 14. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 21% or 6% sequentially to a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services group is expected to increase by 6% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure group is expected to increase by 8% sequentially, of which approximately half of this growth is associated with the acquisition of operations in France and Italy. The balance reflects new business awards from an existing customer and the wireless telecommunications programs, which will ramp over the next two quarters, while our High Velocity segment is expected to increase 3% sequentially. 
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million. Please keep in mind that this includes the range of $5 million to $10 million of operating losses associated with the sites in France and Italy. Core operating margin is expected to be in the range of 4.3% to 4.4%. And that will result to core earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 per diluted share. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be 3.1% of revenue. Research and development costs, $7.5 million in the fiscal quarter, intangibles amortization is expected to be approximately $5 million, stock based compensation, $20 million, and interest expense of $26 million in the third fiscal quarter. Based upon the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income is expected to be approximately 17% for the year. 
Our capital expenditures are estimated to be $100 million in the quarter. The majority of this expenditure, being associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services and Enterprise & Infrastructure segments, support ongoing multi-quarter program runs. 
At this point, I shall hand the call over to Tim Main."

The first half of fiscal 2011 has been a great start to the full fiscal year. Revenues increased 31% year-over-year and a little over $8 billion. All three business segments that we report today, Diversified Man",1707,"Thank you, Forbes. Please turn to Slide 15. The first half of fiscal 2011 has been a great start to the full fiscal year. Revenues increased 31% year-over-year and a little over $8 billion. All three business segments that we report today, Diversified Manufacturing Services, High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure are exceeding their long-term growth targets, particularly Diversified Manufacturing Services, in the most recent quarter grew 47% year-over-year. We're particularly heartened by the fact that Diversified Manufacturing Services has increased to 35% of our overall business, and that's from 30% about a year ago. So a very rapid growth in this area and increasing the richness of our portfolio mix. 
Enterprise & Infrastructure is resuming its growth rate and, again, will likely exceed our long-term targets this year. The new wins are improving the diversification in this segment. I'll talk about that in a few moments. High velocity, we were challenged in fiscal '10 to drive operating margins to the targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. We now have two consecutive quarters where the High Velocity area performed within the long-term targeted range. And we're very happy, Forbes and I are both pleased, to report that free cash flow in the first half of this year is significantly above where it was in the first half of fiscal '10, with cash flow from operations in the most recent quarter $450 million, which is, I think, a pretty good performance. 
Turning to Slide 16, please, on the recap in Diversified Manufacturing Services. In the second fiscal quarter, we enjoyed 47% growth over the same period in fiscal 2010. 2011 growth is very likely to exceed now our long-term growth target of 20% to 30%. Operating margin remains in the targeted range of 6% to 8%, and we're seeing continued growth with guidance of 6% sequential growth in terms of our guidance in Q3. So we're very pleased with the performance in Diversified Manufacturing Services. 
Turn to Page 17, Enterprise & Infrastructure is starting to demonstrate significant growth, and we enjoyed 19% year-over-year growth in our second fiscal quarter. Operating margins continue to be at the high end of our targeted range of 4% to 4.5%, actually we exceeded that margin in our second fiscal quarter and expectations are that we'll continue to operate within that range. We're seeing an increase in contribution of business mix from our storage and telecommunications sector. In fact, we would look for this storage and telecommunications portion of Enterprise & Infrastructure to grow to as high as 70% of the overall sectors business by the second half of the year, and expect 8% sequential growth in fiscal Q3. So very, very strong growth there based on some new business wins in the targeted areas, particularly telecommunications and storage. 
Turn to Slide 18, please. In High Velocity, we did see 27% year-over-year growth. Operating margins at 2% are within the range, so two consecutive quarters of being within the targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. We're particularly happy with that performance given our second fiscal quarter is typically a very poor quarter because of the seasonal down, and going through a 15% sequential decline and being able to maintain operating margins at 2% and within the range is, I think, underscores our ability to run the full fiscal year within our targeted long-term range. Expect the second half to show consistent results with the first half and forecasting guidance to a 3% sequential growth rate. 
So taking that all into account, will you turn to Slide 19, please. This provides a look at our portfolio and growth mix and how we look at the second half of the year. Hopefully, help you how to characterize the second half of the year relative to the first half. Our first half actual results are a little over $8 billion, and taking the midpoint of our guidance in the third quarter and applying our long-term growth rates to the fourth fiscal quarter, that results in the second half revenue level of $8.4 billion. This is consistent with the chart that we reviewed in the last quarter's conference call. Just helping you build a model for this year. That results in a full fiscal year of about $16.4 billion. 
I think it's interesting to note that if we applied the long-term growth targets onto that $16.4 billion, 5% to 10% in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure, 20% to 30% in Diversified Manufacturing Services, and based on the business mix we'll have, at the end of this fiscal year, the company would reach a $20 billion revenue level by fiscal 2013. So we're very happy to be moving in that direction and seeing significant growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services in particular. 
Turning to Slide 20, please. Our business transformation is well underway and I think showing up in the results, the chart on the right, depicts our core operating margin and core EBITDA margin. And tracking that from fiscal '09 through the first half of fiscal 2011, over a 200 basis point improvement in both metrics, and a very significant growth year-over-year. 
We’re very stressing a great deal on customer service and operational performance. Some of the improvement in margins, particularly from the '09 levels, was due to growth in the business of scale and some of it is due to portfolio mix, but a significant part of the improvement in margins is due to really focusing on operational excellence, lean manufacturing and higher levels of productivity. We continue to focus on differentiated services and capabilities, particularly in targeted markets like Healthcare & Life Sciences and other areas of Diversified Manufacturing Services. And we see a growing scale and advancing share in targeted markets, which tends to be a virtuous cycle of lower costs, higher capabilities and greater share. 
Turning to Slide 21, please. Just to kind of recap near term our challenges and opportunities, clearly the near-term challenges, one significant near-term challenge could be the potential for near-term supply disruptions due to the natural disaster in Japan. Right now, it's too early to accurately assess the impact to supply. We're working very closely with our suppliers and customers to mitigate any potential impact. Information that we are now in the 11th day since the tragic event took place, I think you should appreciate that some suppliers are simply scrambling to get their employees back to work, determine if and what level of damage has been done to their operations and when they can resume supply. Information is coming in rapidly, and we are getting better information. But again, it's too early to accurately assess what impact this might have to our results in the third fiscal quarter. We thought the best thing for us to do was to give you an honest appraisal using our conventional, conservative guidance, give you as accurate a picture as we can of the shape and health of the business today, and excluding the potential impact that this might have. 
We'll be making, just to talk about the Q&A session today, we will not be making any specific comments regarding particular customers or suppliers. I know you're very interested to know what suppliers might be most impacted, what business sectors might be most impacted, what customers might be -- suffer to the highest level of consequence. That is completely speculative at this point. There's no reason for us to think that Jabil's experience, if there is a significant supply chain disruption, that our experience would be any different than anybody else in the electronics industry, no better and no worse. In fact, I think our diversification probably helps us in that regard. And we're not in a position to predict or help you predict what areas of the industry may be least affected or most affected. So we will be making -- we will have no responses to these specific questions in that regard. 
Second near-term challenge in Italy and France. We're working on a sustainable, profitable business plan. We think the impact of margins will be minimal. And this was a difficult decision that we made on behalf of significant strategic customers, as well as protecting our reputation within the communities that we do business. I think it provides a significant opportunity for us, though, to differentiate Jabil's customer service during a period of high stress, both in terms of acquiring sites that were struggling on behalf of strategic customers, as well as proactively working with our customers and suppliers to mitigate and minimize any supply chain disruption due to the events in Japan. I think it's an opportunity for Jabil to use its skilled resources in the area of component engineering and design resources, as well as our global supply chain management capabilities, particularly those capabilities in Asia. 
Jabil's also well capitalized to support customers during this period of high stress. And we think it's a great reason for the customers that we serve to do business with large scale, well-capitalized and well-funded companies like Jabil over other players in the industry that may not be as well positioned to support them during this period of high stress. We take this opportunity to fine-tune our service, support customers and, pursuant to that, build market share and scale in targeted markets. Our growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services is exceeding our long-term targets and we're building share in Enterprise & Infrastructure and very gratified by that. 
So in summary, there are some near-term challenges. There's no reason to think that those near-term challenges will be extended into any type of permanent challenge. In fact, Jabil has operated in highly-allocated component markets many times, in my experience at Jabil. And there will be short-term disruptions, may or may not be severe, we don't know at this point. They are temporary disruptions, and there's no reason to think that it will be any better or worse for Jabil, and no reason to think that it will extend beyond the next quarter or two. 
So it's a great opportunity for Jabil to differentiate ourselves with customers and the industry and to continue to grow on target markets. And in summary, our long-term strategic plan is on track and we're very pleased with our progress."

Let me talk about first the actions that we take and then maybe some experiences that might be instructive. In the short term, the first things that we can do are focused on productivity and cost reduction within the sites themselves, and we'll be working on that diligently immediately. Secondly, is to make sure that the present customers in the sites are well served and hopefully enhance those relationships in order to give them confidence that we cannot only supply their current requirements, but also potentially expand the business. Third, we look at the unique characteristics of the sites and develop a business plan that is sustainable and target customers and markets that can support the cost structure and take advantage of any unique capabilities that the sites might have. Another experience for Jabil is our U.S. operations today are profitable. I believe every single site in the United States is profitable. So even though we went through a period of retrenchment in the U.S., we closed a site in Billerica, Massachusetts, by working on middle market accounts aggressively and working on things like NPI [new product introduction] services in plants like Michigan and really working in healthcare and areas of the business that need a U.S. presence, we've actually developed a pretty robust and profitable business here in the U.S. We decided to forgo that opportunity in Europe because the market is a little bit different, a little more challenging to make those things work in Western Europe, but now that we own the sites again, we're going to have to revisit all of those plants and really aggressively go after it. So initially, short-term, it's cost reduction in the current customers and then longer-term over the next three, four, five quarters, it's really working diligently on new markets for the sites."

As we move forward, you're going to see that just come up a little bit, guidance for next quarter is about 3.1%, so consistent with Q2. What that does is add about $6 million of expense there, $4 million associated with the plants in France and Italy, and a little bit of room for growth there to support the continuing growth across our Enterprise. R&D, nothing particular there. We’ve got various activities and programs that move in and out. I think, as you know, design can be a little bit more challenging to predict exactly where some of these programs launch and finish. So nothing particular there, and we'll continue to see that as we move forward. In terms of the tax rate, that came in lower than we’d expected, and that's really being driven by the sources of revenue and income on a geographic basis. So we'd expect that, given what we see today as we move forward, to be in right about 17% as we move forward to the balance of this fiscal year. I would drive one’s attention to we do still have some tax holidays in various geographies in Asia. And even with the impact of operations in France and Italy, I think we can still achieve that 17% as we move forward."

Therefore, we're really kind of pulling in the date at which, the year in which we will likely hit a $20 billion run rate. So it's not guidance.

In terms of the last quarter, we did have a little weakness in semiconductor capital equipment that was a little bit less than anticipated, and making investments, particularly in Specialized Services, to support continued growth in Specialized Services in the second half of the year. So if you take a look at where the margins were in the second quarter versus the midpoint, it's about $10 million of additional income.

You're probably likely to see that the next couple of quarters. But as we absorb that very rapid growth, I think that rate will start to slow down a bit. And the payback periods are relatively conventional and nothing out of the ordinary for us."

That said, that slope rate -- the next slope rate is not going to be nearly as rapid as their core businesses today. I think they will start to pay dividends -- well it's starting to pay dividend already, actually. There are new program wins that we're winning because of their capability today, and will become more material through our results in 2012 and 2013 as we continue to provide that integration.

I actually had a few investors email me some questions that maybe you can help clarify. When we look at the first half of 2011 versus the second half of 2011, the green section basically more than doubles, and the red section basically gets cut in third. Maybe while you look at that chart, can you help us understand, is that what you expect your second half 2011 total company mix to be, or is that the portion of the growth that you see coming from that? Because it almost looks like high velocity is going to get cut in third.

These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, on filing subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Net revenue for the third quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 22.3% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $152.5 million. This compares to $96.5 million of GAAP operating income from revenues of $3.5 billion for the same period in the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 34.8% to $177.8 million and represents 4.2% revenue. This compares to $131.9 million or 3.8% for the same period in the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 7.6% in the third quarter, while core operating income increased 5.6%. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.58, an increase of 45% over the prior year. 
Please refer to slides 5 and 6 where for mix and core operating income in each of our segments for the third fiscal quarter. I would also like to remind you that the third fiscal quarter results include a full quarter results from operations related to the sites we acquired in France and Italy late last quarter. On a comparable sequential basis, these sites impacted overall gross margin negatively by approximately 15 basis points and core operating income negatively by 20 basis points in the quarter. 
Let's turn to our segments. Our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 9.4% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew 44%. Revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 36% total company revenue in the third quarter. Core operating income expanded sequentially by 10 basis points to 6.2% in the quarter. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 11.8% sequentially. On a yearly basis, the segment grew by 15.5%. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion and represented 33% of total company revenues in the third quarter. Core operating income was 3.9% of revenue. This segment includes the results of operations of the sites we acquired in France and Italy, which had a negative impact of 50 basis points on core operating in this segment. These operating returns, the segment remains at the high end of our overall operating margin target. The High Velocity segment increased 1.7% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 10%. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 31% of total company revenue in the third quarter. The core operating income was 2.2% of revenue, an expansion of 20 basis points. Our top 10 customers in the quarter accounted for approximately 63% of our revenue. 
And now I'll ask you to refer to slides 7, 8 and 9, which accompany my commentary on elements of our third quarter operating and balance sheet performance. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $134.1 million, and represent 3.2% of revenue. Part of the $12 million sequential increase is associated with the operations we acquired in France and Italy. The balance of costs represent faster than we anticipated to support margin growth across our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Research and development costs were $6.5 million in the quarter. Intangibles amortization was $5.2 million and stock-based compensation was $20.1 million in the quarter. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $26 million and the tax rate on a net core operating income was 15.2%. 
Our sales cycle in the quarter was consistent with the previous quarter of 11 days, and improved by 5 days from the same period a year ago. Days in inventory decreased by 2 days while turns remained consistent at 7. Core return on invested capital for the quarter was 28.5%, cash flow from operations was $158.8 million and cash and cash equivalents were $911.1 million. There are no outstanding balances on our revolver at the end of the third quarter. 
Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $77.3 million and core EBITDA was $255.1 million or 6% of revenue. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $113.6 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support the targeted marketing capabilities. Approximately $71 million was associated with our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, $21 million with Enterprise & Infrastructure, $8 million in High Velocity and $13 million in installation technology and infrastructure. We remain very well-positioned to continue to produce free cash flow within our fourth fiscal quarter and through fiscal '12. And with this in mind, we are pleased to advised that our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million worth of common stock during the next 12 months in open market transactions. 
I'd now like to refer to slides 10 and 11. In summary, we are pleased with the results of the third quarter and are extremely well positioned to meet the overall fiscal '11 goals. In the third quarter our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment represented 36% of company revenue versus 31% for the same period a year ago. Our overall company core operating income margins have expanded from 3.7% to 4.2% over the same period. Capital investments year-to-date and for the fourth quarter have and shall be focused in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. 60% for the full year's capital expenditure investment have been committed to expanding the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, supporting our stated goals to fundamentally shift the revenue and income profile of the company to provide overall sustainable operating performance and free cash flow generation. 
I'd now like to provide you with our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 guidance and ask that you refer to Slides 13 and 14. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 9% on the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase by 7% sequentially, with growth across all areas of business in this segment. The Enterprise & Infrastructure group are expected to increase by 3% sequentially despite the ongoing wireless network and product ramps, and our High Velocity segment is expected to decrease 13% sequentially, solely as a result of the late new product introductions and eroding demand from a major Mobility customer. The core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.3% and core earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.60 per deleted share. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to remain at 2.3% revenue in the fourth quarter. We expect selling, general and industry expense to move back to 3% of revenue in fiscal 2012. Research and development costs are expected to be $7 million in the fourth quarter, and tangibles amortization approximately $5 million, stock-based compensation $20 million, finally interest expense, $26 million in the quarter. Based on the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 17%. Our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter are estimated to be approximately $100 million. As I previously noted, a majority of these expenditures associated with investments and diversified manufacturing services. At this point, I'll hand the call over to Tim Main."

The company is exceeding its long-term growth targets since fiscal 2011. We'll post revenue base at the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, roughly a $3 billion growth",1177,"Thank you, Forbes. I'm referring now to Slide 15. The company is exceeding its long-term growth targets since fiscal 2011. We'll post revenue base at the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, roughly a $3 billion growth rate over the previous year. About $500 million of that growth is high velocity, representing about 10% growth rate year-over-year. $800 million will come from the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, representing about an 18% growth rate year-over-year. And looking at the Diversified Manufacturing Services area, healthcare should grow year-over-year by about 31%, Industrial & Clean Tech about 18% and Specialized Services 64%, resulting in overall growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services year-over-year of $1.7 billion or 40%. We're very pleased with this performance. 
Please move to Slide 16. We this growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services in particular, the company believes it is differentiated and resulting in a much more sustainable portfolio of businesses. This chart indicates the progression of the percentage of business of the 3 business areas: High velocity, Enterprise & Infrastructure and Diversified Manufacturing Services over the course of Q1 2010, over the quarter period to the midpoint of guidance for Q4 2011. Our largest segment now and for the past couple of quarters is Diversified Manufacturing Services, which is well on its way to being 45% to 50% of our overall business. And we have a high level of confidence that this will result in a more resilient and sustainable business for our company in the future years. Please turn to Slide 17 year call that stock about diversified manufacturing services a little bit further. Now, we believe are another premium player in the Diversified Manufacturing Services. Look right now, our competitors don't put businesses this way, and we think it's a very rich diversified area for Jabil's differentiation and business model capabilities, and its 33% annual growth rates since fiscal 2009, growing to an almost $6 billion business for us in fiscal 2011. On a stand-alone basis, I think it's interesting to note that on a stand-alone basis, this would be the fastest-growing business and a top 5 player in terms of the North American EMS industry. So we're very happy with the performance of Diversified Manufacturing Services. A lot of questions about how sustainable this is and how differentiated, how can we stay in this type of growth and expectation going forward. Please turn to Slide 18. Let's talk a little bit about differentiation and Diversified Manufacturing Services. In the Materials Technology Group, I think we're uniquely differentiated in materials technology, not only helping that part of our business grow at very rapid rate, is providing excellent synergistic value to targeted markets, such as healthcare and other areas. We believe the strongest player in the Aftermarket Services with excellent depth in our capabilities and we're taking these capabilities and diversifying them into new geographies and markets. In the Healthcare & Instrumentation, we're well beyond the electronic score in healthcare. We're focused on product development and full systems and we're really focused on the high growth areas of customer healthcare. So well beyond the electronics envelope in this business area. And this happens to be a segment where a high mix, high complexity manufacturing is extremely important. And based in our business drives, our success here, we believe that our company is the premier high mix, high complexity manufacturer. Over 70% of our production is produced in quantities of less than 100 and that's for the overall business. And it's certainly much higher mix and higher complexity in the Healthcare & Instrumentation segment on its own. In Industrial & Clean Tech, we're early mover in the Clean Tech business and have broad participation in the entire investor and Clean Tech echo system and our intent is to continue to build on that strength. 
Slide 19, our number one priority as a company is to deliver excellence in customer service. We think we're making progress in that area in our operational performance. Our scale is advancing in targeted markets, believing we have differentiated services and capabilities, focus on lean and productivity allows us to continuously reduce costs to a point where our operating margins and EBITDA margins lead the industry. You can see from the chart on the right that from fiscal '09, core operating margins at 2%. This year, will run the full year fourth quarter be our fifth consecutive quarter of core operating margins above 4%. And at least, our fourth consecutive quarter EBITDA margin is above 6%. In essence, with Jabil, you're getting Tier I scale, with EBITDA margins at 200 basis points above Tier 1 bracket and operating margins that are significantly higher, 50 to 100 basis points higher than our Tier I. So Tier I scale at each player margins. 
Turning to Slide 20, companies increasing cash generation. This is very important. We believe we're in business to produce cash flow for our shareholders and we're moving through an inflection point wherein free cash is deflected and continuing increasing. This free cash flow funds CapEx, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases and such as we've just talked about. I think it's interesting to compare the 9 months ending 5/31 2011 with the 9 months ended 5/31 2010. Cash flow from operations has increased $382 million from $142 million to $524 million. Our free cash flow has gone from a negative $6 million to a positive $226 million. We're well on our way to producing $1 billion in fiscal 2011 and this is starting to accumulate cash, which allows us to do things like share repurchases. And we continue to invest in high-growth areas of our company. 
Slide 21, the results of an improving portfolio mix, a sustainable business model based on differentiation, free cash flow is beginning to produce shareholder return metrics that I think are enviable. Our GAAP return on equity and GAAP return on invested capital are both in the mid20s very consistent with S&P 500 metrics. We do expect free cash flow this year of approximately $330 million based on the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. We will continue to pay approximately $60 million in dividends. And we are in a position really to fund up to a $200 million share repurchase at our discretion over the next year. 
Slide 22, when we look at the population of companies that can put up this type of growth in cash flow and earnings over a long period of time, I think it's interesting to compare us to Fortune 500 companies. Our company's IPO was in 1993 and since our first full year as a public company through 2010, we are one of just 5 Fortune 500 companies that have posted a 16-year company annual growth rate of 25% or better in both revenue, EBITDA and pays regular dividends. We are happy to be in this elite and record-setting group of companies and it's our intent to continue to run the business to be able to produce those types of results over the next few years. Thank you."

So we put that together and are actually very excited about the prospects for fiscal Q1 and we would expect to see margin performance consistent with that. I'm actually pretty pleased that we can get a very, very short-term air pocket and continue to put up 4.2% operating margins. And with that, we've had Japan, we've had the acquisition of the sites in France and Italy, we've had some near-term disruptions from the High Velocity segment.

As we move into the fourth fiscal quarter, given you're sequentially consistent revenue stream at the midpoint of our guidance. We'll continue to see significant free cash flow generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. So the management team and the board saw it appropriate to look at a more holistic way capital structure here and saw an opportunity to put forward a modest share repurchase and help minimize some of the dilution in terms of the share count as we move forward here.

And so I look at it, I think we're on track. We just have a little stronger growth in High Velocity in enterprise infrastructure this year. We'll take that when it comes up and there's some opportunity for us to grow the business. You asked about particular business areas. Very excited about all three. I hate to be such a so nondescript in terms of what areas are strong than others but we have great things going on in healthcare. And if you look at the Healthcare & Instrumentation, there's a very significant resumption in growth in that area in the third fiscal quarter. We are investing significantly in that area, both from an SG&A, product development and new product ramp standpoint. Forbes indicated that a little bit. So in the next few years, we're very excited about that business area. That's a tougher area to grow. It takes more investment, more infrastructure, more focus. The individual program wins tend to be a little bit smaller from a revenue standpoint, and they take a longer time to get into the revenue stream. I think that's consistent with probably the narrative that you heard from some of the other players that have a significant healthcare business. So we're very excited about it. It grew 31%. They're expected to grow 31% based on the midpoint of Q4 guidance in 2011 and continue to be excited about 2012 and 2013. Industrial and healthcare, good growth in 2011 and I expect to get at least consistent growth in 2012, 2013. And then Specialized Services, I think it's been such a huge year of growth in Materials Technology Group. I wouldn't expect to double the size of that group again in 2012, and again in 2013. But I expect it to continue to see growth there and we're looking to create opportunities for additional growth in the Aftermarket Services. We think we have a great solution there. We've grown that business strictly organically and we may turn our attention to ways to accelerate the growth there.

GDP growth in our country was 1.9%, I guess, in the first calendar quarter. If I look at demand patterns, the way customers are behaving today, I don't see any big change. I don't see any big change in Europe, I don't see any big change in North America. Continues to be relatively robust, Latin America continues to be pretty robust. So I'm not see a lot of changes. We absorbed kind of deceleration of GDP growth in the developed world over the course of the first calendar quarter. And I don't know of any significant changes to that kind of tone. And if anything, anecdotally, I'd say that people are becoming a little bit more optimistic about late 2011 and prospects in 2012. I know that doesn't quite square with CNN and particularly Fox but that's kind of the way that I see it in the real world. The healthcare demand is good. Instrumentation demand is okay. Industrial Clean Tech and the other areas seem to be good and diversified manufacturing services. Enterprise infrastructure is a little bit more of a mixed bag for us. We see very good demand in storage and our Telecommunications business seems to be in pretty good shape. And then High Velocity actually, things are okay. And with the exception of the one business area that Forbes mentioned, everything seems to be tracking as planned. So I think we we're in the midst of a slow, somewhat choppy economic recovery that continues to seem sustainable from our vantage point."

So we're trying to provide some help without providing guidance for fiscal Q1. So we're not providing guidance for fiscal Q1. But if you look at the high velocity area, and you can do what you want with the Mobility area of high velocity. If you'd like to assume that it's going to be better than that in the November quarter because of whatever your reasons are, that's great. I think the main point is that's a high level of uncertainty for us and the balance of the high velocity area is actually in very good shape and we would expect normal seasonal patterns to show up in our November quarter. And we would regard that normal seasonal pattern to be something in the nature of 15% to 20% sequential growth in the high velocity segment. Excluding the uncertainty with the customer you talked about. And when you talk about Enterprise & Infrastructure, not necessarily a seasonal area. But we continue to see some growth there. In Diversified Manufacturing Services, we see excellent growth there. No reason to think that growth will slow down. And keep in mind that there is an area of diversified manufacturing services that will probably see a seasonal uptick in the Materials Technology Group. So in any case, that could actually see some acceleration of growth in that area, depending on how other things go."

Not much of a seasonal impact on enterprise infrastructure and diversified manufacturing services tends to be pretty steady.

I would you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the third quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 22.3% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $152.5 million. This compares to $96.5 mil",1178,"Thank you, Beth, and good afternoon, everyone. I would you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the third quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 22.3% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $152.5 million. This compares to $96.5 million of GAAP operating income from revenues of $3.5 billion for the same period in the prior year. 
Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 34.8% to $177.8 million and represents 4.2% revenue. This compares to $131.9 million or 3.8% for the same period in the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 7.6% in the third quarter, while core operating income increased 5.6%. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.58, an increase of 45% over the prior year. 
Please refer to Slides 5 and 6 where for revenue mix and core operating income by each of our segments for the third fiscal quarter. I would also like to remind you that the third fiscal quarter results include a full quarter of results from operations related to the sites we acquired in France and Italy late last quarter. On a comparable sequential basis, these sites impacted the overall gross margin negatively by approximately 15 basis points and core operating income negatively by 20 basis points in the quarter. 
Let's turn into our segments. Our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 9.4% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew 44%. Revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 36% total company revenue in the third quarter. Core operating income expanded sequentially by 10 basis points to 6.2% in the quarter. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 11.8% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 15.5%. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion and represented 33% of total company revenues in the third quarter. Core operating income was 3.9% of revenue. This segment includes the results of operations of the sites we acquired in France and Italy, which had a negative impact of 50 basis points on core operating income for this segment. Without these operating returns, the segment remains at the high end of our overall operating margin targets. The High Velocity segment increased 1.7% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 10%. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 31% of total company revenue in the third quarter. The core operating income was 2.2% of revenue, an expansion of 20 basis points. Our top 10 customers in the quarter accounted for approximately 63% of our revenue. 
And now I'll ask you to refer to slides 7, 8 and 9, which accompany my commentary on elements of our third quarter operating and balance sheet performance. Selling, general and administration expenses were $134.1 million. It represent 3.2% of revenue. Part of the $12 million sequential increase is associated with the operations we acquired in France and Italy. The balance of costs represent costs started faster than we anticipated to support margin growth across our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Research and development costs were $6.5 million in the quarter. Intangibles amortization was $5.2 million, and stock-based compensation was $20.1 million in the quarter. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $26 million, and the tax rate on a net core operating income was 15.2%. 
Our sales cycle in the quarter was consistent with the previous quarter of 11 days, and improved by 5 days from the same period a year ago. Days in inventory decreased by 2 days, while turns remained consistent at 7. Core return on invested capital for the quarter was 28.5%, cash flow from operations was $158.8 million, and cash and cash equivalents were $911.1 million. There are no outstanding balances on our revolver at the end of the third quarter. 
Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $77.3 million and core EBITDA was $255.1 million or 6% of revenue. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $113.6 million, as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support the targeted markets and capabilities. Approximately $71 million was associated with our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, $21 million with Enterprise & Infrastructure, $8 million in High Velocity and $13 million in installation technology and infrastructure. We remain very well-positioned to continue to produce free cash flow within our fourth fiscal quarter and through fiscal '12. And with this in mind, we are pleased to advise that our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million worth of common stock during the next 12 months in open market transactions. 
I'd now like you to refer to Slides 10 and 11. In summary, we are pleased with the results of the third quarter and are extremely well-positioned to meet our overall fiscal '11 goals. In the third quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment represented 36% of company revenue versus 31% for the same period a year ago. Our overall company core operating income margins have expanded from 3.7% to 4.2% over the same period. Capital investments year-to-date and for the fourth quarter have and shall be focused in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. 60% for the full year's capital expenditure investments have been committed to expanding the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, supporting our stated goals to fundamentally shift the revenue and income profile of the company to provide overall sustainable operating performance and free cash flow generation. 
I'd now like to provide you with our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 guidance and ask that you refer to Slides 13 and 14. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 9% from the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase by 7% sequentially, with growth across all areas of business in this segment. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure group are expected to increase by 3% sequentially despite the ongoing wireless networking product ramps, and our High Velocity segment is expected to decrease 13% sequentially, solely as a result of the late new product introductions and eroding demand from a major Mobility customer. Our core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.3%, and core earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.60 per diluted share. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to remain at 3.2% revenue in the fourth quarter. We didn't expect selling, general and administrative expenses to move back to 3% of revenue in fiscal 2012. Research and development costs are estimated to be $7 million in the fourth quarter, and tangibles amortizations approximately $5 million; stock-based compensation $20 million; finally interest expense, $26 million in the quarter. Based on the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 17%. Our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter are estimated to be approximately $100 million. As I previously noted, a majority of these expenditures are associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services. At this point, I'll hand the call over to Tim Main."

The company is exceeding its long-term growth targets since fiscal 2011. We'll post revenue based on the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, roughly a $3 billion growth",1199,"Thank you, Forbes. I'm referring now to Slide 15. The company is exceeding its long-term growth targets since fiscal 2011. We'll post revenue based on the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, roughly a $3 billion growth rate over the previous year. About $500 million of that growth has come in High Velocity, representing about a 10% growth rate year-over-year. $800 million will come from the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, representing about an 18% growth rate year-over-year. And looking at the Diversified Manufacturing Services area, healthcare and its mutation should grow year-over-year about 31%, Industrial & Clean Tech about 18%, and Specialized Services, 64%, resulting in overall growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services year-over-year of $1.7 billion or 40%. We're very pleased with this performance. 
Please move to Slide 16. With this growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, in particular, the company believes it is differentiated and resulting in a much more sustainable portfolio of businesses. This chart indicates the progression of the percentage of business of the 3 business areas: High Velocity, Enterprise & Infrastructure and Diversified Manufacturing Services over the course of Q1 2010 over the 8-quarter period to the midpoint of guidance for Q4 2011. 
Our largest segment now and for the past couple of quarters is Diversified Manufacturing Services, which is well on its way to being 45% to 50% of our overall business, and we have a high levels of confidence that this will result in more resilient and sustainable business for our company in future years. 
Please turn to Slide 17. Let's talk about Diversified Manufacturing Services a little bit further. We believe we're now the premier player in the Diversified Manufacturing Services. Right now, it's that our competitors don't group their businesses this way. We think this is a very rich diversified area for Jabil's differentiation and business model capabilities, and its 33% comp annual growth rates since fiscal 2009, growing to an almost $6 billion business for us in fiscal 2011. 
On a standalone basis, I think it's interesting to note that on a standalone basis, this would be the fastest-growing business and a top 5 player in terms of the North American EMS industry. So we're very happy with the performance of Diversified Manufacturing Services. There's a lot of questions about how sustainable this is and how differentiated, how can we sustain this type of growth and expectation going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 18. Let's talk a little bit about differentiation in Diversified Manufacturing Services. In the Materials Technology Group, I think we're uniquely differentiated in materials technology, not only helping that part of our business grow at very rapid rates, it's providing excellent synergistic value to targeted markets, such as healthcare and other areas. We believe we're the strongest player in the Aftermarket Services with excellent depth and our capabilities, and we're taking these capabilities and diversifying into new geographies and markets. 
In Healthcare & Instrumentation, we're well beyond the electronics core in healthcare. We're focused on product development and full systems, and we're really focusing on the high-growth areas of healthcare. It's well beyond the electronics envelope in this business area, and this happens to be a segment where a high mix, high complexity manufacturing is extremely important. And based in our business size and our success here, we believe that our company is the premier high-mix, high-complexity manufacturer. Over 70% of our production is produced in large quantities of less than 100, and that's for the overall business. And it's certainly much higher mix and higher complexity in the Healthcare & Instrumentation segment on its own. 
In Industrial & Clean Tech, we're early mover in the Clean Tech business and have broad participation in the entire investor and Clean Tech ecosystem, and our intent is to continue to build on that strength. 
Slide 19. Our number one priority as a company is to deliver excellence in customer service. We think we're making progress in that area in our operational performance. Our scale is advancing in targeted markets. We believing we have differentiated services and capabilities, focused on Lean and productivity. It allows us to continuously reduce costs to a point where our operating margins and EBITDA margins lead the industry. 
You can see from the chart on the right that from fiscal '09, our core operating margins at 2% this year. We'll run the full year, it will be our -- in the fourth quarter, it will be our fifth consecutive quarter of core operating margins above 4%. And at least, our fourth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margin is above 6%. In essence, with Jabil, you're getting Tier 1 scale, with EBITDA margins at 200 basis points above the Tier 1 bracket, and operating margins that are significantly higher, 50 to 100 basis points higher than our Tier 1 brothers [ph]. So Tier 1 scale at niche-player margins. 
Turning to Slide 20, the company is increasing cash generation. This is very important. We believe we're in business to produce cash flow for our shareholders, and we're moving through an inflection point wherein free cash is expected to continue increasing. This free cash flow funds CapEx, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, such as we've just -- as Forbes has just talked about. I think it's interesting to compare the 9 months ending 5/31/2011 with the 9 months ended 5/31/2010. Cash flow from operations has increased $380 million from $142 million to $524 million. Our free cash flow has gone from a negative $96 million to a positive $226 million. We're well on the way to producing $1 billion of EBITDA in fiscal 2011 and this is starting to accumulate cash, which allows us to do things like do share repurchases and continue to invest in high-growth areas of our company. 
Slide 21. The results of an improving portfolio mix, a sustainable business model based on differentiation, free cash flow is beginning to produce shareholder return metrics that I think are enviable. Our GAAP return on equity and GAAP return on invested capital are both in the mid-20s, very consistent with S&P 500 metrics. We do expect free cash flow this year of approximately $330 million based on the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. We will continue to pay approximately $60 million in dividends. I mean, we are in a position where we can fund up to a $200 million share repurchase at our discretion over the next year. 
Slide 22. When we look at the population of companies that can put up this type of growth in cash flow and earnings over a long period of time, I think it's interesting to compare us to Fortune 500 companies. Our company's IPO was in 1993, and since our first full year as a public company through 2010, we are one of just 5 Fortune 500 companies that have posted a 16-year comp annual growth rate of 25% or better in both revenue, EBITDA and pays regular dividends. We're happy to be in this elite and record-setting group of companies, and it's our intent to continue to run the business to be able to produce those types of results over the next few years. Thank you."

And we don't see any reason why High Velocity would not exhibit its normal seasonal pattern of high growth in fiscal Q1, excluding the impact of a major mobility customer in the High Velocity area. So we put that together, and we were actually very excited about the prospects for fiscal Q1 and would expect to see margin performance consistent with that. I'm actually pretty pleased that we can get a very, very short-term air pocket and continue to put up 4.2% operating margins. And we've had the Japan, we've had the acquisition of the sites in France and Italy, we've had some near-term disruptions from the High Velocity segment, and the company is still turning pretty good numbers.

We saw a second sequential of some significant cash flow from operations this quarter, free cash flows are being generated year-to-date after capital expenditures and the dividends payment of $45 million, somewhere in the region of $200 million of free cash flow had generated through the 9 months today. As we move into the fourth fiscal quarter, given our sequentially consistent revenue stream at the midpoint of our guidance, we will continue to see some significant free cash flow generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. So the management team and our Board, we saw it's appropriate to look at it in a more holistic way capital structure here, and I saw an opportunity to put forward a modest share repurchase and help minimize some of the dilution in terms of the share count as we move forward here. But as we look into fiscal '12, we continue to see significant cash flow generation and allow us to fund internally our growth, be that organically or with some modest investments and acquisitions."

Enterprise & Infrastructure will be up 18% for the year. High Velocity will be up 10% for the year, and if they moderate to the long-term growth targets of 5% to 10% and we continue to deliver 20% to 30% growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, we should end up right about where we sat in the analyst meeting in the first week of May, that by 2013, our Diversified Manufacturing Services would end up at around 45% of our business. And so, I look at it, I think we're on track. We just had a little stronger growth in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure this year. We'll take that when it comes up, and there's opportunity for us to grow the business. You asked about, particularly, business areas. We're very excited about all 3. I hate to be such a so-nondescript in terms of what areas are stronger than others, but we have great things going on in healthcare. And if you look at the Healthcare & Instrumentation, there's a very significant resumption in growth in that area in the third fiscal quarter. We are investing significantly in that area, both from an SG&A, product development and new product ramp standpoint. Forbes indicated that a little bit. So over the next few years, we're very excited about that business area. That's a tougher area to grow. It takes more investments, more infrastructure, more focus. The individual program wins tend to be a little bit smaller from a revenue standpoint, and they take a longer time to get into the revenue stream. I think that's consistent with probably the narrative that you heard from some of the other players that have a significant Healthcare business though. So we're very excited about it. It grew 31%. They're expected to grow 31% based on the midpoint of Q4 guidance in 2011 and continue to be excited about 2012 and 2013. Industrial & Healthcare, good growth in 2011 and I expect to get, at least, consistent growth in 2012, 2013. And then Specialized Services, I think it's been such a huge year of growth in the Materials Technology Group. I wouldn't expect to double the size of that group again in 2012 and again in 2013, but I expect it to continue to see growth there and we're looking to create opportunities for additional growth in the Aftermarket Services. We think we have a great solution there. We've grown that business strictly organically, and we may turn our attention to ways to accelerate the growth there. So we expect all 3 business areas to contribute, and we feel like we're right on track to have Diversified Manufacturing Services end up at 45% to 50% of our business by the time we get into 2013 timeframe."

I know that doesn't quite square with CNN, and particularly Fox, but that's kind of the way that I see it in the real world. So our healthcare demand is good. Instrumentation demand is okay. Industrial Clean Tech and the other areas seem to be good and Diversified Manufacturing Services. Enterprise & Infrastructure is a little bit more of a mixed bag for us. We see very good demand in Storage, and our Telecommunications business seems to be in pretty good shape. And then High Velocity, actually, things are okay.

I would ask you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the third quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 22.3% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $152.5 million. This compares to $96.5",1177,"Thank you, Beth, and good afternoon, everyone. I would ask you to refer to Slides 3 and 4. Net revenue for the third quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 22.3% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $152.5 million. This compares to $96.5 million of GAAP operating income from revenues of $3.5 billion for the same period in the prior year. 
Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 34.8% to $177.8 million and represents 4.2% revenue. This compares to $131.9 million or 3.8% for the same period in the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 7.6% in the third quarter, while core operating income increased 5.6%. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.58, an increase of 45% over the prior year. 
Please refer to Slides 5 and 6 where revenue mix and core operating income by each of our segments for the third fiscal quarter. I would also like to remind you that the third fiscal quarter results include a full quarter of results from operations related to the sites we acquired in France and Italy late last quarter. On a comparable sequential basis, these sites impacted the overall gross margin negatively by approximately 15 basis points and core operating income negatively by 20 basis points in the quarter. 
Let's turn into our segments. Our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 9.4% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew 44%. Revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 36% total company revenue in the third quarter. Core operating income expanded sequentially by 10 basis points to 6.2% in the quarter. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 11.8% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 15.5%. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion and represented 33% of total company revenues in the third quarter. Core operating income was 3.9% of revenue. This segment includes the results of operations of the sites we acquired in France and Italy, which had a negative impact of 50 basis points on core operating income for this segment. Without these operating returns, the segment remains at the high end of our overall operating margin targets. The High Velocity segment increased 1.7% sequentially. On a yearly basis, this segment grew by 10%. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 31% of total company revenue in the third quarter. The core operating income was 2.2% of revenue, an expansion of 20 basis points. Our top 10 customers in the quarter accounted for approximately 63% of our revenue. 
And now I'll ask you to refer to slides 7, 8 and 9, which accompany my commentary on elements of our third quarter operating and balance sheet performance. Selling, general and administration expenses were $134.1 million. It represent 3.2% of revenue. Part of the $12 million sequential increase is associated with the operations we acquired in France and Italy. The balance of costs represent costs started faster than we anticipated to support margin growth across our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Research and development costs were $6.5 million in the quarter. Intangibles amortization was $5.2 million, and stock-based compensation was $20.1 million in the quarter. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $26 million, and the tax rate on net core operating income was 15.2%.  
Our sales cycle in the quarter was consistent with the previous quarter of 11 days, and improved by 5 days from the same period a year ago. Days in inventory decreased by 2 days, while turns remained consistent at 7. Core return on invested capital for the quarter was 28.5%, cash flow from operations was $158.8 million, and cash and cash equivalents were $911.1 million. There are no outstanding balances on our revolver at the end of the third quarter. 
Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $77.3 million and core EBITDA was $255.1 million or 6% of revenue. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $113.6 million, as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support the targeted markets and capabilities. Approximately $71 million was associated with our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, $21 million with Enterprise & Infrastructure, $8 million in High Velocity and $13 million in installation technology and infrastructure. We remain very well-positioned to continue to produce free cash flow within our fourth fiscal quarter and through fiscal '12. And with this in mind, we are pleased to advise that our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million worth of common stock during the next 12 months in open market transactions. 
I'd now like you to refer to Slides 10 and 11. In summary, we are pleased with the results of the third quarter and are extremely well-positioned to meet our overall fiscal '11 goals. In the third quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment represented 36% of company revenue versus 31% for the same period a year ago. Our overall company core operating income margins have expanded from 3.7% to 4.2% over the same period. Capital investments year-to-date and for the fourth quarter have and shall be focused in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. 60% for the full year's capital expenditure investments have been committed to expanding the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, supporting our stated goals to fundamentally shift the revenue and income profile of the company to provide overall sustainable operating performance and free cash flow generation. 
I'd now like to provide you with our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 guidance and ask that you refer to Slides 13 and 14. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 9% from the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase by 7% sequentially, with growth across all areas of business in this segment. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure group are expected to increase by 3% sequentially despite the ongoing wireless networking product ramps, and our High Velocity segment is expected to decrease 13% sequentially, solely as a result of the late new product introductions and eroding demand from a major Mobility customer. Our core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.3%, and core earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.60 per diluted share. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to remain at 3.2% revenue in the fourth quarter. We didn't expect selling, general and administrative expenses to move back to 3% of revenue in fiscal 2012. Research and development costs are estimated to be $7 million in the fourth quarter, and tangibles amortizations approximately $5 million; stock-based compensation $20 million; finally interest expense, $26 million in the quarter. Based on the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 17%. Our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter are estimated to be approximately $100 million. As I previously noted, a majority of these expenditures are associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services. At this point, I'll hand the call over to Tim Main."

The company is exceeding its long-term growth targets since fiscal 2011. We'll post revenue based on the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, roughly a $3 billion growth",1199,"Thank you, Forbes. I'm referring now to Slide 15. The company is exceeding its long-term growth targets since fiscal 2011. We'll post revenue based on the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, roughly a $3 billion growth rate over the previous year. About $500 million of that growth has come in High Velocity, representing about a 10% growth rate year-over-year. $800 million will come from the Enterprise Infrastructure area, representing about an 18% growth rate year-over-year. And looking at the Diversified Manufacturing Services area, healthcare and its mutation should grow year-over-year about 31%, Industrial & Clean Tech about 18%, and Specialized Services, 64%, resulting in overall growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services year-over-year of $1.7 billion or 40%. We're very pleased with this performance. 
Please move to Slide 16. With this growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, in particular, the company believes it is differentiated and resulting in a much more sustainable portfolio of businesses. This chart indicates the progression of the percentage of business of the 3 business areas: High Velocity, Enterprise & Infrastructure and Diversified Manufacturing Services over the course of Q1 2010 over the 8-quarter period to the midpoint of guidance for Q4 2011. 
Our largest segment now and for the past couple of quarters is Diversified Manufacturing Services, which is well on its way to being 45% to 50% of our overall business, and we have a high levels of confidence that this will result in more resilient and sustainable business for our company in future years. 
Please turn to Slide 17. Let's talk about Diversified Manufacturing Services a little bit further. We believe we're now the premier player in the Diversified Manufacturing Services. Right now, it's that our competitors don't group their businesses this way. We think this is a very rich diversified area for Jabil's differentiation and business model capabilities, and its 33% comp annual growth rates since fiscal 2009, growing to an almost $6 billion business for us in fiscal 2011. 
On a standalone basis, I think it's interesting to note that on a standalone basis, this would be the fastest-growing business and a top 5 player in terms of the North American EMS industry. So we're very happy with the performance of Diversified Manufacturing Services. There's a lot of questions about how sustainable this is and how differentiated, how can we sustain this type of growth and expectation going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 18. Let's talk a little bit about differentiation in Diversified Manufacturing Services. In the Materials Technology Group, I think we're uniquely differentiated in materials technology, not only is that helping that part of our business grow at very rapid rates, it's providing excellent synergistic value to targeted markets, such as healthcare and other areas. We believe we're the strongest player in the Aftermarket Services with excellent depth and our capabilities, and we're taking these capabilities and diversifying into new geographies and markets. 
In Healthcare & Instrumentation, we're well beyond the electronics core in healthcare. We're focused on product development and full systems, and we're really focusing on the high-growth areas of healthcare. It's well beyond the electronics envelope in this business area, and this happens to be a segment where a high mix, high complexity manufacturing is extremely important. And based in our business size and our success here, we believe that our company is the premier high-mix, high-complexity manufacturer. Over 70% of our production is produced in large quantities of less than 100, and that's for the overall business. And it's certainly much higher mix and higher complexity in the Healthcare & Instrumentation segment on its own. 
In Industrial & Clean Tech, we're early mover in the Clean Tech business and have broad participation in the entire investor and Clean Tech ecosystem, and our intent is to continue to build on that strength. 
Slide 19. Our number one priority as a company is to deliver excellence in customer service. We think we're making progress in that area in our operational performance. Our scale is advancing in targeted markets. We believing we have differentiated services and capabilities, focused on Lean and productivity. It allows us to continuously reduce costs to a point where our operating margins and EBITDA margins lead the industry. 
You can see from the chart on the right that from fiscal '09, our core operating margins at 2% this year. We'll run the full year, it will be our -- in the fourth quarter, it will be our fifth consecutive quarter of core operating margins above 4%. And at least, our fourth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margin is above 6%. In essence, with Jabil, you're getting Tier 1 scale, with EBITDA margins at 200 basis points above the Tier 1 bracket, and operating margins that are significantly higher, 50 to 100 basis points higher than our Tier 1 brother. So Tier 1 scale at niche-player margins. 
Turning to Slide 20, the company is increasing cash generation. This is very important. We believe we're in business to produce cash flow for our shareholders, and we're moving through an inflection point wherein free cash is expected to continue increasing. This free cash flow funds CapEx, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, such as we've just -- as Forbes has just talked about. I think it's interesting to compare the 9 months ending 5/31/2011 with the 9 months ended 5/31/2010. Cash flow from operations has increased $380 million from $142 million to $524 million. Our free cash flow has gone from a negative $96 million to a positive $226 million. We're well on the way to producing $1 billion of EBITDA in fiscal 2011 and this is starting to accumulate cash, which allows us to do things like do share repurchases and continue to invest in high-growth areas of our company. 
Slide 21. The results of an improving portfolio mix, a sustainable business model based on differentiation, free cash flow is beginning to produce shareholder return metrics that I think are enviable. Our GAAP return on equity and GAAP return on invested capital are both in the mid-20s, very consistent with S&P 500 metrics. We do expect free cash flow this year of approximately $330 million based on the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. We will continue to pay approximately $60 million in dividends. I mean, we are in a position where we can fund up to a $200 million share repurchase at our discretion over the next year. 
Slide 22. When we look at the population of companies that can put up this type of growth in cash flow and earnings over a long period of time, I think it's interesting to compare us to Fortune 500 companies. Our company's IPO was in 1993, and since our first full year as a public company through 2010, we are one of just 5 Fortune 500 companies that have posted a 16-year comp annual growth rate of 25% or better in both revenue, EBITDA and pays regular dividends. We're happy to be in this elite and record-setting group of companies, and it's our intent to continue to run the business to be able to produce those types of results over the next few years. Thank you."

And we don't see any reason why High Velocity would not exhibit its normal seasonal pattern of high growth in fiscal Q1, excluding the impact of a major mobility customer in the High Velocity area. So we put that together, and we were actually very excited about the prospects for fiscal Q1 and would expect to see margin performance consistent with that. I'm actually pretty pleased that we can get a very, very short-term air pocket and continue to put up 4.2% operating margins. And we've had Japan, we've had the acquisition of the sites in France and Italy, we've had some near-term disruptions from the High Velocity segment, and then the company is still turning pretty good numbers.

We saw a second sequential of some significant cash flow from operations this quarter, free cash flows are being generated year-to-date after capital expenditures and the dividends payment of $45 million, somewhere in the region of $200 million of free cash flow had generated through the 9 months today. As we move into the fourth fiscal quarter, given our sequentially consistent revenue stream at the midpoint of our guidance, we will continue to see some significant free cash flow generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. So as the management team and as our Board, we saw it's appropriate to look at it in a more holistic way capital structure here, and I saw an opportunity to put forward a modest share repurchase and help minimize some of the dilution in terms of the share count as we move forward here. But as we look into fiscal '12, we continue to see significant cash flow generation and allow us to fund internally our growth, be that organically or with some modest investments and acquisitions."

So at this rate, you'll be somewhat short of your 45% goal for the full year of 2013 unless the pace of those accelerates.

Enterprise & Infrastructure will be up 18% for the year. High Velocity will be up 10% for the year, and if they moderate to the long-term growth targets of 5% to 10% and we continue to deliver 20% to 30% growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, we should end up right about where we sat in the analyst meeting in the first week of May, that by 2013, our Diversified Manufacturing Services would end up at around 45% of our business. And so, I look at it, I think we're on track. We just had a little stronger growth in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure this year. We'll take that when it comes up, and there's opportunity for us to grow the business. You asked about, particularly, business areas. We're very excited about all 3. I hate to be such a so-nondescript in terms of what areas are stronger than others, but we have great things going on in healthcare. And if you look at the Healthcare & Instrumentation, there's a very significant resumption in growth in that area in the third fiscal quarter. We are investing significantly in that area, both from an SG&A, product development and new program ramp standpoint. Forbes indicated that a little bit. So over the next few years, we're very excited about that business area. That's a tougher area to grow. It takes more investments, more infrastructure, more focus. The individual program wins are tend to be a little bit smaller from a revenue standpoint, and they take a longer time to get into the revenue stream. I think that's consistent with probably the narrative that you heard from some of the other players that have a significant Healthcare business though. So we're very excited about it. It grew 31%. They're expected to grow 31% based on the midpoint of Q4 guidance in 2011 and continue to be excited about 2012 and 2013. Industrial & Healthcare, good growth in 2011 and I expect to get, at least, consistent growth in 2012, 2013. And then Specialized Services, I think it's been such a huge year of growth in Materials Technology Group. I wouldn't expect to double the size of that group again in 2012 and again in 2013, but I expect it to continue to see growth there and we're looking to create opportunities for additional growth in the Aftermarket Services. We think we have a great solution there. We've grown that business strictly organically, and we may turn our attention to ways to accelerate the growth there. So we expect all 3 business areas to contribute, and we feel like we're right on track to have Diversified Manufacturing Services end up at 45% to 50% of our business by the time we get into 2013 timeframe."

When I think about the overall macro environment, I mean, just generally a note, I apologize if these statements are so general, if they're worthless. I think they're valuable, GDP growth in our country was 1.9%, I guess, in the first calendar quarter. If I look at demand patterns and the way customers are behaving today, I don't see any big change. And I don't see any big change in Europe, I don't see any big change in North America. I think Asia continues to be relatively robust, Latin America continues to be pretty robust. So I'm not seeing a lot of changes. I mean, we absorbed the kind of deceleration of GDP growth in the developed world over the course of the first calendar quarter. And I don't know of any significant changes to that kind of tone. And if anything, anecdotally, I'd say that people are becoming a little bit more optimistic about late 2011 and prospects in 2012. I know that doesn't quite square with CNN, and particularly Fox, but that's kind of the way that I see it in the real world. So our healthcare demand is good. Instrumentation demand is okay. Industrial Clean Tech and the other areas seem to be good and Diversified Manufacturing Services. Enterprise & Infrastructure is a little bit more of a mixed bag for us. We see very good demand in Storage, and our Telecommunications business seems to be in pretty good shape. And then High Velocity, actually, things are okay. And with the exception of the one business area that Forbes mentioned, everything seems to be tracking as planned.

I will take this one. We've been very happy with the progression and performance in High Velocity, and I think that comes down to a lot of the focus we put on Lean activities and efficiencies in manufacturing. So a lot of effort has gone into that. Basically, for the last year, where this whole High Velocity arena was the low-targeted margins. And as you point out, it's a difficult business to manage for the volatility that one sees in this area. But with the processes we have in place, our real focus in terms of Lean activity and Six Sigma processes, it's bringing it home into the targeted ranges."

Our printing relationship is in great shape, and we do a lot of set-top boxes and point-of-sale systems, and we've actually been pretty pleased with those customer relationships and our ability to execute. So as Forbes said, it's really fundamentally about better execution and not wasting a lot of time and effort on suboptimized relationships in areas of the business that represent waste. So it's primarily an execution, an improvement in execution is responsible for the improvement of almost 100 basis points of margin in that area year-over-year."

I think the main point is that's a high level of uncertainty for us, and the balance of the High Velocity area is actually in very good shape, and we would expect normal seasonal patterns to show up in our November quarter. And we would regard that normal seasonal pattern to be something in the nature of 15% to 20% sequential growth in the High Velocity segment, excluding the uncertainty with the customer you talked about. And when you talk about Enterprise & Infrastructure, not necessarily a seasonal area, but we continue to see some growth there. In Diversified Manufacturing Services, we've seen excellent growth there. No reason to think that growth will slow down. And keep in mind that there is an area of Diversified Manufacturing Services that will probably see a seasonal uptick in the Materials Technology Group.

This compares to $103 million of GAAP",1327,"Thank you, Beth, and hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Net revenue for the fourth quarter is $4.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $165.6 million or 3.9% of revenue. This compares to $103 million of GAAP operating income and revenues of $3.9 million or 2.7% for the same period in the prior year. Core For operating income excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 19% to $187.2 million and represents 4.4% of revenue. This compares with $157 million or 4.1% for the same period in the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Our core operating income increased 5%. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 19% over the prior year. 
And I'll ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2011, net revenue was $16.5 billion, an increase of 23%. GAAP operating income was $578.7 million, an increase of 77% and represented 3.5% of revenue. This compares to $327.6 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $13.4 billion for fiscal 2010 and 2.4% of revenue.
Core operating income excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 46% to $715.2 million and represented 4.3% of revenue for the full fiscal year. This compares to $490.9 million or 3.7% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.34, an increase of 54% for the prior year. 
And I'll ask you to turn to Slide 5 for our segment discussion. In the fourth quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 10% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 35%. Revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 40% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.7% of revenue. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 10% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion that represented 32% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 2.6% of revenue. The decline in core operating margin this quarter is primarily attributable to license we were taking to restructure operations in Italy specifically the severance cost, asset writeoffs and other related charges of approximately $8 million. The balance of the decline in operating performance was attributed to the sequential increase in the losses in Italy and infrastructure readiness for ongoing wireless program ramps in non-Western European geographies.
So we move to fiscal '12, the continued ramp-up of the new programs around the world will continue, diluting the negative impact of operating results in Western Europe. We therefore expect margins in this segment to slightly improve over the course of the fiscal year and core operating margin targets between 4% and 4.5% when we move back. 
Our strategy tractions, we expect our routine of our infrastructure will be ongoing and absorb the operating earnings as we have done in the fourth fiscal quarter. We do not expect any future actions to be material enough to be disruptive to our operations as we expected margins performance of the company overall.
Our High Velocity segment decreased 9% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment decreased 11% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of the total company revenue in this quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 3.1% of revenue. The sequential increase in core operating margin, a result of a more favorable mix with revenues and the successful implementation of lean initiatives. 
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of segment performance on a yearly basis. For fiscal year 2011, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 43%. Revenue was approximately $6 billion representing 36% of total company revenue and core operating income was 6.5% of the revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 18% in fiscal 2011. Revenue was approximately $5.2 million, representing 32% of total company revenue. And core operating income was 3.9% for the full year. The High Velocity segment grew 11%. Revenue was approximately $5.3 billion, 32% total company revenue and core operating income was 2.4% for the full year.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 7 for the following discussion. We are very pleased with our fiscal 2011 performance. Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated and sustainable manner has resulted in a sustainable portfolio and income mix change to our business. Over the course of the first fiscal quarter of 2010 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment has grown from 29% to 40% of company revenues. Our High Velocity segment has fallen from 40% to 28% of overall revenues. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment remained at 32% of overall revenue. Executing this strategy has also delivered core operating income expansion from 3.4% to 4.4% over the same time frame. In fiscal '11, the resulting mix in revenue contributed to margin expansion from 3.7% to 4.3%.
Our investments in the fiscal year we'll remain focused for Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Approximately 60% of the investments were made in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, 11% in Enterprise & Infrastructure and 8% in High Velocity. The balance being IT and infrastructure current and planned future growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 11, our capital returns in fiscal 2011 are exceptional and the year-on-year revenue grew 23%. The rest of the year with a GAAP return on invested capital of 26%, EBITDA in excess of $1 billion or 6.1% of revenue. Our earnings growth and focused balance sheet management had allowed us to produce very sound cash flows, producing $304 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, $828 million for the full fiscal year resulting in a free cash flow yield of some 40% exceeding the target we've established at the beginning of the fiscal year. The strong cash flows had also allowed us to return to $260 million to shareholders and stock repurchases and our ongoing dividend payment. We entered fiscal 2012 with position of strength. Our balance sheet conditions strategic flexibility, core continued growth as we continue to invest our manufacturing services towards 50% of our overall revenue stream. It's also important to note that fiscal '11 performance continues the production of quality earnings amongst our peer group, with Jabil producing positive GAAP earnings 9 years out of 10 years through the end of fiscal '10. Looking ahead in 2012, we expect continued growth. 
First fiscal 2012 guidance can be found on Slides 14 and 15. We expect the revenue in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to be up approximately 8% on a range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we expect it to increase 3% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we expected to be consistent and our High Velocity segment, we expect it to increase 6% sequentially, representing seasonality in the past years as a result of continued diversification of our business model. Core operating income is estimated to be the range of $185 million to $205 million and the core operating margin in a range of 4.3% to 4.5%. While core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per diluted share based upon the diluted share count of 213 million shares. We become the estimates of production and tax rate on core operating income we expect it to be 17% quarter in the full fiscal year.
We anticipate leaving the first quarter we should complete the acquisition of Telmar Network Technology, continuing our strategy of diversification and growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our capital expenditures and acquisition of Telmar are estimated to be $225 million in the quarter. The majority of these capital expenditures are associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services and the associated IT infrastructure. 
At this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Tim Main. Tim?"

The growth",1014,"Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we are very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and about the customers on how we differentiated services capabilities. The growth is particularly gratifying given the fact that we operated for 3 quarters of the fiscal year with a GDP growth at very low levels. Now some estimated Jabil's a cyclical business, and I think the evidence indicates the opposite. Please turn to Slide 17. 
In fact, since 2008 Jabil's compounded annual growth rate EPS was ninth among Fortune 500 companies with over $15 billion in revenue. If you really look at results, it is a bit stunning, and I have a lot of people asking, Tim, if it isn't business cycle, your big customers or the latest products, what is it? Well, I think it would be an oversupply of patient distributed results full solely on our exposure to growth markets. Please turn to Slide 18. 
In fact, they can to be to our story is our culture of continuous improvement, with Blitz Kaizen Events. Of 14,000 events this, year we have 3,000 people enrolled in Lean Six Sigma Education programs. We significantly expanded our human development and leadership training resources. We have developed and employed proprietary global logistics and planning tools around the world, significantly increasing the depth of our critical product engineering capability in key areas, and we continued to invest in our IT infrastructure in 1 of the 2  companies in the world that I've ever come across actually operate a company of this size S&P around the world, and that gives us some very key strategic advantages. 
Now let's take a look at our 3 business areas with a little bit more color. Please turn to Slide 19. In High Velocity, it's really about staying ahead of the game and we do this by having a hyperactive focus on cost. Rapid development of new technology, approaches and locations really keeps us lean and moving to the right locations in the world. The business areas is continuously providing synergy to high-growth areas like health care, which we talked about many times in the past, and it is an asset like business that generates free cash flow to help repurchase shares in front expansion of other areas of our business. In margin performance in this area has been good all year and well within our targeted range of actually above our targeted range in most recent quarters.
Please turn to Slide 20. In the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, we do operate at the higher end of the product and service complexity. Our customers have continuously challenged with an ever-expanding number of new countries the pliers order configurations services they must provide to their customers and delivering it in different countries all over the world. Our job is to really provide simplification of this web of complexity, and we do this through engineering to see you we product development a of our products today that we are shifting in a collaborative way; superb manufacturing of very complex products and low-cost locations around the world; proprietary planning tools that help our customers balance the demand and supply, which becomes exceedingly difficult in today's environment. We have more locations. We have scale. We have more capability than our competition and we have the ability to deploy plug ‘n play systems around the world and top order capabilities in places like Brazil and Russia.
Please turn to Slide 21. At Diversified Manufacturing services, we're really there to make a difference, make a difference to patients, to the environment, to help our customers products more attractive, more functional and then help make user expense better through aftermarket support. We do this in the Material Technology Group, which is a big part of our growth story this year, and this group continues to provide synergistic value to targeted markets, typically health care. Aftermarket Services an area of great opportunity for us and we've recently made an acquisition we hope to close later this quarter, and we expect to see more growth from this group in coming years. Healthcare & Instrumentation is particularly an attractive area for us and we've expanded our ability to help our product, our customers design develop and deploy their products around the world and we're moving from electronics to non-electronic areas as well. In industrial and Clean Tech, we're an early mover in have some significant advantages in this area. And our business is getting a brother capable of the reputation as we look forward to a bright future in this business area for many years to come. 
Turn to Slide 22, please. So putting it all together this is what I think our business is about. It is about the hot product to bring customer the timing the business cycle. What I look at the landscape our customers are doing business in a will that is going through very rapid change, the world in which 80% of global GDP growth was generated in developing economies. Where our customers are what they do and how they do has been a constant state of change and challenge. In managing the business, where its customers, global, urbanizing resource world is a top for our customers. Where we do, we just make it easier. Jabil does every day to make it easier for our customers to be successful in growth markets, making it easier for customers to develop, have made deliver and service products around the world. Now we think the demand for this value proposition has been strong and will continue to be strong across more markets for many years to come, actually what I think is the business is about and conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everybody that there is in attendance, and you can refer to the appendix for some more detailed information regarding metrics and other information that we typically provide on conference calls. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think growth in the March quarter was less than 1 point, in the June quarter, about a point. In September quarter, I can imagine it being much above 1 point. I don't see European GDP growth is much on Europe, that's teetering on the edge of recession to I think that covers around 60% of the world's economy, and we put our 23% revenue growth and that type of environment. So a remarkable thing to me is how with little the macroeconomic environment matters to the company's results over the course of the year. I think as we move into 2012, I think we will be a little bit conservative in the level of growth we could put up consecutively after having such a robust 2011 but a year in which we think Diversified Manufacturing Services has the ability to grow its range maybe at the low end of the range but certainly within the targeted launch of growth ranges. And in pricing infrastructure we expect level performance. In the High Velocity, we'll see what consumer trends are over the course of the year, and we think it's a good set of conditions right now to be conservative. And it's not all bad if revenue growth slows off 23% to 10-ish%. That's not a big deal to the company and given some opportunity to really drive margin expansion and EPS growth in 2012, so kind of like the environment."

And then, Diversified Manufacturing Services I mean we really have a combination of internal manufacturing that's being externalized. You have some very valuable services that Jabil provides an access to emerging economies, product development localizing supply chains, and this is an area of activity that we do see very robust demand from health care customers and industrial customers. We've got our Clean Tech business very strong position and Materials Technology Group continues to do very well.

So it's in revenue at think cost of goods sold and it's SG&A, and that has been settled expanded over the last few years and our level of confidence has dramatically increased in the last few  years. We've got a lot of infrastructure in places like enterprise storage, in places like health care, in places like design for manufacturability and value engineering, which is used by virtually all customers in some level. So design is touching almost every single relationship we have in important ways and particularly important in health care and in the enterprise storage markets. So I think part of it is missing for investors frankly is that our spending this area is $85 million to $100 million and we have a very very rapidly increasing engineering headcount and a rapidly capability. The customers are paying us for this and that's a really good sign. And in terms of R&D is what it is specifically categorized as R&D under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles rules and that stuff as we plan on our own for which we expect no return capitalization from customers. We'll continue to do that at some level because we think that's important for us to stay in front of the product development cycle and keep our expertise advanced.

The last quarter's conference call, we indicated that we're 1 of the 15 companies that have grown revenue EBITDA 25% on a compound annual growth rate since going public in 1993. So from 1994 through 2010, there were very, very elite group of companies that have been able to sustain that kind of growth, and you can talk all you want about 90-day time windows and what's happening on the margins. You can't grow 25% for 18 years or 16 years, whatever that is, if you're reliant on macroeconomic growth. You have to be developing new markets and opportunities and through all the free cash implementations and aging processes and that crisis is and everything else our business has come out and made a pretty darn good business and helping customers across the world manage complexity and showing customers that it's really viable for them to let us manage making this stuff for them. And when we look at the world and even going forward, that's really what our growth is premised on. So when we really analyze this carefully a few years ago, I think we came up with a metric that's 80% of our growth which really is a kind of new customers market share gains, organic growth with different customers, expanding services, and the balance of it was really attributable to what's happening in the secular growth trend of electronics customers and macroeconomic and that kind of thing. So I'm not here to say that we're immune to rapid abrupt contractions in economic activity. That affects everybody in the world. But in a relatively benign stop-catch type of market, this is the business that can grow on well above the S&P 500 in 18 years."

I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Net revenue for the fourth quarter is $4.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $165.6 million or 3.9% of revenue. This compares to $103 million of GAAP",1353,"Thank you, Beth, and hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Net revenue for the fourth quarter is $4.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $165.6 million or 3.9% of revenue. This compares to $103 million of GAAP operating income and revenues of $3.9 billion or 2.7% for the same period in the prior year. Core operating income excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 19% to $187.2 million and represents 4.4% of revenue. This compares with $157 million or 4.1% for the same period in the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Our core operating income increased 5%. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 19% over the prior year. 
And I'll ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2011, net revenue was $16.5 billion, an increase of 23%. GAAP operating income was $578.7 million, an increase of 77% and represented 3.5% of revenue. This compares to $327.6 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $13.4 billion for fiscal 2010 and 2.4% of revenue.
Core operating income excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 46% to $715.2 million and represented 4.3% of revenue for the full fiscal year. This compares to $490.9 million or 3.7% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.34, an increase of 54% over the prior year. 
And I'll ask you to turn to Slide 5 for our segment discussion. In the fourth quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 10% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 35%. Revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 40% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.7% of revenue. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 10% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion representing 32% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 2.6% of revenue. The decline in core operating margin this quarter is primarily attributable to license we were taking to restructure our operations in Italy, specifically severance cost, asset write-offs and other related charges of approximately $8 million. The balance of the decline in operating performance was attributed to the sequential increase in losses in Italy and infrastructure readiness for ongoing wireless program ramps in non-Western European geographies.
As we move to fiscal '12, the continued ramp-up of the new programs around the world will continue, diluting the negative impact of operating results in Western Europe. We, therefore, expect margins in this segment to slightly improve over the course of the fiscal year and core operating margin targets between 4% and 4.5% remain intact. 
As for any future actions, we expect a routine tailoring of our infrastructure will be ongoing and absorbed through operating earnings as we have done in the fourth fiscal quarter. We do not expect any future actions to be material enough to be disruptive to our operations or the expected margins performance for the company overall.
Our High Velocity segment decreased 9% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment decreased 11% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of the total company revenue in this quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 3.1% of revenue. The sequential increase in core operating margin, a result of a more favorable mix of revenues and the successful implementation of lean initiatives. 
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion to our segment performance on a yearly basis. In fiscal year 2011, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 43%. Revenue was approximately $6 billion representing 36% of total company revenue and core operating income was 6.5% of the revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 18% in fiscal 2011. Revenue was approximately $5.2 billion, representing 32% of total company revenue. And core operating income was 3.9% for the full year. And finally, High Velocity segment grew 11%. Revenue was approximately $5.3 billion, again representing 32% of total company revenue and core operating income was 2.4% for the full year.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 7 through 10 for the following discussion. We are very pleased with our fiscal 2011 performance. Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated and sustainable manner has resulted in a sustainable portfolio and income mix change to our business. Over the course of the first fiscal quarter of 2010 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment has grown from 29% to 40% of company revenues, but our High Velocity segment has fallen from 40% to 28% of overall revenues. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment remained at 32% of overall revenue. Executing for this strategy has also delivered core operating income expansion from 3.4% to 4.4% over the same time frame. In fiscal '11, the resulting mix in revenue contributed to margin expansion from 3.7% to 4.3%.
Our investments in the fiscal year were and shall remain focused toward our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Approximately 60% of these investments were made in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, 11% in Enterprise & Infrastructure and 8% in High Velocity. The balance being IT and infrastructure that support our current and planned future growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and 12. Our capital returns in fiscal '11 are exceptional and the year-on-year revenue grew 23%. We exit the year with a GAAP return on invested capital of 26%, EBITDA in excess of $1 billion or 6.1% of revenue. Our earnings growth and focused balance sheet management had allowed us to produce very strong cash flows, producing $304 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, $828 million for the full fiscal year resulting in a free cash flow yield of some 40%, exceeding the target we've established at the beginning of the fiscal year. The strong cash flows had also allowed us to return some $260 million to shareholders in stock repurchases and our ongoing dividend payment. We enter fiscal 2012 in a position that's strong. Our balance sheet is positioned to allow strategic flexibility and support continued growth as we continue to position Diversified Manufacturing Services towards 50% of our overall revenue stream. It's also important to note that fiscal '11 performance continues the production of quality earnings amongst our peer group, with Jabil producing positive GAAP earnings 9 years out of 10 years through the end of fiscal '10. Looking ahead in 2012, we expect continued growth. 
First fiscal 2012 guidance can be found on Slides 14 and 15. We expect the revenue in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to be up approximately 8%, on a range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we expect it to increase 3% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we expected to be consistent and our High Velocity segment, we expect it to increase 6% sequentially, representing less seasonality in the past years as a result of continued diversification of our business model. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million, and the core operating margin in a range of 4.3% to 4.5%. While core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per diluted share based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. Based upon the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income, we expect it to be 17% for the quarter and the full fiscal year.
We anticipate that late in the first quarter we should complete the acquisition of Telmar Network Technology, continuing our strategy of diversifications and growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our capital expenditures and acquisition of Telmar are estimated to be $225 million in the quarter. The majority of these capital expenditures are associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services and the associated IT infrastructure. 
At this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Tim Main. Tim?"
96078,140503225,170283,"Jabil Circuit Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2011",2011-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Jabil Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we're very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and to premise our value to customers on highly differentiated services and capabili",1052,"Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we're very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and to premise our value to customers on highly differentiated services and capabilities. The growth is particularly gratifying given the fact that we operated for 3 quarters of the fiscal year with developed world GDP growth at very low levels. Now some would say to me, that Jabil is a cyclical business, and I think the evidence indicates just the opposite. Please turn to Slide 17. 
In fact, since 2008 Jabil's compound annual growth rate and EPS places ninth among Fortune 500 companies with over $15 billion in revenue. If you really look at the facts and results, it is a bit stunning, and I have a lot of people asking, ""Tim, if it isn't the business cycle, your big customers or the latest products, what is it?"" Well, I think it would be an oversimplification to attribute distributed the results solely to mix and our exposure to growth markets. Please turn to Slide 18. 
In fact, I think the big contributor to our story is our culture of continuous improvement. With some Blitz Kaizen Events, we had 14,000 events this year, we have 3,000 people enrolled in Lean Six Sigma Education programs. We significantly expanded our human development and leadership training resources. We have developed and deployed proprietary global logistics and planning tools around the world, significantly increased the depth of our critical product engineering capability in key areas, and we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and are one of the few  companies in the world that have ever come across -- it's actually operated a company of this size with a single instance of SAP around the world, and that gives us some very key strategic advantages. 
Now let's take a look at our 3 business areas for a little bit more color. Please turn to Slide 19. In High Velocity, it's really about staying ahead of the game and we do this by having a hyperactive focus on cost, rapid development of new technology, approaches and locations really keeps us lean and moving to the right locations in the world. The business area is continuously providing synergy to high-growth areas like healthcare, which we talked about many times in the past, and it is an asset-light business that generates free cash flow to help repurchase shares and fund expansion and other areas of our business. And margin performance in this area has been good all year and well within our targeted range and actually above our targeted range in most recent quarters.
Please turn to Slide 20. In the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, we do operate at the higher end of the product and service complexity. Our customers are continuously challenged with an ever-expanding number of new countries, suppliers, order configurations, services they must provide to their customers and delivering it to different customers all over the world. Our job is to really to provide simplification of this web of complexity, and we do this through engineering intimacy. We -- product developed many, many of our products today that we are shipping in a collaborative way; superb manufacturing of very complex products and low-cost locations around the world; proprietary planning tools that help our customers balance demand and supply, which becomes exceedingly difficult in today's environment. We have more locations. We have scale. We have more capability than our competition and we have the ability to deploy plug and play systems around the world and top order fulfillment capabilities in places like Brazil and Russia.
Please turn to Slide 21. At Diversified Manufacturing services, we're really there to make a difference, make a difference to patients, to the environment, to help our customers' products more attractive, more functional and then help make user expense better through aftermarket support. We do this in the Material Technology Group, which has been a big part of our growth story this year, and this group continues to provide synergistic value to targeted markets, particularly healthcare. Aftermarket Services is an area of great opportunity for us and we've recently made an acquisition we hope to close later this quarter, and we expect to see more growth from this group in coming years. Healthcare & Instrumentation is particularly an attractive area for us and we've expanded our ability to help our product, our customers design, develop and deploy their products around the world and we're moving from electronics to non-electronic areas as well. In industrial and Clean Tech, we are an early mover and have some significant advantages in this area. And our business is gaining in breadth, capability and reputation and we look forward to a bright future in this business area for many years to come. 
Turn to Slide 22, please. So putting it all together, this is what I think our business is about. It isn't about the hot product, the big customer or timing the business cycle. When I look at the landscape, our customers are doing business in a world that is going through very rapid change, the world in which 80% of global GDP growth was generated in developing economies. Where our customers are, what they do and how they do it, there's been a constant state of change and challenge. In managing a business as a customer of Jabil ,in a globalizing, urbanizing, resource scarce and socially connected world is a tough task for our customers. What do we do? We just make it easier. Jabil does effort every day to make it easier for our customers to be successful in global markets, making it easier for customers to develop, handmade, deliver and service products around the world. 
Now we think the demand for this value proposition has been strong and will continue to be strong across more markets for many years to come. That's really what I think the business is about and will conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everybody that there is in appendix, and you can refer to the appendix for some more detailed information regarding metrics and other information that we typically provide on conference calls. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think U.S. GDP growth in the March quarter was less than 1 point, in the June quarter, about 1 point. In the September quarter, I can't imagine it being much above 1 point. I don't think European GDP growth has amounted to much all year, and in Japan, that's teetering on the edge of recession. So I think that covers around 60% of the world's economy, and we put up 23% revenue growth in that type of environment. So a remarkable thing to me is how little the macroeconomic environment matter to the company's results over the course of the year. And I think as we move into 2012, I think we -- we're being a little bit conservative in the level of growth that we could put up consecutively after having such a robust 2011. But it's still a year in which we think Diversified Manufacturing Services has the ability to grow at the range, maybe at the low end of the range but certainly within the targeted long-term of growth ranges. And in  Enterprise & Infrastructure, we'd expect a similar level of performance. In the High Velocity, we'll see what consumer trends are over the course of the year, and we think it's a good set of conditions right now to be conservative. And it's not all bad if revenue growth slows down from 23% to 10-ish percent. That's not a big deal to the company and give us an opportunity to really drive margin expansion and EPS growth in 2012. So we kind of like the environment, Lou."

We think we'll grow our top line, and over the course of 2012 and much of that is a function of market share gains, and so we look forward to that. And then, Diversified Manufacturing Services, I mean, we really have a combination of internal manufacturing that's being externalized. Here are some very valuable services that Jabil provides and access to emerging economies, product development, localizing supply chains, and this is an area of activity that we do see very robust demand from healthcare customers, industrial customers. We think our Clean Tech  business is in a very strong position and Materials Technology Group continues to do very well. So overall, I think it's an area that's a combination of driving a lean culture and higher levels of productivity along with specific revenue growth in targeted areas should result in a year in which we can put up another good year."

And you can talk all you want about 90-day time windows and what's happening on the margins, you can't grow a 25% for 18 years or 16 years, whatever that is, if you're reliant on macroeconomic growth. You have to be developing new markets and opportunities and through all the freak outs in communications and Asian crises and debt crises and everything else, our business has gone out and made a pretty darn good business in helping customers across the world to manage complexity and showing customers that it's really advisable for them to let us manage making this stuff for them. And when we look at the world and even going forward, that's really what our growth is premised on. So when we really analyze this carefully a few years ago, I think we came up with a metric that's 80% of our growth, which really is a kind of new customers market share gains, lead time organic growth with different customers, expanding services, and the balance of it was really attributable to what's happening in the secular growth trend of electronics and customers and macroeconomic activity and that kind of thing.

We've made great strides this year adding the 5 percentage points and I think we are going to be adding another 5% next year. So that's the first area of thought process. We are committed to our dividend and we continue to review the levels of these dividends with our board on a quarterly basis and we'll be doing that again at our next board meeting. So no specific direction that I can provide you today, but certainly I consider all these various alternatives, that investing in the business, acquisitions, our dividend policy and a stock repurchase program in holistic basis continues to give us flexibility with our capital structure."

I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Net revenue for the fourth quarter is $4.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $165.6 million or 3.9% of revenue. This compares to $103 million of GAAP",1353,"Thank you, Beth, and hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Net revenue for the fourth quarter is $4.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $165.6 million or 3.9% of revenue. This compares to $103 million of GAAP operating income and revenues of $3.9 billion or 2.7% for the same period in the prior year. Core operating income excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 19% to $187.2 million and represents 4.4% of revenue. This compares with $157 million or 4.1% for the same period in the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Our core operating income increased 5%. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 19% over the prior year. 
And I'll ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2011, net revenue was $16.5 billion, an increase of 23%. GAAP operating income was $578.7 million, an increase of 77% and represented 3.5% of revenue. This compares to $327.6 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $13.4 billion for fiscal 2010 and 2.4% of revenue.
Core operating income excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 46% to $715.2 million and represented 4.3% of revenue for the full fiscal year. This compares to $490.9 million or 3.7% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.34, an increase of 54% over the prior year. 
And I'll ask you to turn to Slide 5 for our segment discussion. In the fourth quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 10% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 35%. Revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 40% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.7% of revenue. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 10% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion representing 32% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 2.6% of revenue. The decline in core operating margin this quarter is primarily attributable to license we were taking to restructure our operations in Italy, specifically severance cost, asset write-offs and other related charges of approximately $8 million. The balance of the decline in operating performance was attributed to the sequential increase in losses in Italy and infrastructure readiness for ongoing wireless program ramps in non-Western European geographies.
As we move to fiscal '12, the continued ramp-up of the new programs around the world will continue, diluting the negative impact of operating results in Western Europe. We, therefore, expect margins in this segment to slightly improve over the course of the fiscal year and core operating margin targets between 4% and 4.5% remain intact. 
As for any future actions, we expect a routine tailoring of our infrastructure will be ongoing and absorbed through operating earnings as we have done in the fourth fiscal quarter. We do not expect any future actions to be material enough to be disruptive to our operations or the expected margins performance for the company overall.
Our High Velocity segment decreased 9% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment decreased 11% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of the total company revenue in this quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 3.1% of revenue. The sequential increase in core operating margin, a result of a more favorable mix of revenues and the successful implementation of lean initiatives. 
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion to our segment performance on a yearly basis. In fiscal year 2011, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 43%. Revenue was approximately $6 billion representing 36% of total company revenue and core operating income was 6.5% of the revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 18% in fiscal 2011. Revenue was approximately $5.2 billion, representing 32% of total company revenue. And core operating income was 3.9% for the full year. And finally, High Velocity segment grew 11%. Revenue was approximately $5.3 billion, again representing 32% of total company revenue and core operating income was 2.4% for the full year.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 7 through 10 for the following discussion. We are very pleased with our fiscal 2011 performance. Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated and sustainable manner has resulted in a sustainable portfolio and income mix change to our business. Over the course of the first fiscal quarter of 2010 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment has grown from 29% to 40% of company revenues, but our High Velocity segment has fallen from 40% to 28% of overall revenues. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment remained at 32% of overall revenue. Executing for this strategy has also delivered core operating income expansion from 3.4% to 4.4% over the same time frame. In fiscal '11, the resulting mix in revenue contributed to margin expansion from 3.7% to 4.3%.
Our investments in the fiscal year were and shall remain focused toward our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Approximately 60% of these investments were made in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, 11% in Enterprise & Infrastructure and 8% in High Velocity. The balance being IT and infrastructure that support our current and planned future growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and 12. Our capital returns in fiscal '11 are exceptional and the year-on-year revenue grew 23%. We exit the year with a GAAP return on invested capital of 26%, EBITDA in excess of $1 billion or 6.1% of revenue. Our earnings growth and focused balance sheet management had allowed us to produce very strong cash flows, producing $304 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, $828 million for the full fiscal year resulting in a free cash flow yield of some 40%, exceeding the target we've established at the beginning of the fiscal year. The strong cash flows had also allowed us to return some $260 million to shareholders in stock repurchases and our ongoing dividend payment. We enter fiscal 2012 in a position that's strong. Our balance sheet is positioned to allow strategic flexibility and support continued growth as we continue to position Diversified Manufacturing Services towards 50% of our overall revenue stream. It's also important to note that fiscal '11 performance continues the production of quality earnings amongst our peer group, with Jabil producing positive GAAP earnings 9 years out of 10 years through the end of fiscal '10. Looking ahead in 2012, we expect continued growth. 
First fiscal 2012 guidance can be found on Slides 14 and 15. We expect the revenue in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to be up approximately 8%, on a range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we expect it to increase 3% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we expected to be consistent and our High Velocity segment, we expect it to increase 6% sequentially, representing less seasonality in the past years as a result of continued diversification of our business model. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million, and the core operating margin in a range of 4.3% to 4.5%. While core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per diluted share based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. Based upon the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income, we expect it to be 17% for the quarter and the full fiscal year.
We anticipate that late in the first quarter we should complete the acquisition of Telmar Network Technology, continuing our strategy of diversifications and growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our capital expenditures and acquisition of Telmar are estimated to be $225 million in the quarter. The majority of these capital expenditures are associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services and the associated IT infrastructure. 
At this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Tim Main. Tim?"
96078,140503225,170299,"Jabil Circuit Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2011",2011-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Jabil Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we're very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and to premise our value to customers on highly differentiated services and capabili",1052,"Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we're very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and to premise our value to customers on highly differentiated services and capabilities. The growth is particularly gratifying given the fact that we operated for 3 quarters of the fiscal year with developed world GDP growth at very low levels. Now some would say to me, that Jabil is a cyclical business, and I think the evidence indicates just the opposite. Please turn to Slide 17. 
In fact, since 2008 Jabil's compound annual growth rate and EPS places ninth among Fortune 500 companies with over $15 billion in revenue. If you really look at the facts and results, it is a bit stunning, and I have a lot of people asking, ""Tim, if it isn't the business cycle, your big customers or the latest products, what is it?"" Well, I think it would be an oversimplification to attribute distributed the results solely to mix and our exposure to growth markets. Please turn to Slide 18. 
In fact, I think the big contributor to our story is our culture of continuous improvement. With some Blitz Kaizen Events, we had 14,000 events this year. We have 3,000 people enrolled in Lean Six Sigma Education programs. We significantly expanded our human development and leadership training resources. We have developed and deployed proprietary global logistics and planning tools around the world, significantly increased the depth of our critical product engineering capability in key areas, and we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and are one of the few  companies in the world that have ever come across -- it's actually operated a company of this size with a single instance of SAP around the world, and that gives us some very key strategic advantages. 
Now let's take a look at our 3 business areas for a little bit more color. Please turn to Slide 19. In High Velocity, it's really about staying ahead of the game and we do this by having a hyperactive focus on cost, rapid development of new technology, approaches and locations really keeps us lean and moving to the right locations in the world. The business area is continuously providing synergy to high-growth areas like healthcare, which we talked about many times in the past, and it is an asset-light business that generates free cash flow to help repurchase shares and fund expansion and other areas of our business. And margin performance in this area has been good all year and well within our targeted range and actually above our targeted range in most recent quarters.
Please turn to Slide 20. In the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, we do operate at the higher end of the product and service complexity. Our customers are continuously challenged with an ever-expanding number of new countries, suppliers, order configurations, services they must provide to their customers and delivering it to different customers all over the world. Our job is to really to provide simplification of this web of complexity, and we do this through engineering intimacy. We -- product developed many, many of our products today that we are shipping in a collaborative way; superb manufacturing of very complex products and low-cost locations around the world; proprietary planning tools that help our customers balance demand and supply, which becomes exceedingly difficult in today's environment. We have more locations. We have scale. We have more capability than our competition and we have the ability to deploy plug and play systems around the world and top order fulfillment capabilities in places like Brazil and Russia.
Please turn to Slide 21. At Diversified Manufacturing services, we're really there to make a difference, make a difference to patients, to the environment, to help our customers' products more attractive, more functional and then help make user expense better through aftermarket support. We do this in the Material Technology Group, which has been a big part of our growth story this year, and this group continues to provide synergistic value to targeted markets, particularly healthcare. Aftermarket Services is an area of great opportunity for us and we've recently made an acquisition we hope to close later this quarter, and we expect to see more growth from this group in coming years. Healthcare & Instrumentation is particularly an attractive area for us and we've expanded our ability to help our product, our customers design, develop and deploy their products around the world and we're moving from electronics to non-electronic areas as well. In industrial and Clean Tech, we are an early mover and have some significant advantages in this area. And our business is gaining in breadth, capability and reputation and we look forward to a bright future in this business area for many years to come. 
Turn to Slide 22, please. So putting it all together, this is what I think our business is about. It isn't about the hot product, the big customer or timing the business cycle. When I look at the landscape, our customers are doing business in a world that is going through very rapid change, the world in which 80% of global GDP growth was generated in developing economies. Where our customers are, what they do and how they do it, there's been a constant state of change and challenge. In managing a business as a customer of Jabil, in a globalizing, urbanizing, resource scarce and socially connected world is a tough task for our customers. What do we do? We just make it easier. Jabil does effort every day to make it easier for our customers to be successful in global markets, making it easier for customers to develop, handmade, deliver and service products around the world. 
Now we think the demand for this value proposition has been strong and will continue to be strong across more markets for many years to come. That's really what I think the business is about and will conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everybody that there is in appendix, and you can refer to the appendix for some more detailed information regarding metrics and other information that we typically provide on conference calls. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think U.S. GDP growth in the March quarter was less than 1 point, in the June quarter, about 1 point",289,"Yes, I'd love to give you some color on that, and I think it's really remarkable how little macroeconomic trends have mattered to the company this year. I think U.S. GDP growth in the March quarter was less than 1 point, in the June quarter, about 1 point. In the September quarter, I can't imagine it being much above 1 point. I don't think European GDP growth has amounted to much all year, and in Japan, that's teetering on the edge of recession. So I think that covers around 60% of the world's economy, and we put up 23% revenue growth in that type of environment. So a remarkable thing to me is how little the macroeconomic environment matter to the company's results over the course of the year. And I think as we move into 2012, I think we -- we're being a little bit conservative in the level of growth that we could put up consecutively after having such a robust 2011. But it's still a year in which we think Diversified Manufacturing Services has the ability to grow at the range, maybe at the low end of the range but certainly within the targeted long-term of growth ranges. And in Enterprise & Infrastructure, we'd expect a similar level of performance. In the High Velocity, we'll see what consumer trends are over the course of the year, and we think it's a good set of conditions right now to be conservative. And it's not all bad if revenue growth slows down from 23% to 10-ish percent. That's not a big deal to the company and give us an opportunity to really drive margin expansion and EPS growth in 2012. So we kind of like the environment, Lou."

We do have as Forbes mentioned a number of new programs ramping in Enterprise & Infrastructure that we think we'll grow our top line, and over the course of 2012 and much of that is a function of market share gains, and so we look forward to that. And then, Diversified Manufacturing Services, I mean, we really have a combination of internal manufacturing that's being externalized. Here are some very valuable services that Jabil provides and access to emerging economies, product development, localizing supply chains, and this is an area of activity that we do see very robust demand from healthcare customers, industrial customers. We think our Clean Tech business is in a very strong position and Materials Technology Group continues to do very well. So overall, I think it's an area that's a combination of driving a lean culture and higher levels of productivity along with specific revenue growth in targeted areas should result in a year in which we can put up another good year."

It's a great platform for our company and global logistics and providing services through a broader range of customers. It's historically been primarily consumer electronics type of activities and some IT activities. The IT area has been growing rapidly. Telmar acquisition is interesting as it gives us some very high-end engineering and troubleshooting capability along with some capabilities that Aftermarket Services doesn't possess today in terms of service and carriers, and providing higher level of functionality to that service set. So it's a big fragmented, fully-run market, and we're the biggest grower in the market today. We believe we were the best run Aftermarket Services business out there and we intend to cross that advantage into different verticals as well as globally, geographically and with a broader set of our existing customers.

In last quarter's conference call, we indicated that we're 1 of 15 companies that have grown revenue EBITDA 25% on a compound annual growth rate since going public in 1993. So from 1994 through 2010, we're very, very elite group of companies that have been able to sustain that kind of growth. And you can talk all you want about 90-day time windows and what's happening on the margins, you can't grow a 25% for 18 years or 16 years, whatever that is, if you're reliant on macroeconomic growth. You have to be developing new markets and opportunities and through all the freak outs in communications and Asian crises and debt crises and everything else, our business has gone out and made a pretty darn good business in helping customers across the world to manage complexity and showing customers that it's really advisable for them to let us manage making this stuff for them. And when we look at the world and even going forward, that's really what our growth is premised on. So when we really analyze this carefully a few years ago, I think we came up with a metric that's 80% of our growth, was really is a kind of new customers market share gains, lead time organic growth with existing customers, expanding services, and the balance of it was really attributable to what's happening in the secular growth trends of electronics and customers and macroeconomic activity and that kind of thing. So I'm not here to say that we're immune to rapid abrupt contractions in economic activity. That hurts everybody in the world.

But because the business activity is a little bit different in each of those areas. I think it's a little bit remarkable that people are looking at this like slow macroeconomic growth at recent events. I mean, it's been going on like this going on a year. I mean, March was horrible, June quarter is horrible. September is going to be horrible. There's no macroeconomic tailwind to the business, and so to think that recently people woke up and saw that the U.S. government couldn't come up with the debt refinancing plan and then everybody freaked out and cut out the orders is a little bit laughable. I mean, is it getting a lot worse? I mean, we don't see any precipitous decline in our business, and you see we're absolutely right. I mean, here and there, you see people trimming here and there. And there's more conservatism overall moving into the picture. But man, oh man, this is not recent. This is like a yearlong of no growth from a macro standpoint. And again, I think to really appreciate the value that Jabil brings and what our growth story is about, we really have to think about other things besides the business cycle, big customers and hot products. We really need to think about the value of simplifying complex global supply chain networks and why that's valuable to so many OEMs in so many different markets around the world, and that's what we're trading on."

This business has got 40% of the business in Diversified Manufacturing Services, which is extremely complex area. 70% of Jabil's production is built in lot quantities of less than 100. This is not a high volume company. This is a high mix, high complexity company and we've managed to maintain inventory turns at 7 turns, and actually had absolute dollar reduction in our inventory levels in the August quarter. So we're not looking at inventories as a proxy for what's going on and actually our raw material, work in process, finished goods levels has been pretty consistent in all years. As Forbes said, we will continue to work like the devil to make our balance sheet more efficient and drive cash flow by being more efficient the way we manage inventory but you compare Jabil to a high mix business to some of our competitors that are more peer plays in that area, and our inventory turnover is pretty good, at 7 turns."

In these slides, you will find the financial information that we covered during this conference call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website and beginning with Slide 2 now.
Here's our forward-looking statements. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected first quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenues and earnings results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecast and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call will begin with our fourth quarter and fiscal year results, some comments and highlights from Forbes Alexander on the results as well as guidance on our first fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will then follow with some macro environment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from call attendees. 
I will now turn the call over to Forbes."

On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 35%. Revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 40% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.7% of revenue. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment grew 10% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion representing 32% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 2.6% of revenue. The decline in core operating margin this quarter is primarily attributable to license we were taking to restructure our operations in Italy, specifically severance cost, asset write-offs and other related charges of approximately $8 million. The balance of the decline in operating performance was attributed to the sequential increase in losses in Italy and infrastructure readiness for ongoing wireless program ramps in non-Western European geographies.
As we move to fiscal '12, the continued ramp-up of the new programs around the world will continue, diluting the negative impact of operating results in Western Europe. We, therefore, expect margins in this segment to slightly improve over the course of the fiscal year and core operating margin targets between 4% and 4.5% remain intact. 
As for any future actions, we expect a routine tailoring of our infrastructure will be ongoing and absorbed through operating earnings as we have done in the fourth fiscal quarter. We do not expect any future actions to be material enough to be disruptive to our operations or the expected margins performance for the company overall.
Our High Velocity segment decreased 9% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, this segment decreased 11% for the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of the total company revenue in this quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 3.1% of revenue. The sequential increase in core operating margin, a result of a more favorable mix of revenues and the successful implementation of lean initiatives. 
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion to our segment performance on a yearly basis. In fiscal year 2011, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 43%. Revenue was approximately $6 billion representing 36% of total company revenue and core operating income was 6.5% of the revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment grew 18% in fiscal 2011. Revenue was approximately $5.2 billion, representing 32% of total company revenue. And core operating income was 3.9% for the full year. And finally, High Velocity segment grew 11%. Revenue was approximately $5.3 billion, again representing 32% of total company revenue and core operating income was 2.4% for the full year.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 7 through 10 for the following discussion. We are very pleased with our fiscal 2011 performance. Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated and sustainable manner has resulted in a sustainable portfolio and income mix change to our business. Over the course of the first fiscal quarter of 2010 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment has grown from 29% to 40% of company revenues, but our High Velocity segment has fallen from 40% to 28% of overall revenues. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment remained at 32% of overall revenue. Executing for this strategy has also delivered core operating income expansion from 3.4% to 4.4% over the same time frame. In fiscal '11, the resulting mix in revenue contributed to margin expansion from 3.7% to 4.3%.
Our investments in the fiscal year were and shall remain focused toward our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Approximately 60% of these investments were made in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, 11% in Enterprise & Infrastructure and 8% in High Velocity. The balance being IT and infrastructure that support our current and planned future growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and 12. Our capital returns in fiscal '11 are exceptional and the year-on-year revenue grew 23%. We exit the year with a GAAP return on invested capital of 26%, EBITDA in excess of $1 billion or 6.1% of revenue. Our earnings growth and focused balance sheet management had allowed us to produce very strong cash flows, producing $304 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, $828 million for the full fiscal year resulting in a free cash flow yield of some 40%, exceeding the target we've established at the beginning of the fiscal year. The strong cash flows had also allowed us to return some $260 million to shareholders in stock repurchases and our ongoing dividend payment. We enter fiscal 2012 in a position that's strong. Our balance sheet is positioned to allow strategic flexibility and support continued growth as we continue to position Diversified Manufacturing Services towards 50% of our overall revenue stream. It's also important to note that fiscal '11 performance continues the production of quality earnings amongst our peer group, with Jabil producing positive GAAP earnings 9 years out of 10 years through the end of fiscal '10. Looking ahead in 2012, we expect continued growth. 
First fiscal 2012 guidance can be found on Slides 14 and 15. We expect the revenue in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to be up approximately 8%, on a range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we expect it to increase 3% sequentially. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we expected to be consistent and our High Velocity segment, we expect it to increase 6% sequentially, representing less seasonality in the past years as a result of continued diversification of our business model. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million, and the core operating margin in a range of 4.3% to 4.5%. While core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per diluted share based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. Based upon the current estimates of production, the tax rate on core operating income, we expect it to be 17% for the quarter and the full fiscal year.
We anticipate that late in the first quarter we should complete the acquisition of Telmar Network Technology, continuing our strategy of diversifications and growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our capital expenditures and acquisition of Telmar are estimated to be $225 million in the quarter. The majority of these capital expenditures are associated with investments in Diversified Manufacturing Services and the associated IT infrastructure. 
At this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Tim Main. Tim?"
96078,140503225,170523,"Jabil Circuit Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2011",2011-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Jabil Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we're very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and to premise our value to customers on highly differentiated services and capabili",1052,"Thank you, Forbes. 2011 was a remarkable year for us and we're very pleased with the growth and the advancement made on key strategic objectives to diversify our business and to premise our value to customers on highly differentiated services and capabilities. The growth is particularly gratifying given the fact that we operated for 3 quarters of the fiscal year with developed world GDP growth at very low levels. Now some would say to me, that Jabil is a cyclical business, and I think the evidence indicates just the opposite. Please turn to Slide 17. 
In fact, since 2008 Jabil's compound annual growth rate and EPS places ninth among Fortune 500 companies with over $15 billion in revenue. If you really look at the facts and results, it is a bit stunning, and I have a lot of people asking, ""Tim, if it isn't the business cycle, your big customers or the latest products, what is it?"" Well, I think it would be an oversimplification to attribute distributed the results solely to mix and our exposure to growth markets. Please turn to Slide 18. 
In fact, I think the big contributor to our story is our culture of continuous improvement. With some Blitz Kaizen Events, we had 14,000 events this year. We have 3,000 people enrolled in Lean Six Sigma Education programs. We significantly expanded our human development and leadership training resources. We have developed and deployed proprietary global logistics and planning tools around the world, significantly increased the depth of our critical product engineering capability in key areas, and we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and are one of the few  companies in the world that have ever come across -- it's actually operated a company of this size with a single instance of SAP around the world, and that gives us some very key strategic advantages. 
Now let's take a look at our 3 business areas for a little bit more color. Please turn to Slide 19. In High Velocity, it's really about staying ahead of the game and we do this by having a hyperactive focus on cost, rapid development of new technology, approaches and locations really keeps us lean and moving to the right locations in the world. The business area is continuously providing synergy to high-growth areas like healthcare, which we talked about many times in the past, and it is an asset-light business that generates free cash flow to help repurchase shares and fund expansion and other areas of our business. And margin performance in this area has been good all year and well within our targeted range and actually above our targeted range in most recent quarters.
Please turn to Slide 20. In the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, we do operate at the higher end of the product and service complexity. Our customers are continuously challenged with an ever-expanding number of new countries, suppliers, order configurations, services they must provide to their customers and delivering it to different customers all over the world. Our job is to really to provide simplification of this web of complexity, and we do this through engineering intimacy. We -- product developed many, many of our products today that we are shipping in a collaborative way; superb manufacturing of very complex products and low-cost locations around the world; proprietary planning tools that help our customers balance demand and supply, which becomes exceedingly difficult in today's environment. We have more locations. We have scale. We have more capability than our competition and we have the ability to deploy plug and play systems around the world and top order fulfillment capabilities in places like Brazil and Russia.
Please turn to Slide 21. At Diversified Manufacturing services, we're really there to make a difference, make a difference to patients, to the environment, to help our customers' products more attractive, more functional and then help make user expense better through aftermarket support. We do this in the Material Technology Group, which has been a big part of our growth story this year, and this group continues to provide synergistic value to targeted markets, particularly healthcare. Aftermarket Services is an area of great opportunity for us and we've recently made an acquisition we hope to close later this quarter, and we expect to see more growth from this group in coming years. Healthcare & Instrumentation is particularly an attractive area for us and we've expanded our ability to help our product, our customers design, develop and deploy their products around the world and we're moving from electronics to non-electronic areas as well. In industrial and Clean Tech, we are an early mover and have some significant advantages in this area. And our business is gaining in breadth, capability and reputation and we look forward to a bright future in this business area for many years to come. 
Turn to Slide 22, please. So putting it all together, this is what I think our business is about. It isn't about the hot product, the big customer or timing the business cycle. When I look at the landscape, our customers are doing business in a world that is going through very rapid change, the world in which 80% of global GDP growth was generated in developing economies. Where our customers are, what they do and how they do it, there's been a constant state of change and challenge. In managing a business as a customer of Jabil, in a globalizing, urbanizing, resource scarce and socially connected world is a tough task for our customers. What do we do? We just make it easier. Jabil does effort every day to make it easier for our customers to be successful in global markets, making it easier for customers to develop, handmade, deliver and service products around the world. 
Now we think the demand for this value proposition has been strong and will continue to be strong across more markets for many years to come. That's really what I think the business is about and will conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everybody that there is in appendix, and you can refer to the appendix for some more detailed information regarding metrics and other information that we typically provide on conference calls. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think U.S. GDP growth in the March quarter was less than 1 point, in the June quarter, about 1 point. In the September quarter, I can't imagine it being much above 1 point. I don't think European GDP growth has amounted to much all year, and in Japan, that's teetering on the edge of recession. So I think that covers around 60% of the world's economy, and we put up 23% revenue growth in that type of environment. So a remarkable thing to me is how little the macroeconomic environment matter to the company's results over the course of the year. And I think as we move into 2012, I think we -- we're being a little bit conservative in the level of growth that we could put up consecutively after having such a robust 2011. But it's still a year in which we think Diversified Manufacturing Services has the ability to grow at the range, maybe at the low end of the range but certainly within the targeted long-term of growth ranges. And in Enterprise & Infrastructure, we'd expect a similar level of performance. In the High Velocity, we'll see what consumer trends are over the course of the year, and we think it's a good set of conditions right now to be conservative. And it's not all bad if revenue growth slows down from 23% to 10-ish percent. That's not a big deal to the company and give us an opportunity to really drive margin expansion and EPS growth in 2012. So we kind of like the environment, Lou."

We do have as Forbes mentioned a number of new programs ramping in Enterprise & Infrastructure that we think we'll grow our top line, and over the course of 2012 and much of that is a function of market share gains, and so we look forward to that. And then, Diversified Manufacturing Services, I mean, we really have a combination of internal manufacturing that's being externalized. Here are some very valuable services that Jabil provides and access to emerging economies, product development, localizing supply chains, and this is an area of activity that we do see very robust demand from healthcare customers, industrial customers. We think our Clean Tech business is in a very strong position and Materials Technology Group continues to do very well. So overall, I think it's an area that's a combination of driving a lean culture and higher levels of productivity along with specific revenue growth in targeted areas should result in a year in which we can put up another good year."

And our job is to help them simplify those issues and we do a very good job of that and we're gaining a reputation for that in these key market areas.

In last quarter's conference call, we indicated that we're 1 of 15 companies that have grown revenue EBITDA 25% on a compound annual growth rate since going public in 1993. So from 1994 through 2010, we're very, very elite group of companies that have been able to sustain that kind of growth. And you can talk all you want about 90-day time windows and what's happening on the margins, you can't grow a 25% for 18 years or 16 years, whatever that is, if you're reliant on macroeconomic growth. You have to be developing new markets and opportunities and through all the freak outs in communications and Asian crises and debt crises and everything else, our business has gone out and made a pretty darn good business in helping customers across the world to manage complexity and showing customers that it's really advisable for them to let us manage making this stuff for them. And when we look at the world and even going forward, that's really what our growth is premised on. So when we really analyze this carefully a few years ago, I think we came up with a metric that's 80% of our growth, was really is a kind of new customers market share gains, lead time organic growth with existing customers, expanding services, and the balance of it was really attributable to what's happening in the secular growth trends of electronics and customers and macroeconomic activity and that kind of thing.

As Forbes said, we will continue to work like the devil to make our balance sheet more efficient and drive cash flow by being more efficient the way we manage inventory but you compare Jabil to a high mix business to some of our competitors that are more peer plays in that area, and our inventory turnover is pretty good, at 7 turns."

Welcome to our first quarter of 2011 earnings call. Joining me today are President and CEO, Timothy Main; and Chief Financial Officer, Forbes Alexander.
This call is being recorded and will be posted for audio playback on the Jabil website, jabil.com, in the Investors section. Our first quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we covered during this conference call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website and beginning with Slide 2 of forward-looking statement.
During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected second quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenues and earnings results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecast and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
You may have noticed in our last earnings call and in our recently published annual report, we have began to highlight operating results. While they are currently still reporting and publishing core results, it is our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we'll also be providing guidance on our long-term year-over-year outlook. This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we do business, taking strategic long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our first quarter and fiscal year results, some comments and highlights from Forbes Alexander on the results as well as guidance on our second fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will then follow with some macro environment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

Our net revenue for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Net operating income was $170.8 million, up 3.9% of revenue, which compares to $156 million, GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.1 billion or 3.8% for the same period in the prior year.
Core operating income excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation increased 7% to $194.6 million, represents 4.5% of revenue. This compares to $181.9 million or 4.5% the same period in the prior year.
The sequential basis, revenue increased 1% for the first quarter while core operating income increased 4%. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.65, an increase of 7% over the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.54, an increase of 10% over the prior year. 
Now I'll ask you to refer to Slide 4 for our segment discussion.  In the first quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment improved 30% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, representing 42% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.8% of revenue. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased 4% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of total company revenue and core operating income for the segment was 2% of revenue.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure performance was below expectations as we experienced revenue reductions in the quarter as a result of inventory leveling for specific large customers associated with specific mix and the inbound product transitions. We expect to revenue growth and improve core operating income performance for the balance of the fiscal year.
While our High Velocity segment performed above our expectations for the quarter, segment revenues decreased by 14% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 30% of total company revenue in the quarter. 
Core operating income for the segment was 3.8% of revenue. And on a sequential basis, we saw strength across the whole segment and core operating income performance exceeded our expectations, primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage in a seasonally high quarter.  
There's also another interesting to note that we have one 10% customer in each of our segments. I'll ask you to refer to Slide 5, the review of our balance sheet metrics. 
We ended the quarter with cash balances over $862 million. Inventory was approximately $2.4 billion, representing 7% increase, primarily associated with our Enterprise & Infrastructure business that we experienced some weakness late in the quarter. Inventory turns remain at 7. Overall, working capital management has remained well controlled. As a result, cash flows from operations was approximately $115 million in the quarter. 
EBITDA in the quarter was $275 million or 6.4%, an expansion of 30 basis points over the same period a year ago.
With regards to capital allocation, we continue to maintain a balanced approach investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $95 million as we continue to invest in new infrastructure to support our targeted markets and capabilities. For the second quarter of the fiscal year, we expect CapEx levels with approximately $80 million to $90 million, reflective of capacity and infrastructure to support higher levels of production in the second half of the fiscal year.
During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14%. Bringing our yearly cash dividend to $0.32 per share and while we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, we still have $100 million available on our authorization for the fiscal year. 
We are also pleased to announce the completion of the Telmar acquisition on December 1. The purchase price of approximately $130 million. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Telmar employees to Jabil. Moving forward, Telmar's results will be incorporated in the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, specifically, within the Specialized Services business. Their capability strengthen the depth and scope of our current Aftermarket Services business. Required revenue is approximately $145 million per year.
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 6 and 7 for summary of the quarter's performance. We are pleased with the first quarters results. Core operating margin was 4.5%, the high end of our guidance. And revenues at the lower end of our guidance, reflective of continued operational efficiency, diversification of our revenue stream. 
Returns on invested capital calculate on a GAAP net income basis expanded 2% on a year-over-year basis, 26%, providing winning capital returns in the EMS industry.
And I'll ask you to refer to Slide 9 and 10, while I discuss our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 4%, a range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. On a sequential basis, overall revenue and operating guidance are consistent with the levels of seasonality we've experienced in fiscal 2011. 
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $185 million. And core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.4%. Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.52 to $0.62 per diluted share based upon diluted share count of 213 million shares. Based upon the current estimates of production, tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18% for the quarter and the year.
Turning to our segments. The year-on-year performance for Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 25%; Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to be consistent on a year-over-year basis. Finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decrease 14% in Year-over-year basis.
And now I would like to hand over the call to Tim Main."
96078,144394466,203032,"Jabil Circuit Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Jabil Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Forbes.

For the first fiscal quarter of 2012 is an interesting quarter, very solid results if a little more uneven than we would typically like. Enterprise & Infrastructure was disappointing in total but that underperformance was isolated and we feel confident about Enterprise & Infrastructure going forward. 
We have very good customer relationship in this segment with stable to expanding share of wallet in all major business relationships. We do expect margins to continue expansion as revenue growth as we experienced revenue growth over the balance of the year, along with the benefits of cost reductions already underway to certain sites in Western Europe.
Very strong results and over performance from our Diversified Manufacturing Services group, outstanding margin performance, as well as sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. 
Many of you might be interested in this specific High Velocity customer, which I want to forewarn you, we will not be able to answer any questions about specific customer relationships. However, recognizing the state of uncertainty generally and as a result of some of the more uneven results in fiscal Q2, we thought it would be helpful to help you understand and characterize the balance of our fiscal year. We have prepared some material to help you along with how we see the balance of the fiscal year for our company.
If you could please turn to Slide 12. Using our fiscal first quarter results and the midpoint of our fiscal second quarter guidance, revenue for the first half of fiscal '12 should be approximately $8.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we expect that Diversified Manufacturing group to continue leading growth. We have the organic growth contribution from Aftermarket Services, which is typically at least 12% to 15% per year, combined with the benefit of the Telmar acquisition. We also continue to expect results in Materials Technology Group and the Industrial & Clean Tech and the Healthcare & Instrumentation business areas to continue expansion over the course of the year. 
Given our market share and relatively stable demand trends in the Enterprise & Infrastructure group, and I want to highlight that, we see a relatively stable demand trends in Enterprise & Infrastructure. And we see growth in the second half, exceeding the first half, which we think is reasonable.
We're being conservative about revenue performance and High Velocity in the second of the year. This chart would indicate we are expecting a contraction of approximately $110 million in the second half of the year. However, the quality of that revenue in High Velocity in the margins would continue to be above the high end of our long-term targeted margin range. 
In essence, as a result in the fiscal '12 of approximately $9 billion in the second half and the  total year revenue of about $17.4 billion. We're not trying to handicap anything more or less into this picture, just providing a viewpoint as to where we think we are today and as to how the balance of the year might unfold.
Please turn to Slide 13. Should the year unfold at about this level, I would regard this as a solid year with a good trended business mix towards a Diversified Manufacturing Services business area. Margin and profit expansion can take place on much more moderate revenue growth that which I regard as a very good thing. Please turn to Slide 14.
Diversified Manufacturing Services Group growth is underpinned by a very substantial market opportunity for the company, approximately a $500 billion addressable market with very low levels of penetration. You can find this chart highlighted on our annual report, the fiscal '12 annual report, and it actually goes into additional detail of market subsegment in each of these business areas. Jabil has a leading or at least a beachhead position at all of these areas, and we look to significant growth in these areas over the next 3, 4, 5 years.
Turning to Slide 15, please. So in summary, we regard our first fiscal quarter and the fiscal year to be solid performance in an uncertain environment. We expect moderate revenue growth in fiscal '12. That's a little bit lower than we just experienced historically. But good solid revenue growth underpinned by a strong improvement in portfolio mix towards Diversified Manufacturing Services.
We are continuing our focus on Lean Manufacturing and operating efficiency and all of these elements combined, will help us keep is on track towards a third consecutive record year for the company in terms of revenue and common EPS.

So I'm having a hard time getting to your interpretation of where we are. And actually, this growth is in terms of top line growth, it might be a little bit below were analyst had as in the conference call in September. But given the portfolio mix towards Diversified Manufacturing Services, the income and EPS associated with this revenue stream is roughly equivalent. So I would regard this as a nice straight out of lower margin revenue for a better earnings profile and more sustainability. So I think I'd take fiscal '12 particularly in this environment."

But taking Enterprise & Infrastructure, which underperformed in the first quarter that's really now about our revenue growth. And as we have said in our prepared remarks, essentially, the guidance we provide will go through the balance of the second fiscal quarter and the balance of the year. So we should see some pretty reasonable margin progression. I'll remind you that last quarter, we discussed the closure of our sites in Northern Italy. So that's underway. We do anticipate that would occur will be some benefit in the February quarter. All below margin accretion and then we'll see the full benefit of those closures in the third or fourth quarter. But principally, we add back the revenue, we see in the growth and we start to see the margins progress from 2.5%. And I would expect us to be very close to the low end of our operating targets as we get to the first fiscal quarter here. I remind everyone that the long-term targets in the range of 4% to 4.5%. Terms of the High Velocity arena, you see, extremely pleased with the performance in the first fiscal quarter. And the way we think about that is that we did have some high utilization of some assets in the seasonally high first quarter. So I would expect some decline in those margins as we move forward to the balance of the year. Sequentially, we do see revenues coming down as a result of this November high season. So the way to think about that is probably certainly above the high end of our targeted range, 2.5%, somewhere around probably approaching to 3% for the balance of the year."

So underlying demand trends are okay. And that's why we're pointing to a few isolated customer relationships. We don't want to give investors the wrong message because it always seems the flowback to specific customers was can be embarrassing. And, frankly, not true. Computing of the storage market was actually a bright spot. And we've seen very stable demand and we're growing share of wallet in the Storage business area. The Telecommunications area, particularly wireless infrastructure demand is good but we're seeing some inventory leveling and some technology changes that elongate some of the product transitions to Jabil. And then the other elements of Enterprise & Infrastructure. Nothing to write home about in terms of great growth but decent stability and I think most of the marketplace has been sensitized to expect lower levels of annual year-over-year growth in the data communications area in particular.

[indiscernible] I think that you often hear out of the faster rate, but I think the overall economic environment isn't getting a lot worse or a lot better, not changing rapidly. They seem to be a little bit better in United States, a little bit slower in Europe. Asia continues to be stable. So I think that the economic environment is relatively benign, if you will, in terms of influence. $600 million of incremental revenue growth and as you point out is pretty similar to what we have last year. We see, if you look at the Enterprise & Infrastructure portion of that, we essentially get back $166 million that wasn't there in fiscal Q1 because that's a share of wallet issue and a sellthrough rate issue. So once that inventory is consumed and the 3 product transitions are completed, you get that basically that same runrate back into the revenue stream. And then there is some additional customer programs we expect to ramp in the production over the course of Q3 and Q4. So we feel good about it in Enterprise & Infrastructure, actually, a very good line of sight to that as well. And in the Diversified Manufacturing Services, gosh with 30% year-over-year in Q1. Materials technology Aftermarket Services and industrial all have a very good growth prospects for the balance of the year. We're actually, we have seen growth here in areas like Defense & Aerospace, so we feel good about line of sight to growth in those areas as well. And I think one of the reasons we want to make sure that investors are in touch with what we think is a realistic perspective on the High Velocity business segment and actually seeing that contract in the second half of the year. And that attenuates the revenue growth for the year, again the margin profile and earnings power of the company is unaffected by that actually improved by that change out of high velocity revenue for Enterprise infrastructure and Diversified Manufacturing Services. So actually a pretty good trade out in our calculus of how the year should unfold. I think what you got to do to put faith in this is you've got to believe that macroeconomic conditions continue at about the same rate. And again, I made the comment during my prepared remarks that we're not trying to handicap anything more or less into this guidance, simply what we see today based on sellthrough rates and the current economic environment. If you someone who thinks the environment is going to get a lot worse, then this is probably something you want to have faith in. If you believe the economic environment will probably continue to be relatively tepid or lackluster, I think this is something you can put a lot of faith in. I think the company has put up spectacular results in the face of significant macro economic headwinds. And I don't think those headwinds are any worse today than they have been of fiscal '11 or previously. So we wanted to help people understand how we see the balance of the year by giving all the moving parts in all of the collateral information that people have been getting over the last 3 or 4 months and worrying about frankly. So we're looking for what we think is a pretty solid year maybe a little bit lower revenue growth, but earnings that will compare very favorably with fiscal '11."

I think we'll take a look at our long-term targets for High Velocity closer to the end of the year when we kind of refresh for fiscal year '13. But I think Forbes and I will be comfortable with the expectation that High Velocity operating margins for the year can start with a 3, probably somewhere in the low 3s. And we expect to see and I think we mentioned this in our prepared remarks or Q&A, but we do see Enterprise & Infrastructure margins improved over the course of the year by about 50 basis points so if you kind of do that and you've got consistent margins in the Diversified Manufacturing Services area, which we think is a reasonable expectation, that's why we think the earnings power of the company is in pretty good shape for the year."

We came in just on $95 million actually for our first quarter. So our overall expectations for the year, if we add in our second fiscal quarter, the point of guidance is $85 million, it's somewhere between $350 million and $400 million in terms of capital expenditures for the year is where our thoughts are currently. So last year, we spend on a net basis I think $136 million something of that nature, so a little bit shy of that. Obviously, we have this Telmar acquisition of $130 million so investors at that point in terms of modeling cash flows. In terms of the overall cash flows, I think the question for performance in terms of cash flow depending on revenue growth. Currently, with the back half of the year that we articulated in the prepared remarks today, the working capital management has really been outstanding in my opinion outstanding over the last multiple of quarters actually that's 5 or 6 quarters. And I didn't want to see anything that will change that level of performance as I look through the balance of the fiscal year. So what that does based on the view we have of the balance of our fiscal year, certainly, provides us an opportunity of somewhere in that $175 million, $200 million plus a quarter of operating cash flow. CapEx levels and expenses we talked about and you're producing $250 million of free cash flow for the year. If revenue should grow faster than in our back half of the fiscal year, there will be some degradation to those cash flows, purely based upon the amendment the working capital that we need. The way we specifically think about that is somewhere in the region of $0.05 to $0.10 of the working capital need for that incremental dollar and revenue. Should we see softness and clearly, cash flows would outperform these levels I have just discussed."

Welcome to our first quarter of 2012 earnings call. Joining me today are President and CEO, Timothy Main; and Chief Financial Officer, Forbes Alexander.
This call is being recorded and will be posted for audio playback on the Jabil website, jabil.com, in the Investors section. Our first quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we covered during this conference call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website beginning with Slide 2 of forward-looking statement.
During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected second quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earnings results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
You may have noticed in our last earnings call and in our recently published annual report we have begun to highlight GAAP operating results. While we are currently still reporting and publishing core results, it is our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we'll also be providing guidance on our long-term year-over-year outlook. This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we've run the business, taking strategic long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our first quarter results highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander on the results as well as guidance on our second fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with some macroenvironment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from our call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

Our net revenue for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $170.8 million, or 3.9% of revenue, which compares to $156 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.1 billion or 3.8% in the same period in the prior year.
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 7% to $194.6 million. It represents 4.5% of revenue. This compares to $181.9 million or 4.5% in the same period in the prior year.
On a sequential basis, revenue increased 1% in the first quarter while core operating income increased 4%. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.65, an increase of 7% over the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for first quarter was $0.54, an increase of 10% over the prior year. 
Now I ask you to refer to Slide 4 for our segment discussion.  In the first quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 30% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, representing 42% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.8% of revenue. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased 4% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of total company revenue, and core operating income for the segment was 2% of revenue.
Enterprise & Infrastructure performance was below expectations as we experienced revenue reductions late in the quarter as a result of inventory leveling with specific large customers associated with specific mix and inbound product transitions. We expect a return to revenue growth and improved core operating income performance the balance of the fiscal year.
While our High Velocity segment performed above our expectations for the quarter, segment revenues decreased by 14% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 30% of total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 3.8% of revenue. Now on a sequential basis, we saw strength across the whole segment, and core operating income performance exceeded our expectations primarily as a result of fixed-cost leverage in a seasonally high quarter.  
It's also now interesting to note that we have one 10% customer in each of our segments. I'll ask you to refer to Slide 5, a review of our balance sheet metrics. 
We ended the quarter with cash balances of $862 million. Inventory was approximately $2.4 billion, representing a 7% increase primarily associated with our Enterprise & Infrastructure business where we experienced some weakness late in the quarter. Inventory turns remained at 7. Overall working capital management remained well controlled. As a result, cash flows from operations was approximately $115 million in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was $275 million, or 6.4%, an expansion of 30 basis points over the same period a year ago.
With regard to capital allocation, we continue to maintain a balanced approach, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $95 million as we continued to invest in new infrastructure to support our targeted markets and capabilities. In the second quarter of the fiscal year, we expect CapEx levels of approximately $80 million to $90 million, reflective of capacity and infrastructure to support higher levels of production in the second half of the fiscal year.
During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14%, bringing our yearly cash dividend to $0.32 per share. And while we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, we still have $100 million available on our authorization for the fiscal year. 
We're also pleased to announce the completion of the Telmar acquisition on December 1 with a purchase price of approximately $130 million. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Telmar employees to Jabil. Moving forward, Telmar's results will be incorporated in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, specifically within the specialized services business. Their capabilities strengthen the depth and scope of our current Aftermarket Services business. Required revenue is approximately $145 million per year.
Now I ask you to turn to Slide 6 and 7 for summary of the quarter's performance. We are pleased with the first quarter's results. Core operating margin was 4.5%, the high end of our guidance. And revenue is at the lower end of our guidance, reflective of continued operational efficiency, diversification of our revenue stream. 
Returns on invested capital, calculated on a GAAP net income basis, expanded 2% on a year-over-year basis, 26%, providing leading [ph] capital returns in the EMS industry.
And I'll ask you to refer to Slide 9 and 10 while I discuss our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 4%, a range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. On a sequential basis, overall revenue and operating guidance are consistent with the levels of seasonality we experienced in fiscal 2011. 
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $185 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.4%. Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.52 to $0.62 per diluted share based upon diluted share count of 213 million shares. Based upon the current estimates of production, tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18% for the quarter and the year.
Turning to our segments. The year-on-year performance for Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 25%. Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to be consistent on a year-over-year basis. Finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decrease 14% on a year-over-year basis.
And now I'd like to hand over the call to Tim Main."

Very solid results if a little more uneven than we would typically like. Enterprise & Infrastructure was disappointing in total, but that underperformance was isolated and we feel confident about prospects for Enterprise & Infrastructure going forward. 
We have very good customer relationships in this segment with stable to expanding share of wallet in all major business relationships. We do expect margins to continue expansion as revenue growth -- as we experience revenue growth over the balance of the year, along with the benefits of cost reductions already underway in certain sites in Western Europe.
Very strong results and overperformance from our Diversified Manufacturing Services group, outstanding margin performance as well as sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. 
Many of you might be interested in a specific High Velocity customer, which I want to forewarn you we will not be able to answer any questions about specific customer relationships. However, recognizing the state of uncertain generally and as a result of some of the more uneven results in fiscal Q2, we thought it'd be helpful to help you understand and characterize the balance of our fiscal year. We've prepared some material to help you along with how we see the balance of the fiscal year for our company. If you could please turn to Slide 12. 
Using our fiscal first quarter results and the midpoint of our fiscal second quarter guidance, revenue for the first half of fiscal '12 should be approximately $8.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we expect the Diversified Manufacturing group to continue leading growth. We have the organic growth contribution from Aftermarket Services, which is typically at least 12% to 15% per year, combined with the benefit of the Telmar acquisition. We also continue to expect results in Materials Technology Group and the industrial & clean tech and the healthcare & instrumentation business areas to continue expansion over the course of the year. 
Given our market share and relatively stable demand trends in the Enterprise & Infrastructure group, and I want to highlight that, we see relatively stable demand trends in Enterprise & Infrastructure. And we see growth in the second half exceeding the first half, which we think is reasonable.
We're being conservative about revenue performance in High Velocity in the second of the year. This chart would indicate we're expecting a contraction of approximately $110 million in the second half of the year. However, the quality of that revenue in High Velocity and the margins should continue to be above the high end of our long-term targeted margin range. 
In essence, as a result for the fiscal '12, we have approximately $9 billion in the second half and a  total year revenue of about $17.4 billion. We're not trying to handicap anything more or less into this picture, just providing you a viewpoint as to where we think we are today and how the balance of the year might unfold.
Please turn to Slide 13. Should the year unfold at about this level, I would regard this as a solid year with a good trend in business mix toward the Diversified Manufacturing Services business area. Margin and profit expansion can take place on a much more moderate revenue growth, which I would regard as a very good thing. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Diversified Manufacturing Services group growth is underpinned by a very substantial market opportunity for the company, approximately a $500 billion addressable market with very low levels of penetration. And you can find this chart highlighted on our annual report, the fiscal '12 annual report, and that actually goes into additional detail of market subsegments in each of these business areas. Jabil has a leading or at least a beachhead position in all of these areas, and we look to significant growth in these areas over the next 3, 4, 5 years.
Turn to Slide 15, please. So in summary, we regard our first fiscal quarter and the fiscal year to be solid performance in an uncertain environment. We expect moderate revenue growth in fiscal '12. That's a little bit lower than what we just -- experience historically. But good solid revenue growth underpinned by a strong improvement in portfolio mix towards Diversified Manufacturing Services.
We are continuing our focus on lean manufacturing and operating efficiency, and all of these elements combined will help us keep us on track towards a third consecutive record year for the company in terms of revenue, income and EPS. Long-term business objectives remain on track, and we look forward to fiscal '12 and fiscal '13 and beyond."

I mean, I think that's based on what we see today. So our long-term growth objectives remain on track, 20% to 30% in Diversified Manufacturing Services and 5% to 10% in the other business areas. If we look back in fiscal '12 over growth in fiscal '11 and '12, we'll certainly be, if not in the range, above the range of growth for those business areas. So I'm having a hard time getting to your interpretation of where we are. And actually, this growth is in terms of top line growth. It might be a little bit below were analysts had us in the -- after the conference call in September. But given the portfolio mix towards Diversified Manufacturing Services, the income and EPS associated with this revenue stream is roughly equivalent. So I would regard this as a nice trade-out of lower-margin revenue for a better earnings profile and more sustainability. So I think I'd take fiscal '12 particularly in this environment."

But let's take Enterprise & Infrastructure first, which underperformed in the first quarter. That's really now about revenue growth. And as we have said in  the prepared remarks, essentially the guidance we're providing is it'll grow through the balance of the second fiscal quarter and the balance of the year. So we should see some pretty reasonable margin progression. I'll remind you that last quarter, we discussed the closure of our sites in Northern Italy. So there -- those -- that's underway. We'd anticipate that, that does occur. There'll be some benefit in the February quarter, obviously, and lead to margin accretion. And then we'd see the full benefit of those closures in the third or fourth quarter. But principally, we add back the revenue, we see the growth and we'll start to see margins progress from 2.5%. And I would expect us to be very close to the low end of our operating targets as we head -- as we get to the first fiscal quarter here. I remind everyone that the long-term target is in a range of 4% to 4.5%. In terms of the High Velocity arena, as you see, extremely pleased with the performance in the first fiscal quarter. And the way we think about that is that we did have some high utilization of assets in a seasonally high first quarter. So I would expect some decline in those margins as we move forward through the balance of the year. Sequentially, we do see revenues coming down as a result of this November high season. So the way to think about that is probably certainly above the high end of our targeted range, 2.5%, to somewhere around probably approaching the 3% for the balance of the year."

About half was associated with excess inventory, buffer inventory to cover inbound transition of programs from a large customer. And they've set a buffer inventory that was larger than needed to support that product transition, and we're working down those buffers now with that customer. And then there was a couple of other customers that are just going through general inventory correction, which we think will rectify very quickly. So I think it's really important to say that the underlying demand is relatively stable.

That's the current target. And we should then see continued pickup in Q3 and then Q4 again as we see revenues continue to ramp towards the low end of our targeted range of 4 to 4.5 points."

So underlying demand trends are okay. And that's why we're pointing to a few isolated customer relationships. We don't want to give investors the wrong message because this always seems to flow back to specific customers, which can be embarrassing and frankly is not true. Computing -- the storage market was actually a bright spot, and we've seen very stable to upper [ph] demand, and we're growing share of wallet in the storage business area. The telecommunications area, particularly wireless infrastructure demand, is good, but we're seeing some inventory leveling and some technology changes that elongate some of the product transitions to Jabil. And then the other elements of Enterprise & Infrastructure, nothing to write home about in terms of great growth, but decent stability. And I think most of the marketplace has been sensitized to expect lower levels of annual year-over-year growth in the data communications area in particular. So I think it's nothing remarkable. We're certainly disappointed in the first fiscal quarter performance relative to our expectation. But relative to previous years' performance in fiscal Q1, not a great deal worse than in fiscal '11 and fiscal '10. And actually, when we look through the balance of the year, very high confidence levels that our revenue growth will resume growth in Q2 and continue throughout the year."

I think the talking heads on TV are pulling their hair out at a faster rate, but I think the overall economic environment isn't getting a lot worse or a lot better, not changing rapidly. Things seem to be a little bit better in the United States, a little bit slower in Europe. Asia continues to be stable. So I think that the economic environment is relatively benign, if you will, in terms of influence. $600 million of incremental revenue growth, as you point out, is pretty similar what we have last year. We see -- if you look at the Enterprise & Infrastructure portion of that, we essentially get back $166 million that wasn't there in fiscal Q1 because that's a share of wallet issue and a sell-through rate issue. So once that inventory is consumed and the product transitions are completed, you get that -- basically that same run rate back into the revenue stream. And then there are some additional customer programs we expect to ramp in the production over the course of Q3 and Q4. So we feel good about it in Enterprise & Infrastructure, actually a very good line of sight to that as well. And then in Diversified Manufacturing Services, gosh, well, 30% year-over-year in Q1. Materials Technology, Aftermarket Services, industrial all have very good growth prospects through the balance of the year. We're actually -- we've seeing growth in areas like defense and aerospace. So we feel good about the line of sight to growth in those areas as well. And I think one of the reasons we went through this, we want to make sure that investors are in touch with the -- what we think is a realistic perspective on the High Velocity business segment and actually seeing that contract in the second half of the year. And that attenuates the revenue growth for the year. Yet again, the margin profile and earnings power of the company is unaffected by that -- actually improved by that change out of High Velocity revenue for Enterprise & Infrastructure and Diversified Manufacturing Services. So actually, a pretty good trade-out in our calculus of how the year should unfold. I think what you've got to do to put faith in this is you've got to believe that macroeconomic conditions continue at about the same rate. And again, I made the comment in -- during my prepared remarks that we're not trying to handicap anything more or less into this guidance, simply what we see today based on sell-through rates in the current economic environment. If you're someone who thinks the environment is going to get a lot worse, then this is probably something you wont to have faith in. If you believe the economic environment will probably continue to be relatively tepid or lackluster, I think this is something you can put a lot of faith in. And I think the company has put up spectacular results in the face of significant macroeconomic headwinds, and I don't think those headwinds are any worse today than they have been in fiscal '11 or previously. So we wanted to help people understand how we see the balance of the year given all the moving parts and all of the collateral information that people have been getting over the last 3 or 4 months and worrying about, frankly. So we're looking for what we think is a pretty solid year, maybe a little bit lower revenue growth, but earnings that will compare very favorably with fiscal '11."

We came in slightly [ph] -- on plan there, $95 million actually for the first quarter. So our overall expectations for the year, if we add in our second fiscal quarter, the point of guidance is $85 million. It's actually somewhere between $350 million to $400 million in terms of capital expenditures for the year is where our thoughts are currently. So last year, we spent on a net basis, I think, $426 million, something of that nature. So a little bit shy of that. In addition, obviously, we -- you have this ""Telmar acquisition"" of about $130 million. So investors at that point in terms of modeling cash flow. In terms of the overall cash flows, I think the question related to performance in terms of the cash flow depending on revenue growth. Currently, with the back half of the year that we articulated in the prepared remarks today, our working capital management has really been, in my opinion, outstanding over the last multiple quarters, the last 5 or 6 quarters. And I don't see anything that would change that level of performance as I look through the balance of the fiscal year. So what that does, based on the view we have of the balance of our fiscal year, certainly provides us an opportunity of somewhere in that $175 million, $200 million-plus a quarter of operating cash flow. Take off these CapEx levels and expenditures [ph]  that we talked about and you're producing $250 million of free cash flow for the year. If revenue should grow faster than our current view of the back half of the fiscal year, there will be some degradation to those cash flows purely based upon the amount of working capital that we need. And the way we typically think about that is somewhere in the region of $0.05 to $0.10 of our working capital need for every incremental dollar of revenue. Should we see softness, then clearly cash flows will outperform these levels I've just discussed."

I think having said that, we're not a company that thinks that the management team should [indiscernible] all excess cash. We think our first priority is to invest the cash in the business. We had a slide that showed our 26% GAAP income return on invested capital. Our cost of capital is under 9%.

Welcome to our first quarter of 2012 earnings call. Joining me today are President and CEO, Timothy Main; and Chief Financial Officer, Forbes Alexander.
This call is being recorded and will be posted for audio playback on the Jabil website, jabil.com, in the Investors section. Our first quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we cover during this conference call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with Slide 2 of forward-looking statement.
During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected second quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earnings results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011 on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
You may have noticed in our last earnings call and in our recently published annual report, we have begun to highlight GAAP operating results. While we are currently still reporting and publishing core results, it is our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we will also be providing guidance on our long-term year-over-year outlook. This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we've run the business, making strategic long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our first quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander on the results as well as guidance on our second fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with some macroenvironment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from our call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

I'll ask you to refer to Slide 3. Our net revenue for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $170.8 million or 3.9% of revenue, which compares to $156 million GAAP",958,"Thank you, Beth. Hello, everyone. I'll ask you to refer to Slide 3. Our net revenue for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $170.8 million or 3.9% of revenue, which compares to $156 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.1 billion or 3.8% in the same period in the prior year.
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation increased 7% to $194.6 million. It represents 4.5% of revenue. This compares to $181.9 million or 4.5% for the same period in the prior year.
On a sequential basis, revenue increased 1% in the first quarter while core-operating income increased 4%. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.65, an increase of 7% over the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for first quarter was $0.54, an increase of 10% over the prior year. 
Now I'll ask you to refer to Slide 4 for our segment discussion.  In the first quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 30% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, representing 42% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 6.8% of revenue. 
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased 4% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 28% of total company revenue, and core-operating income for the segment was 2% of revenue.
Our Enterprise & Infrastructure performance was below expectations, as we experienced revenue reductions late in the quarter as a result of inventory leveling with specific large customers associated with specific mix and inbound product transitions. We expect a return to revenue growth and improved core operating income performance the balance of the fiscal year.
While our High Velocity segment performed above our expectations for the quarter, segment revenues decreased by 14% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 30% of total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 3.8% of revenue. Now on a sequential basis, we saw strength across the whole segment and core operating income performance exceeded our expectations primarily as a result of fixed-cost leverage in a seasonally high quarter. It's also now interesting to note that we have one 10% customer in each of our segments. 
I'll ask you to refer to Slide 5 for the review of our balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with cash balances of $862 million. Inventory was approximately $2.4 billion, representing a 7% increase primarily associated with our Enterprise & Infrastructure business where we experienced some weakness late in the quarter. Inventory turns remained at 7. Overall working capital management remained well controlled. As a result, cash flows from operations was approximately $115 million in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was $275 million or 6.4%, an expansion of 30 basis points over the same period a year ago.
With regard to capital allocation, we continue to maintain a balanced approach, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $95 million as we continued to invest in new infrastructure to support our targeted markets and capabilities. In the second quarter of the fiscal year, we expect CapEx levels of approximately $80 million to $90 million, reflective of capacity and infrastructure to support higher levels of production in the second half of the fiscal year.
During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14%, bringing our yearly cash dividend to $0.32 per share. And while we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, we still have $100 million available on our authorization for the fiscal year. 
We're also pleased to announce the completion of the Telmar acquisition on December 1 with a purchase price of approximately $130 million. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Telmar employees to Jabil. Moving forward, Telmar's results will be incorporated in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, specifically within the specialized services business where their capabilities strengthen the depth and scope of our current Aftermarket Services business. Required revenue is approximately $145 million per year.
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 6 and 7 for summary of the quarter's performance. We are pleased with the first quarter's results. Core operating margin was 4.5%, the high end of our guidance. And revenue is at the lower end of our guidance, reflective of continued operational efficiency, diversification of our revenue stream. 
Returns on invested capital, calculated on a GAAP net income basis, expanded 2% on a year-over-year basis, 26%, providing leading [ph] capital returns in the EMS industry.
And I'll ask you to refer to Slide 9 and 10 while I discuss our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 4%, a range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. On a sequential basis, overall revenue and operating guidance are consistent with the levels of seasonality we experienced in fiscal 2011. 
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $185 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.4%. Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.52 to $0.62 per diluted share based upon diluted share count of 213 million shares. Based upon the current estimates of production, tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18% for the quarter and the year.
Turning to our segments, the year-on-year performance for Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 25%. Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to be consistent on a year-over-year basis. Finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decrease 14% on a year-over-year basis.
And now I'd like to hand over the call to Tim Main."
96078,144394466,203106,"Jabil Circuit Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Jabil Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Forbes. Well, the first fiscal quarter of 2012 is an interesting quarter. Very solid results, if a little more uneven than we would typically like. Enterprise & Infrastructure was disappointing in total, but that underperformance was isolated a",778,"Thank you, Forbes. Well, the first fiscal quarter of 2012 is an interesting quarter. Very solid results, if a little more uneven than we would typically like. Enterprise & Infrastructure was disappointing in total, but that underperformance was isolated and we feel confident about prospects for Enterprise & Infrastructure going forward. 
We have very good customer relationships in this segment with stable to expanding share of wallet in all major business relationships. We do expect margins to continue expansion as revenue growth -- as we experience revenue growth over the balance of the year, along with the benefits of cost reductions already underway in certain sites in Western Europe.
Very strong results and over performance from our Diversified Manufacturing Services group, outstanding margin performance as well as sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. 
Many of you might be interested in a specific High Velocity customer, which I want to forewarn you we will not be able to answer any questions about specific customer relationships. However, recognizing the state of uncertain generally and as a result of some of the more uneven results in fiscal Q2, we thought it'd be helpful to help you understand and characterize the balance of our fiscal year and we've prepared some material to help you along with how we see the balance of the fiscal year for our company. 
If you could please turn to Slide 12. Using our fiscal first quarter results and the midpoint of our fiscal second quarter guidance, revenue for the first half of fiscal '12 should be approximately $8.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we expect the Diversified Manufacturing group to continue leading growth. We have the organic growth contribution from Aftermarket Services, which is typically at least 12% to 15% per year, combined with the benefit of the Telmar acquisition. We also continue to expect results in Materials Technology Group and the industrial & clean tech and the healthcare & instrumentation business areas to continue expansion over the course of the year. 
Given our market share and relatively stable demand trends in the Enterprise & Infrastructure group, and I want to highlight that, we see relatively stable demand trends in Enterprise & Infrastructure. And we see growth in the second half exceeding the first half, which we think is reasonable.
We're being conservative about revenue performance in High Velocity in the second of the year. This chart would indicate we're expecting a contraction of approximately $110 million in the second half of the year. However, the quality of that revenue in High Velocity and the margins should continue to be above the high end of our long-term targeted margin range. 
In essence, this resulted in fiscal '12 of approximately $9 billion in the second half and a total year revenue of about $17.4 billion. We're not trying to handicap anything more or less into this picture, just providing you a viewpoint as to where we think we are today and how the balance of the year might unfold.
Please turn to Slide 13. Should the year unfold at about this level, I would regard it as a solid year with a good trend in business mix toward the Diversified Manufacturing Services business area. Margin and profit expansion can take place on a much more moderate revenue growth, which I would regard as a very good thing. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Diversified Manufacturing Services group growth is underpinned by a very substantial market opportunity for the company, approximately a $500 billion addressable market with very low levels of penetration. And you can find this chart highlighted on our annual report, the fiscal '12 annual report, and that actually goes into additional detail of market subsegments in each of these business areas. Jabil has a leading or at least a beachhead position in all of these areas, and we look to significant growth in these areas over the next 3, 4, 5 years.
Turn to Slide 15, please. So in summary, we regard our first fiscal quarter and the fiscal year to be solid performance in an uncertain environment. We expect moderate revenue growth in fiscal '12. That's a little bit lower than what we just -- experience historically. But good solid revenue growth underpinned by a strong improvement in portfolio mix towards Diversified Manufacturing Services.
We are continuing our focus on lean manufacturing and operating efficiency, and all of these elements combined will help us -- keep us on track towards a third consecutive record year for the company in terms of revenue, income and EPS. Our long-term business objectives remain on track, and we look forward to fiscal '12 and fiscal '13 and beyond."

So I'm having a hard time getting to your interpretation of where we are. And actually this growth, in terms of top line growth, might be a little bit below were analysts had us in the -- after the conference call in September. But given the portfolio mix towards Diversified Manufacturing Services, the income and EPS associated with this revenue stream is roughly equivalent. So I would regard this as a nice trade-out of lower-margin revenue for a better earnings profile and more sustainability. So I think I'd take fiscal '12, particularly in this environment."

But let's take Enterprise & Infrastructure first, which underperformed in the first quarter. That's really now about revenue growth. And as we have said in the prepared remarks, essentially the guidance we're providing is it'll grow through the balance of the second fiscal quarter and the balance of the year. So we should see some pretty reasonable margin progression. I'll remind you that last quarter, we discussed the closure of our sites in Northern Italy. So there -- those -- that's underway. We'd anticipate that, that does occur. There'll be some benefit in the February quarter, obviously, and lead to margin accretion. And then we'd see the full benefit of those closures in the third or fourth quarter. But principally, we add back the revenue, we see the growth and we'll start to see margins progress from 2.5%. And I would expect us to be very close to the low end of our operating targets as we head -- as we get to the first fiscal quarter here. I remind everyone that the long-term target is in a range of 4% to 4.5%. In terms of the High Velocity arena, as you see, extremely pleased with the performance in the first fiscal quarter. And the way we think about that is that we did have some high utilization of assets in a seasonally high first quarter. So I would expect some decline in those margins as we move forward through the balance of the year. Sequentially, we do see revenues coming down as a result of this November high season. So the way to think about that is probably certainly above the high end of our targeted range, 2.5%, to somewhere around probably approaching the 3% for the balance of the year."

I think the talking heads on TV are pulling their hair out at a faster rate, but I think the overall economic environment isn't getting a lot worse or a lot better, not changing rapidly. Things seem to be a little bit better in the United States, a little bit slower in Europe. Asia continues to be stable. So I think that the economic environment is relatively benign, if you will, in terms of influence. $600 million of incremental revenue growth, as you point out, is pretty similar to what we had last year. We see -- if you look at the Enterprise & Infrastructure portion of that, we essentially get back $166 million that wasn't there in fiscal Q1 because that's a share of wallet issue and a sell-through rate issue. So once that inventory is consumed and the product transitions are completed, you get that -- basically that same run rate back into the revenue stream. And then there are some additional customer programs we expect to ramp in the production over the course of Q3 and Q4. So we feel good about it in Enterprise & Infrastructure, actually a very good line of sight to that as well. And then in Diversified Manufacturing Services, gosh, we're 30% year-over-year in Q1. Materials Technology, Aftermarket Services, industrial all have very good growth prospects through the balance of the year. We're actually even seeing growth in areas like defense and aerospace. So we feel good about the line of sight to growth in those areas as well. And I think one of the reasons we went through this, we want to make sure that investors are in touch with the -- what we think is a realistic perspective on the High Velocity business segment and actually seeing that contract in the second half of the year. And that attenuates the revenue growth for the year. Yet again, the margin profile and earnings power of the company is unaffected by that -- actually improved by that change out of High Velocity revenue for Enterprise & Infrastructure and Diversified Manufacturing Services. So it's actually a pretty good trade-out in our calculus of how the year should unfold. I think what you've got to do to put faith in this is you've got to believe that macroeconomic conditions continue at about the same rate. And again, I made the comment in -- during my prepared remarks that we're not trying to handicap anything more or less into this guidance, simply what we see today based on sell-through rates in the current economic environment. If you're someone who thinks the environment is going to get a lot worse, then this is probably something you won't have faith in. If you believe the economic environment will probably continue to be relatively tepid or lackluster, I think this is something you can put a lot of faith in. And I think the company has put up spectacular results in the face of significant macroeconomic headwinds, and I don't think those headwinds are any worse today than they have been in fiscal '11 or previously. So we wanted to help people understand how we see the balance of the year given all the moving parts and all of the collateral information that people have been getting over the last 3 or 4 months and worrying about, frankly. So we're looking for what we think is a pretty solid year, maybe a little bit lower revenue growth, but earnings that will compare very favorably with fiscal '11."

But I think it's -- I think Forbes and I would be comfortable with the expectation that High Velocity operating margins for the year can start with a 3, probably somewhere in the low 3s. And we expect to see -- I don't recall if we mentioned this in our prepared remarks or Q&A, but we do see the Enterprise & Infrastructure margins improving over the course of the year by about 50 basis points per quarter.

We came in slightly on point, $95 million actually for the first quarter. So our overall expectations for the year, if we add in our second fiscal quarter, the point of guidance is $85 million. It's actually somewhere between $350 million to $400 million in terms of capital expenditures for the year is where our thoughts are currently. So last year, we spent on a net basis, I think, $426 million, something of that nature. So a little bit shy of that. In addition, obviously we -- you have this ""Telmar acquisition"" of about $130 million. So investors at that point in terms of modeling cash flow. In terms of the overall cash flows, I think the question related to performance in terms of the cash flow depending on revenue growth. Currently, with the back half of the year that we articulated in the prepared remarks today, our working capital management has really been, in my opinion, outstanding over the last multiple quarters, the last 5 or 6 quarters. And I don't see anything that would change that level of performance as I look through the balance of the fiscal year. So what that does, based on the view we have of the balance of our fiscal year, certainly provides us an opportunity of somewhere in that $175 million, $200 million-plus a quarter of operating cash flow. Take off these CapEx levels and expenditures [ph] that we talked about and you're producing $250 million of free cash flow for the year. If revenue should grow faster than our current view of the back half of the fiscal year, there will be some degradation to those cash flows purely based upon the amount of working capital that we need. And the way we typically think about that is somewhere in the region of $0.05 to $0.10 of our working capital need for every incremental dollar of revenue. Should we see softness, then clearly cash flows will outperform these levels I've just discussed."

But we do see more significant growth from the healthcare & instrumentation and the industrial & clean tech groups in the second half of the year. And now unfortunately, we've not been able to turn growth in those areas into the linear growth ramps. They tend to be relatively stair step and come in some chunks with stair step and then moderate growth sequentially. And that's why we're really converting or thinking to looking at things in a year-over-year basis because it does a better job of characterizing the actual growth rate in those areas. The other thing I'd say, Sherri, is just looking at the present core and the present environment, the semi-cap equipment area of industrial & clean tech and the healthcare & instrumentation group, that is weak and diluting the results in that area. We expect that to kind of either stay where it is or maybe even modestly improve in fiscal '12, but not looking for -- that has the impact of diluting the sequential growth near term."
