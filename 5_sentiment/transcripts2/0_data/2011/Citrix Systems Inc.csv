26524,118256980,95659,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $530 million in total revenue, nearly $100 million increase to defer",1671,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $530 million in total revenue, nearly $100 million increase to deferred revenue and $180 million in cash flow from operations. 
For the full year 2010, total revenue was up 16% to $1.87 billion, GAAP earnings per share increased 41% to $1.46 and adjusted EPS was $2.08. I'm really pleased with our execution in the field, gains in net app and the vast and growing leadership across desktop virtualization, trends that can be clearly seen in our financials. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, revenue from new license sales was $196 million, up 17% from last year. License update revenue increased 13% annually driven by demand for subscription advantage renewals and XenDesktop Trade-up program. Tech services increased 40% led by record consulting utilization and support agreements attached to our NetScaler products. And finally, online SaaS revenue was $95 million, up 16%.
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 27% from last year to $239 million. Included in this number is product license growth of about 36% year-on-year, and 16 transactions greater than $1 million. Internationally, the business environment was mixed in Q4, similar to what we've seen all year. Japan and Pacific combined for a steady 15% year-over-year revenue growth while EMEA revenue was up 7% to $153 million as we continue to see uneven demand across Europe. This was despite closing $12 million plus transactions in the region. We remain a little cautious on these markets going into 2011. 
So overall, a very solid quarter to cap off a great year for Citrix. As we entered 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline continue at record levels. We remain focused on delivering financial results while investing to expand our capabilities and capacity across our main product categories of Desktop, Data Center and cloud and SaaS. 
So let's now take a look at Q3 resulted in those three areas. First, our Desktop solutions business grew 14% over last year to over $325 million including license growth of 16%. The results were led by XenDesktop, with strong demand drove total revenue of $95 million, up 60% sequentially, and up 230% from last year. Of the $62 million in XenDesktop license revenue, approximately 70% came from new licenses and 30% from licenses acquired through the Trade-up program. 
So to provide a little more context on the XenDesktop business in Q4, there are a few metrics I think really demonstrate the breath of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, more than $30 million of the growth in deferred revenue during Q4 is attributable to XD subscription advantage renewals and trade ups. 15 of the 29 deals over $1 million in the quarter included XenDesktop licenses. There are more than 230 XD transactions greater than 1,000 seats each and over 30 with 5,000 seats each. Downloadable licenses increased by more than 100% sequentially. And finally, over 3,000 different customers bought XenDesktop in the period. So throughout 2010, we captured almost 10,000 XD customers, up 3x over 32009 with 5,000 of them taking advantage of the 2010 trade up promotions.
So our installed base of XenApp customers represents over 20 million licenses in total with more than 12 million of those currently active on assay. Last year, we designed a trade-up promotion to migrate the most strategic segment of these customers, ultimately upgrading almost 15% of the active SA base. This month, we announced a new Trade-up program targeting the entire XenApp base providing an ongoing upgrade and migration path to XenDesktop. This program features a new concurrent licensing option and three new ways to trade up, including Trade-up Plus, for easy more project driven upgrades to XenDesktop with some incentives for purchasing additional licenses; Trade Up Max, which is for enterprisewide migration to XenDesktop; and Trade-up Restart, offering the benefits of trade up for customers with expired SA. The new Trade-up program really gives our partners and communities a more complete set of tools to leverage our large installed base of customers.
said, looking at our Data Center and Cloud business, revenue was up 27% in the quarter to $85 million. Growth is led with the NetScaler products particularly with cloud and Internet-centric and government agencies. We're also still seeing really good traction with enterprise customers, accounting former than half of the top 20 deals in this business. 
Regarding the specific platforms, we saw strong growth in the midrange of NetScaler MPX appliances due to the enterprise uptake. And additionally, the VPX line of virtual appliances continues to do really well with the revenue up more than 15% sequentially, and unit volume up 100% as the cloud service provider addition is getting broader adoption.
In WAN optimization, Branch Repeater revenue nearly doubled from Q4 of last year with growth coming across all product additions. Besides the government, which has always been the largest vertical market here, we're also seeing an increasing attach rate to desktop virtualization deployments as customers are leveraging more of our end-to-end solutions in their infrastructure. 
And finally, touching our SaaS business, revenue was up 16% in the fourth quarter to $95 million. For the full year, it was up 17% and now represents almost 20% of total Citrix revenues. The growth here continues to be led by the collaboration of products and the GoToMeeting family, which were up just about 30% of fourth quarter.
We believe that there's a large SaaS opportunity in international markets as customers grow more comfortable with this delivery model. We've already seen some early success and market share gains with ago to products in Europe, particularly with the recent launch of GoToMeeting in France and Germany. So in an effort to accelerate the expansion in this area, we recently announced our intent to acquire Net Viewer, an online collaboration business based in Germany. Net Viewer currently has over 200 employees and is built on install base of more than 18,000 customers across enterprise and SMB. This acquisition also brings the Citrix Online a seasoned team to help manage our international growth going forward. So right now, we currently expect the transaction to close in mid February.
So turning to expenses and operations. In Q4, adjusted op margin was 28%, up 100 basis points sequentially, and in line with a year ago. For the full year, adjusted op margin expanded by 227 basis points to 26%, which is significantly higher than our initial 2010 guidance. This is really a result of improved revenue performance and our continued focus on execution. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind the demand growth we're seeing in the market so as bookings, pipeline and POCs all accelerated. We've grown headcount pretty significant with a focus on two areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, consulting capacity and tech support; and second, product innovation, to bring the market new technologies as well as improving integration of the total solution to drive simplicity and better end user experience. 
In Q4, we added nearly 250 new people to Citrix, which brings the full year increase to more than 800. Looking into Q1, the rate of hiring will slow as we work to integrate the new members and really start ramping productivity. so on the balance sheet, cash and investments increased $1.7 billion, up 39% from 2009 driven by $179 million in cash flow from ops. And for the full year, total cash flow from operations was $616 million, which is up 28% over the prior period.
Also in Q4, we purchased 1.9 million shares with an average price of $66. And year-to-date, we bought back about 8.3 million shares at an average cost of $53 per share.
To further revenue of the end of the year was a record $779 million, which is up 26% from 2010. Q4 alone, as I said, we added nearly $100 million to the deferred revenue balance which is our highest sequential growth ever. Three main drivers for this were the increase in renewal rates for subscription advantage, the success of the XenDesktop Trade-up program and tax services contracts for consulting education and support.
So overall, really a great Q4. We're executing well, seeing growth in all of our primary businesses and making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while expanding our go-to-market capacity.
So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q1 and for the full year 2011. Overall, we are raising revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2011. However, since it is the first time that we provided any quarterly breakdown, I'm aware that the shape of the year is different than any of the published models particularly with regard to expenses in Q1. So to point out a couple of things here, the most significant items in Q1 include the full impact of Q3, Q4 headcount investments, where productivity will ramp through the year and from the acquisition of Net Viewer, assuming an early February close. And due to the purchase accounting adjustments, another one-time costs. We're going to realize several pennies of EPS dilution in the first half of the year, which should be offset by the end of the year.
So taking that all into account, for the full-year 2011, our current expectations have increased to total revenue in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion and adjusted EPS of between $2.29 and $2.33 per share. For the first quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenues to be in the range of $470 million to $475 million, adjusted tax rate of approximately 23% and adjusted EPS of between $0.40 and $0.41. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarterly performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

Today, we are reporting another record-breaking quarter and year for Citrix in both revenue and EPS. I'm very pleased with our 2010 strategic, operating and financial results, further establishing Citrix's leadership in virtual computing. 2010 was highlighted by three primary things in my mind: Stronger market positions in Desktop Virtualization, Web Collaboration and app networking; second, significant strategic visibility into IT executive suite; and third, solid operating leverage in our financials. Importantly, our go-to-market transformation has elevated our presence as a strategic vendor with significant increases in key level engagement, step ups in SI pipelines and deal flow, upselling end-to-end technologies and cross selling our networking products. You can see it in our results, a larger mix of seven-figure deals than ever, greater use of our products as an end-to-end system, record growth of technical services, especially consulting and strength in SA renewals. I'm extremely proud of the Citrix team and thankful to thousands of Citrix partners and customers, both long-standing and knee for their business, their confidence and their enthusiasm for our strategic vision. 
Here's how we'll drive the business this year. Five things: First, continued go-to-market evolution with direct customer touch and a larger mix of business from SI and service provider channels; second, increased depth in select strategic projects that's further develop the virtual computing markets we're in and broaden our reach; third, customer programs and services built around our Desktop transformation model to accelerate the adoption of Desktop Virtualization; fourth, expanded brand awareness in virtualization, networking and cloud computing spaces; and fifth and as always, an amazing innovation agenda for all of our product lines and services. So next, I'd like to give some additional color in several areas of the business starting with Web Collaboration. 
Around the globe, web, audio and video collaboration continue to go mainstream, converging and moving toward mass-market appeal, fueled by solid economic globalization and productivity trends, empowering our Online Services business to 17% growth with over $360 million into 2010 revenue and increasing our share in web collaboration, now garnering the number two position. 
In October, we announced GoToMeeting with HD faces, adding stunning HD videoconferencing to GoToMeeting. We also introduced GoToMeeting for French and German-speaking markets and achieved some early customer successes in those markets in Q4. As David mentioned, to accelerate our European expansion, we're acquiring Germany-based Net Viewer, adding go-to-market capacity, management depth and a larger customer footprint, and building on our current strength in the U.K. and north Nordic regions. In 2011, we'll focus on fully integrating the Net Viewer business on new go-to-market programs, on higher impact partnerships, on strengthening of our remote access and support services and on executing in the international marketplace. In addition, our growth plan includes even richer collaboration experiences, partner app integrations and expanded mobile device support including GoToMyPC for the iPad.
Next is our Desktop Virtualization business, where we've now shipped over 6 million licenses since the release of XenDesktop 4, just five quarters ago. 2010 was a milestone year for XenDesktop, growing 400% to about $250 million in revenue and becoming the growth engine of our overall desktop computing business. 
In Q4, we shipped over a million licenses with some customer wins across geographies, segments and scale. For example, a large U.S.-based healthcare providers, one of the virtual desktop platforms for flexible access to electronic medical records and other apps for 20,000 employees. After selecting Citrix in a head-to-head competitive takeoff, they traded up 4,600 Xen app licenses to XenDesktop Platinum. And then, they added 2,000 new licenses on top of that. An Asia-based customer in financial services with an extensive branch network abandoned their first-generation virtual infrastructure stack for a full XenDesktop stack, signing a deal for 2,500 feet, and then added Citrix networking products to ensure a secure available and SaaS  end-to-end user experience. 
Another example is a petroleum company with 2,000 employees throughout Australia needed a virtual Desktop solutions to serve a wide variety of end points over networks and user scenarios. They chose XenDesktop for its flex-pass technology to deliver a mix of posted share desktops, VDI desktops, virtual apps and local VM desktops running XenClient technology. This deal was a joint win with Microsoft Word the customers leveraging a combined Desktop and server virtualization stack, all managed by Microsoft system center.
The largest XenDesktop deal in the quarter was with a major European government agency. They purchased platinum edition as an end-to-end solution for centralizing apps, desktops and data for 150,000 users to support a vast array of devices, to reach mobile and branch workers and to achieve new levels of security. The deal was closed in collaboration with a global SI partner and Microsoft with Citrix consulting services assisting with architectural design and implementation strategy. So these are a few examples to give you a sense of what's happening with customers in the market.
Looking forward, there are three focal points for our Desktop business: First, drive mass-market demand; second, raise the bar in innovation; and third, expand the desktop to web and SaaS  apps. So our biggest XenDesktop growth opportunity lies in developing primary demand for virtualization of the desktop to drive the mass market. We still consider the market to be in earlier stages with the potential to go mainstream as an enterprisewide solution. 
Entering 2011, it's clear that virtual desktops are high-priority for many IT teams, actually becoming a budget line item and being acknowledged as a strategic element of overall IT spend. Our focus is in market segments where security, business flexibility and central management are most critical, in particular, banking, healthcare and government. We already have an impressive set of large-scale successful implementations to reference in these segments.
In 2011, we'll build on our go-to-market partnerships that accelerate core demand in collaboration with Microsoft, with Cisco on the ECS platform, with Desktop as a service offering, with Citrix SI as including CSE, Fujitsu, IBM and Accenture. With Intel and major OEMs including Dell, HP and Lenovo, and with over 400 Citrix-ready business partners. The opportunity is to transform the enterprise desktop to an on-demand service, offering new ways to migrate to Windows 7, to rethink traditional hardware refresh cycles, to embrace amazing new consumer devices and to bring SaaS  apps into the enterprise. 
From a technology perspective, we're driving the market with Citrix Receiver, our universal client for IT services, allowing IT to say yes to millions of new devices entering the enterprise from personal laptops to tablets to smartphones, making Citrix the one company that can truly deliver IT as a service to any device, anywhere securely. Over the past few weeks, Receiver has been one of the top two free business apps in the new Mac app store. Receiver was featured prominently in Google's Promo as Notebook launch, and Receiver embedded in Motorola's 4G smartphone helped it earned best of show at CES. In 2010, receiver was downloaded over 1.8 million x across a wide variety of consumer laptops, tablet and smartphone platforms.
Virtual apps continue to be an essential part of the virtual desktop. Last year, XenApp 6 launch set a new standard for user density, overall scalability, integration with Microsoft systems center and support for Windows Server 2008. From here, product advancements will continue at a rapid pace, giving customers lower cost through innovation and management, scalability and storage, making the path to desktop virtualization more clear, more compelling and more economical than ever.
Last year's introduction of XenDesktop 5 in October was a significant step forward, delivering major product simplifications that make simplification, installation and set up faster and easier, a completely new and powerful management operations console. Optimizations for XenServer that significantly reduces cost while reducing the level of BBI performance and VM density. Self-service apps including single sign-on for Windows, web and SaaS  applications; secure centrally managed desktop to go with our Xen client feature and lots more.
2011 will mark another year where innovations will further in the cost of virtual desktops while distancing ourselves from competitive solutions through better design, broader device support, better partnerships and greater leverage of our Flex Pass technology.
Going forward, SaaS and web apps are rapidly becoming a core part of the Desktop computing experience. That's why we've made the seamless integration of SaaS and web apps into both virtual and physical desktops, a core feature of XenDesktop 5 and a top priority on our innovation agenda. For the user, this takes self-service to an entirely new different level, giving them an easy way to access any window, SaaS or web app with a single click and a single log-in. They are even synchronized across devices, a Citrix invention we call following the apps.
For the first time, IT gets three core things first, centrally manage account creation for hundreds of SaaS apps like salesforce and NetSuite, success factors and as examples that are fully integrated with active directory. Secondly, IT gets powerful workflow that automatically enable or disable user access. And thirdly, license monitoring and auditing to reduce cost and to enable better compliance management. 
Extending the benefits of access control, management and the single sign-on to web and SaaS apps is one more way we are helping IT to embrace consumerization while controlling what matters, the service, delivering a great experience for users on any device and getting robust security and management for IT organizations. So that's how we're thinking about Desktop Virtualization looking forward. As a market, that's multidimensional across virtual desktops, apps and data. That's moving rapidly toward broader adoption, and where Citrix is the clear market leader.
When it comes to the cloud, CIOs love the idea of a more elastic style of computing, one that lets them freely choose from a vast array of IT services, without having to build and support everything themselves. At the same time, they are increasingly concerned about the impending cloud words they see on the horizon with every major IT vendor promoting their own proprietary cloud stack. That's why we're taking a fundamentally different approach with our Citrix OpenCloud platform, an approach that makes it easy for customers to connect their existing data centers into any external cloud service, regardless of the hypervisor, network or app platform on either side. This strategy is highly differentiated, and a great example of what makes the end-to-end computing Citrix virtual computing vision compelling and unique. 
In 2010, our Data Center and Cloud products grew nearly 30%, delivering close to $300 million in revenue. Growth was fueled by the NetScaler business growing 35% and XenServer business which saw market expansions showed 15% of all new servers virtualized in 2010. In 2011, we're focusing on product innovation that will leverage our full range of virtual desktop, app, networking and server technologies. 
In addition, we're investing in a dedicated sales team, focused specifically on the cloud provider market, and game changing new partnerships that will further enhance our position as the most widely deployed networking and virtualization platform in the cloud. I'm very pleased today in fact to announce the first of those partnerships in 2011. An exciting new collaboration with the industry's number one cloud provider and operator of the largest virtualized environment in the world, Amazon  Web Services. As part of this agreement, Citrix and Amazon are working together on the Xen platform in three key areas to make cloud computing more open, more accessible and more secure. More open by enabling seamless interoperability between the Amazon cloud and millions of XenServer workloads running on enterprise data centers and in other clouds. More accessible by ensuring that existing windows workloads and private data centers run just as well in the Amazon cloud with the same manageability, reliability and performance. And more secure by bringing XenServer enterprise-class disaster recovery, compliance and advanced security innovations to Amazon cloud customers. 
In a world of many clouds, our strategy of making it easy for customers to connect to any cloud with the best performance, security and ROI, will continue to differentiate Citrix as a leading cloud infrastructure provider. 
So in closing, CIOs are telling us three things: First, they want to simplify enterprise computing. Secondly, they won't waste to embrace IT consumerization and third, they're ready to adopt a larger mix of cloud services. All of these in the pursuit of transforming IT to an on-demand service. We think this is the promise and the opportunity of virtual computing infrastructure. This is how we'll continue to deliver long-term value to shareholders for employees, for partners and for customers. So I'm really delighted to share these results with you today and now, I'd like to open it up to questions. Casey?"

We have subscription advantage that's available in most XenApp and XenDesktop. Now that we've got a one full quarter of last year's XenDesktop sales coming up for renewal, the renewal rates on this are substantially higher than what we've seen historically on XenApp, north of 95%. And while it's certainly one data point, it's in line with the way we've been thinking about this. XenDesktop is a strategic part of our customers infrastructure as opposed to XenApp, which in some cases was more project or technical. And so, I think this is one of those things that will help drive deferred revenue growth as the installed base of XenDesktop continues to be a larger and larger percent of the mix."

And that will be substantially lower than the underlying bookings performance that's going on with the international online business. So call it $20 million next year, probably at least double that in 2012 as we get back to a more normalized model.

I do expect at this point that deferred revenue growth will be a positive in Q1. And I expect the deferred revenue balance to go out. I'm just forecasting the exact amount, it's got a lot of variables in them. So that's why we shy away from giving bookings guidance. But I would expect bookings to certainly exceed the year-over-year growth rate for recognize revenue."

Good performances from our Eastern Europe teams and the major weakness that we've seen pretty much all year was southern Europe, except we did start to see some real positive things happen in Q4 in southern Europe, where several of our seven-figured deals were closed in XenDesktop, with some pretty significant banking and telco customers.

You also need a strong play in the virtual appliance and VPX has done incredibly well. I'd say this year, 2011, we'll see VPX volumes pass MPX somewhere maybe after the first half. And a lot of it has to do with the uptake in the SP channel and as well as some of our larger enterprise customers. And then I'd say the third piece that we're looking for is the fact is that both MPX and VPX interoperate kind of as a service delivery controller fabric so that you can put the physical hardware at the front door, and then you can put the virtual appliances in front of web tier, app tier and data tier services inside the Data Center and service provider to sort of give an even more powerful solution. So we think that service providers see that as a differentiator for them to offer their cloud to customers. And obviously, some of our larger enterprise customers are loving it as well.

We made the announcement in fall with Cisco, and there's been several announcements since then, and a lot of traction with customers, pilots and engagement with Cisco in the field. So we're really amazed by what's happened there. They had incredible access at the top end, top levels of IT organizations. And they brought us in, in many, many cases. Secondly, the response that we're seeing from customers on UCS is very positive. The test that we've run in the lab and customers have run in their pilots with XenDesktop on UCS, it's quite impressive as a platform for XenDesktop. One of the major banks, New York banks has committed to UCS as a platform to XenDesktop. And in the last five quarters, I think we've gone seven-figures in licensing for XenDesktop with them, and they'll be putting all of that on UCS. And that's again good to see as a validation of platform and the partnership. There's more to do and more to come this year with partnership with Cisco so stay tuned for that. So just kind of all probably exceeding our expectations right now in terms of so how it's going. The announcement that IBM made, I guess a few days ago was really coming out of their software group, a product that's a DDI only product for small SMB marketplace where I think overall, it's pretty much well understood that market adoption for virtual desktops in that marketplace is really unproven and really, really, really early. Our work with IBM, IGS is all on the enterprise side. And IBM includes XenDesktop in both their public and their private cloud services business. They have something called Smart Business Desktop Cloud, we're essential to that. They're running that infrastructure for I think now over 100 customers. They've trained hundreds of consultants on XenDesktop in the last year, and our work with IBM Global Services has been amazing to identify them as one of the top SIs in terms of momentum. In fact, in Q4, we had three seven-figure deals with them, and it's my understanding that they've closed two seven-figure deals since the first of the year that we are in the pipeline. So we're highly focused with IBM on where the market is, that's midmarket to enterprise. And that's what we know about the announcement."

But to keep the growth rate pretty high as well. There's a number of incremental growth drivers that we talked about in our earlier remarks and around things we're doing in audio, video and mobility and et cetera.

First of all, it's definitely a strategic component of the business, more so than a revenue driver. And its strategic for a few reasons. Yes, it's a mind share and so forth but that's not the primary reason. The primary reason if XenServer is at the core of technology that's within XenClient, that's underneath XenDesktop, that is underneath the OpenCloud platform that we'll be enhancing this year. And you'll see parts of other products that we have in the pipeline. So it's an important element across our entire virtual computing platform. And that's how you need to think about it. We do make it available sort of the basic version of, three, and a vital uptake model there. The monetization is modest, but it's because it's not the focus of the business. The focus of the business is to leverage XenServer technologies. So you see today, we made the announcement with Amazon around Amazon Web Services. And so core technologies that were developed in XenServer for optimizing Windows and performance and security of Windows workloads and the manageability of them, et cetera, the ability to tie all of them together with Xen center with Amazon Web Services and the expansion of a private Data Center. All of that is XenServer technology that's really, really critical for us, as well as in our networking products. And so, our VTX products, Net Scale or Branch Repeater, VPX gateway all really sit on top of XenServer as well."

So in 2010, our estimate is 15%. That's up from 11% in 2009 and 3% in 2008. And that's based on Biro, and it's based upon relationships we have with certain cloud providers that are building their stack on top of XenServer. Last year, for example, we jointly announced with racks space that they would move their entire platform from open sources to XenServer. So making XenServer an important element there, of course, but counting in the sockets there around new servers virtualized as Rack Space themselves continue to grow. So that's the most direct metric. The other metric is really around the velocity that we get into than XenDesktop due to the XenClient technology and due to the optimizations that we make in XenServer so that we can offer a customer a full platform on top of the bare metal and drive optimizations whether they're storage or density or performance. And while we're also on top of other virtualization as well. And so, XenDesktop is an important piece of the monetization of the XenServer technology. Those are the primary things to look for. And then, as we get further and more deeply into our OpenCloud platform and releasing that, we'll be monetizing it there as well. And that will be another proxy for the value of XenServer in the underlying infrastructure."

So I'd say this, if you've been a XenApp customer using XenApp and some significantly strategic way for the small sort of uptick in cost to get all the other capabilities that XenDesktop brings, my guess is a lot of those customers are going that way with the intention to go further and to do more. So that means more deployments, not if you were with our strategic customers. I think project-based customers that have bought XenApp in the past will continue and do continue to buy XenApp and deploy it in a similar kind of a pattern and similar kinds of ways. And you see the evidence of that obviously in the assay renewables motion. You continue to see an really strong renewal rates, no decline in the renewal rates. As a matter of fact, in XenApp and XenDesktop renewal rates are, as David mentioned, remarkably higher. So as I said a little bit earlier, in response to Rob's question, the key thing here is that clearly position each product, make sure the sales organization partners understand those products and then, meet the customer demand where it happens to be and let customers make that decision.

And really, that assessment was the core driving force behind the XenDesktop 5 release. We began shipping in who Q4. So it's too early for that release for them to now have measurable impact on sales cycles and implementation cycles. But I can tell you that anecdotal evidence that I have from the time I spent with customers and partners since we made the announcement and sort of world tour and demonstrations back in October, we expect to see really amazing things. One of the things that we did with XenDesktop 5 is we made sure that if you are going to implement a VDI kind of solution, you can basically install it in 10 minutes. And we call it 10 to Xen and then spinning off desktops the multiples off desktops is then sort of measured in seconds. We reduced the complexity overall, essential console for operations and configuration management, et cetera. So we've done a lot of things in XenDesktop 5 to answer these market adoption challenges and we'll see that play out, I think, in 2011. And that means easier to get up and going and lower cost to own and operate. And that continues to be dramatically a key piece of what we're doing with XenDesktop from an innovation agenda perspective."

Last year was a good start. We've put it on the plate as one of the top five priorities for every sales person in the world, great success. We're somewhat doubling down this year on two dimensions, upselling, which is really more getting the Branch Repeater, axis gateway, other kinds of related components and NetScaler components as part of that XenDesktop and the XenApp infrastructure design is not as cross-selling both our networking products and in the U.S., beginning to cross sell our Web Collaboration products as well.

26524,118256980,95777,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $530 million in total revenue, nearly $100 million increase to defer",1677,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $530 million in total revenue, nearly $100 million increase to deferred revenue and $180 million in cash flow from operations. 
For the full year 2010, total revenue was up 16% to $1.87 billion, GAAP earnings per share increased 41% to $1.46, while adjusted EPS was $2.08. I'm really pleased with our execution in the field, gains in app, networking and SaaS, and a growing leadership across desktop virtualization, trends that can be clearly seen in our financials. 
So looking at the fourth quarter, revenue from new license sales was $196 million, up 17% from last year. License update revenue increased 13% annually driven by demand for subscription advantage renewals and the XenDesktop Trade-up program. Tech services increased 40% led by record consulting utilization and support agreements attached to our NetScaler products. And finally, online SaaS revenue was $95 million, up 16%.
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 27% from last year to $239 million. Included in this number is product license growth of about 36% year-on-year, and 16 transactions greater than $1 million. Internationally, the business environment was mixed in Q4, similar to what were seeing all year. Japan and Pacific combine for a steady 15% year-over-year revenue growth, while EMEA revenue was up 7% to $153 million as we continue to see uneven demand across Europe. This was despite closing $12 million-plus transactions in the region. We remain a little cautious on these markets going into 2011. 
So overall, a very solid quarter to cap off a great year for Citrix. As we entered 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline continue at record levels. We remain focused on delivering financial results, while investing to expand our capabilities and capacity across our main product categories of Desktop, Data Center and cloud and SaaS. 
So let's take a look at the Q4 results within those three areas. First, our Desktop Solutions business grew 14% over last year to over $325 million, including license growth of 16%. The results were led by XenDesktop, with strong demand drove total revenue of $95 million, up 60% sequentially, and up 230% from last year. Of the $62 million in XenDesktop license revenue, approximately 70% came from new licenses and 30% from licenses acquired through the Trade-up program. 
So to provide a little more context on the XenDesktop business in Q4, there are a few metrics I think really demonstrate the breath of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, more than $30 million of the growth in deferred revenue during Q4 is attributable to XD subscription advantage renewals and trade ups. 15 of the 29 deals over $1 million in the quarter included XenDesktop licenses. There are more than 230 XD transactions greater than 1,000 seats each and over 30 with 5,000 seats each. Download to Vevo licenses increased by more than 100% sequentially. And finally, over 3,000 different customers bought XenDesktop in the period. So throughout 2010, we captured almost 10,000 XD customers, up 3x over 2009, with 5,000 of them taking advantage of the 2010 trade up promotions.
So our installed base of XenApp customers represents over 20 million licenses in total with more than 12 million of those currently active on SA. Last year, we designed a trade-up promotion to migrate the most strategic segment of these customers, ultimately upgrading almost 15% of the active SA base. This month, we announced a new Trade-up program targeting the entire XenApp base, providing an ongoing upgrade and migration path to XenDesktop. This program features a new concurrent licensing option, and three new ways to trade up. Including Trade-up Plus, for easy more project driven upgrades to XenDesktop, with some incentives for purchasing additional licenses; Trade Up Max, which is for enterprise-wide migration to XenDesktop; and Trade-up Restart, offering the benefits of trade up for customers with expired SA. The new Trade-up program really gives our partners and field teams, a more complete set of tools to leverage our large installed base of customers.
So next, looking at our Data Center and Cloud business. Revenue was up 27% in the quarter to $85 million. Growth is led by the NetScaler products, particularly with cloud and Internet-centric and government agencies. We're also still seeing really good traction with enterprise customers, accounting form more than half of the top 20 deals in this business. 
Regarding the specific platforms, we saw strong growth in the midrange, NetScaler MPX appliances due to the enterprise uptake. And additionally, the VPX line of virtual appliances continues to do really well, with revenue up more than 50% sequentially, and unit volume up 100% as the cloud service provider addition is getting broader adoption.
In WAN optimization, Branch Repeater revenue nearly doubled from Q4 of last year, with growth coming across all product divisions. Besides the government, which has always been the largest vertical market here, we're also seeing an increasing attach rate to desktop virtualization deployments as customers are leveraging more of our end-to-end solutions in their infrastructure. 
And finally, touching our SaaS business, revenue was up 16% in the fourth quarter to $95 million. For the full year, it was up 17% and now represents almost 20% of total Citrix revenue. Here, the growth here continues to be led by the collaboration of products as the GoToMeeting family, which were up just about 30% in the fourth quarter.
We believe that there's a large SaaS opportunity in international markets, as customers grow more comfortable with this delivery model. We've already seen some early success and market share gains with the GoTo products in Europe, particularly with the recent launch of GoToMeeting in France and Germany. So in an effort to accelerate the expansion in this area, we recently announced our intent to acquire Net Viewer, an online collaboration business based in Germany. Net Viewer currently has over 200 employees and is built on install base of more than 18,000 customers across enterprise and SMB. This acquisition also brings the Citrix Online a seasoned team to help manage our international growth going forward. So right now, we currently expect the transaction to close in mid February.
So turning to expenses and operations. In Q4, adjusted op margin was 28%, up 100 basis points sequentially, and in line with a year ago. For the full year, adjusted op margin expanded by 227 basis points to 26%, which is significantly higher than our initial 2010 guidance. This is really a result of the improved revenue performance and our continued focus on execution. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind the demand growth we're seeing in the market so as bookings, pipeline and POCs have all accelerated, we've grown headcount pretty significant with a focus on two areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, consulting capacity and tech support; and second, product innovation, to bring the market new technologies, as well as improving integration of the total solution to drive simplicity and better end user experience. 
In Q4, we added nearly 250 new people to Citrix, which brings the full-year increase to more than 800. Looking into Q1, the rate of hiring will slow as we work to integrate the new members and really start ramping productivity. So on the balance sheet, cash and investments increased $1.7 billion, up 39% from 2009, driven by $179 million in cash flow from ops. And for the full year, total cash flow from operations was $616 million, which is up 28% over the prior period.
Also in Q4, we purchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $66. And year-to-date, we bought back about 8.3 million shares at an average cost of $53 per share.
Deferred revenue at the end of the year was a record $779 million, which is up 26% from 2010. Q4 alone, as I said, we added nearly $100 million to the deferred revenue balance, which is our highest sequential growth ever. Three main drivers for this were the increasing renewal rates for subscription advantage, the success of the XenDesktop Trade-up program and tax services contracts for consulting education and support.
So overall, really a great Q4. We're executing well, seeing growth in all of our primary businesses and making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets, while expanding our go-to-market capacity.
So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q1 and for the full year 2011. Overall, we are raising revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2011. However, since this is the first time that we provided any quarterly breakdown, I'm aware that the shape of the year is different than many of the published models, particularly with regard to expenses in Q1. So to point out a couple of things here, the most significant items in Q1 include the full impact of Q3, Q4 headcount investments, where productivity will ramp through the year and from the acquisition of Net Viewer, assuming an early February close. And due to the purchase accounting adjustments, another one-time costs. We're going to realize several pennies of EPS dilution in the first half of the year, which should be offset by the end of the year.
So if you're taking that all into account, for the full-year 2011, our current expectations have increased to total revenue in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion and adjusted EPS between $2.29 and $2.33 per share. For the first quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in a range of $470 million to $475 million, adjusted tax rate of approximately 23% and adjusted EPS of between $0.40 and $0.41. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarterly performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

Today, we're reporting another record-breaking quarter and year for Citrix in both revenue and EPS. I'm very pleased with our 2010 strategic, operating and financial results, further establishing Citrix's leadership in virtual computing. 2010 was highlighted by three primary things in my mind: Stronger market positions in Desktop Virtualization, Web Collaboration and app networking; secondly, significant strategic visibility in the IT executive suite; and third, solid operating leverage in our financials. Importantly, our go-to-market transformation has elevated our presence as a strategic vendor with significant increases in sea level engagements, step ups in SI pipelines and deal flow, up-selling end-to-end technologies and cross selling our networking products. You can see it in our results, a larger mix of seven-figure deals than ever, greater use of our products as an end-to-end system, record growth of technical services, especially consulting and strength in SA renewals. I'm extremely proud of the Citrix team and thankful to thousands of Citrix partners and customers, both long-standing and new for their business, their confidence and their enthusiasm for our strategic vision. 
Here's how we'll drive the business this year. Five things: First, continued go-to-market evolution with direct customer touch and a larger mix of business from SI and service provider channels; second, increased depth in select strategic projects, that's further develop the virtual computing markets we're in and broaden our reach; third, customer programs and services built around our Desktop transformation model to accelerate the adoption of Desktop Virtualization; fourth, expanded brand awareness in virtualization, networking and cloud computing spaces; and fifth and as always, an amazing innovation agenda for all of our product lines and services. So next, I'd like to give some additional color in several areas of the business starting with web collaboration. 
Around the globe, web, audio and video collaboration continue to go mainstream, converging and moving toward mass-market appeal, fueled by solid economic globalization and productivity trends, empowering our Online Services business to 17% growth with over $360 million in 2010 revenue, and increasing our share in web collaboration, now garnering the number two position. 
In October, we announced GoToMeeting with HD faces, adding stunning HD videoconferencing to GoToMeeting. We also introduced GoToMeeting for French and German-speaking markets, and achieved some early customer successes in those markets in Q4. As David mentioned, to accelerate our European expansion, we're acquiring Germany-based Net Viewer, adding go-to-market capacity, management depth and a larger customer footprint, and building on our current strength in the U.K. and Nordic regions. In 2011, we'll focus on fully integrating the Net Viewer business on new go-to-market programs, on higher-impact partnerships, on strengthening of our remote access and support services and on executing in the international marketplace. In addition, our growth plan includes even richer collaboration experiences, partner app integrations and expanded mobile device support including GoToMyPC for the iPad.
Next is our Desktop Virtualization business, where we've now shipped over 6 million licenses since the release of XenDesktop 4 just five quarters ago. 2010 was a milestone year for XenDesktop, growing 400% to about $250 million in revenue and becoming the growth engine of our overall desktop computing business. 
In Q4, we shipped over a million licenses with some customer wins across geographies, segments and scale. For example, a large U.S.-based healthcare provider, wanted a virtual desktop platform for flexible access to electronic medical records and other apps for 20,000 employees. After selecting Citrix in a head-to-head competitive bake-off, they traded up 4,600 XenApp licenses to XenDesktop Platinum. And then, they added 2,000 new licenses on top of that. An Asia-based customer in financial services with an extensive branch network, abandoned their first-generation virtual infrastructure stack for a full XenDesktop stack, signing a deal for 2,500 seats, and then added Citrix networking products to ensure a secure available and SaaS  end-to-end user experience. 
Another example is the petroleum company, with 2,000 employees throughout Australia needed a virtual Desktop solution to serve a wide variety of end points, over networks and user scenarios. They chose XenDesktop for its FlexCast technology to deliver a mix of hosted share desktops, VDI desktops, virtual apps and local VM desktops running XenClient technology. This deal was a joint win with Microsoft, where the customer is leveraging our combined Desktop, App and server virtualization stack, all managed by Microsoft system center.
The largest XenDesktop deal in the quarter was with a major European government agency. They purchased Platinum Edition as an end-to-end solution for centralizing apps, desktops and data for 150,000 users to support a vast array of devices, to reach mobile and branch workers and to achieve new levels of security. The deal was closed in collaboration with a global SI partner and Microsoft with Citrix consulting services assisting with architectural design and implementation strategy. So these are a few examples to give you a sense for what's happening with customers in the market.
Looking forward, there are three focal points for our Desktop business: First, drive mass-market demand; second, raise the bar in innovation; and third, expand the desktop to web and SaaS apps. So our biggest XenDesktop growth opportunity lies in developing primary demand for virtualization at the desktop, to drive mass market. We still consider the market to be in earlier stages with the potential to go mainstream as an enterprise-wide solution. 
Entering 2011, it's clear that virtual desktops are high-priority for many IT teams, actually becoming a budget line item and being acknowledged as a strategic element of overall IT spend. Our focus is in market segments where security, business flexibility and central management are most critical, in particular, banking, healthcare and government. We already have an impressive set of large-scale successful implementations to reference in these segments.
In 2011, we'll build on our go-to-market partnerships that accelerate core demand in collaboration with Microsoft, with Cisco on the UCS platform, with Wipro's Desktop as a Service offering, with Citrix SIs including CSE, Fujitsu, IBM and Accenture. With Intel and major OEMs including Dell, HP and Lenovo, and with over 400 Citrix-ready business partners. The opportunity is to transform the enterprise desktop to an on-demand service, offering new ways to migrate to Windows 7, to rethink traditional hardware refresh cycles, to embrace amazing new consumer devices and to bring SaaS apps into the enterprise. 
From a technology perspective, we're driving the market with Citrix Receiver, our universal client for IT services, allowing IT to say yes to millions of new devices entering the enterprise from personal laptops to tablets to smartphones, making Citrix the one company that can truly deliver IT as a service to any device, anywhere, securely. Over the past few weeks, Receiver has been one of the top two free business apps in the new Mac app store. Receiver was featured prominently in Google's Chrome OS Notebook launch, and Receiver embedded in Motorola ATRIX 4G smartphone helped it earn best of show at CES. In 2010, Receiver was downloaded over 1.8 million x across a wide variety of consumer laptop, tablet and smartphone platforms.
Virtual apps continue to be an essential part of the virtual desktop. Last year, XenApp 6 launch set a new standard for user density, overall scalability, integration with Microsoft systems center and app fee and support for Windows Server 2008. From here, product advancements will continue at a rapid pace, giving customers lower cost through innovations and management, scalability and storage, making the path to desktop virtualization more clear, more compelling and more economical than ever.
Last year's introduction of XenDesktop 5 in October was a significant step forward, delivering major product simplifications that make simplification, installation and set up faster and easier, a completely new and powerful management operations console. Optimizations for XenServer that significantly reduce storage cost, while raising the level of VDI performance and VM density. Self-service apps including single sign-on for Windows, web and SaaS applications; secure centrally managed virtual desktops to go with our new Xen client feature and lots more.
2011 will mark another year where innovations will further optimize the cost of virtual desktops, while distancing ourselves from competitive solutions through better design, broader device support, better partnerships and greater leverage of our FlexCast technology.
Going forward, SaaS and web apps are rapidly becoming a core part of the Desktop computing experience. That's why we've made the seamless integration of SaaS and web apps into both virtual and physical desktops, a core feature of XenDesktop 5 and a top priority on our innovation agenda. For the user, this takes self-service to an entirely new level, giving them an easy way to access any window, SaaS or web app, with a single click and a single log-in. Their apps even automatically synchronize across devices, a Citrix invention we call Follow Me apps.
For the first time, IT gets three core things. First, centrally manage account creation for hundreds of SaaS apps like Salesforce and NetSuite, success factors and Mark Cueto as examples that are fully integrated with active directory. Secondly, IT gets powerful workflow that automatically enable or disable user access. And thirdly, license monitoring and auditing to reduce cost and to enable better compliance management. 
Extending the benefits of access control, management and the single sign-on to web and SaaS apps is one more way we are helping IT to embrace consumerization, while controlling what matters, the service, delivering a great experience for users on any device and getting robust security and management for IT organizations. So that's how we're thinking about Desktop Virtualization looking forward. As a market, that's multidimensional across virtual desktops, apps and data. That's moving rapidly toward broader adoption, and where Citrix is a clear market leader.
When it comes to the cloud, CIOs love the idea of a more elastic style of computing, one that lets them freely choose from a vast array of IT services, without having to build and support everything themselves. At the same time, they're increasingly concerned about the impending cloud wars they see on the horizon, with every major IT vendor promoting their own proprietary cloud stack. That's why we're taking a fundamentally different approach with our Citrix OpenCloud platform, an approach that makes it easy for customers to connect their existing data centers into any external cloud service, regardless of the hypervisor, network or app platform on either side. This strategy is highly differentiated, and a great example of what makes the end-to-end Citrix virtual computing vision compelling and unique. 
In 2010, our Data Center and Cloud products grew nearly 30%, delivering close to $300 million in revenue. Growth was fueled by the NetScaler business growing 35% and XenServer business which saw market share expand to more than 15% of all new servers virtualized in 2010. In 2011, we're focusing on product innovation that will leverage our full range of virtual desktop, app, networking and server technologies. 
In addition, we're investing in a dedicated sales team, focused specifically on the cloud provider market, and game changing new partnerships that will further enhance our position as the most widely-deployed networking and virtualization platform in the cloud. I'm very pleased today in fact to announce the first of those partnerships in 2011. An exciting new collaboration with the industry's number one cloud provider and operator of the largest virtualized environment in the world, Amazon  Web Services. 
As part of this agreement, Citrix and Amazon are working together on the Xen platform in three key areas to make cloud computing more open, more accessible and more secure. More open by enabling seamless interoperability between the Amazon cloud and millions of XenServer workloads running in enterprise data centers and in other clouds. More accessible by ensuring that existing windows workload in private data centers run just as well in the Amazon cloud, with the same manageability, reliability and performance. And more secure by bringing XenServer's enterprise-class disaster recovery, compliance and advanced security innovations to Amazon cloud customers. 
In a world of many clouds, our strategy of making it easy for customers to connect to any cloud with the best performance, security and ROI, will continue to differentiate Citrix as a leading cloud infrastructure provider. 
So in closing, CIOs are telling us three things: First, they want to simplify enterprise computing; secondly, they want ways to embrace IT consumerization; and third, they're ready to adopt a larger mix of cloud services. All of these in the pursuit of transforming IT to an on-demand service. 
We think this is the promise and the opportunity of virtual computing infrastructure. This is how we'll continue to deliver a long-term value for shareholders, for employees, for partners and for customers. So I'm really delighted to share these results with you today and now, I'd like to open it up to questions. Casey?"

That's going to add to deferreds. And then one other dynamic that is just starting to pop up is renewal rates of subscription advantage. We have subscription advantage that's available on both XenApp and XenDesktop. And now that we've got one-full quarter of last year's XenDesktop sales coming up for renewal, the renewal rates on this are substantially higher than what we've seen historically on XenApp, north of 95%. And while it's certainly one data point, it's in line with the way we've been thinking about this. XenDesktop is a strategic part of customer's infrastructure, as opposed to XenApp, which in some cases was more project or tactical. And so, I think this is one of those things that will help drive deferred revenue growth as the installed base of XenDesktop, continues to be a larger and larger percent of the mix."

There's a couple of dynamics going on here with M&A, and when you're acquiring a SaaS company, you just have the normal purchase accounting adjustments where we write down most of the deferred revenue, which impacts total revenue. So we'll recognize, call it a couple million of revenue, probably from the acquisition in Q1 and $20 million for the year, ballpark. And that will be substantially lower than the underlying bookings performance that's going on with the international online business. So call it $20 million next year, probably at least double that in 2012 as we get back to a more of a normalized model. So specific to the dilution, a couple of pennies in the first quarter, maybe a penny in the second and accretive by the back end of the year. So for the full year, I'll expect it to be roughly neutral."

So the way to think about the broad Desktop Solutions business in Q1 would be product license growth in the -- down the low to mid teens, and total revenue growth obviously kind of in that same range, 13% to 15%. I do expect at this point that deferred revenue growth will be a positive in Q1. And I expect that deferred revenue balance to go up. It's just forecasting the exact amount, it's got a lot of variables in it. So that's why we shy away from giving bookings guidance.

You also need a strong play in the virtual appliance, and VPX has done incredibly well. I'd say this year, 2011, we'll see VPX unit volumes pass MPX somewhere maybe after the first half. And a lot of that has to do with the uptake in the VSP channel and as well as some of our larger enterprise customers. And then I'd say the third piece that we're looking for is that the fact is that both MPX and VPX interoperate kind of as a service delivery controller fabric so that you can put the physical hardware at the front door, and then you can put the virtual appliances in front of web tier, app tier and data tier of services inside the data center and service provider to sort of give an even more powerful solution. So we think that service providers see that as a great differentiator for them to offer their cloud customers. And obviously, some of our larger enterprise customers are loving it as well.

What we've said quite consistently is that this is really a Desktop Computing business that has kind of the desktop and apps sort of product then desktop and then the Apple-only product, XenApp. And over a series of quarters, what we're seeing is customers being able to choose the right solution for what they're trying to do: app-centric solutions, app delivery kind of solutions, project-based solutions. XenApp continues to be a fantastic product for that. And those that want to move toward more robust, full-featured Desktop as a Service kind of a solution, they're naturally taking XenDesktop.

So we don't look at this as a decay rate, we look at it as a normalization rate between the products based upon what's happening in the marketplace and what customers are actually demanding.

And a lot of traction with customers, pilots and engagement with Cisco in the field. So we're really amazed by what's happened there. They have incredible access at the top end, top levels of IT organizations, and they brought us in, in many, many cases. Secondly, the response that we're seeing from customers on UCS is very positive. The tests that we've run in the lab and customers have run in their pilots with XenDesktop on UCS, it's quite impressive as a platform for XenDesktop. One of the major New York banks has committed with us as their platforms to XenDesktop. And in the last five quarters, I think we've done seven figures in licensing for XenDesktop with them, and they'll be putting all that on UCS. And that's again good to see as a validation of the platform and the partnership. There's more to do and more to come this year with our partnership with Cisco, so stay tuned for that. And so just kind of all probably exceeding our expectations right now in terms of  how that's going. 
The announcement that IBM made I guess a few days ago was really coming out of their software group, a product that's a VDI-only product for the SMB marketplace where I think overall it's pretty much well understood that market adoption for virtual desktops in that marketplace is really unproven and really, really, really early. Our work with IBM, IGS, is all on the enterprise side. And IBM includes XenDesktop in both their Public and their Private Cloud Services business. They have something called Smart Business Desktop Cloud. We're essential to that. They're running that infrastructure for I think now over 100 customers. They've trained hundreds of consultants on XenDesktop in the last year. And our work with IBM Global Services has been amazing. So I identify them as one of the top SIs in terms of momentum. In fact, in Q4, we had three seven-figure deals with them, and it's my understanding that they closed two seven-figure deals since the first of the year that were in the pipeline. So we're highly focused with IBM on where the market is, and that's mid-market to enterprise. And that's what we know about the announcement."

The primary reason  XenServer is at the core of technology that's within XenClient, that's underneath XenDesktop, that is underneath the OpenCloud platform that we'll be enhancing this year. And you'll see parts of other products that we have in the pipeline. So it's an important element across our entire virtual computing platform. And that's how you need to think about it. We do make it available, sort of the basic version of it, free, and there's a viral uptake model there. The monetization is modest, but it's because it's not the focus of the business. The focus of the business is to leverage XenServer technologies. So you see today we made the announcement with Amazon around Amazon Web Services. And so core technologies that were developed in XenServer for optimizing Windows' performance and security of Windows workloads and the manageability of them, et cetera, the ability to tie all of that together with XenCenter to be able to make Amazon Web Services an extension of a private data center, all of that is XenServer technology that's really, really critical for us and as well as in our networking products.

So in 2010, our estimate is 15%. That's up from 11% in 2009 and 3% in 2008. And that's based on viral, and it's based upon relationships we have with certain cloud providers that are building their stack on top of XenServer. Last year, for example, we jointly announced with RackSpace that they would move their entire platform from open sources into XenServer. So making XenServer then an important element there, of course, but counting in the sockets there around new servers virtualized as RackSpace themselves continue to grow. So that's the most direct metric. The other metric is really around the velocity that we get in XenDesktop due to the XenClient technology and due [ph] [1:10:52] to the optimizations that we make in XenServer so that we can offer a customer a full platform on top of the bare metal and drive optimizations, whether they're storage or density or performance, while we also run on top of other virtual platforms as well. And so XenDesktop is an important piece of the monetization of the XenServer technology. Those are the primary things to look for. And then, as we get further and more deeply into our OpenCloud platform and releasing that, we'll be monetizing it there as well. And that will be another proxy for the value of XenServer in the underlying infrastructure."

And I'd tell you this, that because XenDesktop as a superset includes XenApp, it's impossible for us to know sort of the mix in which customers actually deploy. So I'd say this. If you've been a XenApp customer using XenApp in some significantly strategic way, for the small sort of uptick in cost to get all the other capabilities that XenDesktop brings, my guess is a lot of those customers are going that way with an intention to go further and to do more. So that means more deployments, not fewer, with our strategic customers. I think project-based customers that have bought XenApp in the past will continue and do continue to buy XenApp and deploy it in a similar kind of a pattern and similar kinds of ways. And you see that -- the evidence of that, obviously, is in the SA renewal motion. We continue to see really strong renewal rates. There are no declines in the renewal rates. As a matter of fact, XenApp and XenDesktop renewal rates are, as David mentioned, remarkably higher. So as I said a little bit earlier in response to Rob's question, the key thing here is to clearly position each product, make sure the sales organization, partners understand those products, and then meet the customer demand where it happens to be and let customers make that decision. That really is our kind of core driving mindset here as we continue to invest in XenApp, of course, and as a component of XenDesktop."

And really, that assessment was the core driving force behind the XenDesktop 5 release. We began shipping in Q4.

But I can tell you that anecdotal evidence that I have from the time I spent with customers and partners since we made the announcement, visit, sort of world tour and demonstrations back in October, we expect to see really amazing things. One of the things that we did with XenDesktop 5 is we made sure that if you are going to implement a VDI kind of solution, you can basically install it in 10 minutes. And we call it -- and then spinning up desktops or multiples of desktops is then sort of measured in seconds. And we reduced the complexity overall, a central console for operations and configuration management, et cetera. So we've done a lot of things in XenDesktop 5 to answer these market adoption challenges, and we'll see that play out, I think, in 2011. And that means easier to get up and going and lower cost to own and operate. And that continues to be thematically a key piece of what we're doing with XenDesktop from an innovation agenda perspective."

And remember, there's not a lot of data points here over the course of a year, but what we're seeing is a reorder size that has gone from about four or 5x earlier in the year, up closer to 10x. And so customers are deploying Desktop Virtualization, they're working through the initial setup and they're on scale. And that's an important driver for us going forward.

So everyone sees not only the strategic sort of benefit of cross-selling because you get the chance to talk about end-to-end virtualization, virtual computing, but also the revenue and the growth kinds of capabilities, opportunities that it brings to the sales rep, and that puts money in their pockets. So I think that last year was a good start. We've put it on the plate as one of the top five priorities for every salesperson in the world. Great success. We're somewhat doubling down this year on two dimensions: upselling, which is really more getting the Branch Repeater, Access Gateway, other kinds of related components and NetScaler components as part of a XenDesktop and a XenApp infrastructure design, as well as cross-selling both our networking products and, in the U.S., beginning to cross-sell our web collaboration products as well.

26524,118256980,95785,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $530 million in total revenue, nearly $100 million increase to defer",1681,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $530 million in total revenue, nearly $100 million increase to deferred revenue and $180 million in cash flow from operations. 
For the full year 2010, total revenue was up 16% to $1.87 billion, GAAP earnings per share increased 41% to $1.46, while adjusted EPS was $2.08. I'm really pleased with our execution in the field, gains in app, networking and SaaS, and a growing leadership across desktop virtualization, trends that can be clearly seen in our financials. 
So looking at the fourth quarter, revenue from new license sales was $196 million, up 17% from last year. License update revenue increased 13% annually driven by demand for Subscription Advantage renewals and the XenDesktop Trade-up program. Tech services increased 40% led by record consulting utilization and support agreements attached to our NetScaler products. And finally, online SaaS revenue was $95 million, up 16%.
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 27% from last year to $239 million. Included in this number is product license growth of about 36% year-on-year, and 16 transactions greater than $1 million. Internationally, the business environment was mixed in Q4, similar to what we were seeing all year. Japan and Pacific combine for a steady 15% year-on-year revenue growth, while EMEA revenue was up 7% to $153 million as we continue to see uneven demand across Europe. This was despite closing 12 $1 million-plus transactions in the region. We’ll remain a little cautious on these markets going into 2011. 
So overall, a very solid quarter to cap off a great year for Citrix. As we enter 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline continue at record levels. We remain focused on delivering financial results, while investing to expand our capabilities and capacity across our main product categories of Desktop, Data Center and cloud and SaaS. 
So let's take a look at the Q4 results within those three areas. First, our Desktop Solutions business grew 14% over last year to over $325 million, including license growth of 16%. The results were led by XenDesktop, where strong demand drove total revenue of $95 million, up 60% sequentially, and up 230% from last year. Of the $62 million in XenDesktop license revenue, approximately 70% came from new licenses and 30% from licenses acquired through the Trade-up program. 
So to provide a little more context on the XenDesktop business in Q4, there are a few metrics I think really demonstrate the breath of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, more than $30 million of the growth in deferred revenue during Q4 is attributable to XD subscription advantage renewals and trade ups. 15 of the 29 deals over $1 million in the quarter included XenDesktop licenses. There are more than 230 XD transactions greater than 1,000 seats each and over 30 with 5,000 seats each. Download to Vevo licenses increased by more than 100% sequentially. And finally, over 3,000 different customers bought XenDesktop in the period. So throughout 2010, we captured almost 10,000 XD customers, up 3x over 2009, with 5,000 of them taking advantage of the 2010 trade up promotion.
So our installed base of XenApp customers represents over 20 million licenses in total with more than 12 million of those currently active on SA. Last year, we designed a trade-up promotion to migrate the most strategic segment of these customers, ultimately upgrading almost 15% of the active SA base. This month, we announced a new Trade-up program targeting the entire XenApp base, providing an ongoing upgrade and migration path to XenDesktop. This program features a new concurrent licensing option, and three new ways to trade up. Including Trade-up PLUS for easy more project driven upgrades to XenDesktop, with some incentives for purchasing additional licenses; Trade-up Max, which is for enterprise-wide migration to XenDesktop; and Trade-up Restart, offering the benefits of trade up for customers with expired SA. The new Trade-up program really gives our partners and field teams, a more complete set of tools to leverage our large installed base of customers.
So next, looking at our Data Center and Cloud business. Revenue was up 27% in the quarter to $85 million. Growth is led by the NetScaler products, particularly with cloud and Internet-centric and government agencies. We're also still seeing really good traction with enterprise customers, accounting for more than half of the top 20 deals in this business. 
Regarding the specific platforms, we saw strong growth in the midrange, NetScaler MPX appliances due to the enterprise uptake. And additionally, the VPX line of virtual appliances continues to do really well, with revenue up more than 50% sequentially, and unit volume up 100% as the cloud of service provider addition is getting broader adoption.
In WAN optimization, Branch Repeater revenue nearly doubled from Q4 of last year, with growth coming across all product divisions. Besides the government, which has always been the largest vertical market here, we're also seeing an increasing attach rate to desktop virtualization deployments as customers are leveraging more of our end-to-end solutions in their infrastructure. 
And finally, touching our SaaS business, revenue was up 16% in the fourth quarter to $95 million. For the full year, it was up 17% and now represents almost 20% of total Citrix revenue. Here, the growth here continues to be led by the collaboration of products in the GoToMeeting family, which were up just about 30% in the fourth quarter.
We believe that there's a large SaaS opportunity in international markets, as customers grow more comfortable with this delivery model. We've already seen some early success and market share gains with the GoTo products in Europe, particularly with the recent launch of GoToMeeting in France and Germany. So in an effort to accelerate the expansion in this area, we recently announced our intent to acquire Net Viewer, an online collaboration business based in Germany. Net Viewer currently has over 200 employees and has built an installed base of more than 18,000 customers across enterprise and SMB. This acquisition also brings to Citrix Online a seasoned team to help manage our international growth going forward. So right now, we currently expect the transaction to close in mid-February.
So turning to expenses and operations. In Q4, adjusted op margin was 28%, up 100 basis points sequentially, and in line with a year ago. For the full year, adjusted op margin expanded by 227 basis points to 26%, which is significantly higher than our initial 2010 guidance. This is really a result of the improved revenue performance and our continued focus on execution. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind the demand growth we're seeing in the market so as bookings, pipeline and POCs have all accelerated, we've grown headcount pretty significant with a focus on two areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, consulting capacity and tech support; and second, product innovation, to bring to market new technologies, as well as improving integration of the total solution to drive simplicity and better end user experience. 
In Q4, we added nearly 250 new people to Citrix, which brings the full-year increase to more than 800. Looking into Q1, the rate of hiring will slow as we work to integrate the new team members and really start ramping productivity. So on the balance sheet, cash and investments increased $1.7 billion, up 39% from 2009, driven by $179 million in cash flow from ops. And for the full year, total cash flow from operations was $616 million, which is up 28% over the prior period.
Also in Q4, we purchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $66. And year-to-date, we bought back about 8.3 million shares at an average cost of $53 per share.
Deferred revenue at the end of the year was a record $779 million, which is up 26% from 2010. Q4 alone, as I said, we added nearly $100 million to the deferred revenue balance, which is our highest sequential growth ever. Three main drivers for this were the increasing renewal rates for Subscription Advantage, the success of the XenDesktop Trade-up program and tech services contracts for consulting, education and support.
So, overall, really a great Q4. We're executing well, seeing growth in all of our primary businesses and making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets, while expanding our go-to-market capacity.
So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q1 and for the full year 2011. Overall, we are raising revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2011. However, since this is the first time that we provided any quarterly breakdown, I'm aware that the shape of the year is different than many of the published models, particularly with regard to expenses in Q1. So to point out a couple of things here, the most significant items in Q1 include the full impact of Q3, Q4 headcount investments, where productivity will ramp through the year and from the acquisition of Net Viewer, assuming an early February close. And due to the purchase accounting adjustments, and other one-time costs, we're going to realize several pennies of EPS dilution in the first half of the year, which should be offset by the end of the year.
So if you're taking that all into account, for the full-year 2011, our current expectations have increased to total revenue in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion and adjusted EPS of between $2.29 and $2.33 per share. For the first quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in a range of $470 million to $475 million, adjusted tax rate of approximately 23% and adjusted EPS of between $0.40 and $0.41. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarterly performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

Today, we're reporting another record-breaking quarter and year for Citrix in both revenue and EPS. I'm very pleased with our 2010 strategic, operating and financial results, further establishing Citrix's leadership in virtual computing. 2010 was highlighted by three primary things in my mind: Stronger market positions in Desktop Virtualization, Web Collaboration and app networking; secondly, significant strategic visibility in the IT executive suite; and third, solid operating leverage in our financials. Importantly, our go-to-market transformation has elevated our presence as a strategic vendor with significant increases in C-level engagements, step ups in SI pipelines and deal flow, up-selling end-to-end technologies and cross selling our networking products. You can see it in our results, a larger mix of seven-figure deals than ever, greater use of our products as an end-to-end system, record growth of technical services, especially consulting, and strength in SA renewals. I'm extremely proud of the Citrix team and thankful to thousands of Citrix partners and customers, both long-standing and new for their business, their confidence and their enthusiasm for our strategic vision. 
Here's how we'll drive the business this year. Five things: First, continued go-to-market evolution with direct customer touch and a larger mix of business from SI and service-provider channels; second, increased depth in select strategic partnerships, that's further develop the virtual computing markets we're in and broaden our reach; third, customer programs and services built around our Desktop transformation model to accelerate the adoption of Desktop Virtualization; fourth, expanded brand awareness in virtualization, networking and cloud computing spaces; and fifth and as always, an amazing innovation agenda for all of our product lines and services. So next, I'd like to give some additional color in several areas of the business starting with web collaboration. 
Around the globe, web, audio and video collaboration continue to go mainstream, converging and moving toward mass-market appeal, fueled by solid economic globalization and productivity trends, empowering our Online Services business to 17% growth with over $360 million in 2010 revenue, and increasing our share in web collaboration, now garnering the number two position. 
In October, we announced GoToMeeting with HD faces, adding stunning HD videoconferencing to GoToMeeting. We also introduced GoToMeeting for French and German-speaking markets, and achieved some early customer successes in those markets in Q4. As David mentioned, to accelerate our European expansion, we're acquiring Germany-based Net Viewer, adding go-to-market capacity, management depth and a larger customer footprint, and building on our current strength in the U.K. and Nordic regions. In 2011, we'll focus on fully integrating the Net Viewer business, on new go-to-market programs, on higher-impact partnerships, on strengthening of our remote access and support services and on executing in the international marketplace. In addition, our growth plan includes even richer collaboration experiences, partner app integrations and expanded mobile device support including GoToMyPC for the iPad.
Next is our Desktop Virtualization business, where we've now shipped over 6 million licenses since the release of XenDesktop 4 just five quarters ago. 2010 was a milestone year for XenDesktop, growing 400% to about $250 million in revenue and becoming the growth engine of our overall desktop computing business. 
In Q4, we shipped more than a million licenses with some great customer wins across geographies, segments and scale. For example, a large U.S.-based healthcare provider, wanted a virtual desktop platform for flexible access to electronic medical records and other apps for 20,000 employees. After selecting Citrix in a head-to-head competitive bake-off, they traded up 4,600 XenApp licenses to XenDesktop Platinum. And then, they added 2,000 new licenses on top of that. An Asia-based customer in financial services with an extensive branch network, abandoned their first-generation virtual infrastructure stack for a full XenDesktop stack, signing a deal for 2,500 seats, and then added Citrix networking products to ensure a secure, available and fast end-to-end user experience. 
Another example is the petroleum company, with 2,000 employees throughout Australia needed a virtual Desktop solution to serve a wide variety of end points, over networks and user scenarios. They chose XenDesktop for its FlexCast technology to deliver a mix of hosted shared desktops, VDI desktops, virtual apps and local VM desktops running XenClient technology. This deal was a joint win with Microsoft, where the customer is leveraging our combined Desktop, App and server virtualization stack, all managed by Microsoft system center.
The largest XenDesktop deal in the quarter was with a major European government agency. They purchased Platinum Edition as an end-to-end solution for centralizing apps, desktops and data for 150,000 users to support a vast array of devices, to reach mobile and branch workers and to achieve new levels of security. The deal was closed in collaboration with a global SI partner and Microsoft with Citrix consulting services assisting with architectural design and implementation strategy. So these are a few examples to give you a sense for what's happening with customers in the market.
Looking forward, there are three focal points for our Desktop business: First, drive mass-market demand; second, raise the bar in innovation; and third, expand the desktop to web and SaaS apps. So our biggest XenDesktop growth opportunity lies in developing primary demand for virtualization at the desktop, to drive mass market. We still consider the market to be in earlier stages with the potential to go mainstream as an enterprise-wide solution. 
Entering 2011, it's clear that virtual desktops are high-priority for many IT teams, actually becoming a budget line item and being acknowledged as a strategic element of overall IT spend. Our focus is in market segments where security, business flexibility and central management are most critical, in particular, banking, healthcare and government. We already have an impressive set of large-scale successful implementations to reference in these segments.
In 2011, we'll build on our go-to-market partnerships that accelerate core demand in collaboration with Microsoft, with Cisco on the UCS platform, with Wipro's Desktop as a Service offering, with Citrix SIs including CSC, Fujitsu, IBM and Accenture. With Intel and major OEMs including Dell, HP and Lenovo, and with over 400 Citrix-ready business partners. The opportunity is to transform the enterprise desktop to an on-demand service, offering new ways to migrate to Windows 7, to rethink traditional hardware refresh cycles, to embrace amazing new consumer devices and to bring SaaS apps into the enterprise. 
From a technology perspective, we're driving the market with Citrix Receiver, our universal client for IT services, allowing IT to say yes to millions of new devices entering the enterprise from personal laptops to tablets to smartphones, making Citrix the one company that can truly deliver IT as a service to any device, anywhere, securely. Over the past few weeks, Receiver has been one of the top two free business apps in the new Mac app store. Receiver was featured prominently in Google's Chrome OS Notebook launch, and Receiver embedded in Motorola’s ATRIX 4G smartphone helped it earn best of show at CES. In 2010, Receiver was downloaded over 1.8 million times across a wide variety of consumer laptop, tablet and smartphone platforms.
Virtual apps continue to be an essential part of the virtual desktop. Last year, XenApp 6 launch set a new standard for user density, overall scalability, integration with Microsoft systems center and app V and support for Windows Server 2008. From here, product advancements will continue at a rapid pace, giving customers lower cost through innovations in management, scalability and storage, making the path to desktop virtualization more clear, more compelling and more economical than ever.
Last year's introduction of XenDesktop 5 in October was a significant step forward, delivering major product simplifications that make simplification, installation and set up faster and easier, a completely new and powerful management operations console. Optimizations for XenServer that significantly reduce storage cost, while raising the level of VDI performance and VM density. Self-service apps including single sign-on for Windows, web and SaaS applications; secure centrally managed virtual desktops to go with our new XenClient feature and lots more.
2011 will mark another year where innovations will further optimize the cost of virtual desktops, while distancing ourselves from competitive solutions through better design, broader device support, better partnerships and greater leverage of our FlexCast technology.
Going forward, SaaS and web apps are rapidly becoming a core part of the Desktop computing experience. That's why we've made the seamless integration of SaaS and web apps into both virtual and physical desktops, a core feature of XenDesktop 5 and a top priority on our innovation agenda. For the user, this takes self-service to an entirely new level, giving them an easy way to access any Windows, SaaS or web app, with a single click and a single log-in. Their apps even automatically synchronize across devices, a Citrix invention we call Follow Me apps.
For the first time, IT gets three core things. First, centrally managed account creation for hundreds of SaaS apps like Salesforce and NetSuite, success factors and Mark Cueto as examples that are fully integrated with active directory. Secondly, IT gets powerful workflows that automatically enable or disable user access. And thirdly, license monitoring and auditing to reduce cost and to enable better compliance management. 
Extending the benefits of access control, management and single sign-on to web and SaaS apps is one more way we are helping IT to embrace consumerization, while controlling what matters: the service, delivering a great experience for users on any device and getting robust security and management for IT organizations. So that's how we're thinking about Desktop Virtualization looking forward. As a market, that's multidimensional across virtual desktops, apps and data. That's moving rapidly toward broader adoption, and where Citrix is a clear market leader.
When it comes to the cloud, CIOs love the idea of a more elastic style of computing, one that lets them freely choose from a vast array of IT services, without having to build and support everything themselves. At the same time, they're increasingly concerned about the impending cloud wars they see on the horizon, with every major IT vendor promoting their own proprietary cloud stack. That's why we're taking a fundamentally different approach with our Citrix OpenCloud platform, an approach that makes it easy for customers to connect their existing data centers into any external cloud service, regardless of the hypervisor, network or app platform on either side. This strategy is highly differentiated, and a great example of what makes the end-to-end Citrix virtual computing vision compelling and unique. 
In 2010, our Data Center and Cloud products grew nearly 30%, delivering close to $300 million in revenue. Growth was fueled by the NetScaler business growing 35% and XenServer business which saw market share expand to more than 15% of all new servers virtualized in 2010. In 2011, we're focusing on product innovation that will leverage our full range of virtual desktop, app, networking and server technologies. 
In addition, we're investing in a dedicated sales team, focused specifically on the cloud-provider market, and game changing new partnerships that will further enhance our position as the most widely deployed networking and virtualization platform in the cloud. I'm very pleased today in fact to announce the first of those partnerships in 2011. An exciting new collaboration with the industry's number one cloud provider and operator of the largest virtualized environment in the world, Amazon Web Services. 
As part of this agreement, Citrix and Amazon are working together on the Xen platform in three key areas to make cloud computing more open, more accessible and more secure. More open by enabling seamless interoperability between the Amazon cloud and millions of XenServer workloads running in enterprise data centers and in other clouds. More accessible by ensuring that existing Windows workloads in private data centers run just as well in the Amazon cloud, with the same manageability, reliability and performance. And more secure by bringing XenServer's enterprise-class disaster recovery, compliance and advanced security innovations to Amazon cloud customers. 
In a world of many clouds, our strategy of making it easy for customers to connect to any cloud with the best performance, security and ROI, will continue to differentiate Citrix as a leading cloud infrastructure provider. 
So in closing, CIOs are telling us three things: First, they want to simplify enterprise computing; secondly, they want ways to embrace IT consumerization; and third, they're ready to adopt a larger mix of cloud services. All of these in the pursuit of transforming IT to an on-demand service. 
We think this is the promise and the opportunity of virtual computing infrastructure. This is how we'll continue to deliver a long-term value for shareholders, for employees, for partners and for customers. So I'm really delighted to share these results with you today and now, I'd like to open it up to questions. Casey?"

We have subscription advantage that's available on both XenApp and XenDesktop. And now that we've got one-full quarter of last year's XenDesktop sales coming up for renewal, the renewal rates on this are substantially higher than what we've seen historically on XenApp, north of 95%. And while it's certainly one data point, it's in line with the way we've been thinking about this. XenDesktop is a strategic part of customers’ infrastructure, as opposed to XenApp, which in some cases was more project or tactical. And so, I think this is one of those things that will help drive deferred revenue growth as the installed base of XenDesktop, continues to be a larger and larger percent of the mix."

So we'll recognize, call it a couple million of revenue, probably from the acquisition in Q1 and $20 million for the year, ballpark. And that will be substantially lower than the underlying bookings performance that's going on with the international online business. So call it $20 million next year, probably at least double that in 2012 as we get back to a more of a normalized model. So specific to the dilution, a couple of pennies in the first quarter, maybe a penny in the second and then accretive by the back end of the year.

So the way to think about the broad Desktop Solutions business in Q1 would be product license growth in the -- in the low- to mid-teens, and total revenue growth obviously kind of in that same range, 13% to 15%. I do expect at this point that deferred revenue growth will be a positive in Q1. And I expect  deferred revenue balance to go up. It's just forecasting the exact amount, it's got a lot of variables in it. So that's why we shy away from giving bookings guidance.

And a lot of that has to do with the uptake in the VSP channel and as well as some of our larger enterprise customers. And then I'd say the third piece that we're looking for is that the fact is that both MPX and VPX interoperate kind of as a service delivery controller fabric so that you can put the physical hardware at the front door, and then you can put the virtual appliances in front of web tier, app tier and data tier  services inside the data center and service provider to sort of give an even more powerful solution.

What we've said quite consistently is that this is really a Desktop Computing business that has kind of the desktop and apps sort of product then desktop and then the App-only product, XenApp. And over a series of quarters, what we're seeing is customers being able to choose the right solution for what they're trying to do: app-centric solutions, app- delivery kind of solutions, project-based solutions. XenApp continues to be a fantastic product for that. And those that want to move more toward a more robust, full-featured Desktop-as-a-Service kind of a solution, they're naturally picking XenDesktop. Of course, they get XenApp in the process of doing that. So we don't look at this as a decay rate, we look at it as a normalization rate between the products based upon what's happening in the marketplace and what customers are actually demanding. And the key thing that we look at here, obviously, is total growth of the Desktop business, whether we serve a customer more strategically with a full virtual desktop system or we serve a customer more tactically, let's say, with a virtual app solution. We love both customers. So let me --  let David handle more the number -- share part of the question."

They have incredible access at the top end, top levels of IT organizations, and they brought us in, in many, many cases. Secondly, the response that we're seeing from customers on UCS is very positive. The tests that we've run in the lab and customers have run in their pilots with XenDesktop on UCS, it's quite impressive as a platform for XenDesktop. One of the major New York banks has committed with as a platforms for XenDesktop. And in the last five quarters, I think we've done seven figures in licensing for XenDesktop with them, and they'll be putting all that on UCS. And that's again good to see as a validation of the platform and the partnership. There's more to do and more to come this year with our partnership with Cisco, so stay tuned for that. And so just kind of all probably exceeding our expectations right now in terms of how that's going. 
The announcement that IBM made I guess a few days ago was really coming out of their software group, a product that's a VDI-only product for the SMB marketplace where I think overall it's pretty much well understood that market adoption for virtual desktops in that marketplace is really unproven and really, really, really early. Our work with IBM, IGS, is all on the enterprise side. And IBM includes XenDesktop in both their Public and their Private Cloud Services business. They have something called Smart Business Desktop Cloud. We're essential to that. They're running that infrastructure for I think now over 100 customers. They've trained hundreds of consultants on XenDesktop in the last year. And our work with IBM Global Services has been amazing. So I identify them as one of the top SIs in terms of momentum. In fact, in Q4, we had three seven-figure deals with them, and it's my understanding that they closed two seven-figure deals since the first of the year that were in the pipeline. So we're highly focused with IBM on where the market is, and that's mid-market to enterprise. And that's what we know about the announcement."

The primary reason is XenServer is at the core of technology that's within XenClient, that's underneath XenDesktop, that is underneath the OpenCloud platform that we'll be enhancing this year. And you'll see parts of other products that we have in the pipeline. So it's an important element across our entire virtual computing platform. And that's how you need to think about it. We do make it available, sort of the basic version of it, free, and there's a viral uptake model there. The monetization is modest, but it's because it's not the focus of the business. The focus of the business is to leverage XenServer technologies. So you see today we made the announcement with Amazon around Amazon Web Services. And so core technologies that were developed in XenServer for optimizing Windows' performance and security of Windows workloads and the manageability of them, et cetera, the ability to tie all of that together with XenCenter to be able to make Amazon Web Services an extension of a private data center, all of that is XenServer technology that's really, really critical for us and as well as in our networking products.

So John, the way to think about it is, so the most straightforward one is we do talk about on an annual basis the number of new servers virtualized in the year and what percentage share that we've gotten. So in 2010, our estimate is 15%. That's up from 11% in 2009 and 3% in 2008. And that's based on viral, and it's based upon relationships we have with certain cloud providers that are building their stack on top of XenServer. Last year, for example, we jointly announced with RackSpace that they would move their entire platform from open-source Xen to XenServer. So making XenServer then an important element there, of course, but counting in the sockets there around new servers virtualized as RackSpace themselves continue to grow. So that's the most direct metric. The other metric is really around the velocity that we get in XenDesktop due to the XenClient technology and due to the optimizations that we make in XenServer so that we can offer a customer a full platform on top of the bare metal and drive optimizations, whether they're storage or density or performance, and while we’d also run on top of other virtual platforms as well. And so XenDesktop is an important piece of the monetization of the XenServer technology. Those are the primary things to look for. And then, as we get further and more deeply into our OpenCloud platform and releasing that, we'll be monetizing it there as well. And that will be another proxy for the value of XenServer in the underlying infrastructure."

So that means more deployments, not fewer, with our strategic customers. I think project-based customers that have bought XenApp in the past will continue and do continue to buy XenApp and deploy it in a similar kind of a pattern and similar kinds of ways. And you see that -- the evidence of that, obviously, is in the SA renewal motion. We continue to see really strong renewal rates. There are no declines in the renewal rates. As a matter of fact, in XenApp and XenDesktop renewal rates are, as David mentioned, remarkably higher. So as I said a little bit earlier in response to Rob's question, the key thing here is to clearly position each product, make sure the sales organization, partners understand those products, and then meet the customer demand where it happens to be and let customers make that decision.

But I can tell you the anecdotal evidence that I have from the time I spent with customers and partners since we made the announcement, did the sort of world tour and demonstrations back in October, we expect to see really amazing things. One of the things that we did with XenDesktop 5 is we made sure that if you are going to implement a VDI kind of solution, you can basically install it in 10 minutes. And we call it 10 -- and then spinning up desktops or multiples of desktops is then sort of measured in seconds. And we reduced the complexity overall, a central console for operations and configuration management, et cetera. So we've done a lot of things in XenDesktop 5 to answer these market adoption challenges, and we'll see that play out, I think, in 2011.

And what we're measuring is kind of the subsequent purchase that a customer makes after the first one. And remember, there's not a lot of data points here over the course of a year, but what we're seeing is a reorder size that has gone from about four or 5x earlier in the year, up closer to 10x. And so customers are deploying Desktop Virtualization, they're working through the initial setup and they're on scale. And that's an important driver for us going forward. So great motion, good activity metrics. Stay tuned, we'll keep providing that each quarter. And probably a good leading indicator."

The 2010 numbers actually, especially on the networking side, are partially a reflection of the successful programs we began last year for cross-selling of networking. And they were so successful that we're doing a couple, three things. Not spiffs, all right, but we're adding more heads to the overlay teams that really help come in and close the networking and cross-selling kinds of products. We are doing a lot more training, and it's been baked into the quotas of every quota-carrying sales rep in the world. So everyone sees not only the strategic sort of benefit of cross-selling because you get the chance to talk about end-to-end virtualization, virtual computing, but also the revenue and the growth kinds of capabilities, opportunities that it brings to the sales rep, and that puts money in their pockets. So I think that last year was a good start. We've put it on the plate as one of the top five priorities for every salesperson in the world. Great success. We're somewhat doubling down this year on two dimensions: upselling, which is really more getting the Branch Repeater, Access Gateway, other kinds of related components and NetScaler components as part of a XenDesktop and a XenApp infrastructure design, as well as cross-selling both our networking products and, in the U.S., beginning to cross-sell our web collaboration products as well. So we think there's a lot of runway there as we scale that up this year and learn a lot more about how to do it and how to scale it effectively."

As you can see from the release, we're starting off the year across with good momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $491 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.50 and $1",1187,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we're starting off the year across with good momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $491 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.50 and $159 million in cash flow from operations. 
I'm really pleased with our execution in the field and throughout the organization in Q1. We're driving leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in the networking business and expanding our SaaS [Software-as-a-Service] footprint, trends can be  clearly seen in the financials. 
So looking at the first quarter, revenue from new license sales was $150 million, up 22% from last year. License update revenue increased 9%. Tech services increased 44%, led by record consulting demand and support agreements attached to our networking products. And finally, online SaaS revenue was $100 million, up 17%.
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continue to execute really well, delivering revenue up 22% from last year to $217 million. And included in this number is product license growth of about 23% year-on-year and 11 transactions, individual transactions greater than $1 million.
In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $133 million. And similar to last year, demand across the region was uneven particularly with the public sector, as many countries are still working through budgetary constraints and capital project prioritization.
And finally, Japan and Pacific are both growing significantly, posting combined revenue growth of 25% from last year. So overall, a very solid quarter. As we look into 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline continued at record levels. We remain committed to delivering balanced results while investing to expand our competitive position, innovation and capacity across our 3 main product categories.
So now let's look at the Q1 results within these 3 businesses. First, Desktop solutions grew 13% from last year to nearly $290 million. Included in this was product license revenue of $100 million, which is an increase of 21% over Q1 last year. The license growth was led by strength in XenDesktop, where the product license was up well over 100% from last year to $43 million, and is quickly approaching 1/2 of the total license mix for the Desktop solutions group.
Furthermore context on the Desktop business in Q1, there's a few metrics that I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption that we're seeing and the strategic value that the customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, 8 of the 14 deals that were over $1 million in Q1 included the XenDesktop licenses. There were over 2,000 different customers that purchased XenDesktop in the period, including 83 transactions from more than 1,000 seats each and 17 deals for over 5000 seats. And we exited Q1 with a record pipeline of $1 million-plus enterprise Desktop opportunities.
So next, in our Data Center and Cloud business. Total revenue was $78 million, up 33% in the quarter with new product revenue increasing 27%. The growth in this business was led by NetScaler, with revenue up more than 50% year-on-year. We continue driving a successful initiative to cross sell networking into our enterprise base with several hundred customers purchasing both software and hardware products together in Q1. Regarding these specific platforms, contribution from the high and NetScaler appliances was up sharply due to wins within the dot com, telco and the service provider segment. 
In the VPX line, our virtual appliances continues to do really well, giving both enterprise and cloud customers a new level of performance and flexibility  within their data centers and clouds. And in total, VPX revenue was up more than 300% compared to Q1 last year, and now accounts for almost 10% of NetScaler license revenue. This is only after 6 quarters in the market.
And finally, touching on our SaaS business. Revenue was up 17% in the first quarter to $100 million, and the growth here continues to be led by the collaboration of products, which drove about 30%.
The second half of Q1, we closed the acquisition of NetViewer in Germany, and this is an important part of the strategy to accelerate our SaaS footprint internationally. And due to the timing of the close, the revenue contribution was about $3 million in Q1.
So looking at the expenses and operations. In the first quarter, adjustment op margin was 23%, up 74 basis points from last year, and really a result of revenue performance and our continued focus on execution. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind the demand growth we're seeing in the market so as bookings, pipelines and proof of concepts had accelerated, we continue to focus on 2 main areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech-support; and second, around product innovation, to bring to market new technologies, as well as improving integration across the solutions to drive simplicity and better end-user experience.
In Q1, we added 350 new people to Citrix, including 200 of which that joined the team through the NetViewer acquisition. Year-on-year, total headcount increased a little over 1,000 people. Also of note, I'd like to point out that included in other income line in Q1 is foreign exchange remeasurement gains of about $3 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments closed at $1.6 billion, driven by $159 million in cash flow from operations. During the quarter, we invested about $120 million in acquisitions and repurchased nearly 1.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $69 a share.
Today, we also announced that the board has authorized an additional $500 million of repurchase authorization to be used in the future as part of our ongoing program.
And finally, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was a record $789 million, up 24% from last year. The 4 main drivers of this growth have been: The increasing size of the base for the Subscription Advantage program, the success of the Desktop Trade-up initiative, a greater volume of multiyear deals being closed; and tech service contracts for consulting and support. 
So really, in total, a great Q1. We are executing well, we're seeing growth in all our strategic businesses. And we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while expanding our go-to-market capacity.
So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q2 and the full year 2011. Given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth for opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our outlook for 2011. For the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion and adjusted EPS of between $2.38 and $2.41 per share.
And for the second quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million and adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23%, and adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55.
So I'd like to turn over to Mark to give you additional details on first quarter performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

Q1 demand in our core markets was strong, with acceleration and collaboration, Desktop and networking segments. Business through SIs is driving growth in multimillion dollar deals and adding rapidly to the overall pipeline. And our technical and consulting services teams are having consistent successes with larger more strategic accounts from presale all the way through implementation.
And I'd like to say our Japan team turned in a remarkable performance, inspite of the disaster, not missing a beat. I'd like to thank them and say that I'm proud of how they've supported our customers, partners and colleagues there. 
In all, we're feeling confident about our execution across SaaS, premise and appliance business models and around our strategic objectives in a rapidly changing computing landscape. The industry is clearly moving from the PC era to the cloud era. This transition, driven by consumerization is changing the way we work and play. It's transforming the desktop, it's transforming networks, and it's transforming the way we collaborate.
The combined forces of cloud and consumerization are clearly driving our Desktop business as CIOs look to create private desktop clouds that deliver apps, desktops and data to a wide mix of IT-owned and employee-owned devices. We're meeting this growing demand with increased capacity for top-down customer engagement through global SIs. Go-to-market alliances, with strategic partners like Microsoft, Cisco, Dell and HP and product innovations in XenDesktop 5 and XenApp 6 that dramatically simplify large-scale enterprisewide deployments. This is how we're driving Desktop Virtualization into the mainstream. 
Worldwide, we now have 50 customers with more than 10,000 licenses of XenDesktop with several in excess of 100,000. The business drivers to go virtual at the desktop are broad, impacting customers of all sizes, industries and geos. So wins in the quarter tells a story. Par example, a U.S.-based healthcare provider ruled out 5,000 seats of XenDesktop to consolidate facilities and to securely deliver sensitive medical information to affiliate clinics efficiently, over the wide area network. Our FlexCast technology allows them to support the full variety of used cases from doctors and nurses to office workers, using a wide variety of PCs, laptops, Xen clients and tablets.
In Europe, our top-tier retail bank expanded their larger scale XenApp Trade-up from last year by adding new licenses of XenDesktop platinum to accelerate the merger integration of an acquired bank. And, as one of the largest age our service firms chose a mix of XenDesktop and XenApp to centralize, simplify and lower overall IT costs by moving more than 1,000 apps and 5,000 users to our Desktop Virtualization platform.
The Fortune 100 CIO who standardized on XenDesktop said it best in a recent e-mail to me, and I quote, ""the benefits of Desktop Virtualization have enabled us to deliver world-class eco-efficiency, workplace optimization, off shoring, business recovery, and secure vendor access. As we've began our companywide transition to Windows 7 in 2011, we anticipate Desktop Virtualization will be the default approach across all businesses and used cases.""
We're winning the market with XenDesktop by offering the only product that enables user access to apps or desktops for many PC, Mac, tablet or smartphone, delivers a high-fidelity user experience, allows self-service for desktops, as well as Windows web and SaaS apps, centralizes configuration, policy and remote support, and goes beyond DDI to integrate the delivery models needed for every user.
We're delivering on our game plan to mainstream this market. The move to Desktop Virtualization and cloud computing is also driving our networking business. NetScaler growth in Q1 was impressive, fueled by new high-end MPX hardware that delivers the best price performance in the industry and our software-based VPX virtual appliances that deliver the best flexibility in the market. Innovative business models like Pay-as-You-Grow and first pack licensing are clearly positioning NetScaler as an end-to-end solution, ideally suited for the cloud ear. Demand in Q1 came from a broad range of enterprise customers and service providers. We are the world's largest acute care and hospital operators deploying NetScaler VPX virtual appliances to transition their paper-based patient record system to a private cloud-based electronic record solution. A large U.S. retail chain purchased to NetScaler MPX to scale up their rapidly growing online e-commerce business; and a leading service provider standardized on NetScaler MPX as the front door of their cloud. And they're also offering NetScaler VPX as a cloud service for enterprise customers.
The cloud era is writing a fundamental transformation of networks. We think as profound as virtualization on desktops. In this new era, fast connections on our pursuit and strategic focus turns to service delivery. This emerging service delivery network will be optimized for content, context and consumerization. We're computing services like apps, desktops, data and rich media are accessed as on-demand services for a wide variety of devices. This is the vision behind our new NetScaler SDX platform, a ground-breaking virtualized networking appliance that consolidates security, scalability, multi-tenancy and performance functions without compromise. It's the perfect front door for enterprise data centers and for on-demand cloud providers. NetScaler SDX uses our Zen virtualization technology to run multiple, virtual NetScaler instances on a single hardware appliance, each optimized for different apps, services, sites and customers. Each of virtual instance delivers the exact mix of acceleration, security and scalability needed to serve a wide variety of enterprise work loads, from a single networking platform designed for private and external clouds.
NetScaler SDX incorporates Intel's advanced Multicore and SRIOV technologies, allowing it to deliver secure, multitenant, multiservice functionality at native wire speeds. It's a fundamental breakthrough in this market, allowing customers to move to a more robust service delivery requirements of private and utility clouds. We are innovating, growing and setting the pace, watch this space for more.
The new way to work in the cloud era is a virtual, with the ability to share content, screens and ideas with anyone across devices, geographies and corporate boundaries. It's a more productive, more eco-friendly and more flexible way to get things done. Citrix is leading here as one of the top SaaS providers of web Collaboration In the world with GoToMeeting, Training and Webinar. 
In Europe, we began to get some early market traction after closing the Netviewer deal. The integration is going smoothly and the 200 strong team already has a good number of wins under their belt. This acquisition will boost the growth of our international SaaS business, with a much larger go-to-market footprint in Europe for our collaboration and support products.
In Q1, we are also very pleased when Skype chose Citrix to add Web Collaboration to their ubiquitous communications platform. This partnership will allow Skype to offer business customers a stunning web and audio conferencing experience, enabled by integration with GoToMeeting technology.
Personal cloud services like GoToMeeting and Skype are powerful examples of IT consumerization. It's been just 1 year since the iPad changed everything. And for the first time, enterprise IT is embracing a wide range of smartphones, tablets and cloud-powered laptops as part of delighting the user, creating new business possibilities and shifting costs away from IT budgets. This is driving huge uptake of our GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and Citrix Receiver apps for Apple, Android and Windows, allowing IT to support these devices with business-endorsed collaboration, remote access, hosted apps and virtual desktops with a consumer-like user experience. These Citrix apps have continually been at the top of the app store charts, and are now being embedded in devices like Motorola Atrix 4G. As new devices begin to shift based on Android Honeycomb, Promo S, Windows Phone and Web OS, our apps will be there. In fact, HP recently demoed Citrix Receiver for Web OS on their beautiful new touchpad tablet, showing how it can securely access many thousands of corporate apps from line of business, to analytics, to big data virtualization directly from receiver's self-service enterprise app store.
Citrix continues to be the one company that can securely deliver IT as an on-demand service to any device, anywhere. 
In the last month, I spend significant personal time with many CIOs from medium to the largest enterprises. They are moving from interested to really engaged in transformation, suggesting that all of this transformation could be more rapid than any of us first imagined. They are desired to embrace consumerization as the desktop and cloud is striking. We're giving them the power to say yes to consumer devices, yes to SaaS apps and yes to cloud infrastructure. And all that is clearly resonating with them.
Computing, as we know it, is facing a multitude of disruptive forces, creating unprecedented stress on today's industry leaders, forcing IT into transformation mode and providing massive opportunity for agile players like Citrix. Our strategy is to show customers how to navigate the convergence of legacy and cloud services while delivering consumer-like experiences and greater business productivity, through innovation, thought leadership and industry partnerships, Citrix is providing a bridge to the cloud era.
Before we get to the Q&A, I'd like to personally invite you to our upcoming industry conference, Synergy 2011, where virtual computing will take center stage at San Francisco's Masconi Center from May 25 to 27. We'll be introducing the future there with exciting announcements, breakthrough technologies, demonstrations and new partnerships along with a few surprises.

Let me think about -- let me take the second part of that question first. Last year, when we were really focused on Trade-up, especially in Q2 when there was a lot of promotional activity, we have tremendous customer demand and customer bookings and drove growth in deferred revenue, which I believe was up just over $50 million last year. So I expect Q2 deferred revenue to be strong, strongly positive and higher than the growth we saw in Q1. Most of that booking was recognized over a radical period of time. So as the mix between new licenses, which are typically about 15%, 20% deferred and Trade-up, which could be 50% deferred, as that continues to shift, you're going to see more show up in current period revenue through product license and less show up on a protracted base over license updates."

Our prior guidance would've taken Desktop solutions license to between 11% and 14% this year. I think given the Q1 performance and full-year outlook, we'd be comfortable raising that to about 15% to 18% growth for the full year 2011. And that's reflecting some of the trends that I'm talking about here. The other thing I point out in terms of the individual line items of the P&L is license updates. That's the line that we recognize most of the deferred revenue through. So that is a lagging indicator to product license bookings. You've seen how that's, the year-over-year growth rate has decelerated over the last several quarters, really reflecting the economic environment and the low product sales that were occurring in 2009 and really into the beginning of 2010. So looking into Q2, I think you should expect license update revenue to decelerate a little bit, a little bit further on a year-over-year basis, and have Q2 be the bottom for the year and start to accelerate into the back half of the year again."

It's coming from a number of points that we called out earlier. We're seeing good traction at the highest end, showing into big web properties, major service providers. We're seeing continued traction for the cross-sell activities and be done across sell networking into a traditional accounts. We had well over 400 unique customers that were buying both hardware and software products in the quarter, which is continues to be up to the right, so that's terrific. And then, the last thing around our virtual appliances, the ones we call the VPX, those are now contributing materially. I mean that's up to about 10% of the overall NetScaler mix, and it's pretty important because we're seeing not only customers that are starting with VPX and then following up with an MPX sale. But a lot of customers that are actually looking at both the hardware and the software versions, think of it as kind of an interoperable part of a service delivery fabric, where you can take an MPX appliance, put it at the front door of the data center and then use VPX virtual appliances on different tiers of the stack, your web tier, your app tier, data tier and et cetera, just giving them really unprecedented flexibility and performance across the infrastructure. So those are the great trends that we're starting to see. As far as the business going through the rest of the year, optimistic about NetScaler. I think we've got some good things coming out. We talked about STX, got some new surprises coming later in the quarter and next quarter. And so, positive outlook. As far as the rest of the Data Center in Glasgow, the only thing I'd say is that the Branch Repeater, which is our LAN optimization solution, we've had great success with the federal government in 2010, selling that in big deals in both Q2 and Q3. I don't see those immediately in the forecast for this quarter but a really tough comp coming up for Q2 and Q3. So the blended business for the division will be, call it, low double-digit growth overall. But certainly, the NetScaler piece is growing substantially faster than that."

It's one of those areas where I think we're capacity constrained. I mean we've been adding aggressively across our consulting capacity in all Geos, really to help customers not only get POCs off the ground but provide architectural help implementation, et cetera and really be there to facilitate knowledge transfer. And a successful customer out of the gate obviously becomes a much larger customer downstream. So a great leading indicator when I look across the consulting business, we're going to continue to add to that capacity out Q2 and through the rest of the year, I'm sure. The other side of that is around tech services. We had a lot of customers, a lot of customer demand for maintenance agreements on top of the networking products, as well as just software support for everything else. So good business. I think looking into Q2, it will grow sequentially, probably in the mid-to high 20s on a year-over-year basis, from a growth rate and really just be gated by our capacity and our ability to add people."

But the important dimension of XenServer is its contributions to our growth in the Desktop business, and its contribution to what we're doing in the networking business. As I mentioned, it's now embedded in our SDX platform that's going to give us a tremendous range of competitive advantages in the networking segments. And then, when it comes to Desktop, XenServer continues to be the optimal platform to run the XenDesktop on because of technologies that we have embedded on both sides of the API stack. So that doesn't mean customers always choose that. We're seeing it stay underneath XenDesktop and at least of the cases, and we see a big uptake in that area in our relation with Microsoft and Hyper-V. And actually seeing customers running XenDesktop on ESX. And then, as we are getting more and more focused on the cloud, we're seeing great uptake in cloud providers of XenServer. I think we all probably saw the announcement that we made not too long ago with RackSpace, who moved entirely to XenServer. But we're doing that with other public clouds, and as I think you all know, Xen is actually the hypervisor in about 80% or more of the utility clouds that are out there.

So that's one dimension of it. And why we're seeing amazing downloads. In fact, I just look yet last night and Receiver is still on the top 10 on the iPad, iPhone, App Store and it's #1 free business app on the Mac App Store. So that's coming from people who already have the infrastructure, downloading it and using it to connect to something they already have. I think Receiver plays an important role than in our strategic message, in how we demonstrate what's possible on XenDesktop and XenApp, to do our customers that were talking to about a strategic implementation, and how this answers a lot of the consumerization challenges they had around really lighting of these consumer devices without compromising security. So that's the role it plays there, very, very strategic growth there and why, because every device that's coming out going forward here, the newer platforms, as I mentioned, HP's touchpad based on Web OS, some of the Chrome OS devices, Windows Phone devices, et cetera, Receiver will be there. So that will pay off on what our promise for network and device independence. As far as the XenClient uptake, the downloads have been, continue to be very solid. We'll talk more about XenClient at Synergy, and we're pleased with what it's doing for the business, giving customers yet one other FlexCast delivery model. It tends to be more important and popular in segments where they are as a very high level of concern around security, in combination with mobility.

First, with the introduction of VPX, really need NetScaler much more consumable and comfortable for our distribution partners. Our integration partners because they tend to be focused on software for the most part historically. So the VPX models have really helped them actually get engaged with the NetScaler brand. But that is leading them to sell not only VPX but also MPX. I think the second piece is we've actually had a very focused initiative around cross selling, our networking products, and so, our field teams are much better at that. And we've added more capacity in the field around technical selling capacity, around the NetScaler product line. That's also helped a lot. So there's a degree of sort of push to this, as well as the customer pull. And obviously, we're going to keep innovating. We made an announcement, and I think an industry first a couple weeks ago around our new DataStream technology. So it takes everything that we've learned around putting NetScaler in front of the web tier of an app. And it implements that same acceleration, security, performance, et cetera and off loading capability to the data tier. So sitting in front of databases, which will save customers money, makes apps faster and more secure. So we're just getting into that. And so, I think we have a lot of opportunity here with greater capacity in the marketplace for the products to market and greater innovation to make the more applicable where we do introduce them to the customers."

So the way we're thinking about this is really simple. This is a Desktop Virtualization business. And so, the unit mix and sort of what customers choose to buy in the end, whether it's XenDesktop that's inclusive of XenApp or just XenApp, where we really are the kind of indifferent on that. And we want customers to buy the product that best suits their needs. So if you look at the unit volumes that way, we continue to see great progress and growth in both dimensions. The goal here is to drive the mainstream but were still in the early stages. And what it takes is some of the things that we've done that are very much in our control around making the product easier to implement, making it simpler to manage and doing more of the innovation area around storage and getting some of the cost of implementation down, making it easier for customers to understand how to do the transformation through our Desktop transformation model. So there are number of things there that we're doing that are in our control. And obviously, we're benefiting from some things that we don't want to control actually. There are these tailwind forces that are coming from all the consumerization stuff, whether it's devices or personal clouds or what's going on in utility cloud. So, I'd say that it's hard to call an inflection point because it's not widely there. It's a knee in the curve so this will be gradual acceleration through the year around this business overall. And we'll do everything we can to control to accelerate it in the meantime. So some of that will roll out at Synergy in May, and we hope to see you there."

They make a very efficient, very low cost storage solution that some of our smaller resellers like a lot. And then, thing that third area is we're obviously adding capabilities to XenDesktop that reduce the storage requirements, and doing that in a XenDesktop itself as well inside of XenServer. So I think it's one part innovation, one part new products that are serving a lower-cost segment and then one part working with the larger storage partners around optimizations that they are naturally doing to compete in the marketplace."

As you can see from the release, we're starting off the year with good momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $491 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.50 and $159 mill",1183,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we're starting off the year with good momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $491 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.50 and $159 million in cash flow from operations. 
I'm really pleased with our execution in the field and throughout the organization in Q1. We're driving leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in the networking business and expanding our SaaS [Software-as-a-Service] footprint, trends that can be clearly seen in the financials. 
So looking at the first quarter, revenue from new license sales was $150 million, up 22% from last year. License update revenue increased 9%. Tech services increased 44%, led by record consulting demand and support agreements attached to our networking products. And finally, online SaaS revenue was $100 million, up 17%.
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 22% from last year to $217 million. And included in this number is product license growth of about 23% year-on-year and 11 transactions, individual transactions, greater than $1 million.
In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $133 million. And similar to last year, demand across the region was uneven, particularly with the public sector, as many countries are still working through budgetary constraints and capital project prioritization.
And finally, Japan and Pacific are both growing significantly, posting combined revenue growth of 25% from last year. So overall, a very solid quarter. As we look into 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline continue with record levels. We remain committed to delivering balanced results while investing to expand our competitive position, innovation and capacity across our 3 main product categories.
So now let's look at the Q1 results within these 3 businesses. First, Desktop solutions grew 13% from last year to nearly $290 million. Included in this was product license revenue of $100 million, which is an increase of 21% over Q1 last year. The license growth was led by strength in XenDesktop, where the product license was up well over 100% from last year to $43 million, and is quickly approaching 1/2 of the total license mix for the desktop solutions group.
Furthermore context on the Desktop business in Q1, there's a few metrics that I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value the customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, 8 of the 14 deals that were over $1 million in Q1 included XenDesktop licenses. There were over 2,000 different customers that purchased XenDesktop in the period, including 83 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 17 deals for over 5,000 seats. And we exited Q1 with a record pipeline of $1 million-plus enterprise desktop opportunities.
So next, in our Data Center and Cloud business. Total revenue was $78 million, up 33% in the quarter with new product revenue increasing 27%. The growth in this business was led by NetScaler, with revenue up more than 50% year-on-year. We continue driving a successful initiative to cross sell networking into our enterprise base with several hundred customers purchasing both software and hardware products together in Q1. Regarding these specific platforms, contribution from a high NetScaler MPX appliances was up sharply due to wins within the dot com, Telco and Service Provider segment. 
In the VPX line, our virtual appliances continue to do really well, giving both enterprise and cloud customers a new level of performance and flexibility  within their data centers and clouds. And in total, VPX revenue was up more than 300% compared to Q1 last year, and now accounts for almost 10% of NetScaler license revenue. This is only after 6 quarters in the market.
And finally, touching on our SaaS business. Revenue was up 17% in the first quarter to $100 million, and the growth here continues to be led by the collaboration products, which are up about 30%.
The second half of Q1, we closed the acquisition of NetViewer in Germany, and this is an important part of the strategy to accelerate our SaaS footprint internationally. And due to the timing of the close, the revenue contribution was about $3 million in Q1.
So looking on expenses and operations, in the first quarter, adjusted op margin was 23%, up 74 basis points from last year, and really a result of revenue performance and our continued focus on execution. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind the demand growth we're seeing in the market, so as bookings, pipeline and proof of concepts have accelerated, we continue to focus on 2 main areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech-support; and second, around product innovation, to bring the market new technologies, as well as improving integration across the solutions to drive simplicity and a better end-user experience.
In Q1, we added 350 new people to Citrix, including 200 of which that joined the team through the NetViewer acquisition. Year-on-year, total headcount increased a little over 1,000 people. Also of note, I'd like to point out that included in the other income line in Q1 is foreign exchange remeasurement gains of about $3 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments closed at $1.6 billion, driven by $159 million in cash flow from operations. During the quarter, we invested about $120 million in acquisitions and repurchased nearly 1.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $69 a share.
Today, we also announced that the board has authorized an additional $500 million of repurchase authorization to be used in the future as part of our ongoing program.
And finally, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was a record $789 million, up 24% from last year. The 4 main drivers of this growth have been: The increasing size of the base for Subscription Advantage program, the success of the desktop Trade-up initiative; a greater volume of multiyear deals being closed; and tech service contracts for consulting and support. 
So really, in total, a great Q1. We're executing well. We're seeing growth in all our strategic businesses. And we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while expanding our go-to-market capacity.
So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q2 and the full year 2011. Given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth for opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our outlook for 2011. For the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion and adjusted EPS of between $2.38 and $2.41 per share.
And for the second quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million and adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23% and adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55.
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

Q1 demand in our core markets was strong, with the acceleration in Collaboration, Desktop and Networking segments. Business through SIs is driving growth in multimillion dollar deals and adding rapidly to the overall pipeline. And our technical and consulting services teams are having consistent successes with larger, more strategic accounts from presale all the way through implementation.
And I'd like to say our Japan team turned in a remarkable performance, in spite of the disaster, not missing a beat. I'd like to thank them and say that I'm proud of how they've supported our customers, partners and colleagues there. 
In all, we're feeling confident about our execution across SaaS, premise and appliance business models and around our strategic objectives in a rapidly changing computing landscape. The industry is clearly moving from the PC era to the cloud era. This transition, driven by consumerization, is changing the way we work and play. It's transforming the desktop, it's transforming networks, and it's transforming the way we collaborate.
The combined forces of cloud and consumerization are clearly driving our Desktop business. As CIOs look to create private desktop clouds that deliver apps, desktops and data to a wide mix of IT-owned and employee-owned devices. We're meeting this growing demand with increased capacity for top-down customer engagement through global SIs. Go-to-market alliances, with strategic partners like Microsoft, Cisco, Dell and HP and product innovations in XenDesktop 5 and XenApp 6 that dramatically simplify large-scale enterprisewide deployments. This is how we're driving Desktop Virtualization into the mainstream. 
Worldwide, we now have 50 customers with more than 10,000 licenses of XenDesktop with several in excess of 100,000. The business drivers to go virtual at the desktop are broad, impacting customers of all sizes, industries and geos. So wins from the quarter tells a story. For example, a U.S.-based healthcare provider rolled out 5,000 seats of XenDesktop to consolidate facilities and to securely deliver sensitive medical information to affiliate clinics efficiently, over the wide area network. Our FlexCast technology allows them to support the full variety of use cases from doctors and nurses to office workers, using a wide variety of PCs, laptops, thin clients and tablets.
In Europe, a top-tier retail bank expanded their large scale XenApp Trade-up from last year by adding new licenses of XenDesktop platinum to accelerate the merger integration of an acquired bank. And as one of the world's largest HR service firms chose a mix of XenDesktop and XenApp to centralize, simplify and lower overall IT costs by moving more than 1,000 apps and 5,000 users to our Desktop Virtualization platform.
A Fortune 100 CIO who standardized on XenDesktop said it best in a recent e-mail to me, and I quote, ""the benefits of Desktop Virtualization have enabled us to deliver world-class eco-efficiency, workplace optimization, off shoring, business recovery, and secure vendor access."" As we begin our companywide transition to Windows 7 in 2011, we anticipate Desktop Virtualization will be the default approach across all businesses and use cases.
We're winning the market with XenDesktop by offering the only product that enables user access to apps or desktops for many PC, Mac, tablet or smartphone; delivers a high-fidelity user experience; allows self-service for desktops, as well as Windows web and SaaS apps; centralizes configuration, policy and remote support; and goes beyond VDI to integrate the delivery models needed for every user.
We're delivering on our game plan to mainstream this market. The move to Desktop Virtualization and cloud computing is also driving our Networking business. NetScaler growth in Q1 was impressive, fueled by new high-end MPX hardware that delivers the best price performance in the industry and our software-based VPX virtual appliances that deliver the best flexibility in the market. Innovative business models like Pay-as-You-Grow and first pack licensing are clearly positioning NetScaler as an end-to-end solution, ideally suited for the cloud era. Demand in Q1 came from a broad range of enterprise customers and service providers. We are the world's largest acute care and hospital operators, deploying NetScaler VPX virtual appliances to transition their paper-based patient record system to a private cloud-based electronic record solution. A large U.S. retail chain purchased NetScaler MPX to scale up their rapidly growing online e-commerce business; and a leading service provider standardized on NetScaler MPX as the front door of their cloud. And they're also offering NetScaler VPX as a cloud service for enterprise customers.
The cloud era is driving a fundamental transformation of networks. We think as profound as virtualization on servers and desktops. In this new era, fast connections are assumed and strategic focus turns to service delivery. This emerging service delivery network will be optimized for content, context and consumerization. We're computing services like apps, desktops, data and rich media are accessed as on-demand services from a wide variety of devices. This is the vision behind our new NetScaler SDX platform, a ground-breaking virtualized networking appliance that consolidates security, scalability, multi-tenancy and performance functions without compromise. It's the perfect front door for enterprise data centers and for on-demand cloud providers. NetScaler SDX uses our Xen virtualization technology to run multiple, virtual NetScaler instances on a single hardware appliance, each optimized for different apps, services, sites and customers. Each virtual instance delivers the exact mix of acceleration, security and scalability needed to serve a wide variety of enterprise work loads, from a single networking platform designed for private and external clouds.
NetScaler SDX incorporates Intel's advanced multi-core and SR-IOV technologies, allowing it to deliver secure, multitenant, multiservice functionality at native wire speeds. It's a fundamental breakthrough in this market, allowing customers to move to a more robust service delivery requirements of private and utility clouds. We're innovating, growing and setting the pace. Watch this space for more.
The new way to work in the cloud era is virtual, with the ability to share content, screens and ideas with anyone across devices, geographies and corporate boundaries. It's a more productive, more eco-friendly and more flexible way to get things done. Citrix is leading here as one of the top SaaS providers of web collaboration in the world, with GoToMeeting, Training and Webinar. 
In Europe, we began to get some early market traction after closing the Netviewer deal. The integration is going smoothly and the 200 strong team already has a good number of wins under their belt. This acquisition will boost the growth of our international SaaS business, with a much larger go-to-market footprint in Europe for our collaboration and support products.
In Q1, we were also very pleased when Skype chose Citrix to add web collaboration to their ubiquitous communications platform. This partnership will allow Skype to offer business customers a stunning web and audio conferencing experience, enabled by integration with GoToMeeting technology.
Personal cloud services like GoToMeeting and Skype are powerful examples of IT consumerization. It's been just one year since the iPad changed everything. And for the first time, enterprise IT is embracing a wide range of smartphones, tablets and cloud-powered laptops as part of delighting the user, creating new business possibilities and shifting costs away from IT budgets. This is driving huge uptake of our GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and Citrix Receiver apps for Apple, Android and Windows, allowing IT to support these devices with business-endorsed collaboration, remote access, hosted apps and virtual desktops with a consumer-like user experience. These Citrix apps have continually been at the top of the app store charts and are now being embedded in devices like the Motorola ATRIX 4G. As new devices begin to shift based on Android Honeycomb, ProMOS, Windows Phone and webOS, our apps will be there. In fact, HP recently demoed Citrix Receiver for webOS on their beautiful new touchpad tablet, showing how it can securely access many thousands of corporate apps from line of business, to analytics, to big data visualization directly from Receiver's self-service enterprise app store.
Citrix continues to be the one company that can securely deliver IT as an on-demand service to any device anywhere. 
In the last month, I've spent significant personal time with many CIOs from medium to the largest enterprises. They are moving from interested to really engaged in transformation, suggesting that all of this transformation could be more rapid than any of us first imagined. Their desire to embrace consumerization at the desktop and in the cloud is striking. We're giving them the power to say yes to consumer devices, yes to SaaS apps and yes to cloud infrastructure, and all that's clearly resonating with them.
Computing, as we know it, is facing a multitude of disruptive forces, creating unprecedented stress on today's industry leaders, forcing IT into transformation mode and providing massive opportunity for agile players like Citrix. Our strategy is to show customers how to navigate the convergence of legacy and cloud services while delivering consumer-like experiences and greater business productivity through innovation, thought leadership and industry partnerships, Citrix is providing a bridge to the cloud era.
Before we get to the Q&A, I'd like to personally invite you to our upcoming industry conference, Synergy 2011, where virtual computing will take center stage at San Francisco's Moscone Center from May 25 to 27. We'll be introducing the future there with exciting announcements, breakthrough technologies, demonstrations and new partnerships, along with a few surprises. You can register at citrixsynergy.com. It's definitely going to be another sellout and we really hope you'll join us. And now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

And the one really interesting statistic from Q1 is that about 30%, 35% of the customers that participated in the Trade-up program actually came through the Plus. So that means that a third of the existing customers taking advantage of Trade-up are using that as an opportunity to expand further and buy more XenDesktop licenses. So I expect that it will be probably in the single digits in terms of the percent of customers trading up in any given quarter now that it's just part of the ongoing rhythm."

Let me think about -- let me take the second part of that question first. Last year, when we were really focused on Trade-up, especially in Q2 when there was a lot of promotional activity, we had tremendous customer demand and customer bookings and that drove a growth in deferred revenue, which I believe was up just over $50 million last year. So I expect Q2 deferred revenue to be strong, strongly positive and higher than the growth we saw in Q1. Most of that booking was recognized over a radical period of time. And so as the mix between new licenses, which are typically about 15%, 20% deferred and Trade-up, which could be 50% deferred, as that continues to shift, you're going to see more show up in current period revenue through product license and less show up on a protracted base over license updates."

And that's reflecting some of the trends that I'm talking about here. The other thing I'd point out in terms of the individual line items on the P&L is license updates. And that's the line that we recognize most of the deferred revenue through. So that is a lagging indicator to product license bookings. And you've seen how the year-over-year growth rate has decelerated over the last several quarters, really reflecting the economic environment and the low product sales that were occurring in 2009 and really into the beginning of 2010. So looking into Q2, I think you should expect license update revenue to decelerate a little bit, a little bit further on a year-over-year basis, and have Q2 be the bottom for the year and start to accelerate into the back half of the year again."

It's coming from a number of points that we called out earlier. We're seeing good traction at the highest end, selling into big web properties, major service providers. We're seeing continued traction for the cross-sell activities, and we've done the cros-sell networking into our traditional enterprise accounts. We had well over 400 unique customers that were buying both hardware and software products in the quarter, which is -- continues to be up into the right, so that's terrific. And then, the last thing around our virtual appliances, the ones we call VPX, those are now contributing materially. I mean that's up to about 10% of the overall NetScaler mix, and it's pretty important because we're seeing not only customers that are starting with VPX and then following up with an MPX sale. But a lot of customers that are actually looking at both the hardware and the software versions, think of it as kind of an interoperable part of a service delivery fabric, where you can take an MPX appliance, put it at the front door of the data center and then use VPX virtual appliances on different tiers of the stack, your web tier, your app tier, your data tier et cetera, just giving them really unprecedented flexibility and performance across the infrastructure. And so those are great trends that we're starting to see. As far as the overall business going throughout the rest of the year, optimistic about NetScaler, I think we've got some good things coming out. We talked about STX, got some new surprises coming later in the quarter and next quarter. And so, a positive outlook. As far as the rest of Data Center and Cloud, the only thing I'd say is that the Branch Repeater, which is our WAN optimization solution. We've had great success with the federal government in 2010, selling that in big deals in both Q2 and Q3. Since I don't see those immediately in the forecast for this quarter, but a really tough comp coming up for Q2 and Q3. So the blended business for the division will be, call it, low double-digit growth overall. But certainly, the NetScaler piece is growing substantially faster than that."

And it really looks great looking forward, including this quarter. And with Microsoft, the progress there has just been stunning. In fact, we have now over 50 people in the field who are completely dedicated to working on joint wins with Microsoft. So as we track the pipeline, POC [Proof of Concept], et cetera, it's really strong. I think there were almost 70 wins worldwide during Q1 with Microsoft. And then we see great traction in our partnership with Cisco, which really is about 3 quarters old at this point. So we like what we are  seeing there. We've closed quite a few deals already and POCs. And obviously, we're still doing a lot with Dell and HP. In fact, we just launched a solution with Dell, a Desktop Virtualization with Dell, they're hardware and services with Citrix XenDesktop. So I think overall, we get a lot of leverage, but most of these tend to address the higher end, larger deal part of the marketplace."

So a great leading indicator when I look across the Consulting business, and we're going to continue to add to that capacity throughout Q2 and the rest of the year, I'm sure. The other side of that is around tech services. We've had a lot of customers, a lot of customer demand for maintenance agreements on top of the networking products, as well as just software support for everything else. So good business.

But the important dimension of XenServer is its contribution to our growth in the Desktop business and its contribution to what we're doing in the Networking business. As I mentioned, it's now embedded in our SDX platform that's going to give us a tremendous range of competitive advantages in the Networking segment. And then, when it comes to the Desktop, XenServer continues to be the optimal platform to run XenDesktop on because of the technologies that we have embedded on both sides of the API stack. So that doesn't mean customers always choose that. We're seeing it stay underneath XenDesktop and at least a third of the cases, and we see a big uptake in that area in our relation with Microsoft and Hyper-V. And actually fewer customers running XenDesktop on ESX. And then as we are getting more and more focused in the cloud, we're seeing great uptake in cloud providers of XenServer. I think you all probably saw the announcement that we made not too long ago with RackSpace, who moved entirely to XenServer. But we're doing that with other public clouds, and as I think you all know, Xen is actually the hypervisor in about 80% or more of the utility clouds that are out there.

I think Receiver plays an important role than in our strategic message, in how we demonstrate what's possible on XenDesktop and XenApp, to newer customers that we're talking to about a strategic implementation, and how this answers a lot of the consumerization challenges they have around really lighting up these consumer devices without compromising security. So that's the role it plays there, very, very strategic role there and why every device that's coming out going forward here, the newer platforms, as I mentioned, HP's touchpad based on webOS, some of the ProMOS devices, Windows Phone devices, et cetera, Receiver will be there. So that will pay off on our promise for network and device independence. As far as XenClient uptake, the downloads have been, continue to be very solid. We'll talk more about XenClient at Synergy, and we're pleased with what it's doing for the business, giving customers yet one other FlexCast delivery model. It tends to be more important and popular in segments where there's a very high level of concern around security, in combination with mobility. And so most sectors, finance and banking, government sectors and healthcare sectors is doing quite well and a very important part of the XenDesktop story."

And then on the highest end, the price performance benefits that we have with our high end MBX platform , serving up the biggest of the web and cloud properties out there.

First, with the introduction of VPX, really made NetScaler much more consumable and comfortable for our distribution partners, our integration partners, because they tend to be focused on software for the most part historically. So the VPX models have really helped them actually get engaged with the NetScaler brand. But that is leading them to sell not only VPX, but MPX. I think the second piece is we've actually had a very focused initiative around cross selling our networking products, and so our field teams are much better at that. And we've added more capacity in the field around technical selling capacity, around the NetScaler product line. And that's also helped a lot. So there's a degree of sort of push to this as well as the customer pull. And obviously, we're going to keep innovating. We made an announcement and I think an industry first a couple of weeks ago around our new DataStream technology. So it takes everything that we've learned about putting NetScaler in front of the web tier of an app. And it implements that same acceleration, security, performance, et cetera and off loading capability to the data tier. So sitting in front of databases, which will save customers money, makes apps faster and more secure. So we're just getting into that. And so, I think we have a lot of opportunity here with greater capacity in the marketplace in products to market and greater innovation to make them more applicable where we do introduce them to customers."

I look at the units for the last 3 quarters after the Trade-Up program got this aggressive, and then about 2 million units over the last 3 quarters, that's roughly on par with the Q2 last year when you have the Trade-up program.

So honestly, the way we're thinking about this is really simple. This is a Desktop Virtualization business. And so, the unit mix and sort of what customers choose to buy in the end, whether it's XenDesktop that's inclusive of XenApp or just XenApp, where we really are kind of indifferent on that. And we want customers to buy the product that best suits their needs. And so if you look at the unit volumes that way, we continue to see great progress and growth in both dimensions. The goal here is to drive the mainstream. We're still in the early stages, and what it takes is some of the things that we've done that are very much in our control around making the product easier to implement, making it simpler to manage and doing more in the innovation area around storage and getting some of the cost of implementation down, making it easier for customers to understand how to do the transformation through our desktop transformation model. So there are number of things there that we're doing that are in our control. And obviously, we're benefiting from some things that we don't want to control, actually. There are these tailwind forces that are coming from all the consumerization stuff, whether it's devices or personal clouds or what's going on in utility cloud. So, I'd say that it's hard to call an inflection point because it's not likely that there'll be a knee in the curve. In fact, this will be a gradual acceleration through the year around this business overall. And we'll do everything we can that's in our control to accelerate it in the meantime.

One of our partners are the guys over at Drobo, and they make a very efficient, very low cost storage solution that some of our smaller resellers like a lot. And then, I think the third area is we're obviously adding capabilities to XenDesktop that reduce the storage requirements, and doing that in XenDesktop itself as well as inside of XenServer. And so I think sort of it's one part innovation, one part new products that are serving a lower-cost segment and then one part working with the larger storage partners around optimizations that they are naturally doing just to compete in the marketplace."

As you can see from the release, we're starting off the year with good momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $491 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.50 and $159 mill",1185,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. As you can see from the release, we're starting off the year with good momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $491 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.50 and $159 million in cash flow from operations. 
I'm really pleased with our execution in the field and throughout the organization in Q1. We're driving leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in the networking business and expanding our SaaS [Software-as-a-Service] footprint, trends that can be clearly seen in the financials. 
So looking at the first quarter, revenue from new license sales was $150 million, up 22% from last year. License update revenue increased 9%. Tech services increased 44%, led by record consulting demand and support agreements attached to our networking products. And finally, online SaaS revenue was $100 million, up 17%.
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 22% from last year to $217 million. And included in this number is product license growth of about 23% year-on-year and 11 transactions, individual transactions, greater than $1 million.
In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $133 million. And similar to last year, demand across the region was uneven, particularly with the public sector, as many countries are still working through budgetary constraints and capital project prioritization.
And finally, Japan Pacific are both growing significantly, posting combined revenue growth of 25% from last year. So overall, a very solid quarter. As we look into 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline continue at record levels. We remain committed to delivering balanced results while investing to expand our competitive position, innovation and capacity across our 3 main product categories.
So now let's look at the Q1 results within these 3 businesses. First, Desktop solutions grew 13% from last year to nearly $290 million. Included in this was product license revenue of $100 million, which is an increase of 21% over Q1 last year. The license growth was led by strength in XenDesktop, where the product license was up well over 100% from last year to $43 million, and is quickly approaching 1/2 of the total license mix for the desktop solutions group.
For a little more context on the Desktop business in Q1, there's a few metrics that I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value the customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, 8 of the 14 deals that were over $1 million in Q1 included XenDesktop licenses. There were over 2,000 different customers that purchased XenDesktop in the period, including 83 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 17 deals for over 5,000 seats. And we exited Q1 with a record pipeline of $1 million-plus enterprise desktop opportunities.
So next, in our Data Center and Cloud business. Total revenue was $78 million, up 33% in the quarter with new product revenue increasing 27%. The growth in this business was led by NetScaler, with revenue up more than 50% year-on-year. We continue driving a successful initiative to cross sell networking into our enterprise base with several hundred customers purchasing both software and hardware products together in Q1. Regarding the specific platforms, contribution from a high NetScaler MPX appliances was up sharply due to wins within the dot com, Telco and Service Provider segment. 
In the VPX line, our virtual appliances continue to do really well, giving both enterprise and cloud customers a new level of performance and flexibility  within their data centers and clouds. And in total, VPX revenue was up more than 300% compared to Q1 last year, and now accounts for almost 10% of NetScaler license revenue. This is only after 6 quarters in the market.
And finally, touching on our SaaS business. Revenue was up 17% in the first quarter to $100 million, and the growth here continues to be led by the collaboration products, which are up about 30%.
The second half of Q1, we closed the acquisition of NetViewer in Germany, and this is an important part of the strategy to accelerate our SaaS footprint internationally. And due to the timing of the close, the revenue contribution was about $3 million in Q1.
So looking on expenses and operations, in the first quarter, adjusted op margin was 23%, up 74 basis points from last year, and really a result of revenue performance and our continued focus on execution. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind the demand growth we're seeing in the market, so as bookings, pipeline and proof of concepts have accelerated, we continue to focus on 2 main areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech-support; and second, around product innovation, to bring the market new technologies, as well as improving integration across the solutions to drive simplicity and a better end-user experience.
In Q1, we added 350 new people to Citrix, including 200 of which that joined the team through the NetViewer acquisition. Year-on-year, total headcount increased a little over 1,000 people. Also of note, I'd like to point out that included in the other income line in Q1 is foreign exchange remeasurement gains of about $3 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments closed at $1.6 billion, driven by $159 million in cash flow from operations. During the quarter, we invested about $120 million in acquisitions and repurchased nearly 1.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $69 a share.
Today, we also announced that the board has authorized an additional $500 million of repurchase authorization to be used in the future as part of our ongoing program.
And finally, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was a record $789 million, up 24% from last year. The 4 main drivers of this growth have been the increasing size of the base for Subscription Advantage program, the success of the desktop Trade-up initiative; a greater volume of multiyear deals being closed; and tech service contracts for consulting and support. 
So really, in total, a great Q1. We're executing well. We're seeing growth in all our strategic businesses. And we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while expanding our go-to-market capacity.
So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q2 and the full year 2011. Given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth for opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our outlook for 2011. For the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion and adjusted EPS of between $2.38 and $2.41 per share.
And for the second quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million and adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23% and adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55.
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

In all, we're feeling confident about our execution across SaaS, premise and appliance business models and around our strategic objectives in a rapidly changing computing landscape. The industry is clearly moving from the PC era to the cloud era. This transition, driven by consumerization, is changing the way we work and play. It's transforming the desktop, it's transforming networks, and it's transforming the way we collaborate.
The combined forces of cloud and consumerization are clearly driving our Desktop business.

We're meeting this growing demand with increased capacity for top-down customer engagement through global SIs. Go-to-market alliances, with strategic partners like Microsoft, Cisco, Dell and HP and product innovations in XenDesktop 5 and XenApp 6 that dramatically simplify large-scale enterprise-wide deployments. This is how we're driving Desktop Virtualization into the mainstream. 
Worldwide, we now have 50 customers with more than 10,000 licenses of XenDesktop with several in excess of 100,000. The business drivers to go virtual at the desktop are broad, impacting customers of all sizes, industries and geos [ph]. So wins from the quarter tells a story. For example, a U.S.-based healthcare provider rolled out 5,000 seats of XenDesktop to consolidate facilities and to securely deliver sensitive medical information to affiliate clinics efficiently, over the wide area network. Our FlexCast technology allows them to support the full variety of use cases from doctors and nurses to office workers, using a wide variety of PCs, laptops, thin clients and tablets.
In Europe, a top-tier retail bank expanded their large scale XenApp Trade-up from last year by adding new licenses of XenDesktop platinum to accelerate the merger integration of an acquired bank. And as one of the world's largest HR service firms chose a mix of XenDesktop and XenApp to centralize, simplify and lower overall IT costs by moving more than 1,000 apps and 5,000 users to our Desktop Virtualization platform.
A Fortune 100 CIO who standardized on XenDesktop said it best in a recent e-mail to me, and I quote, ""the benefits of Desktop Virtualization have enabled us to deliver world-class eco-efficiency, workplace optimization, off shoring, business recovery, and secure vendor access."" As we begin our companywide transition to Windows 7 in 2011, we anticipate Desktop Virtualization will be the default approach across all businesses and use cases.
We're winning the market with XenDesktop by offering the only product that enables user access to apps or desktops for many PC, Mac, tablet or smartphone; delivers a high-fidelity user experience; allows self-service for desktops, as well as Windows web and SaaS apps; centralizes configuration, policy and remote support; and goes beyond VDI to integrate the delivery models needed for every user.
We're delivering on our game plan to mainstream this market. The move to Desktop Virtualization and cloud computing is also driving our Networking business. NetScaler growth in Q1 was impressive, fueled by new high-end MPX hardware that delivers the best price performance in the industry and our software-based VPX virtual appliances that deliver the best flexibility in the market. Innovative business models like Pay-as-You-Grow and first pack licensing are clearly positioning NetScaler as an end-to-end solution, ideally suited for the cloud era. Demand in Q1 came from a broad range of enterprise customers and service providers. We are the world's largest acute care and hospital operators, deploying NetScaler VPX virtual appliances to transition their paper-based patient record system to a private cloud-based electronic record solution. A large U.S. retail chain purchased NetScaler MPX to scale up their rapidly growing online e-commerce business; and a leading service provider standardized on NetScaler MPX as the front door of their cloud. And they're also offering NetScaler VPX as a cloud service for enterprise customers.
The cloud era is driving a fundamental transformation of networks. We think as profound as virtualization on servers and desktops. In this new era, fast connections are assumed and strategic focus turns to service delivery. This emerging service delivery network will be optimized for content, context and consumerization. We're computing services like apps, desktops, data and rich media are accessed as on-demand services from a wide variety of devices. This is the vision behind our new NetScaler SDX platform, a ground-breaking virtualized networking appliance that consolidates security, scalability, multi-tenancy and performance functions without compromise. It's the perfect front door for enterprise data centers and for on-demand cloud providers. NetScaler SDX uses our Xen virtualization technology to run multiple, virtual NetScaler instances on a single hardware appliance, each optimized for different apps, services, sites and customers. Each virtual instance delivers the exact mix of acceleration, security and scalability needed to serve a wide variety of enterprise work loads, from a single networking platform designed for private and external clouds.
NetScaler SDX incorporates Intel's advanced multi-core and SR-IOV technologies, allowing it to deliver secure, multitenant, multiservice functionality at native wire speeds. It's a fundamental breakthrough in this market, allowing customers to move to a more robust service delivery requirements of private and utility clouds. We're innovating, growing and setting the pace. Watch this space for more.
The new way to work in the cloud era is virtual, with the ability to share content, screens and ideas with anyone across devices, geographies and corporate boundaries. It's a more productive, more eco-friendly and more flexible way to get things done. Citrix is leading here as one of the top SaaS providers of web collaboration in the world, with GoToMeeting, Training and Webinar. 
In Europe, we began to get some early market traction after closing the Netviewer deal. The integration is going smoothly, and the 200 strong team already has a good number of wins under their belt. This acquisition will boost the growth of our international SaaS business, with a much larger go-to-market footprint in Europe for our collaboration and support products.
In Q1, we were also very pleased when Skype chose Citrix to add web collaboration to their ubiquitous communications platform. This partnership will allow Skype to offer business customers a stunning web and audio conferencing experience, enabled by integration with GoToMeeting technology.
Personal cloud services like GoToMeeting and Skype are powerful examples of IT consumerization. It's been just one year since the iPad changed everything. And for the first time, enterprise IT is embracing a wide range of smartphones, tablets and cloud-powered laptops as part of delighting the user, creating new business possibilities and shifting costs away from IT budgets. This is driving huge uptake of our GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and Citrix Receiver apps for Apple, Android and Windows, allowing IT to support these devices with business-endorsed collaboration, remote access, hosted apps and virtual desktops with a consumer-like user experience. These Citrix apps have continually been at the top of the app store charts and are now being embedded in devices like the Motorola ATRIX 4G. As new devices begin to shift based on Android Honeycomb, ProMOS, Windows Phone and webOS, our apps will be there. In fact, HP recently demoed Citrix Receiver for webOS on their beautiful new touchpad tablet, showing how it can securely access many thousands of corporate apps from line of business, to analytics, to big data visualization directly from Receiver's self-service enterprise app store.
Citrix continues to be the one company that can securely deliver IT as an on-demand service to any device anywhere. 
In the last month, I've spent significant personal time with many CIOs from medium to the largest enterprises. They are moving from interested to really engaged in transformation, suggesting that all of this transformation could be more rapid than any of us first imagined. Their desire to embrace consumerization at the desktop and in the cloud is striking. We're giving them the power to say yes to consumer devices, yes to SaaS apps, and yes to cloud infrastructure, and all that's clearly resonating with them.
Computing, as we know it, is facing a multitude of disruptive forces, creating unprecedented stress on today's industry leaders, forcing IT into transformation mode and providing massive opportunity for agile players like Citrix. Our strategy is to show customers how to navigate the convergence of legacy and cloud services while delivering consumer-like experiences and greater business productivity through innovation, thought leadership and industry partnerships, Citrix is providing a bridge to the cloud era.
Before we get to the Q&A, I'd like to personally invite you to our upcoming industry conference, Synergy 2011, where virtual computing will take center stage at San Francisco's Moscone Center from May 25 to 27. We'll be introducing the future there with exciting announcements, breakthrough technologies, demonstrations and new partnerships, along with a few surprises. You can register at citrixsynergy.com. It's definitely going to be another sellout and we really hope you'll join us. And now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

And the one really interesting statistic from Q1 is that about 30%, 35% of the customers that participated in the Trade-up program actually came through the Plus. So that means that a third of the existing customers taking advantage of Trade-up are using that as an opportunity to expand further and buy more XenDesktop licenses. So I expect that it will be probably in the single digits in terms of the percent of customers trading up in any given quarter now that it's just part of the ongoing rhythm."

Let me think about -- let me take the second part of that question first. Last year, when we were really focused on Trade-up, especially in Q2 when there was a lot of promotional activity, we had tremendous customer demand and customer bookings and that drove a growth in deferred revenue, which I believe was up just over $50 million last year. So I expect Q2 deferred revenue to be strong, strongly positive and higher than the growth we saw in Q1. Most of that booking was recognized over a radical period of time. And so as the mix between new licenses, which are typically about 15%, 20% deferred and Trade-up, which could be 50% deferred, and that continues to shift, you're going to see more show up in current period revenue through product license and less show up on a protracted base over license updates."

And that's reflecting some of the trends that I'm talking about here. The other thing I'd point out in terms of the individual line items on the P&L is license updates. And that's the line that we recognize most of the deferred revenue through. So that is a lagging indicator to product license bookings. And you've seen how the year-over-year growth rate has decelerated over the last several quarters, really reflecting the economic environment and the low product sales that were occurring in 2009 and really into the beginning of 2010. So looking into Q2, I think you should expect license update revenue to decelerate a little bit, a little bit further on a year-over-year basis, and have Q2 be the bottom for the year and start to accelerate into the back half of the year again."

It's coming from a number of points that we called out earlier. We're seeing good traction at the highest end, selling into big web properties, major service providers. We're seeing continued traction for the cross-sell activities, and we've done the cross-sell networking into our traditional enterprise accounts. We had well over 400 unique customers that were buying both hardware and software products in the quarter, which is -- continues to be up into the right, so that's terrific. And then, the last thing around our virtual appliances, the ones we call VPX, those are now contributing materially. I mean that's up to about 10% of the overall NetScaler mix, and it's pretty important because we're seeing not only customers that are starting with VPX and then following up with an MPX sale. But a lot of customers that are actually looking at both the hardware and the software versions, think of it as kind of an interoperable part of a service delivery fabric, where you can take an MPX appliance, put it at the front door of the data center and then use VPX virtual appliances on different tiers of the stack, your web tier, your app tier, your data tier et cetera, just giving them really unprecedented flexibility and performance across the infrastructure. And so those are great trends that we're starting to see. As far as the overall business going throughout the rest of the year, optimistic about NetScaler, I think we've got some good things coming out. We talked about STX, got some new surprises coming later in the quarter and next quarter. And so, a positive outlook. As far as the rest of Data Center and Cloud, the only thing I'd say is that the Branch Repeater, which is our WAN optimization solution, we've had great success with the federal government in 2010, selling that in big deals in both Q2 and Q3. I don't see those immediately in the forecast for this quarter, but a really tough comp coming up for Q2 and Q3.

Our top performing SI for the quarter was CSC, but we had tremendous performances from Accenture, Fujitsu, HP and IBM as well. The pipeline achieved sort of a new level, record level. And it really looks great looking forward, including this quarter. And with Microsoft, the progress there has just been stunning. In fact, we have now over 50 people in the field who are completely dedicated to working on joint wins with Microsoft. So as we track the pipeline, POC [Proof of Concept], et cetera, it's really strong. I think there were almost 70 wins worldwide during Q1 with Microsoft. And then we see great traction in our partnership with Cisco, which really is about 3 quarters old at this point. So we like what we are seeing there. We've closed quite a few deals already and POCs. And obviously, we're still doing a lot with Dell and HP. In fact, we just launched a solution with Dell, a Desktop Virtualization with Dell, their hardware and services with Citrix XenDesktop.

But the important dimension of XenServer is its contribution to our growth in the Desktop business and its contribution to what we're doing in the Networking business. As I mentioned, it's now embedded in our SDX platform that's going to give us a tremendous range of competitive advantages in the Networking segment. And then, when it comes to the Desktop, XenServer continues to be the optimal platform to run XenDesktop on because of the technologies that we have embedded on both sides of the API stack. So that doesn't mean customers always choose that. We're seeing it stay underneath XenDesktop and at least a third of the cases, and we see a big uptake in that area in our relation with Microsoft and Hyper-V and actually fewer customers running XenDesktop on ESX. And then as we are getting more and more focused in the cloud, we're seeing great uptake in cloud providers of XenServer. I think you all probably saw the announcement that we made not too long ago with RackSpace, who moved entirely to XenServer. But we're doing that with other public clouds, and as I think you all know, Xen is actually the hypervisor in about 80% or more of the utility clouds that are out there.

That's more of kind of the common case. It's not really our strategy to go out and try and sell an ELA where it's an all you can use and try to effectively jam a lot of licenses on customers. We'd much rather do it as they're rolling things out, being successful and you're really along their timelines. So I'd say, that's more of the rule. I mean there will be exceptions along the way where customers are looking for term-based licenses, which we're starting to see more and more of those, not a material part of the mix yet, but not unusual to see a large customer, especially like in the education vertical looking for a 2, 3, 4 year term-based license. So we'll provide whatever is right for the customer and make sure that we're being flexible. But nothing that I'd point out as a real material shift yet."

So that's one dimension of it. And why we're seeing amazing downloads. In fact, I looked just last night and Receiver is still on the top 10 on the iPad, iPhone, App Store and it was the #1 free business app on the Mac App Store. So that's coming from people who already have the infrastructure, downloading it and using it to connect to something they already have. I think Receiver plays an important role than in our strategic message, in how we demonstrate what's possible on XenDesktop and XenApp, to newer customers that we're talking to about a strategic implementation, and how this answers a lot of the consumerization challenges they have around really lighting up these consumer devices without compromising security. So that's the role it plays there, very, very strategic role there and why every device that's coming out going forward here, the newer platforms, as I mentioned, HP's touchpad based on webOS, some of the ProMOS devices, Windows Phone devices, et cetera, Receiver will be there. So that will pay off on our promise for network and device independence. As far as XenClient uptake, the downloads have been, continue to be very solid. We'll talk more about XenClient at Synergy, and we're pleased with what it's doing for the business, giving customers yet one other FlexCast delivery model. It tends to be more important and popular in segments where there's a very high level of concern around security, in combination with mobility. And so most sectors, finance and banking, government sectors and healthcare sectors is doing quite well and a very important part of the XenDesktop story."

First, with the introduction of VPX, really made NetScaler much more consumable and comfortable for our distribution partners, our integration partners, because they tend to be focused on software for the most part historically. So the VPX models have really helped them actually get engaged with the NetScaler brand. But that is leading them to sell not only VPX, but MPX. I think the second piece is, we've actually had a very focused initiative around cross selling our networking products, and so our field teams are much better at that. And we've added more capacity in the field around technical selling capacity, around the NetScaler product line. And that's also helped a lot. So there's a degree of sort of push to this as well as the customer pull. And obviously, we're going to keep innovating. We made an announcement and I think an industry first a couple of weeks ago around our new DataStream technology. So it takes everything that we've learned about putting NetScaler in front of the web tier of an app. And it implements that same acceleration, security, performance, et cetera and off loading capability to the data tier. So sitting in front of databases, which will save customers money, makes apps faster and more secure. So we're just getting into that. And so, I think we have a lot of opportunity here with greater capacity in the marketplace in products to market and greater innovation to make them more applicable where we do introduce them to customers."

And so, the unit mix and sort of what customers choose to buy in the end, whether it's XenDesktop that's inclusive of XenApp or just XenApp, where we really are kind of indifferent on that. And we want customers to buy the product that best suits their needs. And so if you look at the unit volumes that way, we continue to see great progress and growth in both dimensions. The goal here is to drive the mainstream. We're still in the early stages, and what it takes is some of the things that we've done that are very much in our control around making the product easier to implement, making it simpler to manage and doing more in the innovation area around storage and getting some of the cost of implementation down, making it easier for customers to understand how to do the transformation through our desktop transformation model. So there are number of things there that we're doing that are in our control. And obviously, we're benefiting from some things that we don't want to control, actually. There are these tailwind forces that are coming from all the consumerization stuff, whether it's devices or personal clouds or what's going on in utility cloud. So, I'd say that it's hard to call an inflection point because it's not likely that there'll be a knee in the curve.

So looking at the second quarter, revenue from new license sales was $171 million, up 15% from last year. License update revenue increased 9%. Technical services increased 33%, led by record consulting demand and support agreements. And our SaaS revenue was $106 million, up 19%. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 16% from last year to $235 million. Included in this number are 17 individual transactions greater than $1 million each. In EMEA, revenue was up 9% to $136 million. And similar to Q1, demand was uneven across the region, particularly within the public sector as many countries as still working through budgetary constraints and capital project prioritization. And finally, revenue in Japan at Pacific continues to grow very significantly, posting the combined growth of 31% from last year.
So overall, a really solid quarter. As we start the second half of 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline are record levels. We remained committed to delivering strong results, integrating our recent acquisitions and expanding our competitive position across our main product groupings. 
So now let's look at the Q2 results within these 3 businesses. First, overall, Desktop solutions grew 9% from last year to nearly $305 million, including product license revenue growth of 10%. So for the first half of 2011, license revenue in this business is up 15%. And consistent with my prior comments, we do anticipate accelerating year-over-year growth in the back half, which should lead to 16% to 18% product license increase for the full year.
Our license growth here continues to be led by the strength in XenDesktop. During Q2, sales of XenApp products were flat year-on-year, while XenDesktop license was up more than 20%. And as you recall, in Q2 of last year, we had a really successful desktop trade-up promotion that skewed the year-over-year license comps. So if you look at the individual sales motions, license revenue coming through the Desktop trade up was down about 1/3 from last year, while revenue generated from new XD licenses grew by over 65% in the period.
For a little more context on the desktop solutions business in Q2, there's a few metrics that really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value to customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, there were 10 $101 million plus deals in Q2 for XenDesktop, representing customers from multiple industries including telecommunications, media, government, education and services with a few of these customers actually choosing to engage in the basis of multiyear site license.
In total, there were over 2,800 different customers that purchased XenDesktop in the period, including 163 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 19 deals for over 5,000 seats each. And I think we execute 2 in a record pipeline in total and for those over $4 million.
So next, in our Data Center and Cloud business. Total revenue was over $90 million, up 32% in the quarter with new product revenue increasing 26%. Growth in this business was led by the NetScaler product line with license revenue up 90% year-on-year. And the strength in NetScaler in Q2 is really coming from a number of different areas. First, we continue to see traction driving the cross-sell motion and our traditional enterprise account base. In fact, more than half the NetScaler customers in Q2 were first-time NetScaler buyers. Second, contribution from the VPX line of virtual appliances nearly tripled from a year ago as customers are recognizing the value of the point of virtual and physical appliances together as a complete solution.
Third, the new NetScaler SDX platform, which enables customers to run numerous virtualized NetScaler instances with full multitenant support began shipping in late June and has already generated 10 new customers. 
And finally, we just had a record quarter from Internet-centric businesses and customers building out infrastructure to support large cloud-based services.
And offsetting the very strong growth in NetScaler, licenses for our WAN solution, Branch Repeater, declined by about 2/3 from Q2 a year ago. And as you know, historically, comparisons in our WAN business were occasionally skewed by large individual orders as was the case in Q2 and Q3 of 2010.
So finally, turning to the SaaS business, revenue was up 19% in the second quarter to $106 million. The growth continues to be led by our collaboration products, which were up 31% and now account for over half of our total SaaS revenue. SaaS' further value through collaboration. This quarter, we're releasing in HD phases, the videoconferencing capabilities is fully integrated into GoToMeeting. 
Geographically, the investment we've been making to expand this business internationally has been delivering results. In Q2, revenue from our international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, which is up from less than 10% a year ago.
So looking at expenses and operations now. In Q2, adjusted op margin was 25%, an increase of about 1.5 points over Q1 and a result of our revenue performance. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind demand growth that we're seeing in the market. So as bookings, pipeline and POCs have accelerated, we continue to focus on 2 main areas. The first is expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account management, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech support. The second area is product innovation to bring to market new technologies, as well as improving integration across the solutions to try simplicity and better end-user experience.
In Q2, we added 130 new people to Citrix, primarily in the sales and services and the SaaS business. Headcount now stands at over 6,100 employees, which is an increase of about 1,000 people as compared to the same period last year. And also of note, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased both sequentially and year-on-year. And the primary driver here is product license mix due to very strong NetScaler results, as well as the record demand for our consulting services.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $1.7 billion, driven by $162 million in cash flow from operations. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from ops is over $690 million, an increase of 24% year-on-year over the comparable period. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares of stock. And we also spent about $30 million on M&A and licensing activity. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was a record $830 million, up $41 million sequentially, and up 21% from a year ago. The main driver is around deferred revenue, have been the increasing numbers of customers, XenDesktop customers in the subscription advantage program, the number of customers that have been initiating multiyear agreements and tech services contract for consulting maintenance and support.
So really in summary, we continue to execute well. We're seeing growth in all of our strategic business us. And we're making investments necessary to expand our leadership position in critical markets while expanding go-to-market capacity.
So before I get to guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the financial impact of our recent acquisitions, Kaviza and Cloud.com. Both of these companies bring great technology and future opportunity Citrix but are in early stages of ramping their revenue base. Our plan is to initially focus on development and integration with the majority of go to market activities happening later in the year. Therefore, these acquisitions will result in aggregate EPS dilution of about $0.03 in Q3 and an additional $0.02 in Q4. This dilution is included in our forward-looking guidance.
So given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth in our opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our revenue outlook for 2011. For the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.16 billion to $2.19 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.41 per share. And for the third quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $540 million to $547 million, adjusted tax rate between 22% and 23%, and adjusted EPS between $0.56 and $0.58.
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mike to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"
26524,137369814,147266,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks much, David. I'm really pleased with our Q2 performance and proud of the strategic and financial results we've delivered this year. We have great confidence in our execution and growth in all 3 of our focal markets. Customer enthusiasm for going vi",2044,"Thanks much, David. I'm really pleased with our Q2 performance and proud of the strategic and financial results we've delivered this year. We have great confidence in our execution and growth in all 3 of our focal markets. Customer enthusiasm for going virtual across meetings, desktops and cloud is simply amazing. We saw this firsthand in our Synergy San Francisco Conference, which was completely sold out again. Since conference, I spent significant time with enterprise customers, with SI partners and service providers in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These conversations have consistently focused on 3 key things: The massive impact of consumerization, the transformation of IT to on-demand delivery, and the lower of external cloud services.
We think these are the conversations of the post-PC Era, setting the stage for the Cloud Era where customers are focused on 3 things: Building new clouds, connecting to existing cloud services, and empowering people and business to work in new ways.
So next, I'd like to highlight each of these areas. The transition from the PC Era to the Cloud Era is fueling a massive buildout in cloud infrastructure. This market will feature thousands of providers of all shapes and sizes, offering a vast array of new cloud services, services that range from business, infrastructure and development offerings to consumer, mobile and gaming. It will also feature thousands of enterprise customers seeking to transform their existing data centers from rigid cost centers into more elastic private clouds, designed to deliver desktops and apps as a service. This buildout is driving great demand for our cloud networking products and positioning us well for growth in the new cloud platforms business we acquired with Cloud.com.
Let me first talk cloud networking. Every cloud, public or private, need the next-generation networking system at the core, ensuring scalable performance, reliability and security. This is fueling strong growth in NetScaler, based on our ability to be weave virtualization into the core fabric of cloud networking. This differentiation is paying off in all 3 of our NetScaler platforms, MPX, VPX and the new SDX. NetScaler MPX continues to be the centerpiece of our lineup, a standard for the world's largest.com and web 2.0 and delivering the industry's best price performance ratio for enterprises. Cross-selling with XenDesktop has been a significant driver of MPX growth. 
In addition, we're winning new customers with our powerful DataStream technology that have offloads and balances sequel databases. NetScaler VPX, our virtually cloud networking system is also seeing significant traction. We now have over 1,500 customers in provider on NetScaler VPX software. More than 80% were first-time NetScaler customers. They can VPX a great cross sell and easier to expand our customer base and a potent competitive weapon. In fact, more than 25% of NetScaler customers are now running a mix of MPX and VPX systems, realizing the power of NetScaler as a service delivery fabric.
As David mentioned, SDX is seeing great early adoption, designed as a multitenant backbone for cloud services, SDX is built with embedded with XenServer technology, optimized the network allowing it to run up to 40 virtual NetScaler instances simultaneously at a single client, all while delivering wire speed performance and a stunning 50 gig throughput. This powerful combination of NetScaler MPX, VPX and SDX puts us in great position for the buildout of private and public clouds. And it's an area we will build up additional muscle in the second half of the year.
This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Cloud.com, creators of the market-leading CloudStack platform, enabling simple cost-effective cloud services that are scalable, secure and open by design. This will significantly accelerate the Olympus Project we announced during Synergy, a project based on OpenStack, the popular open-source cloud movement. Cloud.com was a founding member of OpenStack, offering complementary product for cloud orchestration and administration called CloudStack. CloudStack is hypervisor agnostic and designed for building cloud that are simple, automated, elastic, scalable and massively efficient. Cloud.com customers ruled out new cloud services up to 50x faster at 1/5 of the cost of alternative solutions. This has yielded impressive early success, with deployments in over 60 large-scale production clouds, including some of the most innovative brands in the world like Zinga, Go Daddy, Korea Telecom and Nokia.
Overall, the strategy is to offer Citrix service providers a powerful and open system that delivers a range of profitable on-demand services, like powerful infrastructure as a service, like services based on Citrix technologies including XenApp, VPX, Cloud Bridge and Cloud Gateway, like services based on the OpenStack ecosystem and of course, innovation cloud services of our service providers own design. 
In the second half, we'll focus on smooth integration while gaining additional design wins around the world with key service providers. We'll also accelerate the investment both companies have already made in multi-hypervisor support, as well as our mutual commitment to OpenStack. We're really excited to be joining forces with an incredibly talented Cloud.com team that includes some of the world's most experienced cloud computing experts. As analysts are projecting the cloud infrastructure and services market to exceed $11 billion by the end of 2013, expanding our position now provides us with a tremendous opportunity to accelerate our cloud strategy and formally establish Citrix as a leader in this market.
Committing enterprise customers to these external clouds is an opportunity Citrix is uniquely positioned to lead at both higher-level application layers, as well as infrastructure as a service levels. We are addressing these markets with 2 powerful new products. The first is NetScaler Cloud Gateway would, which sits at the front door of the enterprise Data Center, giving IT an easy, unified way to orchestrate the delivery of any mix of SaaS, web and Windows apps to end users. Cloud Gateway unifies silos of public and private cloud apps and provides a single way to manage secure access, user provisioning, license measurement and user experience. And that gives end-users a brilliantly easy way to access all their apps, with a single one-time login number regardless of what device they are using or where all those apps are being hosted.
The other important connection to cloud services is at the infrastructure layer. Our new NetScaler Cloud Bridge sits at the back door of enterprise data centers, creating a secure, fast, transparent network bridge to virtually any cloud like RackSpace, Amazon, Soft Layer and others. In fact, Cloud Bridge gives private clouds infinite reach the public cloud compute, network and storage resources. So things like app testing, the vast recovery, burst over or building new apps. 
As the industry shifts from the PC unit to the Cloud Era, IT is rapidly growing its ability to own and manage all of its own apps, all of its own infrastructure and thousands and thousands of devices. The introduction of Cloud Gateway and Cloud Bridge gives IT organizations an easy way to extend their data centers to a vast array of cloud services that are outside their own domain.
Empowering people through a flexible virtual workstyle is the third dimension of enabling the Cloud Era. It's clear that computing has gone personal again, freeing people to do whatever, whenever, wherever. This mindset of empowerment through mobility, device independence and a work-anywhere experience continues to be the driver of both our Desktop Virtualization and Web Collaboration businesses. It's been said in quarters, since we launched XenDesktop with flex gas technology, giving customers a single solution that delivers any mix of virtual desktops and apps in 1 enterprise class product. It's now available with a choice of licensing models and a smooth trade-up path from XenApp. XenDesktop continues to leave the Desktop Virtualization market, winning an impressive array of reviews, awards and market share assessments. 
Earlier this month, IDC added to this growing list by publishing the first ever report on the Desktop Virtualization space. Report that named Citrix as the only company in the leader category. We are honored, but in a market this early, we still see a lot of space for growth, innovation and expansion. This is why it's driving primary demand remains our strategic focus. But our estimates we're still in the early stages of the Desktop Virtualization market, with tremendous upside still ahead.
From an adoption standpoint, the primary verticals continue to be finance and banking, health and education and healthcare, driven by the demand for better security and control, lower operational costs and higher business agility. Gradually, we're seeing customers focus on a broader set of strategic business initiatives with XenDesktop, making deals better and driving a greater mix across our products. Indiana University, for example, is going virtual for over 100,000 units, faculty and staff, with an on-demand personal cloud service called anywhere, all powered by XenDesktop. They're lowering support costs, supporting a wide variety of consumer devices and enabling better work life balance for everyone.
At the other end of the spectrum, our corporate like SunCorp, one of Australia's largest concerned crops, they are deploying 15,000 as part of a joint Citrix Microsoft solution, driven by a key corporate initiatives to attract, develop and inspire innovation and ingenuity in their workforce by creating a smarter workplace that incorporates hot desk gate, work from home and employee-owned devices.
These and many others represent a tremendous opportunity ahead as Desktop Virtualization continues toward mainstream. We're aggressively driving the evolution of this market with innovations that make going virtual at the desktop easier, more affordable and more accessible to millions of new users and devices. For example, our recent releases of XenDesktop, XenApp and XenClient, we added new capabilities that reduce the storage cost of VDI storage up to 50% with our groundbreaking Intellicast technology, features that extend our reach to more than 1 billion end user devices with new versions of Citrix Receiver, new XenClient technology that support a much broader range of new laptop models and the all-new XenClient XT addition that opens brand-new technology and high-security Desktop computing markets.
Breadth is the other key to driving primary demand, expanding the markets to broadly serve the SMB customer. Our recent acquisition of Kaviza gives us a simple all-in-one VDI solution, perfect for the SMB. Kaviza's VDI-in-a-Box rivals the acquisition cost of a traditional PC, and can be deployed and managed without an enterprise IT department. We think it will really invigorate our SMB-focused partners. For product innovation to market expansion, we're relentlessly focused on extending our lead invest in desktop virtualization as we work to drive broad mainstream adoption. So we're staying on offense, and encourage you to watch this space for some great announcements in the second half.
Empowering users is also about making it easy to collaborate with others. That's what drives our online collaboration business, enabling customers of all sizes to deliver a more virtual workstyle, one that frees people to work from anywhere with anyone on any device. We're taking that experience to a new level this quarter, with the delivery of GoToMeeting with HD faces, extending solution that makes realtime HD videoconferencing to online meetings at no extra charge to GoToMeeting subscribers. HD Faces is brilliantly easy, totally immersive, simply amazing. It delivers telepresence for everyone in any location without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive hardware-based systems. And because it's a built-in feature of GoToMeeting, customers get a fully integrated web, audio and video experience, all with the same market-leading ease of use that's always been a hallmark of our SaaS product. 
Looking forward, we'll continue to expand into new markets like IT services with our new go-to-manage product line, into new geographies in Europe and Asia and to more mobile platforms, building on our top 10 ranking on the iPad with support for an array of exciting new devices.
So now, to wrap up. Our long focus on products that power virtual workstyles and cloud services has put us in the center of exciting growth markets. For the opportunity to lead customers as they build clouds, connect to cloud services and empower people. Computing, as we've known it, is facing seriously disruptive forces, creating unprecedented stress on today's industry leaders, forcing IT into transformation mode and providing massive opportunity for agile players like Citrix.
So now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

And remember, it is fairly hard to forecast exactly the mix that's going to come out because we're showing the customers and what makes most sense for the projects that they're looking to deploy. But, order of magnitude, I do think XenApp roughly flat year-over-year is the way to think about it. And then the majority of the growth continuing to come from new licenses of XenDesktop. So we've made trade up a part of the ongoing motion, just giving customers a path to migrate from XenApp to XenDesktop as they looked a much more broad holistic solution around desktops and apps. And then, new licenses is we're either selling into new parts of existing customers or more likely just brand-new customers. So that business is were I a think the majority of the growth is going to come from. And what gives us confidence in the growth rates that I talked about here is it's really a function of just the overall opportunity pipeline we're seeing. We're exiting Q2 with record levels across aggregate pipeline and in large deals that I mentioned earlier. We're seeing very high pipeline coverage ratios. We're seeing increasing activity metrics from our SIs and other partners. And in some of the other metrics that we occasionally quote around that business be it reorder rates or time to reorder, they are all very positive. And the last comment I made is really around the utilization receiver consulting. It's been 7 quarters in a row now that we've talked about record consulting utilization. And that continues to be the case. It outstrips our capacity by far. And that's really customers who are going through everything from proof of concepts up to scaling large deployments. And how successful we are making them successful drives long-term business. So these are all generally moving in the right direction. We feel good that our standing guidance of 16% to 18% growth for this total desktop and app that business is the right place right. We feel very good about that."

In other cases, we're just having more access to opportunities inside those accounts, and that allows us to just ramp the base. From a competitive standpoint, we continue to do very well competitively. You should assume that most of the large deals are competitive bake offs with one or another.

So we've got a couple of pennies per quarter of dilution coming from the acquisitions. The early focus is around integration, development, et cetera with a real go-to-market push coming late in the year. And so, that's basically it. We also have some one-time transaction costs in Q3 related to those. And that adds another 1 to 2 pennies. So that's the primary Delta."

I think it's really more of a function of we're selling the right solution for what the customers projects are and what they're trying to drive. And there are certain dynamics that are going on that I think will raise the visibility and interest around that virtualization. One of those has been the tablet phenomenon. A lot of people are using XenApp to deliver applications to iPads, et cetera. The others are just expanding the delivery of applications in a different context. So a lot of uses for the product, it's a great product, it's huge customer base. So I do think that about this level is stable at this point in time, from a year-over-year growth rate perspective. In terms of the dynamics with XenDesktop, I mean in many cases, there is largely different sale. Customers are looking at Desktop transformation a way to transform, I'd say the whole IT delivery into more of a service. And that's where XenDesktop plays much more directly. The larger deals will tend to be XenDesktop, it's a more strategic product. It's more infrastructure focused. And I think that, that's going to become even more pronounced as we move through the next several quarters."

We've talked of them a lot over the year to be by the footprint and the result is, the international component of the mix is now north of 15% where it was the south of 10% a year ago. So that's really been the big push geographically. On a product-by-product basis, the collaboration products, which is the probably general bucket that we put, GoToMeeting family and webinar, et cetera, those have been, and continue to be the growth engine moving north of 30%. A couple of standouts that while small numbers are providing the nice incremental growth has been around GoToTraining, which is a product that we initiated last year, and has been growing nicely, as well as our audio services, which have been a nice incremental growth engine as well. So one of the things that both Mark and I talked about in our prepared comments around HD Faces going live here in the short-term is just continuing to add value and differentiate the products in the marketplace. And one of the things that we believe will allow us to not only attract and retain new customers but also maintain the price points at the right level.

It's up north of $40 million, about 3/4 of that coming from the Desktop business, the rest split between online and tech services contract. The second half of the year,  it generally moves up even further. So with deferred revenue being up about, let's say about 21% year-on-year, I'd expect at least that rate as we move into the back half of the year. One thing I'd add to that is if you look at the components of deferred revenue, you're seeing the long-term grow faster than the short term. And I think long-term deferred was up, just about 30% on a year-over-year basis. And what's going on there is really a reflection of customers looking at multiyear commitments. And so, we've got more and more customers coming for a term based or a site license type of an engagement with the Citrix. And so, that revenue gets deferred and recognized over a period of time instead of upfront like a traditional license sale.

And at the consumer end, we don't really play there either. So we'll stay focused on SMB, focused on ease-of-use, focused on the value proposition that has gotten us here, and do more integration across our own platform and with third parties as we go into the future.

Obviously, we're seeing a full range of those cycles based upon whether a deal in XenApp is sort of incremental at the project level and transaction level, which tend to be very short and/or XenDesktop at the strategic level, which can take 90 to 270 days, just depending upon how big and how strategic a transaction like that is with a big gating factor along the way, being the design architecture of the system itself, migrating applications and that process. So we see a full range of cycles but no material change from last quarter."

In terms of the dynamics, the split between the products, we're running just about half and half right now between XenApp and XenDesktop. And the reason why we haven't guided to an individual components is like we've said, every single quarter is we're really focused on selling to customers what makes more sense for what they're trying to do, what they're trying to accomplish and the type of deployment. That said, we certainly have put more focus in the last year or so, selling the broader desktop solution, which includes desktops and apps. And it tends to growth rate of that being significantly larger. But in terms of the way we want to forecast the business going forward, it really does need to be combined with the desktop solutions. And so, there will be quarters, I think, were one gross oil faster than the other but the way to really think about it is on a combined basis. And reiterating our 16% to 18% full year is right in line with what we're seeing. Hopefully, that proves to be conservative at the end of the day. But right now, that's our guidance. That's really the way we're thinking about it. In terms of the individual, some of the activity metrics and just remind everybody that these are pure activity metrics, and should, don't take them with a high level of position. But from a reorder rate, it's been a reorder timeline, it's been pretty consistent. Last quarter was 8 months. So about 8 months after the initial order, customers are coming back for a follow-on. Natural size of the reorder moved up a little bit from last quarter. It's more than 9x. So it's a positive indicator. But again, these are more directional than specific. And in terms of actual seats in production, I'm not sure we have any way to measure that with a high level of specificity. I will say that the renewal rates for XenDesktop continue to be extremely high. And that's one of our best indicators that we have in terms of what has actually being deployed and used. Did I answer your question, Ross?"

I mentioned a bit earlier in terms of the individual drivers. But from the enterprise side, it's breadth of accounts of where we are just being successful in terms of our cost tell motion. It's been a priority of the business over the course of the year. And so, we're getting more and more customers that are buying NetScaler either in conjunction with a virtual app, virtual Desktop deployment or just raised visibility that we have into other opportunities for more traditional load-balancing, for example, or app security. So that's kind of one motion that's working well. The other is around our virtual appliances. We've made a big push around the last year around VPX and created virtual instances of many of our technologies and they've been very successful. I mentioned in my comments that they're up about 3x from a year ago which grants a small number but now contributing more and more material component all the time. And the benefit there is that customers are not only deploy the physical hardware. But they're deploying virtual appliances now in more of the, we call the service delivery fabric. But we think about the conjunction with a physical appliance anything to virtual appliance and deployed like an application to your web tier, it just gives you a tremendous flexibility from an overall solution architecture. And so, that's been a driver. And then the third is around just the broader capacity in technology that we've delivered to our higher end appliances that are doing extremely well in the traditional Internet-centric cloud service provider or maybe you could call, it enterprise accounts that are building out data centers to deliver cloud services. So all of those things are very -- we're just very, very strong in Q2. As we look at the second half of the year, we do guide at a total division level. So there's a few moving parts that I talked about earlier, we continue to think that the NetScaler as a standalone will be the majority component of that division. On a year-on-year basis, probably in Q3, it will be down year-on-year from a division because we have a huge Q3 a year ago. So in the mid to high teens from a division. And in Q4, it will be back north of 20% year-on-year growth again. So that's the long answer but the way kind of a little more context on the NetScaler side."

I mean, our WAN business is largely related to solutions sale, as customers are rolling out and optimizing the other related technologies for virtual apps, virtual desktops, et cetera. However, we also have large deals that occasionally come in from the government, for example, as was the case in Q2 and Q3 last year. We have a very big pop around department of defense that was doing a specific project. So those things are in the pipeline. They come from time from to time. They're very difficult to forecast exactly when they hit. Don't anticipate any, we didn't anticipate any in Q2 and don't anticipate any in Q2. So that's the context around my commentary on the Branch Repeater business. In terms of the cross-sell motion, it was one of the 5 key focus for our field organization this year, and that was -- it includes everything from just awareness, making sure customers are aware of the capabilities we can deliver in the networking area. It's about demonstrating the benefits that are derived by some of our technology integrations to be able to optimize traffic around the virtual app or virtual desktop deployment. And then, putting in place programs to really package these in a way that customers can acquire them easily. And so, that's been a key play, as we call it in the sales and services organization. And so, I mentioned just anecdotally that in some geos, there's even a couple of countries in EMEA that I visited get more than half of their NetScaler business through cross-sell activities, versus trying to sell into Internet accounts, et cetera. So that's what's going on there. And I think it will continue, and one of the gating factors in our networking business is capacity. We spent a lot of time and effort looking for the right people, both internally and our capacity to train channel partners and make sure that they are proficient and capable to sell our networking products. So a lot of work to do still on that front, but we're pretty excited with the results so we throughout this year."

So I'd say it has been gradual taken a bit of an inflection point a couple years ago when XenDesktop began to hit the market has and continues to go that same direction. The acquisition of Cloud.com will continue that trajectory because the kind of sales passes and direct engagement even after the sale, whether it's on architecture or implementation support, is much more profound than let say than either event XenDesktop at this stage of customer and market maturity.

In Q2, we delivered a record $531 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.57 and $162 million in cash flow from operations. We're continuing to drive leadership across Desktop Virt",1453,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. In Q2, we delivered a record $531 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.57 and $162 million in cash flow from operations. 
We're continuing to drive leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in cloud networking and expanding the capabilities and footprint in our SaaS business, trends that can be clearly seen in our business results. 
So looking at the second quarter, revenue from new license sales was $171 million, up 15% from last year. License update revenue increased 9%. Technical services increased 33%, led by record consulting demand and support agreements. And our SaaS revenue was $106 million, up 19%. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 16% from last year to $235 million. Included in this number are 17 individual transactions greater than $1 million each.  In EMEA, revenue was up 9% to $136 million. And similar to Q1, demand was uneven across the region, particularly within the public sector as many countries as still working through budgetary constraints and capital project prioritization.  And finally, revenue in Japan and Pacific continues to grow very significantly, posting the combined growth of 31% from last year.
So overall, a really solid quarter. As we start the second half of 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline are record levels. We remained committed to delivering strong results, integrating our recent acquisitions and expanding our competitive position across our main product groupings. 
So, now let's look at the Q2 results within these 3 businesses. First, overall, Desktop solutions grew 9% from last year to nearly $305 million, including product license revenue growth of 10%. So for the first half of 2011, license revenue in this business is up 15%. And consistent with my prior comments, we do anticipate accelerating year-over-year growth in the back half, which should lead to 16% to 18% product license increase for the full year.
Our license growth here continues to be led by the strength in XenDesktop. During Q2, sales of XenApp products were flat year-on-year, while XenDesktop license was up more than 20%. And as you recall, in Q2 of last year, we had a really successful desktop Trade-up promotion that skewed the year-over-year license comps. So if you look at the individual sales motions, license revenue coming through the desktop Trade-up was down about 1/3 from last year, while revenue generated from new XD licenses grew by over 65% in the period.
For a little more context on the Desktop solutions business in Q2, there's a few metrics that really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, there were 10 $1 million plus deals in Q2 for XenDesktop, representing customers from multiple industries, including telecommunications, media, government, education and services with a few of these customers actually choosing to engage on the basis of a multiyear site license.
In total, there were over 2,800 different customers that purchased XenDesktop in the period, including 163 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 19 deals for over 5,000 seats each. And we exit in Q2 with a record pipeline in total and for those deals over $1 million.
So next, in our Data Center and Cloud business. Total revenue was over $90 million, up 32% in the quarter with new product revenue increasing 26%. Growth in this business was led by the NetScaler product line with license revenue up 90% year-on-year. 
And the strength in NetScaler in Q2 is really coming from a number of different areas. First, we continue to see traction driving the cross-sell motion into our traditional enterprise account base. In fact, more than half of NetScaler customers in Q2 were first-time NetScaler buyers. Second, contribution from the VPX line of virtual appliances nearly tripled from a year ago as customers are recognizing the value of deploying the virtual and physical appliances together as a complete solution.  Third, the new NetScaler SDX platform, which enables customers to run numerous virtualized NetScaler instances with full multitenant support began shipping in late June, and has already generated 10 new customers.  And finally, we just had a record quarter from Internet-centric businesses and customers building out the infrastructure to support large cloud-based services.
And offsetting the very strong growth in NetScaler, licenses for our WAN op solution, Branch Repeater, declined by about 2/3 from Q2 a year ago. And as you know, historically, comparisons in our WAN op business were occasionally skewed by large individual orders as was the case in Q2 and Q3 of 2010.
So finally, turning to the SaaS business, revenue was up 19% in the second quarter to $106 million. The growth continues to be led by our collaboration products, which were up 31% and now account for over half of our total SaaS revenue. SaaS will further value through collaborations. This quarter, we're releasing in HDFaces, the videoconferencing capabilities is fully integrated into GoToMeeting. 
Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand this business internationally have been delivering results. In Q2, revenue from our international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, which is up from less than 10% a year ago.
So looking at expenses and operations now. In Q2, adjusted op margin was 25%, an increase of about 1.5 points over Q1 and a result of our revenue performance. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind demand growth that we're seeing in the market. So as bookings, pipeline and POCs have accelerated, we continue to focus on 2 main areas. 
The first is expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech support. The second area is product innovation to bring to market new technologies, as well as improving integration across the solutions to drive simplicity and better end-user experience.
In Q2, we added 130 new people to Citrix, primarily in the sales and the services in the SaaS business. Headcount now stands at over 6,100 employees, which is an increase of about 1,000 people as compared to the same period of last year. And also of note, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased both sequentially and year-on-year. And the primary driver here is product license mix due to the very strong NetScaler results, as well as the record demand for consulting services.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $1.7 billion, driven by $162 million in cash flow from operations. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from ops is over $690 million, an increase of 24% year-on-year over the comparable period. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares of stock. And we also spent about $30 million on M&A and licensing activity. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was a record $830 million, up $41 million sequentially, and up 21% from a year ago. The main drivers around deferred revenue have been the increasing number of customers, XenDesktop customers in the subscription advantage program, the number of customers that have been initiating multiyear agreements and tech services contracts for consulting, maintenance and support.
So really in summary, we continue to execute well. We're seeing growth in all of our strategic businesses. And we're making investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while expanding go-to-market capacity.
So before I get to guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the financial impact of our recent acquisitions, Kaviza and Cloud.com. Both of these companies bring great technology and future opportunity to Citrix but are in their early stages of ramping their revenue base. Our plan is to initially focus on development and integration with the majority of go-to-market activities happening later in the year. Therefore, these acquisitions will result in aggregate EPS dilution of about $0.03 in Q3 and an additional $0.02 in Q4. This dilution is included in our forward-looking guidance.
So given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth in our opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our revenue outlook for 2011. For the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.16 billion to $2.19 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.41 per share. And for the third quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $540 million to $547 million; adjusted tax rate, between 22% and 23%; and adjusted EPS between $0.56 and $0.58.
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"

I'm really pleased with our Q2 performance and proud of the strategic and financial results we've delivered this year.

I'm really pleased with our Q2 performance and proud of the strategic and financial results we've delivered this year. We have great confidence in our execution and growth in all 3 of our focal markets. Customer enthusiasm for going virtual across meetings, desktops and clouds is simply amazing. 
We saw this firsthand in our Synergy San Francisco conference, which was completely sold out again. Since the conference, I spent significant time with enterprise customers, with SI partners and service providers in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These conversations have consistently focused on 3 key things: the massive impact of consumerization, the transformation of IT to on-demand delivery, and the allure of external cloud services.
We think these are the conversations of the post-PC era, setting the stage for the cloud era, where customers are focused on 3 things: building new clouds, connecting to existing cloud services and empowering people and business to work in new ways.
So next, I'd like to highlight each of these areas. The transition from the PC era to the cloud era is fueling a massive buildout in cloud infrastructure. This market will feature thousands of providers of all shapes and sizes, offering a vast array of new cloud services, services that range from business, infrastructure and development offerings to consumer, mobile and gaming. It will also feature thousands of enterprise customers seeking to transform their existing data centers from rigid cost centers into more elastic private clouds, designed to deliver desktops and apps as a service. This buildout is driving great demand for our cloud networking products and positioning us well for growth in the new cloud platforms business we acquired with Cloud.com.
Let's talk first about cloud networking. Every cloud, public or private, need the next-generation networking system at the core, ensuring scalable performance, reliability and security. This is fueling strong growth in NetScaler, based on our ability to be weave virtualization into the core fabric of cloud networking. This differentiation is paying off in all 3 of our NetScaler platforms, MPX, VPX and the new SDX. 
NetScaler MPX continues to be the centerpiece of our lineup, a standard for the world's largest .coms and web 2.0 providers and delivering the industry's best price performance ratio for enterprises. Cross-selling with XenDesktop has been a significant driver of MPX growth.  In addition, we're winning new customers with our powerful DataStream technology that offloads and balances sequel databases. 
NetScaler VPX, our fully virtualized cloud networking system is also seeing significant traction. We now have over 1,500 customers in production on NetScaler VPX software appliances. More than 80% were first-time NetScaler customers, making VPX a great cross-sale, an easier way to expand our customer base and a potent competitive weapon. In fact, more than 25% of NetScaler customers are now running a mix of MPX and VPX systems, realizing the power of NetScaler as a service delivery fabric.
As David mentioned, SDX is seeing great early adoption, designed as a multitenant backbone for cloud services, SDX is built with embedded XenServer technology, optimized for network IO, allowing it to run up to 40 virtual NetScaler instances simultaneously in the same appliance, all while delivering wire-speed performance and a stunning 50-gig throughput. This powerful combination of NetScaler MPX, VPX and SDX puts us in great position for the buildout of public and private clouds. And it's an area where we'll build out additional muscle in the second half of the year.
This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Cloud.com, creators of the market-leading CloudStack platform, enabling simple cost-effective cloud services that are scalable, secure and open by design. This will significantly accelerate the Olympus project we announced during Synergy, a project based on OpenStack, the popular open-source cloud movement. 
Cloud.com was a founding member of OpenStack, offering a complementary product for cloud orchestration and administration called CloudStack. CloudStack is hypervisor agnostic and designed for building cloud that are simple, automated, elastic, scalable and massively efficient. 
Cloud.com customers roll out new cloud services up to 50x faster at 1/5 of the cost of alternative solutions. This has yielded impressive early success, with deployments in over 60 large-scale production clouds, including some of the most innovative brands in the world like Zynga, Go Daddy, Tata, Korea Telecom and Nokia.
Overall, the strategy is to offer Citrix's service providers a powerful and open system that delivers a range of profitable on-demand services, like powerful infrastructure as a service, like services based on Citrix technologies including XenApp, VPX, Cloud Bridge and Cloud Gateway, like services based on the OpenStack ecosystem and of course, innovative cloud services of our service providers own design. 
In the second half, we'll focus on smooth integration while gaining additional design wins around the world with key service providers. We'll also accelerate the investment both companies have already made in multi-hypervisor support, as well as our mutual commitment to OpenStack. We're really excited to be joining forces with an incredibly talented Cloud.com team that includes some of the world's most experienced cloud-computing experts. 
As analysts are projecting the cloud infrastructure and services market to exceed $11 billion by the end of 2013, expanding our position now provides us with a tremendous opportunity to accelerate our cloud strategy and formally establish Citrix as a leader in this market.
Committing enterprise customers to these external clouds is an opportunity Citrix is uniquely positioned to lead at both higher-level application layers, as well as infrastructure as a service levels. We are addressing this market with 2 powerful new products. The first is NetScaler Cloud Gateway, which sits at the front door of the enterprise data center, giving IT an easy, unified way to orchestrate the delivery of any mix of SaaS, web and Windows' apps to end users. 
Cloud Gateway unifies silos of private and public cloud apps and provides a single way to manage secure access, user provisioning, license measurement and user experience. And that gives end users a brilliantly easy way to access all their apps, with a single one-time login regardless of what device they are using or where all those apps are being hosted.
The other important connection to cloud services is at the infrastructure layer. Our new NetScaler Cloud Bridge sits at the back door of enterprise data centers, creating a secure, fast, transparent network bridge to virtually any cloud like RackSpace, Amazon, SoftLayer and others. In fact, Cloud Bridge gives private clouds infinite reach to public cloud compute, network and storage resources, things like app testing, vaster recovery, burst over or building new apps. 
As the industry shifts from the PC era to the cloud era, IT is rapidly outgrowing its ability to own and manage all of its own apps, all of its own infrastructure and thousands and thousands of devices. The introduction of Cloud Gateway and Cloud Bridge give IT organizations an easy way to extend their data centers to a vast array of cloud services that are outside their own domain.
Empowering people through a flexible virtual workstyle is the third dimension of enabling the cloud era. It's clear that computing has gone personal again, freeing people to do whatever, whenever, wherever. This mindset of empowerment through mobility, device independence and a work-anywhere experience continues to be the driver of both our Desktop Virtualization and web collaboration businesses. 
It's been said in quarters, since we launched XenDesktop with FlexCast technology, giving customers a single solution that delivers any mix of virtual desktops and apps in one enterprise class product. It's now available with a choice of licensing models and a smooth trade-up path from XenApp. XenDesktop continues to lead the Desktop Virtualization market, winning an impressive array of reviews, awards and market share assessments. 
Earlier this month, IDC added to this growing list by publishing the first-ever report on the desktop virtualization space, report that named Citrix as the only company in the leader category. We are honored, but in a market this early, we still see a lot of space for growth, innovation and expansion. This is why driving primary demand remains our strategic focus. By our estimates, we're still in the early stages of the desktop virtualization market, with tremendous upside still ahead.
From an adoption standpoint, the primary verticals continue to be finance and banking, gov and education and healthcare, driven by the demand for better security and control, lower operational costs and higher business agility. Gradually, we're seeing customers focus on a broader set of strategic business initiatives with XenDesktop, making deals bigger and driving a greater mix across our products. 
Indiana University, for example, is going virtual for over 100,000 students, faculty and staff, with an on-demand personal cloud service called IU anywhere, all powered by XenDesktop. They're lowering support costs, supporting a wide variety of consumer devices and enabling better work life balance for everyone.
At the other end of the spectrum, our corporate customers Suncorp, one of Australia's largest insurance firms, they are deploying 15,000 seats as part of a joint Citrix Microsoft solution, driven by a key corporate initiative to attract, develop and inspire innovation and ingenuity in their workforce by creating a smarter workplace that incorporates hot desking, work from home and employee-owned devices.  These and many others represent a tremendous opportunity ahead as Desktop Virtualization continues toward mainstream. 
We are aggressively driving the evolution of this market with innovations that make going virtual at the desktop easier, more affordable and more accessible to millions of new users and devices. For example, in our latest releases of XenDesktop, XenApp and XenClient, we added new capabilities that reduce the cost of VDI storage up to 50% with our groundbreaking Intellicast technology, features that extend our reach to more than 1 billion end-user devices with new versions of Citrix Receiver, new XenClient technology that support a much broader range of new laptop models and the all-new XenClient XT edition that opens brand-new opportunity and new high-security desktop computing markets.
Breadth is the other key to driving primary demand, expanding the market to broadly serve the SMB customer. Our recent acquisition of Kaviza gives us a simple all-in-one VDI solution, perfect for the SMB. Kaviza's VDI-in-a-box rivals the acquisition cost of a traditional PC, and can be deployed and managed without an enterprise IT department. We think it will really invigorate our SMB-focused partners. 
For product innovation to market expansion, we're relentlessly focused on extending our lead in desktop virtualization as we work to drive broad mainstream adoption. So we're staying on offense, and encourage you to watch this space for some great announcements in the second half.
Empowering users is also about making it easy to collaborate with others. That's what drives our online collaboration business, enabling customers of all sizes to deliver a more virtual work style, one that frees people to work from anywhere with anyone on any device. We're taking that experience to a new level this quarter, with the delivery of GoToMeeting with HDFaces, a stunning solution that brings realtime HD videoconferencing to online meetings at no extra charge to GoToMeeting subscribers. 
HDFaces is brilliantly easy, totally immersive, simply amazing. It delivers tele-presence for everyone in any location without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive hardware-based systems. And because it's a built-in feature of GoToMeeting, customers get a fully integrated web, audio and video experience, all with the same market-leading ease of use that's always been a hallmark of our SaaS product. 
Looking forward, we'll continue to expand into new markets like IT services with our new GoToManage product line into new geographies in Europe and Asia and to more mobile platforms, building on our top 10 ranking on the iPad with support for an array of exciting new devices.
So now, to wrap up. Our long focus on products that power virtual work styles and cloud services has put us at the center of exciting growth markets, with the opportunity to lead customers as they build clouds, connect to cloud services and empower people. 
Computing, as we've known it, is facing seriously disruptive forces, creating unprecedented stress on today's industry leaders, forcing IT into transformation mode and providing massive opportunity for agile players like Citrix.
So now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Yes, I think you hit it right about down the middle in terms of XenApp as a stand-alone product. And remember, it is fairly hard to forecast exactly the mix that's going to come out because we're showing the customers and what makes most sense for the projects that they're looking to deploy. But in order of magnitude, I do think that XenApp, roughly flat year-on-year, is the way to think about it. And then the majority of the growth continuing to come from new licenses of XenDesktop. So we've made Trade-up a part of the ongoing motion, just giving customers a path to migrate from XenApp to XenDesktop, as they looked to a kind of a much more broad, holistic solution around desktops and apps. And then, new licenses is we're either selling into new parts of existing customers or more likely just brand-new customers. So that business is where I think the majority of the growth is going to come from. And what gives us confidence in the growth rates that I talked about here is it's really a function of just the overall opportunity pipeline we're seeing. We're exiting Q2 with record levels across aggregate pipeline and in large deals that I mentioned earlier. We're seeing very high pipeline coverage ratios. We're seeing an increase in activity metrics from our SIs and other partners. And in some of the other metrics that we occasionally quote around that business, be it reorder rates or time to reorder, they're all very positive. And the last comment I'll make is really around the utilization we're seeing for consulting. It's been several quarters in a row now that we've talked about record consulting utilization, and that continues to be the case. It outstrips our capacity by far. And that's really just customers working through everything from proof of concepts up through scaling large deployments. And how successful we are making them successful drives long-term business. So these are all generally moving in the right direction. We feel good that our standing guidance of 16% to 18% growth for this total desktop and app business is the right place right now. We feel very good about that."

We've made it the priority for our sales and services teams. And so, we've got some geos, for example, that are seeing more than 50% of their NetScaler revenue coming from sales in conjunction with XenApp and XenDesktop, and that's great. In other cases, we're just having more access to opportunities inside those accounts, and that allows us to just ramp the base. From a competitive standpoint, we continue to do very well competitively. You should assume that most of the large deals are competitive bake-offs with one or another. We've got a great set of core features, price performance, metrics. And then some of the others that Mark mentioned that really differentiate NetScaler as a product around like AppFlow, which gives application and transaction level visibility. DataStream, which is about sequel load-balancing and many other things that just make a very compelling solution. So all that together post a great quarter. And the number of customers that are building out large scale call it, cloud services -- infrastructure to deliver cloud services. We've been fortunate to participate alongside of those as well."

I think it's really more a function of we're selling the right solution for what the customers' projects are and what they're trying to drive. And there are certain dynamics that are going on that I think have pretty raised the visibility and interest around our virtualization. One of those has been the tablet phenomenon. A lot of people are using XenApp as a way to deliver applications to iPads, et cetera, others are just expanding the delivery of applications in a different context. So a lot of uses for the product. It's a great product. It has huge customer base. So I do think that about this level is stable at this point in time, from a year-over-year growth rate perspective. In terms of the dynamics with XenDesktop, I mean in many cases, they are largely a different sale. Customers are looking at desktop transformation, a way to transform, I'd say, the whole IT delivery into more of a service. And that's where XenDesktop plays much more directly. The larger deals will tend to be XenDesktop, it is a more strategic product. It's more infrastructure focused. And I think that, that's going to become even more pronounced as we move to the next several quarters."

We've talked about them a lot over the last year to really broaden  up the footprint. And the result is the international component of the mix is now north of 15% where it was south of 10% a year ago. So that's really been the big push geographically. On a product-by-product basis, the collaboration products, which is kind of a general bucket that we put, the GoToMeeting family and webinar, et cetera, those have been, and continued to be the growth engine moving north of 30%. A couple of standouts that -- while small numbers are providing the nice incremental growth has been around GoToTraining, which is a product that we initiated last year, and has been growing nicely, as well as our audio services, which have been a nice incremental growth engine as well. So one of the things that both Mark and I talked about in our prepared comments around HDFaces going live here in the short-term is just continuing to add value and differentiate the products in the marketplace. And one of those things that we believe will allow us to not only attract and retain new customers but also maintain the price points at the right level.

And at the consumer end, we don't really play there either. So we'll stay focused on SMB, focused on ease-of-use, focused on the value proposition that has gotten us here, and do more integration across our own platform and with third parties as we go into the future.

The only thing I would add, Walter, is that a number of our SI partners have really created practices and specific skewed offerings around XenDesktop like CSC with Dynamic Desktop, and Wipro with their DaaS service. And so, as they do that, they get a lot more urgency, and it becomes much more of a rhythm in terms of driving the market as opposed to following the market. And obviously, this is what we've been working on for now, a couple years to help them design, architect and skew these kinds of offerings up, which accounts for the increase in the pipeline and the growth rate we're seeing with SI.

And we'd expect sales cycles on this kind of product through the kind of partners that we have around the world that focus on SMBs to be pretty short actually. But we're yet to get to that part of the process so you have to stay tuned for that. Overall, on the enterprise side, sales cycles really haven't changed materially from -- well, over the last couple of quarters. Obviously, we're seeing a full range of those cycles based upon whether a deal with XenApp is sort of incremental at the project level and transaction level, which tend to be very short and/or XenDesktop at the strategic level, which can take 90 to 270 days, just depending upon how big and how strategic a transaction like that is with a big gating factor along the way, being the design architecture of the system itself, migrating applications and that process.

Maybe you could just give us some insight as to what might be causing that mixed shift?

In terms of overall dynamics, the split between the products, I mean we're running just about half and half right now between XenApp and XenDesktop. And the reason why we haven't guided to the individual component is like we've said, every single quarter is that we're really focused on selling the customer what makes most sense for what they're trying to do, what they're trying to accomplish and the type of deployment. So that said, we certainly have put more focus in the last year or so, selling the broader desktop solution, which includes desktops and apps. And it tends, the growth rate of that, being significantly larger. But in terms of the way we want to forecast the business going forward, it really does need to be combined with the desktop solutions. And so, there will be quarters, I think, where one grows a little faster than the other but the way to really think about it is on a combined basis. And reiterating our 16% to 18% full year is right in line with what we're seeing. Hopefully, that proves to be conservative at the end of the day. But right now, that's our guidance. That's really the way we're thinking about it. In terms of the individual, some of the activity metrics and just remind everybody that these are interactivity metrics, and shouldn't -- don't take them with -- or a high level of precision. But from a reorder rate, it's been -- a reorder timeline, it's been pretty consistent. Last quarter was 8 months. So about 8 months after the initial order, customers are coming back for a follow-on. Natural size of the reorder moved up a little bit from last quarter. It's more than 9x. So that's a positive indicator. But again, these are more directional than specific. And in terms of actual seats and production, I'm not sure we have any way to measure that with a high level of specificity. I will say that the renewal rates for XenDesktop continue to be extremely high. And that's one of our best indicators that we have in terms of what is actually being deployed and used.

I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of the individual drivers. But from the --  on the enterprise side, it's breadth of accounts, we're just being successful in terms of our cross-sell motion. It's been a priority for the business over the course of the year. And so, we're getting more and more customers that are buying NetScaler either in conjunction with a virtual app, virtual desktop deployment or just raised visibility that we have into other opportunities for more traditional load-balancing, for example, or app security. So that's kind of one motion that's working well. The other is around our virtual appliances. We've made a big push in the last year around VPX and created virtual instances of many of our technologies, and they've been very successful. I mentioned in my comments that they're up about 3x from a year ago, which granted a small number still but now contributing more and more material component all the time. And the benefit there is that customers are not only deploying the physical hardware. But they're deploying the virtual appliances now in more of a, we call, the service delivery fabric. But if you think about it in conjunction with a physical appliance and then you can take a virtual appliance and deployed it like an application to your web tier, it just gives you a tremendous flexibility from an overall solution architecture. And so, that's been a driver. And then the third is around just the broader capacity in technology that we've delivered to one of our higher end appliances that are doing extremely well in the traditional Internet-centric cloud service provider or maybe you could call it enterprise accounts that are building out data centers to deliver cloud services. So all of those things are very -- we're just very, very strong in Q2. As we look into the second half of the year, we do guide at a total division level. So there's a few moving parts that I talked about earlier, we continue to think that the NetScaler as a standalone will be the majority component of that division. On a year-on-year basis, probably in Q3, it will be down year-on-year from a division because we have that huge Q3 a year ago. So in the mid to high teens from a division. And then in Q4, it will be back north of 20% year-on-year growth again. So that's the long answer but the way -- kind of a little more context on the NetScaler side."

I mean, our WAN op business is largely related to solutions sale, as customers are rolling out and optimizing the other related technologies, virtual apps, virtual desktops, et cetera. However, we also have large deals that occasionally come in from the government, for example, as was the case in Q2 and Q3 last year. We had very big pop around Department of Defense that was doing a specific project. And so those things are in the pipeline. They come from time to time. They're very difficult to forecast exactly when they hit. Don't anticipate any, and didn't anticipate any in Q2 and don't anticipate any in Q3. So that's the context around my commentary on the Branch Repeater business. In terms of the cross-sell motion, it was one of the 5 key focuses for our field organization this year, and it was -- it includes everything from just awareness, making sure customers are aware of the capabilities we can deliver in the networking area. It's about demonstrating the benefits that are derived by some of our technology integrations to be able to optimize traffic around the virtual app or virtual desktop deployment. And then, putting in place programs to really package these in a way that customers can acquire them easily. And so, that's been a key play, as we call it, in the sales and services organization. And so, I mentioned just anecdotally that in some geos, there's even a couple of countries in EMEA that I had visited that get more than half of their NetScaler business through cross-sell activities versus trying to sell into Internet accounts, et cetera. So that's what's going on there. And I think it will continue, and one of the gating factors in our networking business is capacity. We spent a lot of time and effort looking for the right people, both internally and our capacity to train channel partners and make sure that they're proficient and capable to sell our networking products. So a lot of work to do still on that front, but we're pretty excited with the results that we've seen throughout this year."

They tend to be much larger deals, more strategic in nature, a less of a project-based sale, which is how I would generalize XenApp 5 years ago. So this has been a continuum. It's been shifting over this period of time, and it will probably continue in this direction."

And then after we did the NetScaler acquisition, that really required a specialty that our channel organization did not have at the time. And then, probably another inflection point, a couple years ago now when XenDesktop went strategic and where we really understood the need to talk to customers, larger ones on the direct touch bases when we started to bring SIs in and when we went to a more of a managed partner program with our platinum partners and some of our top-tier gold partners. So I'd say it has been gradual probably took a little bit of an inflection point a couple years ago when XenDesktop began to hit the marketplace and continues to go that same direction. The acquisition of Cloud.com will continue that trajectory because the kind of sales process and direct engagement even after the sale, whether it's on architecture or implementation support, is much more profound than let say than even XenDesktop at this stage of the customer and market maturity. So we're investing a lot in professional services, ERMs, technical relationship managers and the people that really build our SI partnerships, including those that trained them. We have a huge uptick in trainings and so forth. So a lot of energy going into that."

In Q2, we delivered a record $531 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.57 and $162 million in cash flow from operations. We're continuing to drive leadership across Desktop Virt",1453,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us this afternoon. In Q2, we delivered a record $531 million in total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.57 and $162 million in cash flow from operations. 
We're continuing to drive leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in cloud networking and expanding the capabilities and footprint in our SaaS business, trends that can be clearly seen in our business results. 
So looking at the second quarter, revenue from new license sales was $171 million, up 15% from last year. License update revenue increased 9%. Technical services increased 33%, led by record consulting demand and support agreements. And our SaaS revenue was $106 million, up 19%. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, delivering revenue up 16% from last year to $235 million. Included in this number are 17 individual transactions greater than $1 million each.  In EMEA, revenue was up 9% to $136 million. And similar to Q1, demand was uneven across the region, particularly within the public sector as many countries as still working through budgetary constraints and capital project prioritization.  And finally, revenue in Japan and Pacific continues to grow very significantly, posting the combined growth of 31% from last year.
So overall, a really solid quarter. As we start the second half of 2011, customer activity metrics and pipeline are record levels. We remained committed to delivering strong results, integrating our recent acquisitions and expanding our competitive position across our main product groupings. 
So, now let's look at the Q2 results within these 3 businesses. First, overall, Desktop solutions grew 9% from last year to nearly $305 million, including product license revenue growth of 10%. So for the first half of 2011, license revenue in this business is up 15%. And consistent with my prior comments, we do anticipate accelerating year-over-year growth in the back half, which should lead to 16% to 18% product license increase for the full year.
Our license growth here continues to be led by the strength in XenDesktop. During Q2, sales of XenApp products were flat year-on-year, while XenDesktop license was up more than 20%. And as you recall, in Q2 of last year, we had a really successful desktop Trade-up promotion that skewed the year-over-year license comps. So if you look at the individual sales motions, license revenue coming through the desktop Trade-up was down about 1/3 from last year, while revenue generated from new XD licenses grew by over 65% in the period.
For a little more context on the Desktop solutions business in Q2, there's a few metrics that really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In fact, there were 10 $1 million plus deals in Q2 for XenDesktop, representing customers from multiple industries, including telecommunications, media, government, education and services with a few of these customers actually choosing to engage on the basis of a multiyear site license.
In total, there were over 2,800 different customers that purchased XenDesktop in the period, including 163 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 19 deals for over 5,000 seats each. And we exit in Q2 with a record pipeline in total and for those deals over $1 million.
So next, in our Data Center and Cloud business. Total revenue was over $90 million, up 32% in the quarter with new product revenue increasing 26%. Growth in this business was led by the NetScaler product line with license revenue up 90% year-on-year. 
And the strength in NetScaler in Q2 is really coming from a number of different areas. First, we continue to see traction driving the cross-sell motion into our traditional enterprise account base. In fact, more than half of NetScaler customers in Q2 were first-time NetScaler buyers. Second, contribution from the VPX line of virtual appliances nearly tripled from a year ago as customers are recognizing the value of deploying the virtual and physical appliances together as a complete solution. Third, the new NetScaler SDX platform, which enables customers to run numerous virtualized NetScaler instances with full multitenant support began shipping in late June, and has already generated 10 new customers.  And finally, we just had a record quarter from Internet-centric businesses and customers building out the infrastructure to support large cloud-based services.
And offsetting the very strong growth in NetScaler, licenses for our WAN op solution, Branch Repeater, declined by about 2/3 from Q2 a year ago. And as you know, historically, comparisons in our WAN op business are occasionally skewed by large individual orders as was the case in Q2 and Q3 of 2010.
So finally, turning to the SaaS business, revenue was up 19% in the second quarter to $106 million. The growth continues to be led by our collaboration products, which were up 31% and now account for over half of our total SaaS revenue. SaaS will further value through collaborations. This quarter, we're releasing in HDFaces, the videoconferencing capabilities is fully integrated into GoToMeeting. 
Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand this business internationally have been delivering results. In Q2, revenue from our international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, which is up from less than 10% a year ago.
So looking at expenses and operations now. In Q2, adjusted op margin was 25%, an increase of about 1.5 points over Q1 and a result of our revenue performance. Our plan has been to invest slightly behind demand growth that we're seeing in the market. So as bookings, pipeline and POCs have accelerated, we continue to focus on 2 main areas. 
The first is expanding go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech support. The second area is product innovation to bring to market new technologies, as well as improving integration across the solutions to drive simplicity and better end-user experience.
In Q2, we added 130 new people to Citrix, primarily in the sales and the services in the SaaS business. Headcount now stands at over 6,100 employees, which is an increase of about 1,000 people as compared to the same period of last year. And also of note, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased both sequentially and year-on-year. And the primary driver here is product license mix due to the very strong NetScaler results, as well as the record demand for consulting services.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $1.7 billion, driven by $162 million in cash flow from operations. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from ops is over $690 million, an increase of 24% year-on-year over the comparable period. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares of stock. And we also spent about $30 million on M&A and licensing activity. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was a record $830 million, up $41 million sequentially, and up 21% from a year ago. The main drivers around deferred revenue have been the increasing number of customers, XenDesktop customers in the subscription advantage program, the number of customers that have been initiating multiyear agreements and tech services contracts for consulting, maintenance and support.
So really in summary, we continue to execute well. We're seeing growth in all of our strategic businesses. And we're making investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while expanding go-to-market capacity.
So before I get to guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the financial impact of our recent acquisitions, Kaviza and Cloud.com. Both of these companies bring great technology and future opportunity to Citrix but are in their early stages of ramping their revenue base. Our plan is to initially focus on development and integration with the majority of go-to-market activities happening later in the year. Therefore, these acquisitions will result in aggregate EPS dilution of about $0.03 in Q3 and an additional $0.02 in Q4. This dilution is included in our forward-looking guidance.
So given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth in our opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our revenue outlook for 2011. For the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.16 billion to $2.19 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.41 per share. And for the third quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $540 million to $547 million; adjusted tax rate, between 22% and 23%; and adjusted EPS between $0.56 and $0.58.
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?"
26524,137369814,147572,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks much, David. I'm really pleased with our Q2 performance and proud of the strategic and financial results we've delivered this year. We have great confidence in our execution and growth in all 3 of our focal markets. Customer enthusiasm for going vi",2045,"Thanks much, David. I'm really pleased with our Q2 performance and proud of the strategic and financial results we've delivered this year. We have great confidence in our execution and growth in all 3 of our focal markets. Customer enthusiasm for going virtual, across meetings, desktops and clouds is simply amazing. We saw this firsthand in our Synergy San Francisco conference, which was completely sold out again. 
Since the conference, I spent significant time with enterprise customers, with SI partners and service providers in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These conversations have consistently focused on 3 key themes: the massive impact of consumerization, the transformation of IT to on-demand delivery, and the allure of external cloud services.
We think these are the conversations of the post-PC era, setting the stage for the cloud era, where customers are focused on 3 things: building new clouds, connecting to existing cloud services, and empowering people and business to work in new ways.
So next, I'd like to highlight each of these areas. The transition from the PC era to the cloud era is fueling a massive buildout in cloud infrastructure. This market will feature thousands of providers of all shapes and sizes, offering a vast array of new cloud services, services that range from business, infrastructure and development offerings to consumer, mobile and gaming. It will also feature thousands of enterprise customers seeking to transform their existing data centers from rigid cost centers into more elastic private clouds, designed to deliver desktops and apps as a service. This buildout is driving great demand for our cloud networking products and positioning us well for growth in the new cloud platforms business we acquired with Cloud.com.
Let's talk first about cloud networking. Every cloud, public or private, need the next-generation networking system at the core, ensuring scalable performance, reliability and security. This is fueling strong growth in NetScaler, based on our ability to be weave virtualization into the core fabric of cloud networking. This differentiation is paying off in all 3 of our NetScaler platforms, MPX, VPX and the new SDX. 
NetScaler MPX continues to be the centerpiece of our lineup, a standard for the world's largest .coms and web 2.0 providers and delivering the industry's best price performance ratio for enterprises. Cross-selling with XenDesktop has been a significant driver of MPX growth.  In addition, we're winning new customers with our powerful DataStream technology that offloads and balances sequel databases. 
NetScaler VPX, our fully virtualized cloud networking system is also seeing significant traction. We now have over 1,500 customers in production on NetScaler VPX software appliances. More than 80% were first-time NetScaler customers, making VPX a great cross-sale, an easier way to expand our customer base and a potent competitive weapon. In fact, more than 25% of NetScaler customers are now running a mix of MPX and VPX systems, realizing the power of NetScaler as a service delivery fabric.
As David mentioned, SDX is seeing great early adoption, designed as a multitenant backbone for cloud services, SDX is built with embedded XenServer technology, optimized for network IO, allowing it to run up to 40 virtual NetScaler instances simultaneously in the same appliance, all while delivering wire-speed performance and a stunning 50-gig throughput. This powerful combination of NetScaler MPX, VPX and SDX puts us in great position for the buildout of public and private clouds. And it's an area where we'll build out additional muscle in the second half of the year.
This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Cloud.com, creators of the market-leading CloudStack platform, enabling simple cost-effective cloud services that are scalable, secure and open by design. This move significantly accelerate the Olympus project we announced during Synergy, a project based on OpenStack, the popular open-source cloud movement. 
Cloud.com was a founding member of OpenStack, offering a complementary product for cloud orchestration and administration called CloudStack. CloudStack is hypervisor agnostic and designed for building cloud that are simple, automated, elastic, scalable and massively efficient. 
Cloud.com customers roll out new cloud services up to 50x faster at 1/5 of the cost of alternative solutions. This has yielded impressive early success, with deployments in over 60 large-scale production clouds, including some of the most innovative brands in the world like Zynga, Go Daddy, Tata, Korea Telecom and Nokia.
Overall, the strategy is to offer Citrix's service providers a powerful and open system that delivers a range of profitable on-demand services, like powerful infrastructure as a service, like services based on Citrix technologies including XenApp, VPX, Cloud Bridge and Cloud Gateway, like services based on the OpenStack ecosystem and of course, innovative cloud services of our service providers own design. 
In the second half, we'll focus on smooth integration while gaining additional design wins around the world with key service providers. We'll also accelerate the investment both companies have already made in multi-hypervisor support, as well as our mutual commitment to OpenStack. We're really excited to be joining forces with an incredibly talented Cloud.com team that includes some of the world's most experienced cloud-computing experts. 
As analysts are projecting the cloud infrastructure and services market to exceed $11 billion by the end of 2013, expanding our position now provides us with a tremendous opportunity to accelerate our cloud strategy and firmly establish Citrix as a leader in this market.
Connecting enterprise customers to these external clouds is an opportunity Citrix is uniquely positioned to lead at both higher-level application layers, as well as infrastructure as a service levels. We are addressing this market with 2 powerful new products. The first is NetScaler Cloud Gateway, which sits at the front door of the enterprise data center, giving IT an easy, unified way to orchestrate the delivery of any mix of SaaS, web and Windows' apps to end users. 
Cloud Gateway unifies silos of private and public cloud apps and provides a single way to manage secure access, user provisioning, license measurement and user experience. And it gives end users a brilliantly easy way to access all their apps, with a single one-time login regardless of what device they are using or where all those apps are being hosted.
The other important connection to cloud services is at the infrastructure layer. Our new NetScaler Cloud Bridge sits at the back door of enterprise data centers, creating a secure, fast, transparent network bridge to virtually any cloud like RackSpace, Amazon, SoftLayer and others. In fact, Cloud Bridge gives private clouds infinite reach to public cloud compute, network and storage resources, for things like app testing, disaster recovery, burst over or building new apps. 
As the industry shifts from the PC era to the cloud era, IT is rapidly outgrowing its ability to own and manage all of its own apps, all of its own infrastructure and thousands and thousands of devices. The introduction of Cloud Gateway and Cloud Bridge give IT organizations an easy way to extend their data centers to a vast array of cloud services that are outside their own domain.
Empowering people through a flexible virtual workstyle is the third dimension of enabling the cloud era. It's clear that computing is going personal again, freeing people to do whatever, whenever, wherever. This mindset of empowerment through mobility, device independence and a work-anywhere experience continues to be the driver of both our Desktop Virtualization and web collaboration businesses. 
It's been said in quarters, since we launched XenDesktop with FlexCast technology, giving customers a single solution that delivers any mix of virtual desktops and apps in one enterprise class product. It's now available with a choice of licensing models and a smooth trade-up path from XenApp. XenDesktop continues to lead the Desktop Virtualization market, winning an impressive array of reviews, awards and market share assessments. 
Earlier this month, IDC added to this growing list by publishing the first-ever report on the desktop virtualization space, a report that named Citrix as the only company in the leader category. We are honored, but in a market this early, we still see a lot of space for growth, innovation and expansion. This is why driving primary demand remains our strategic focus. By our estimates, we're still in the early stages of the desktop virtualization market, with tremendous upside still ahead.
From an adoption standpoint, the primary verticals continue to be finance and banking, gov and education and healthcare, driven by the demand for better security and control, lower operational costs and higher business agility. Gradually, we're seeing customers focus on a broader set of strategic business initiatives with XenDesktop, making deals bigger and driving a greater mix across our products. 
Indiana University, for example, is going virtual for over 100,000 students, faculty and staff, with an on-demand personal cloud service called IU anywhere, all powered by XenDesktop. They're lowering support costs, supporting a wide variety of consumer devices and enabling better work life balance for everyone.
At the other end of the spectrum, our corporate customers like Suncorp, one of Australia's largest insurance firms, they are deploying 15,000 seats as part of a joint Citrix Microsoft solution, driven by a key corporate initiative to attract, develop and inspire innovation and ingenuity in their workforce by creating a smarter workplace that incorporates hot desking, work from home and employee-owned devices.  These and many others represent a tremendous opportunity ahead as Desktop Virtualization continues toward mainstream. 
We are aggressively driving the evolution of this market with innovations that make going virtual at the desktop easier, more affordable and more accessible to millions of new users and devices. For example, in our latest releases of XenDesktop, XenApp and XenClient, we added new capabilities that reduce the cost of VDI storage up to 50% with our groundbreaking Intellicast technology, features that extend our reach to more than 1 billion end-user devices with new versions of Citrix Receiver, new XenClient technology that supports a much broader range of new laptop models, and the all-new XenClient XT edition that opens brand-new opportunity and new high-security desktop computing markets.
Breadth is the other key to driving primary demand, expanding the market to broadly serve the SMB customer. Our recent acquisition of Kaviza gives us a simple all-in-one VDI solution, perfect for the SMB. Kaviza's VDI-in-a-box rivals the acquisition cost of a traditional PC, and can be deployed and managed without an enterprise IT department. We think it will really invigorate our SMB-focused partners. 
For product innovation to market expansion, we're relentlessly focused on extending our lead in desktop virtualization as we work to drive broad mainstream adoption. So we're staying on offense, and encourage you to watch this space for some great announcements in the second half.
Empowering users is also about making it easy to collaborate with others. That's what drives our online collaboration business, enabling customers of all sizes to deliver a more virtual work style, one that frees people to work from anywhere with anyone on any device. We're taking that experience to a new level this quarter, with the delivery of GoToMeeting with HDFaces, a stunning new solution that brings realtime HD videoconferencing to online meetings at no extra charge to GoToMeeting subscribers. 
HDFaces is brilliantly easy, totally immersive, simply amazing. It delivers tele-presence for everyone in any location without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive hardware-based systems. And because it's a built-in feature of GoToMeeting, customers get a fully integrated web, audio and video experience, all with the same market-leading ease of use that's always been a hallmark of our SaaS product. 
Looking forward, we'll continue to expand into new markets like IT services with our new GoToManage product line, into new geographies in Europe and Asia and to more mobile platforms, building on our top 10 ranking on the iPad with support for an array of exciting new devices.
So now, to wrap up. Our long focus on products that power virtual work styles and cloud services has put us at the center of exciting growth markets, with the opportunity to lead customers as they build clouds, connect to cloud services and empower people. 
Computing, as we've known it, is facing seriously disruptive forces, creating unprecedented stress on today's industry leaders, forcing IT into transformation mode and providing massive opportunity for agile players like Citrix.
So now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

But in order of magnitude, I do think that XenApp, roughly flat year-on-year, is the way to think about it. And then the majority of the growth continuing to come from new licenses of XenDesktop. So we've made Trade-up a part of the ongoing motion, just giving customers a path to migrate from XenApp to XenDesktop, as they look to a kind of a much more broad, holistic solution around desktops and apps. And then, new licenses is we're either selling into new parts of existing customers or more likely just brand-new customers. So that business is where I think the majority of the growth is going to come from. And what gives us confidence in the growth rates that I talked about here is it's really a function of just the overall opportunity pipeline we're seeing. We're exiting Q2 with record levels across aggregate pipeline and in large deals that I mentioned earlier. We're seeing very high pipeline coverage ratios. We're seeing increasing activity metrics from our SIs and other partners. And in some of the other metrics that we occasionally quote around that business, be it reorder rates or time to reorder, they're all very positive. And the last comment I'd make is really around the utilization we're seeing for consulting. It's been several quarters in a row now that we've talked about record consulting utilization, and that continues to be the case. It outstrips our capacity by far. And that's really just customers working through everything from proof of concepts up through scaling large deployments. And how successful we are making them successful drives long-term business. So these are all generally moving in the right direction. We feel good that our standing guidance of 16% to 18% growth for this total desktop and app business is the right place right now. We feel very good about that."

We did talk about some of the kind of macro-dynamics that are affecting this, in terms of the investments that we've made to make the products easier to acquire, POC scale and manage to improve the ROI profile, those types of things, as well as just the breadth of adoption we're seeing across verticals.

And that was a couple of things. One of them is just the continued success we're having on the cross-sell motion. This has been a major focus for several quarters. We've talked about this. We've made it the priority for our sales and services teams. And so, we've got some geos, for example, that are seeing more than 50% of their NetScaler revenue coming from sales in conjunction with XenApp and XenDesktop, and that's great. In other cases, we're just having more access to opportunities inside those accounts, and that allows us to just ramp the base. From a competitive standpoint, we continue to do very well competitively. You should assume that most of the large deals are competitive bake-offs with one or another. We've got a great set of core features, price performance, metrics. And then some of the others that Mark mentioned that really differentiate NetScaler as a product around like AppFlow, which gives application and transaction level visibility.

I think it's really more a function of we're selling the right solution for what the customers' projects are and what they're trying to drive.

A lot of people are using XenApp as a way to deliver applications to iPads, et cetera. Others are just expanding the delivery of applications in a different context. So a lot of uses for the product. It's a great product. It has huge customer base. So I do think that about this level is stable at this point in time, from a year-over-year growth rate perspective. In terms of the dynamics with XenDesktop, I mean in many cases, they are largely a different sale. Customers are looking at desktop transformation, a way to transform, I'd say, the whole IT delivery into more of a service. And that's where XenDesktop plays much more directly. The larger deals will tend to be XenDesktop, it is a more strategic product. It's more infrastructure focused.

On a product-by-product basis, the collaboration products, which is kind of a general bucket that we put, the GoToMeeting family and webinar, et cetera, those have been, and continue to be the growth engine moving north of 30%. A couple of standouts that -- while small numbers are providing the nice incremental growth has been around GoToTraining, which is a product that we initiated last year, and has been growing nicely, as well as our audio services, which have been a nice incremental growth engine as well. So one of the things that both Mark and I talked about in our prepared comments around HDFaces going live here in the short-term is just continuing to add value and differentiate the products in the marketplace.

It's up north of $40 million, about 3/4 of that coming from the Desktop business, the rest split between online and tech services contracts.

So with deferred revenue being up about, let's say, about 21% year-on-year, I'd expect at least that rate as we move into the back half of the year. And just going back to, maybe the one thing I'd add to that, is that if you look in the components of deferred revenue, you are seeing the long term grow faster than the short term. And I think long-term deferred was up, just about 30% on a year-over-year basis. And what's going on there is really a reflection of customers looking at multiyear commitments. And so, we've got more and more customers coming for a, call it a term-based or a site license type of an engagement with Citrix. And so, that revenue gets deferred and recognized over a period of time instead of upfront like a traditional license sale.

And they've had actually a very small SMB and business revenue focus. This is where we had great discussions and an agreement to partner with them to help power the Skype for business platform with GoToMeeting. We don't have insight, until Microsoft actually closes the acquisition, we don't have insight on to Microsoft's product and strategy plans with Skype. But we're assuming that they're going to seek to actually integrate their technology assets with Skype. And that will create a dynamic, and at least in the enterprise and of the marketplace that will be -- a place where we haven't played big with the GoToMeeting at this point. And at the consumer end, we don't really play there either. So we'll stay focused on SMB, focused on ease-of-use, focused on the value proposition that has gotten us here, and do more integration across our own platform and with third parties as we go into the future. And hopefully, Skype will be one of those platforms that we can integrate with, as a potential partnership as opposed to head-to-head competition. But we really won't know until Microsoft closes the deal and talks with us more directly about their strategy."

In terms of overall dynamics, the split between the products, I mean we're running just about half and half right now between XenApp and XenDesktop. And the reason why we haven't guided to the individual component is like we've said, every single quarter is that we're really focused on selling the customer what makes most sense for what they're trying to do, what they're trying to accomplish and the type of deployment. So that said, we certainly have put more focus in the last year or so, selling the broader desktop solution, which includes desktops and apps. And hence, the growth rate of that being significantly larger. But in terms of the way we want to forecast the business going forward, it really does need to be combined with the desktop solutions. And so, there will be quarters, I think, where one grows a little faster than the other but the way to really think about it is on a combined basis. And reiterating our 16% to 18% full year is right in line with what we're seeing. Hopefully, that proves to be conservative at the end of the day. But right now, that's our guidance. That's really the way we're thinking about it. In terms of the individual, some of the activity metrics and just remind everybody that these are interactivity metrics, and shouldn't -- don't take them with a high level of precision. But from a reorder rate, it's been -- a reorder timeline, it's been pretty consistent. Last quarter was 8 months. So about 8 months after the initial order, customers are coming back for a follow-on. The actual size of the reorder moved up a little bit from last quarter. It's more than 9x. So that's a positive indicator. But again, these are more directional than specific. And in terms of actual seats and production, I'm not sure we have any way to measure that with a high level of specificity. I will say that the renewal rates for XenDesktop continue to be extremely high. And that's one of our best indicators that we have in terms of what is actually being deployed and used.

I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of the individual drivers. But from the -- on the enterprise side, it's breadth of accounts, we're just being successful in terms of our cross-sell motion. It's been a priority for the business over the course of the year. And so, we're getting more and more customers that are buying NetScaler either in conjunction with a virtual app, virtual desktop deployment or in just raised visibility that we have into other opportunities for more traditional load-balancing, for example, or app security. So that's kind of one motion that's working well. The other is around our virtual appliances. We've made a big push in the last year around VPX and created virtual instances of many of our technologies, and they've been very successful. I mentioned in my comments that they're up about 3x from a year ago, which granted small numbers still but now contributing more and more material component all the time. And the benefit there is that customers are not only deploying the physical hardware, but they're deploying the virtual appliances now in more of a, we call the service delivery fabric. But if you think about it in conjunction with a physical appliance and then you can take a virtual appliance and deployed it like an application to your web tier, it just gives you a tremendous flexibility from an overall solution architecture. And so, that's been a driver. And then the third is around just the broader capacity in technology that we've delivered to one of our higher end appliances that are doing extremely well in the traditional Internet-centric cloud service provider or maybe you could call it enterprise accounts that are building out data centers to deliver cloud services. So all of those things are very -- we're just very, very strong in Q2. As we look into the second half of the year, we do guide at a total division level. So there's a few moving parts that I talked about earlier. We continue to think that the NetScaler as a standalone will be the majority component of that division. On a year-on-year basis, probably in Q3, it will be down year-on-year from a division because we had that huge Q3 a year ago. So in the mid to high teens from a division. And then in Q4, it will be back north of 20% year-on-year growth again. So that's the long answer but the way -- kind of a little more context on the NetScaler side."

I mean, our WAN op business is largely related to solutions sale, as customers are rolling out and optimizing the other related technologies, virtual apps, virtual desktops, et cetera. However, we also have large deals that occasionally come in from the government, for example, as was the case in Q2 and Q3 last year. We had very big pop around Department of Defense that was doing a specific project. And so those things are in the pipeline. They come from time to time. They're very difficult to forecast exactly when they hit. Don't anticipate any -- and didn't anticipate any in Q2 and don't anticipate any in Q3. So that's the context around my commentary on the Branch Repeater business. In terms of the cross-sell motion, it was one of the 5 key focuses for our field organization this year, and it was -- it includes everything from just awareness, making sure customers are aware of the capabilities we can deliver in the networking area. It's about demonstrating the benefits that are derived by some of our technology integrations to be able to optimize traffic around the virtual app or virtual desktop deployment. And then, putting in place programs to really package these in a way that customers can acquire them easily. And so, that's been a key play, as we call it, in the sales and services organization. And so, I mentioned just anecdotally that in some geos, there's even a couple of countries in EMEA that I had visited that get more than half of their NetScaler business through cross-sell activities versus trying to sell into Internet accounts, et cetera. So that's what's going on there. And I think it will continue. And one of the gating factors in our networking business is capacity, we spend a lot of time and effort looking for the right people, both internally and our capacity to train channel partners and make sure that they're proficient and capable to sell our networking products.

They tend to be much larger deals, more strategic in nature, a less of a project-based sale, which is how I would generalize XenApp 5 years ago. So this has been a continuum. It's been shifting over this period of time, and it will probably continue in this direction."

And then after we did the NetScaler acquisition, that really required a specialty that our channel organization did not have at the time. And then, probably another inflection point, a couple years ago now when XenDesktop went strategic and where we really understood the need to talk to customers, larger ones on the direct touch bases when we started to bring SIs in, and when we went to a more of a managed partner program with our platinum partners and some of our top-tier gold partners. So I'd say it has been gradual probably took a little bit of an inflection point a couple years ago when XenDesktop began to hit the marketplace and continues to go that same direction. The acquisition of Cloud.com will continue that trajectory because the kind of sales process and direct engagement even after the sale, whether it's on architecture or implementation support, is much more profound than, let's say, than even XenDesktop at this stage of the customer and market maturity. So we're investing a lot in professional services, ERMs, technical relationship managers and the people that really build our SI partnerships, including those that train them. We have a huge uptick in trainings and so forth. So a lot of energy going to that."

Today, we're hosting the call from Citrix Synergy in Barcelona. It's our annual customer and partner event in Europe. We're really excited to actually have a record number of attendees this week, up more than 40% from last year. Mark will give you an update on the event later in the call.
So turning to Q3. Revenue grew 20% to $565 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.64, and we generated almost $190 million in cash flow from operations. We're continuing to drive leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in cloud networking and expanding the capabilities and footprint in our SaaS business. Trends that can be clearly seen in our results.
In the third quarter, revenue from new license sales was $194 million, up 28% from last year. License update revenue increased 7%. Tech services increased 37%, led by consulting demand and support agreements. And finally, SaaS revenue was $110 million, up 20%. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, with revenue up 21% from last year including 26 individual deals greater than $1 million each. It's a metric that was more than double from a year ago. In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $137 million, and Japan and Pacific posted another strong quarter with combined revenue growth of 39%.
So overall, a very good quarter. So now, let's take a look at the Q3 results within our 3 main businesses. First, Desktop solutions grew 14% in total revenue from last year to $316 million, including product license growth of 24%. Year-to-date, this license revenue in this business is up 18%, and is at the top of our 16% to 18% license growth target that we set for the full year. In Q3, sales of XenDesktop product were up more than 65% year-on-year, with about 20% of revenue coming from the trade-off program and the balance from new licenses. XenApp also increased from last year as more customers are looking to application virtualization as a great way to deliver apps, tablet and other mobile devices.
There's also a few other metrics that I think really demonstrated breadth of adoption we're seeing, as well as the strategic value that customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In Q3, there were $22 million-plus deals for XenDesktop, easily a record and representing customers from healthcare, retail, insurance, government, education and other verticals. In total, over 3,000 different customers purchased XenDesktop, including 174 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 24 deals for over 5,000 seats each.
Customers are looking at desktop transformation as a way to accelerate their business imperatives. For example, a large insurance company in Asia with over 20,000 employees buying XenDesktop and XenServer in order to provide flex working from police, increasing productivity and maximizing real estate savings; or a major U.S. retailer the purchase over 20,000 Desktop licenses as part of their critical business infrastructure necessary to deliver on a vision for a store in the future in over 1,800 locations across the country; or a U.S.-based healthcare provider that rolled out more than 5,000 seats of XenDesktop to securely deliver sensitive medical information to affiliate clinics over a wide area network; and using our FlexCast technology allowing them to support the full variety of use cases from doctors and nurses to office workers using PCs, laptops, XenClients and tablets.
So increasingly conversations with customers at this level, as the conversation moves from technology to business enablement. We're providing them the tools to more efficiently transform their desktop infrastructure, including a brand-new solution announced yesterday through the pending acquisition of App-DNA. And this tool allows customer to quickly assess their application portfolio, and implement a strategy to deliver desktops and applications as a service to all users in the enterprise.
Next, in our Data Center and cloud the business. Total revenue was up 30% in the quarter with product license revenue increasing 32%. Growth here was again led by NetScaler with license revenue up 48% year-on-year, and the strength really coming from 3 big areas: First, continuing to see really strong traction, driving across cell motion into our traditional enterprise account base with a number of new NetScaler customers up more than 50%. Second, the new NetScaler SDX platform, which started shipping in June is enabling customers to run numerous virtualized NetScaler instances with full multitenant support, giving service providers and other large enterprises significant economic benefits to consolidation. And finally, another big quarter for Internet-centric accounts, as they're building out infrastructure to support large retail and other cloud-based service offerings.
In the SaaS business, revenue was up 20% to $110 million. The growth continues to be led by our collaboration products, which were up 30%, and now account for over half of total SaaS revenue. Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand this business internationally delivering good results. And in fact, in Q3, revenue from international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, up from just 10% a year ago. 
Also in Q4, through the acquisition of Share File, we'll begin offering customers a solutions for cloud based data storage, sharing and collaboration, making it easy for businesses of all sizes to securely store, sync and share business documents and files, both inside and outside of the company.
So turning to operations. In Q3, adjusted op margin was 26%, an increase of over 100 basis points from Q2. Our plan all year has been to invest slightly behind demand growth we're seeing in the market, so as bookings, pipeline and POCs have accelerated, we continue to focus on really 2 main areas. The first, which is about expanding our go-to-market reach and customer touch through our project account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech support; and second, around product innovation to bring market new technologies as well as improving integration across our solutions in order to drive simplicity and a better end-user experience.
So in total, in the third quarter, we had over 400 new people at Citrix, with more than half of those coming in the sales and services organization. In total, headcount now stands at over 6,500 employees, which is an increase of 1,100 people compared to the same time last year.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments is now $1.5 billion, driven by nearly $190 million in cash flow from operations. During Q3, we repurchased just over 2.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $57, and we spent about $200 million on M&A and licensing activities. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $834 million, which is up 23% from last year. And the main drivers here being really 3 things: First is an increasing number of XenDesktop customers that are involved in the Subscription Advantage program; a number of customers that are initiating multiyear agreements; and tech services contracts for consulting maintenance and support.
So we continue to execute really well. We're seeing growth across all of our strategic businesses, and we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while at the same time expanding our go-to-market capacity. So given the segment is seeing across several facets of the business and the growth of our opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our revenue outlook for a 2011. And just as a reminder, our guidance does include the impact of acquisitions that we've made today.
So for the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.21 billion, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.45 to $2.46 a share. And for the fourth quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million, adjusted tax rate between 22% and 23%, and adjusted EPS of $0.75 to $0.76.
And with respect to 2012, our planning cycle is still in process, which is normal for early Q4. And at this point, we're comfortable with the current revenue expectations that are in the range of $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion. Our focus next year is going to be on helping customers accelerate desktop transformation, delivering the infrastructure to build both public and private clouds and expanding our customer reach through both direct touch and go-to-market partnerships. We'll update these expectations with more specifics on our fourth quarter earnings call. But ultimately, our confidence in the market position and our ability to drive long-term growth remains unchanged. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you a brief update on Synergy and all of the important announcement coming out this week. Mark?"

I'm really delighted and proud of our Q3 performance across our geographies, business lines and financials. As David mentioned, we're in Barcelona this week with business partners and customers attending our second European version of Synergy. Despite the tough economic state of Europe overall, attendance is up over 40% from last year, and it's fueled by customer enthusiasm is up over 100%. Our long health mission and belief in creating a world where people can work and play from everywhere is really resonating. It's clear that in a highly volatile, uncertain and complex and ambiguous world, this is how people and business will live better and work better. 
Yesterday, we unveiled enhanced technologies, future innovations and acquisitions that will power mobile work styles and cloud services. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on a few of the important announcements we've made this week, putting them in  context about markets, strategy and ambitions around growth.
First is empowering end users. Empowering them with increasingly mobile work styles and their personal Cloud. To continue to lead and innovate in this area, we demonstrated how our customers can create seamless access across people, data and apps on any device. Our recent acquisition of Share File was the centerpiece. A fast product that enables secure professional and simple document sharing using any device, Windows and Mac, along with everything mobile from iOS to Android to Windows. Getting to your data from any device is critical to growing mobile. Integrating data within collaboration tools is just as critical. So we announced Workspaces, a new feature for GoToMeeting that adds intuitively easy places to create, share and store leading content. With Workspaces, meetings and center around project teams and the content needed for productivity. Making data available to enterprise and mobile apps is also critical, so we announced the addition of follow me data to Citrix Receiver, allowing IT professionals to give employees easy, secure access to business documents from any company-owned or personal device. These data center products and features are all built on the data cloud that's been the underlying infrastructure for Share File.
We announced this as our new Follow Me Data fabric and extendable platform for sharing business data across a wide range of apps, devices and cloud services. We think of it as iCloud for business. Our Follow Me Data fabric powers our own personal cloud services, and we'll make it easy for third-party developers to incorporate data services like search, share, sync, secure and remote wipe through a set of open APIs, resulting in dynamic mesh ups of data sharing of new and existing apps, and making user data securely and easily accessed from millions of business and consumer devices.
The second area of focus yesterday was around transformation. Transformation of traditional data centers into more elastic and economical private clouds. Controlling and delivering a wide array of services to the personal cloud is creating greater need for a single point of service and control at the front door of the Data Center. To enable this, we demonstrated Citrix's Cloud Gateway, the industry's first unified service broker that aggregates, controls and delivers Windows, web, SaaS and mobile apps to any user on any device. Cloud Gateway empowers any users with self-service access to all their business apps, and gives IT unmatched control, providing identity provisioning for authorized users, automatic account provisioning and deep provisioning, and mobile wipe for data and apps on lost devices. It also includes a unified dashboard for service-level monitoring and license optimization among other things.
Cloud Gateway is the connection and aggregation point for on-demand IT services, including Windows apps and desktops, where XenDesktop continues as the market leader. Our focus is to make virtualization at the desktop more powerful and pervasive by expanding our market reach by lowering acquisition costs, and by speeding adoption. Our virtualization at the Desktop is being deployed by customers of all sizes, with widely recognized ROI for virtual apps and virtual desktops, as David mentioned. We recently shipped new versions of both XenDesktop and XenApp with new features that address performance, management and simplicity, including the biggest set of enhancements to our industry-standard HDX technology in the entire history of Citrix. These releases will help customers drive even greater business agility, tighter security and wider availability across consumer and business any points. 
To reach the SMB and departmental customers more rapidly, we announced Citrix VDI-in-a-box, a simple, affordable all-in-one VDI solution. This was especially well received by our European partners who service these smaller customers. Over the past 2 years, we focused on reducing the cost of Desktop Virtualization as an enabler to wider scale adoptions. This week, we showed how the first year capital cost of a Citrix XenDesktop rollout is now materially below that of physical desktops in many cases.
We're achieving this through our industry-only flex passed delivery technology, along with the addition of storage, networking and management optimization, leveraging the innovations of our partner ecosystem and greater density of virtual apps and virtual desktops.
We also announced XenDesktop new personal be this technology, built on a recent acquisition of RingCube that moves personal apps, preferences and data to a virtual disc. It reduces VDI storage by 65% in most cases, because only 1 image of the Windows VM is now required. Over the next 6 months, I think we'll be able to drive the upfront cost of virtual desktops below our physical desktops across the board, inspiring even broader adoption, which is our third area of focus. 
Customers are asking for services and innovations that will speed them to the value of virtual desktops. This week, we announced upgrades and enhancements to all our Desktop transformation model services, with more self-service tools and partner services. We also announced the agreement to acquire App-DNA to simplify the migration of Windows and browser apps to the new world of Win 7 virtual desktops and consumer devices, something that's been a significant obstacle for many customers. This acquisition will give our customers the ability to analyze their application portfolio, to know what they're deploying and options are, to quantify actual mediation where needed and to auto package the apps for use with Microsoft Installer, Microsoft's App and Citrix XenApp.
The third area of focus for the conference has been around connecting, connecting to the growing array of public cloud services in the simplest way possible. NetScaler, having a great, great quarter is becoming the top brand in cloud networking, as you can see in our business trajectory; connecting people, devices, apps and data to cloud services. NetScaler VPX, SPX and MPX are the underlying service delivery fabric, leading the industry in the transition from app delivery to service delivery networking. 
We also announced enhancements to Cloud Bridge, securely connecting private clouds to the infinite capacity of public clouds at the back door of the Data Center. The enhancements include the industry's first infrastructure as a service cloud catalog, leading cloud providers worldwide will be the precertified for supporting Cloud Bridge, giving enterprises a one-sided setup, choosing from a validated risk of cloud data centers worldwide. It will be as simple as adding a new e-mail account to your smartphone.
The last area of focus this week has been around building clouds. Building new cloud services the way the world's most successful clouds are built. At the industry transition from the PC Era to the cloud era, the cloud services market is projected by IDC to exceed $55 billion by the end of 2014, comprised of thousands of providers of all sizes for business and productivity applications, gaming, collaboration services, managed desktops, data storage, business continuity services and infrastructure as a service. To date, more than 2,500 cloud providers around the world have chosen a combination of Citrix's CloudStack, CloudPortal, XenServer and NetScaler products as a key platform for building their cloud businesses, including 4 of the top 5 largest public clouds in production today. 
We demonstrated some of them at yesterday's keynote. The Synergy audience really responded to the live demo of CloudStack and CloudPortal, NetScaler like Go Daddy, Korea Telecom and IDC Frontier; and super scale specialty clouds like XenDesk ZCloud, all built on Citrix cloud infrastructure.
Under the covers, they were seeing CloudStack 3, CloudPortal Services Manager, CloudPortal Business Manager, XenServer 6 and NetScaler SPX, powering some amazing clouds from general-purpose to special-purpose. As more businesses shift to the cloud, our open solutions provide a powerful alternative that will challenge other vendors that are limited to providing proprietary and closed solutions.
So wrapping up. Clearly, we're building strong positions across SaaS, virtualization, networking and cloud markets, and the investments we've made over the past year in people, infrastructure and innovation and go-to-market is powering growth through geographical reach and business model diversity.
And now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

So a lot of movement in that direction, and it's certainly been a trend that we've seen over some period of time. If you'll recall last quarter, we're up to 26, which was clearly a record for a Q2. We're seeing a good mix across products. We have some of the largest deals coming out of NetScaler as well as XenDesktop, and a surprising number of combined transactions. Those customers that are buying both the hardware and the software solution, as well as customers that are looking at both XenDesktop and XenApp stand-alone product as a component. I'd also add that contribution from SIs, as you know, one of our big focus areas over the course of the last couple of years, continues to move, talk about 65% year-on-year in Q3. And remember, that's a little bit lumpy because it's related to large deals. But still representing somewhere in the 15% of product bookings neighborhood, big contribution in Q3 from EDS HP, IBM, Fujitsu and others. And I'd also, we had a good geographic mix. We had about 10 of the large deals come from EMEA. And even though EMEA is ours those largest region, the one that is clearly in the middle of working through a number of political and macroeconomic issues, customers are still stepping up for large strategic transactions. And it's just a lot of positive forces moving in that direction."

But we will be able to come back in 3 months, and give you more detail there. As far as acquisitions and specifically lesion and whatnot, most of the acquisitions we've been doing are not terribly material in size, and are focused on accelerating some of these markets categories or the coming features or infrastructure of existing products. And because of that, it becomes more of a build buy, right? So it's kind of the number already. And the only area that I'd say had some dilutive drag, if you want to call it that, into next year would be around the cloud platforms group. And that's just because it's very recent market, and we're investing to capture what we believe is a huge multibillion dollar opportunity in a next few years.

So that's the way you should be thinking about that business. In terms of tech services, yes, we've seen growth, tremendous growth across all 4 major areas. That includes the support revenue, consulting and education, and maintenance. The big driver frankly, the largest year-on-year growth rate was around consulting, and this is the demand we're seeing from customers that are either looking at Desktop transformation and kind of earlier stages or they're in the process of architecting and the deploying XenApp and XenDesktop on a more broad basis. That's a people business, so our ability to grow their revenue is somewhat linked to our ability to hire and bring new people on board. So the way we think about it financially is probably for Q4, I'd expect that business to be up a little sequentially, and in the mid-20s, mid-20% range on a year-over-year basis."

Today, we're hosting the call from Citrix Synergy in Barcelona. It's our annual customer and partner event in Europe. We're really excited to actually have a record number of attendees this week, up more than 40% from last year. Mark will give you an update on the event later in the call.
So turning to Q3, revenue grew 20% to $565 million, adjusted EPS was $0.64, and we generated almost $190 million in cash flow from operations. We're continuing to drive leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering significant new technologies in cloud networking, and expanding the capabilities and footprint in our SaaS business. Trends that can be clearly seen in our results.
In the third quarter, revenue from new license sales was $194 million, up 28% from last year; license update revenue increased 7%; tech services increased 37%, led by consulting demand and support agreements; and finally, SaaS revenue was $110 million, up 20%. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, with revenue up 21% from last year including 26 individual deals greater than $1 million each with a metric that has more than doubled from a year ago. In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $137 million; and Japan and Pacific posted another strong quarter with combined revenue growth of 39%.
So overall, a very good quarter. So now, let's take a look at the Q3 results within our 3 main businesses. First, Desktop solutions grew 14% in total revenue from last year to $316 million, including product license growth of 24%. Year-to-date, this license revenue in this business is up 18% and is at the top of our 16% to 18% license growth target that we set for the full year. 
In Q3, sales of XenDesktop product were up more than 65% year-on-year, with about 20% of revenue coming through the trade-off program and the balance from new licenses. XenApp also increased last -- from last year as more customers are looking to application virtualization as a great way to deliver apps to tablets and other mobile devices.
There's also a few other metrics that I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing, as well as the strategic value the customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. In Q3, there were $22 million-plus deals for XenDesktop, easily a record, and representing customers from healthcare, retail, insurance, government, education and other verticals. In total, over 3,000 different customers purchased XenDesktop, including 174 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 24 deals for over 5,000 seats each.
Customers are looking at desktop transformation as a way to accelerate their business imperatives. For example, a large insurance company in Asia with over 20,000 employees buying XenDesktop and XenServer in order to provide flex working for employees, increasing productivity and maximizing real estate savings; or a major U.S. retailer the purchased over 20,000 desktop licenses as part of their critical business infrastructure necessary to deliver on a vision for the store in the future in over 1,800 locations across the country; or a U.S.-based healthcare provider that rolled out more than 5,000 seats of XenDesktop to securely deliver sensitive medical information to affiliate clinics over a wide area network; and using our FlexCast technology allowing them to support the full variety of use cases from doctors and nurses to office workers using PCs, laptops, XenClients and tablets, so increasingly having conversations with customers at this level as the conversation moves from technology to business enablement. 
We're providing them the tools to more efficiently transform their desktop infrastructure, including the brand-new solution announced yesterday through the pending acquisition of AppDNA. And this tool allows customers to quickly assess their application portfolio and implement a strategy to deliver desktops and applications as a service to all users in the enterprise.
Next, in our Datacenter and Cloud business. Total revenue was up more than 30% in the quarter with product license revenue increasing 32%. Growth here was again led by NetScaler with license revenue up 48% year-on-year, and the strength really coming from 3 big areas: First, continuing to see really strong traction, driving a cross-sell motion into our traditional enterprise account base with a number of new NetScaler customers up more than 50%. Second, the new NetScaler SDX platform, which started shipping in June is enabling customers to run numerous virtualized NetScaler instances with full multi-tenant support, giving service providers and other large enterprises significant economic benefits to consolidation. And finally, another big quarter from Internet-centric accounts as they're building out the infrastructure to support large retail and other cloud-based service offerings.
In the SaaS business, revenue was up 20% to $110 million. The growth continues to be led by our collaboration products, which were up 30%, and now account for over half of total SaaS revenue. 
Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand this business internationally are delivering good results. And in fact, in Q3, revenue from international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, up from just 10% a year ago. 
Also in Q4, through the acquisition of ShareFile, we'll begin offering customers a solution for cloud-based data storage, sharing and collaboration, making it easy for businesses of all sizes to securely store, sync and share business documents and files, both inside and outside of the company.
So turning to operations. In Q3, adjusted op margin was 26%, an increase of over 100 basis points from Q2. Our plan all year has been to invest slightly behind demand growth we're seeing in the market, so as bookings, pipeline and POCs have accelerated, we've continued to focus on really 2 main areas: First, which is about expanding our go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech support; and second, around product innovation, to bring the market new technologies as well as improving integration across our solutions in order to drive simplicity and a better end-user experience.
So in total, in the third quarter, we had over 400 new people at Citrix, with more than half of those coming into the sales and services organization. In total, headcount now stands at over 6,500 employees, which is an increase of 1,100 people compared to the same time last year.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments is now $1.5 billion, driven by nearly $190 million in cash flow from operations. During Q3, we repurchased just over 2.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $57, and we spent about $200 million on M&A and licensing activities. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $834 million, which is up 23% from last year. And the main drivers here being really 3 things: First is an increasing number of XenDesktop customers that are involved in the Subscription Advantage program; the number of customers that are initiating multi-year agreements; and tech services contracts for consulting maintenance and support.
So we continue to execute really well. We're seeing growth across all of our strategic businesses, and we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while at the same time expanding our go-to-market capacity. 
So given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth in our opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our revenue outlook for 2011. And just as a reminder, our guidance does include the impact of acquisitions that we've made to date.
So for the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.21 billion, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.45 to $2.46 a share. And for the fourth quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million, adjusted tax rate between 22% and 23%, and adjusted EPS of $0.75 to $0.76.
And with respect to 2012, our planning cycle is still in process, which is normal for early Q4. And at this point, we're comfortable with the current revenue expectations that are in the range of $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion. Our focus next year is going to be on helping customers accelerate desktop transformation, delivering the infrastructure to build both public and private clouds and expanding our customer reach through both direct touch and go-to-market partnerships. We'll update these expectations with more specifics on our fourth quarter earnings call. But ultimately, our confidence in the market position and our ability to drive long-term growth remains unchanged. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you a brief update on Synergy and all of the important announcements coming out this week. Mark?"

Despite the tough economic state of Europe overall, attendance is up over 40% from last year, and it feels like customer enthusiasm is up over 100%. 
Our long health mission and belief in creating a world where people can work and play from anywhere is really resonating. It's clear that in a highly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, this is how people and business will live better and work better. 
Yesterday, we unveiled enhanced technologies, future innovations and acquisitions that will power mobile workstyles and cloud services. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on a few of the important announcements we've made this week, putting them in  context of our markets, strategy and ambitions around growth.
First is empowering end users. Empowering them with increasingly mobile workstyles in their personal cloud. To continue to lead and innovate in this area, we demonstrated how our customers can create seamless access across people, data and apps on any device. Our recent acquisition of ShareFile was the centerpiece. A fast product that enables secure, professional and simple document sharing using any device, Windows and Mac, along with everything mobile from iOS to Android to Windows phone. 
Getting to your data from any device is critical to going mobile. Integrating data within collaboration tools is just as critical. So we announced Workspaces, a new feature for GoToMeeting that adds intuitively easy places to create, share and store leading content. With Workspaces, meetings can center around project teams and the content needed for productivity. 
Making data available to enterprise and mobile apps is also critical, so we announced the addition of Follow-Me-Data to Citrix Receiver, allowing IT professionals to give employees easy, secure access to business documents from any company-owned or personal device. These data center products and features are all built on the data cloud that's been the underlying infrastructure for ShareFile.
We announced this as our new Follow-Me-Data Fabric, an extensible platform for sharing business data across a wide range of apps, devices and cloud services. We think of it as iCloud for business. Our Follow-Me-Data Fabric powers our own personal cloud services, and we'll make it easy for third-party developers to incorporate data services like search, share, sync, secure and remote wipe through a set of open APIs, resulting in dynamic mesh ups of data sharing in new and existing apps, and making user data securely and easily accessed from millions of business and consumer devices.
The second area of focus yesterday was around transformation. Transformation of traditional data centers into more elastic and economical private clouds. Corralling, controlling and delivering a wide array of services to the personal cloud is creating greater need for a single point of service and control at the front door of the data center. To enable this, we demonstrated Citrix CloudGateway, the industry's first unified service broker that aggregates, controls and delivers Windows, Web, SaaS and mobile apps to any user on any device. CloudGateway empowers any users with self-service access to all their business apps and gives IT unmatched control, providing identity provisioning for authorized users, automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning, and remote wipe for data and apps on lost devices. It also includes a unified dashboard for service-level monitoring and license optimization among other things. CloudGateway is the connection and aggregation point for on-demand IT services, including Windows apps and desktops, where XenDesktop continues as the market leader. 
Our focus is to make virtualization at the desktop more powerful and pervasive by expanding our market reach, by lowering acquisition costs and by speeding adoption. A virtualization at the desktop is being deployed by customers of all sizes, with widely recognized ROI for virtual apps and virtual desktops, as David mentioned. We recently shipped new versions of both XenDesktop and XenApp with new features that address performance, management and simplicity, including the biggest set of enhancements to our industry-standard HDX technology in the entire history of Citrix. These releases will help customers drive even greater business agility, tighter security and wider availability across consumer and business end points. 
To reach the SMB and departmental customers more rapidly, we announced Citrix VDI-in-a-box, a simple, affordable all-in-one VDI solution. This was especially well received by our European partners who service these smaller customers. Over the past 2 years, we focused on reducing the cost of Desktop Virtualization as an enabler to wider-scale adoptions. This week, we showed how the first year capital cost of a Citrix XenDesktop rollout is now materially below that of physical desktops in many cases.
We're achieving this through our industry-only FlexCast delivery technology, along with the addition of storage, networking and management optimizations, leveraging the innovations of our partner ecosystems and Moore's Law for greater density of virtual apps and virtual desktops.
We also announced XenDesktop's new personal vDesk technology, built on the recent acquisition of RingCube that moves personal apps, preferences and data to a virtual disc. It reduces VDI storage by 65% in most cases, because only 1 image of a Windows VM is now required. Over the next 6 months, I think we'll be able to drive the upfront cost of virtual desktops below a physical desktop across the board, inspiring even broader adoption, which is our third area of focus. 
Customers are asking for services and innovations that will speed them to the value of virtual desktops. This week, we announced updates and enhancements to all our desktop transformation model services, with more self-service tools and partner services. We also announced the agreement to acquire AppDNA to simplify the migration of Windows and browser apps to the new world of Win 7 virtual desktops and consumer devices, something that's been a significant obstacle for many customers. This acquisition will give our customers the ability to analyze their application portfolio, to know what they're deployment options are, to quantify app remediation where needed and to auto package the apps for use with Microsoft Installer, Microsoft's App-V and Citrix XenApp.
The third area of focus for the conference has been around connecting, connecting to the growing array of public cloud services in the simplest way possible. NetScaler, having a great, great quarter, is becoming the top brand in cloud networking as you can see in our business trajectory; connecting people, devices, apps and data to cloud services. NetScaler VPX, MPX and SDX are the underlying service delivery fabric, leading the industry in the transition from app delivery to service delivery networking. 
We also announced enhancements to Cloud Bridge, securely connecting private clouds to the infinite capacity of public clouds at the back door of the data center. The enhancements include the industry's first infrastructure as a service cloud catalog. Leading cloud providers worldwide will be the precertified for supporting Cloud Bridge, giving enterprises a one-sided setup, choosing from a validated lit's of cloud data centers worldwide. It will be as simple as adding a new email account to your smartphone.
The last area of focus this week has been around building clouds, building new cloud services the way the world's most successful clouds are built. As the industry transitions from the PC era to the cloud era, the cloud services market is projected by IDC to exceed $55 billion by the end of 2014, comprised of thousands of providers of all sizes for business and productivity applications, gaming, collaboration services, managed desktops, data storage, business continuity services and infrastructure as a service. To date, more than 2,500 cloud providers around the world have chosen a combination of Citrix's CloudStack, CloudPortal, XenServer and NetScaler products as a key platform for building their cloud businesses, including 4 of the top 5 largest public clouds in production today. 
We demonstrated some of them at yesterday's keynote. The Synergy audience really responded to the live demo of CloudStack and CloudPortal, ZenServer and NetScaler customers like GoDaddy, Korea Telecom and IDC Frontier; and super-scale specialty clouds like Zynga's Z Cloud, all built on Citrix Cloud Infrastructure.
Under the covers, they were seeing CloudStack 3, CloudPortal Services Manager, CloudPortal Business Manager, XenServer 6 and NetScaler SPX, powering some amazing clouds from general purpose to special purpose. As more businesses shift to the cloud, our open solutions provide a powerful alternative that will challenge other vendors that are limited to providing proprietary and closed solutions.
So wrapping up. Clearly, we're building strong positions across SaaS, virtualization, networking and cloud markets. And the investments we've made over the past year in people, infrastructure and innovation and go-to-market is powering growth through geographical reach and business model diversity.
And now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Yes, as you pointed out, we had a terrific quarter for large deals, where it was 40, which is -- frankly, that's about double what we saw in most quarters a year ago. So a lot of movement in that direction, and it's certainly been a trend that we've seen over some period of time. If you recall last quarter, we're up to 26, which was clearly a record for a Q2. We're seeing a good mix across products. We have some of the largest deals coming out of NetScaler as well as XenDesktop and a surprising number of combined transactions. Those customers that are buying both the hardware and the software solution, as well as customers that are looking at both XenDesktop and XenApp stand-alone products as a component. I'd also add that contribution from SIs, as you know, one of our big focus areas over the course of the last couple of years, continues to move up. It's up about 65% year-on-year in Q3. And remember, that's a little bit lumpy because it is related to large deals. But still representing somewhere in the 15% of product bookings neighborhood, big contribution in Q3 from EDS, HP, IBM, Fujitsu and others. And I'd also add, we had a good geographic mix. We had about 10 of the large deals come from EMEA. And even though EMEA is our slowest-growing region, one that is clearly in the middle of working through a number of political and macroeconomic issues, customers are still stepping up for large strategic transactions. And it's just a lot of positive forces moving in that direction."

I think we're seeing good results coming out of all of our regions. And some of it is something the categories we're in, obviously, desktop transformation and networking. And these areas are high priorities for a lot of CIOs and driving high-wallet share and mind share. So that's certainly a positive. We've been executing for the last year under a set of expectations around continued market volatility in some areas, in particular EMEA. And so the -- and I call it the metrics that we apply and the lens that we look at pipeline has adjusted a bit to accommodate that. But frankly, heading into Q4, we've got a record level of pipeline. We've got a record opportunity for large deals, and the challenges always is just getting them closed. But we feel good about our market position right now."

We've had good success with customers, and they're looking at just expansion of capacity, replacement of legacy gear, a number of those factors, particularly in the Internet vertical. And then, the new products. We've got virtual instances of VPX for all of our major hardware products that are contributing incremental opportunities for us. We are looking at the SDX platform. The new high-end platform really targeted towards some of the largest cloud service providers and large enterprises as a way to drive incredible economics through combining virtual instances of NetScaler technology.

It's still a fantastic cost-effective way to deliver apps and desktops, whether that is on a project basis, or remote location or even enterprise-wide. And frankly, it's probably the cheapest way to deliver virtual desktops of all the options that are out there. But I think one of the things that's really driving activity is the broad trends around mobile right now. And so customers are looking at an app-centric world and delivering applications to iPads, tablets, et cetera, and it's a perfect tool to be able to do that. And so we're looking at -- we're seeing customers purchasing what makes sense for their own infrastructure, what makes sense for the projects that they're looking to initiate. So as I mentioned earlier, a pretty good mix of the largest deals for both XenApp and XenDesktop. So I think that's what you should expect going forward. Right now, the mix is somewhere 50-50 in the Desktop solutions business, and it will move around that over time."

That includes technical support revenue, consulting, education and maintenance. The big driver, frankly, the largest year-on-year growth rate was around consulting, and this is the demand we're seeing from customers that are either looking at desktop transformation in kind of earlier stages or they're in the process of architecting and deploying XenApp -- XenDesktop on a more broad basis. That's a people business, so our ability to grow that revenue is somewhat linked to our ability to hire and bring new people on board.

In the third quarter, revenue from new license sales was $194 million, up 28% from last year; license update revenue increased 7%; tech services increased 37%, led by consulting demand and support agreements; and finally, SaaS revenue was $110 million, up 20%. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas region continues to execute really well, with revenue up 21% from last year including 26 individual deals greater than $1 million each with a metric that has more than doubled from a year ago. In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $137 million; and Japan and Pacific posted another strong quarter with combined revenue growth of 39%.
So overall, a very good quarter. So now, let's take a look at the Q3 results within our 3 main businesses. First, Desktop Solutions grew 14% in total revenue from last year to $316 million, including product license growth of 24%. Year-to-date, this license revenue in this business is up 18% and is at the top of our 16% to 18% license growth target that we set for the full year. 
In Q3, sales of XenDesktop product were up more than 65% year-on-year, with about 20% of revenue coming through the trade-off program and the balance from new licenses. XenApp also increased last -- from last year as more customers are looking to application virtualization as a great way to deliver apps to tablets and other mobile devices.
There's also a few other metrics that I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing, as well as the strategic value the customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure. In Q3, there were 22 $1 million-plus deals for XenDesktop, easily a record, and representing customers from healthcare, retail, insurance, government, education and other verticals. In total, over 3,000 different customers purchased XenDesktop, including 174 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each and 24 deals for over 5,000 seats each.
Customers are looking at desktop transformation as a way to accelerate their business imperatives. For example, a large insurance company in Asia with over 20,000 employees buying XenDesktop and XenServer in order to provide flex working for employees, increasing productivity and maximizing real estate savings; or a major U.S. retailer that purchased over 20,000 desktop licenses as part of their critical business infrastructure necessary to deliver on a vision for the store of the future in over 1,800 locations across the country; or a U.S.-based healthcare provider that rolled out more than 5,000 seats of XenDesktop to securely deliver sensitive medical information to affiliate clinics over a wide area network; and using our FlexCast technology allowing them to support the full variety of use cases from doctors and nurses to office workers using PCs, laptops, XenClients and tablets, so increasingly having conversations with customers at this level as the conversation moves from technology to business enablement. 
We're providing them the tools to more efficiently transform their desktop infrastructure, including a brand-new solution announced yesterday through the pending acquisition of App-DNA. And this tool allows customers to quickly assess their application portfolio and implement a strategy to deliver desktops and applications as a service to all users in the enterprise.
Next, in our Datacenter and Cloud business. Total revenue was up more than 30% in the quarter with product license revenue increasing 32%. Growth here was again led by NetScaler with license revenue up 48% year-on-year, and the strength really coming from 3 big areas: First, continuing to see really strong traction, driving a cross-sell motion into our traditional enterprise account base with a number of new NetScaler customers up more than 50%. Second, the new NetScaler SDX platform, which started shipping in June is enabling customers to run numerous virtualized NetScaler instances with full multi-tenant support, giving service providers and other large enterprises significant economic benefits to consolidation. And finally, another big quarter from Internet-centric accounts as they're building out the infrastructure to support large retail and other cloud-based service offerings.
In the SaaS business, revenue was up 20% to $110 million. The growth continues to be led by our collaboration products, which were up 30%, and now account for over half of total SaaS revenue. 
Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand this business internationally are delivering good results. And in fact, in Q3, revenue from international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, up from just 10% a year ago. 
Also in Q4, through the acquisition of ShareFile, we'll begin offering customers a solution for cloud-based data storage, sharing and collaboration, making it easy for businesses of all sizes to securely store, sync and share business documents and files, both inside and outside of the company.
So turning to operations. In Q3, adjusted op margin was 26%, an increase of over 100 basis points from Q2. Our plan all year has been to invest slightly behind demand growth we're seeing in the market, so as bookings, pipeline and POCs have accelerated, we've continued to focus on really 2 main areas: First, which is about expanding our go-to-market reach and customer touch through enterprise account managers, strategic partnerships, consulting and tech support; and second, around product innovation, to bring the market new technologies as well as improving integration across our solutions in order to drive simplicity and a better end-user experience.
So in total, in the third quarter, we had over 400 new people at Citrix, with more than half of those coming into the sales and services organization. In total, headcount now stands at over 6,500 employees, which is an increase of 1,100 people compared to the same time last year.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments is now $1.5 billion, driven by nearly $190 million in cash flow from operations. During Q3, we repurchased just over 2.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $57, and we spent about $200 million on M&A and licensing activities. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $834 million, which is up 23% from last year. And the main drivers here being really 3 things: First is an increasing number of XenDesktop customers that are involved in the Subscription Advantage program; the number of customers that are initiating multi-year agreements; and tech services contracts for consulting maintenance and support.
So we continue to execute really well. We're seeing growth across all of our strategic businesses, and we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in critical markets while at the same time expanding our go-to-market capacity. 
So given the strength that we're seeing across several facets of the business and the growth in our opportunity pipeline, we're increasing our revenue outlook for 2011. And just as a reminder, our guidance does include the impact of acquisitions that we've made to date.
So for the full year, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.21 billion, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.45 to $2.46 a share. And for the fourth quarter of 2011, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million, adjusted tax rate between 22% and 23%, and adjusted EPS of $0.75 to $0.76.
And with respect to 2012, our planning cycle is still in process, which is normal for early Q4. And at this point, we're comfortable with the current revenue expectations that are in the range of $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion. Our focus next year is going to be on helping customers accelerate desktop transformation, delivering the infrastructure to build both public and private clouds and expanding our customer reach through both direct touch and go-to-market partnerships. We'll update these expectations with more specifics on our fourth quarter earnings call. But ultimately, our confidence in the market position and our ability to drive long-term growth remains unchanged. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you a brief update on Synergy and all of the important announcements coming out this week. Mark?"

I'm really delighted and proud of our Q3 performance across geographies, business lines and financials. As David mentioned, we're in Barcelona this week with business partners and customers attending our second European version of Synergy. Despite the tough economic state of Europe overall, attendance is up over 40% from last year, and it feels like customer enthusiasm is up over 100%. 
Our long health mission and belief in creating a world where people can work and play from anywhere is really resonating. It's clear that in a highly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, this is how people and business will live better and work better. 
Yesterday, we unveiled enhanced technologies, future innovations and acquisitions that will power mobile workstyles and cloud services. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on a few of the important announcements we've made this week, putting them in  context of our markets, strategy and ambitions around growth.
First is empowering end users. Empowering them with increasingly mobile workstyles in their personal cloud. To continue to lead and innovate in this area, we demonstrated how our customers can create seamless access across people, data and apps on any device. Our recent acquisition of ShareFile was the centerpiece. A fast product that enables secure, professional and simple document sharing using any device, Windows and Mac, along with everything mobile from iOS to Android to Windows phone. 
Getting to your data from any device is critical to going mobile. Integrating data within collaboration tools is just as critical. So we announced Workspaces, a new feature for GoToMeeting that adds intuitively easy places to create, share and store leading content. With Workspaces, meetings can center around project teams and the content needed for productivity. 
Making data available to enterprise and mobile apps is also critical, so we announced the addition of Follow-Me-Data to Citrix Receiver, allowing IT professionals to give employees easy, secure access to business documents from any company-owned or personal device. These data center products and features are all built on the data cloud that's been the underlying infrastructure for ShareFile.
We announced this as our new Follow-Me-Data Fabric, an extensible platform for sharing business data across a wide range of apps, devices and cloud services. We think of it as iCloud for business. Our Follow-Me-Data Fabric powers our own personal cloud services, and we'll make it easy for third-party developers to incorporate data services like search, share, sync, secure and remote wipe through a set of open APIs, resulting in dynamic mesh ups of data sharing in new and existing apps, and making user data securely and easily accessed from millions of business and consumer devices.
The second area of focus yesterday was around transformation. Transformation of traditional data centers into more elastic and economical private clouds. Corralling, controlling and delivering a wide array of services to the personal cloud is creating greater need for a single point of service and control at the front door of the data center. To enable this, we demonstrated Citrix CloudGateway, the industry's first unified service broker that aggregates, controls and delivers Windows, Web, SaaS and mobile apps to any user on any device. CloudGateway empowers any users with self-service access to all their business apps and gives IT unmatched control, providing identity provisioning for authorized users, automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning, and remote wipe for data and apps on lost devices. It also includes a unified dashboard for service-level monitoring and license optimization among other things. CloudGateway is the connection and aggregation point for on-demand IT services, including Windows apps and desktops, where XenDesktop continues as the market leader. 
Our focus is to make virtualization at the desktop more powerful and pervasive by expanding our market reach, by lowering acquisition costs and by speeding adoption. A virtualization at the desktop is being deployed by customers of all sizes, with widely recognized ROI for virtual apps and virtual desktops, as David mentioned. We recently shipped new versions of both XenDesktop and XenApp with new features that address performance, management and simplicity, including the biggest set of enhancements to our industry-standard HDX technology in the entire history of Citrix. These releases will help customers drive even greater business agility, tighter security and wider availability across consumer and business end points. 
To reach the SMB and departmental customers more rapidly, we announced Citrix VDI-in-a-box, a simple, affordable all-in-one VDI solution. This was especially well received by our European partners who service these smaller customers. Over the past 2 years, we focused on reducing the cost of Desktop Virtualization as an enabler to wider-scale adoptions. This week, we showed how the first year capital cost of a Citrix XenDesktop rollout is now materially below that of physical desktops in many cases.
We're achieving this through our industry-only FlexCast delivery technology, along with the addition of storage, networking and management optimizations, leveraging the innovations of our partner ecosystems and Moore's Law for greater density of virtual apps and virtual desktops.
We also announced XenDesktop's new personal vDisk technology, built on the recent acquisition of RingCube that moves personal apps, preferences and data to a virtual disc. It reduces VDI storage by 65% in most cases, because only 1 image of a Windows VM is now required. Over the next 6 months, I think we'll be able to drive the upfront cost of virtual desktops below a physical desktop across the board, inspiring even broader adoption, which is our third area of focus. 
Customers are asking for services and innovations that will speed them to the value of virtual desktops. This week, we announced updates and enhancements to all our desktop transformation model services, with more self-service tools and partner services. We also announced the agreement to acquire App-DNA to simplify the migration of Windows and browser apps to the new world of Win 7, virtual desktops and consumer devices, something that's been a significant obstacle for many customers. This acquisition will give our customers the ability to analyze their application portfolio, to know what their deployment options are, to quantify app remediation where needed and to auto package the apps for use with Microsoft Installer, Microsoft's App-V and Citrix XenApp.
The third area of focus for the conference has been around connecting, connecting to the growing array of public cloud services in the simplest way possible. NetScaler, having a great, great quarter, is becoming the top brand in cloud networking as you can see in our business trajectory; connecting people, devices, apps and data to cloud services. NetScaler VPX, MPX and SDX are the underlying service delivery fabric, leading the industry in the transition from app delivery to service delivery networking. 
We also announced enhancements to Cloud Bridge, securely connecting private clouds to the infinite capacity of public clouds at the back door of the data center. The enhancements include the industry's first infrastructure as a service cloud catalog. Leading cloud providers worldwide will be the precertified for supporting Cloud Bridge, giving enterprises a one-sided setup, choosing from a validated list of cloud data centers worldwide. It will be as simple as adding a new email account to your smartphone.
The last area of focus this week has been around building clouds, building new cloud services the way the world's most successful clouds are built. As the industry transitions from the PC era to the cloud era, the cloud services market is projected by IDC to exceed $55 billion by the end of 2014, comprised of thousands of providers of all sizes for business and productivity applications, gaming, collaboration services, managed desktops, data storage, business continuity services and infrastructure as a service. To date, more than 2,500 cloud providers around the world have chosen a combination of Citrix CloudStack, CloudPortal, XenServer and NetScaler products as a key platform for building their cloud businesses, including 4 of the top 5 largest public clouds in production today. 
We demonstrated some of them at yesterday's keynote. The Synergy audience really responded to the live demo of CloudStack and CloudPortal, ZenServer and NetScaler customers like GoDaddy, Korea Telecom and IDC Frontier; and super-scale specialty clouds like Zynga's Z Cloud, all built on Citrix Cloud Infrastructure.
Under the covers, they were seeing CloudStack 3, CloudPortal Services Manager, CloudPortal Business Manager, XenServer 6 and NetScaler SDX, powering some amazing clouds from general purpose to special purpose. As more businesses shift to the cloud, our open solutions provide a powerful alternative that will challenge other vendors that are limited to providing proprietary and closed solutions.
So wrapping up. Clearly, we're building strong positions across SaaS, virtualization, networking and cloud markets. And the investments we've made over the past year in people, infrastructure and innovation and go-to-market is powering growth through geographical reach and business model diversity.
And now, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Yes, as you pointed out, we had a terrific quarter for large deals, where it was 40, which is -- frankly, that's about double what we saw in most quarters a year ago. So a lot of movement in that direction, and it's certainly been a trend that we've seen over some period of time. If you recall last quarter, we're up to 26, which was clearly a record for a Q2. We're seeing a good mix across products. We have some of the largest deals coming out of NetScaler as well as XenDesktop and a surprising number of combined transactions. Those customers that are buying both the hardware and the software solution, as well as customers that are looking at both XenDesktop and XenApp stand-alone products as a component. I'd also add that contribution from SIs, as you know, one of our big focus areas over the course of the last couple of years, continues to move up. It's up about 65% year-on-year in Q3. And remember, that's a little bit lumpy because it is related to large deals. But still representing somewhere in the 15% of product bookings neighborhood, big contribution in Q3 from EDS, HP, IBM, Fujitsu and others. And I'd also add, we had a good geographic mix. We had about 10 of the large deals come from EMEA. And even though EMEA is our slowest-growing region, one that is clearly in the middle of working through a number of political and macroeconomic issues, customers are still stepping up for large strategic transactions. And it's just a lot of positive forces moving in that direction."

I think we're seeing good results coming out of all of our regions. And some of it is something the categories we're in, obviously, desktop transformation and networking. And these areas are high priorities for a lot of CIOs and driving high-wallet share and mind share. So that's certainly a positive. We've been executing for the last year under a set of expectations around continued market volatility in some areas, in particular EMEA. And so the -- and I call it the metrics that we apply and the lens that we look at pipeline has adjusted a bit to accommodate that. But frankly, heading into Q4, we've got a record level of pipeline. We've got a record opportunity for large deals, and the challenges always is just getting them closed. But we feel good about our market position right now."

And then, the new products. We've got virtual instances of VPX for all of our major hardware products that are contributing incremental opportunities for us. We are looking at the SDX platform. The new high-end platform really targeted towards some of the largest cloud service providers and large enterprises as a way to drive incredible economics through combining virtual instances of NetScaler technology.

I mean, remember, when we talk about the Desktop Solutions business, we always talk about XenApp and XenDesktop together, because frankly, that's the way customers look at it. That's the way we sell it on a go-to-market basis. But XenApp is a stand-alone product. It's still a fantastic cost-effective way to deliver apps and desktops, whether that is on a project basis, or remote location or even enterprise-wide. And frankly, it's probably the cheapest way to deliver virtual desktops of all the options that are out there. But I think one of the things that's really driving activity is the broad trends around mobile right now. And so customers are looking at an app-centric world and delivering applications to iPads, tablets, et cetera, and it's a perfect tool to be able to do that. And so we're looking at -- we're seeing customers purchasing what makes sense for their own infrastructure, what makes sense for the projects that they're looking to initiate. So as I mentioned earlier, a pretty good mix of the largest deals for both XenApp and XenDesktop. So I think that's what you should expect going forward. Right now, the mix is somewhere 50-50 in the Desktop Solutions business, and it will move around that over time."

The big driver, frankly, the largest year-on-year growth rate was around consulting, and this is the demand we're seeing from customers that are either looking at desktop transformation in kind of earlier stages or they're in the process of architecting and deploying XenApp, XenDesktop on a more broad basis.

So more specifics on targeted growth rates after Q4, but in a broad strokes, that's how I would think about it."

And then, on the other side of the formula would be innovations and introductions of improvements, enhancements, new products, et cetera. And we have a great pipeline and line up there as well, including the beginnings of some really great impact from the acquisitions we've made in the second half in this particular space, whether it's the personal vDisk technology or it's the AppTitude technology that we just announced, the acquisition of -- the integration of Follow-Me-Data, which will have a material impact on the value and capabilities of virtual apps and desktops and mobility. So I think, we'll see that start to gain some traction as we push into the first half of the year. So we're optimistic and confident."
