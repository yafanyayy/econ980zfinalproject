Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information related to this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
In the Appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income by quarter for 2009 and 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, first quarter and full year 2011 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful. Moving to Slide 3, our fourth quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $780 million was a 241% increase over the fourth quarter 2009 and 10% higher than the third quarter 2010. Slide 4 shows key drivers to the fourth quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted net income. Earnings before tax for all four segments were lower to the decrease was offset by lower taxes which resulted from a shift within the quarter toward greater domestic versus foreign income along with normal year true-ups.
The quarter-to-quarter different syntaxes was also impacted by the essence of current currency fluctuation in current quarter. The overall income tax for 2010 was 50%. Within our previously provided guidance of 49% to 54%. For 2011, we expect the rates between 54% and 59%. And please remember, the overall rate is highly sensitive to the mix of income and can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As shown on Slide 5, our adjusted net income more than doubled year-over-year going from $1.2 billion in 2009 to almost $2.6 billion in 2010. Slide 6 shows the key drivers to the year-over-year increase in adjusted net income including significantly better earnings in both our E&P and industry businesses, partially offset by higher income taxes and lower earnings in our Oil Sands Mining segment. As shown on Slide 7, E&P segment income was slightly lower for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2010. Higher realizations and sales volumes were largely offset by higher domestic DD&A associated primarily with the Droshky field and higher exploration expenses.
Average E&P realizations and market indicators are shown on Slide 8. Quarter-over-quarter, our average E&P realizations per BOE increased $6. While NYMEX prompt WTI increased $9/BBL per barrel and the bid week natural gas price decreased $0.58 per MMBTu.
Slide 9 shows our E&P production volumes, productions sold increased 5% in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter 2010 as compared to the third quarter were result of a smaller underlifted in the fourth quarter. We ended the year approximately 3.4 million BOE underlifted. The makeup of this underlifted was 2.1 million BOE in the last to the gas storage and underlifted in Europe of about 700,000 BOE in both EG and Libya being underlifted approximately 300,000 BOE.
Fourth quarter 2010 production available for sale increased 3% from the third quarter 2010 and 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. These increases were primarily a result of a full quarter of Droshky production.
Turning to Slide 10, compared to the prior quarter, fourth quarter E&P earnings per BOE decrease $12.95 primarily a result of the higher exploration expenses largely attributable to unsuccessful exploration wells in Indonesia and Norway. Higher DD&A per Droshky and higher field level controllable costs and other expenses. This negatives were partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Total operating costs per BOE increased from $24.47 to $33.34 quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 11 shows the trend by quarter over the last three years for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses per BOE per day increase in exploration expense per BOE is attributable to the aforementioned dried well. The increase in field level controllable cost per BOE is largely a result of work over costs in the Gulf of Mexico, timing of international lifting and year end accruals from outside operator properties which added $0.66 per BOE to the fourth quarter results.
Turning to Slide 12 in Oil Sands Mining, fourth quarter segment income was $9 million which reflects both positive price and volume variances over the third quarter offset by onetime startup in ongoing costs at the Jackpine Mine, an increase blend stock volume and costs. Net synthetic crude sales for the quarter increased 38,000 barrels per day as production continue to ramp up at the Jackpine Mine.
We'll now move to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call over to Dave Roberts to discuss 2010 upstream highlights."

Despite significant challenges in 2010, the upstream business continued on the path to create sustainable profitable growth options for the company. As noted in our release this morning, we have expanded our presence in unconventional resource plays both in the United States and internationally with a strong preference for liquids-rich opportunities.
Our Bakken position now stands almost 400,000 acres. Production continues to grow and our targeted peak of over 22,000 barrels per day is in view. We have six rigs in continuous drilling operations and one rig plan to handle completions across our assets. We have also hold 86,000 acres in the Anadarko Woodford area, an area where we have operated for decades and we have line site for new opportunities to increase that position to over 100,000 acres. Importantly we will have eight rigs in the play by 2011 by the end of this year.
We've also entered two new unconventional plays in the Lower 48 and believe there are further opportunities we can access. We have an option on 75,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas and will likely expand that position further in 2011. And we built the position of over 172,000 acres in the Niobrara Play across the DJ Basin. Again, importantly we'll be drilling wells in both these plays in 2011 for two and one rig programs, respectively to begin with and a capability to expand this condition is warranted.
Internationally, we built our position in Poland to over 2 million acres and will drill in 2011 to begin testing this play. And in Canada, we started the evaluation drilling program over the winter to test our 100% owned in situ asset of Birchwood. As we remain committed to impact exploration opportunities, we took a position in four blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq moving from early-stage discussions to completion and less than three months. We are currently engaged in drilling and testing operations on two of the blocks and will be progressing operating activity on to 100% block throughout this year.
A key driver for 2011 performance began to debut in 2010 at the Jackpine Mine commenced start-up in the third quarter. The upgrader for the project is currently in start-up phase so we will soon see the full benefit of our first expansion at the Athabasca project.
We also had continued successful exploration in Libya with seven new discoveries.
As we look forward to a potentially different future as an upstream enterprise, we are focused on two things that will make us successful in the future. The first is disciplined investment leading to sustained reserve and production growth. In 2010, we replaced organic E&P basis, 95% of our reserves offsetting it significant impact to the negative in the Gulf of Mexico. Importantly showing our focus and discipline towards liquid-based activities, we replaced 109% of our liquid hydrocarbon production, with 72% on gas replacement as we focused on value with our capital dollars. Our strong healthy production base gives us tremendous flexibility in this regard.
Finally, our operational reliability continues to improve at Marathon. We executed several major turnaround flawlessly in 2010 and we had overall 94% of operational reliability across our operated assets. High reliability yields are most cost-effective and valuable barrel. All in, 2010 was a solid year for us. We have a lot more to do, that's for certain. We are building our reliability to our base portfolio and adding significant growth options in both unconventional and impact areas, all creating a sustainable growth platform for the future.
I'll turn the call back over to Howard."

Moving to our results in Slide 14, RM&T fourth quarter 2010 segment profit totaled $213 million compared to an $18 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the downstream business, I will compare our fourth quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009.
Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS during the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the corresponding quarter last year. As shown on Slide 15, the primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the increase in the sweet sour differential of approximately $2.25 per barrel. And an increase in the percentage of our sour crude processed through our refinery of approximately 15%. In addition, the futures market was in contango, $1.20 per barrel on average in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $0.71 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2009, which also reduced our actual crude cost compared to the LLS price used in the crack spread calculation.
While we completed the sale of our St. Paul Park refinery December 1, 2010, we still increased our total throughputs about 200,000 barrels per day or approximately 20% over the same quarter last year. Primarily because the Garyville  major expansion project was online in the entire fourth quarter 2010. In addition, some other work we recently completed in our refineries to improve their efficiency of our crack  [ph] units also improved results over fourth quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive improvements compared to the corresponding quarter last year, manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the fourth quarter 2010 primarily because of higher maintenance and other manufacturing costs.
Speedway SuperAmerica is refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $16 million higher in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the fourth quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and diesel margins which increased from $0.10 per gallon in the fourth quarter 2009 to $0.14 per gallon in the fourth quarter 2010. As essays, same-store merchandise sales increase approximate 4% while same-store gasoline volumes increased 1% order to quarter.
Slide 15 provides historical performance indicators for the downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6321 crack spreads. We'll now move to Slide 16 and I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger to our review of 2010 downstream highlights."

We completed the integration of what is essentially the first new refinery in the U.S. in over 30 years. The Garyville Major Expansion has exceeded our expectations by outperforming the design specifications. In addition, the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project approach the halfway mark on schedule and on budget and we have accomplished outstanding safety records along the way.
Our Speedway and brand marketing components managed to continue to excel and basically flat growth market. Now let me give you a little more color on the highlights that I just mentioned.
First of all, the Garyville Major Expansion project has been operating for almost a year and we are very pleased with the performance and additional value generated in the new plant. Most processed units are outperforming their design criteria and we have raised their rate of capacity to 464,000 barrels per day or, an increase of 208,000 barrels per day.
The new [ph] constructed as part of the project increases or takeaway capacity by approximately the 40%. This ducking conjunction with additional barrel at have produced has opened world sales markets and we began exporting distillate and gasoline since last spring to markets in Europe and South and Latin America.
Our diesel project remains on schedule for start-up in the second half of 2012. 25% of the construction is complete and we plan a very robust construction season here in 2011. And then we will complete the project in the second half of 2012.
Now turning to our marketing components, Speedway had one of the best years ever and they were voted for the second straight year as best gasoline brand in the U.S. Same-store life product volume was up 3.7% for the year and 1.7% for the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Speedway team increased same-store merchandise sales by 4.4% for the year and 3.8% for the quarter.
Turning to our Marathon brand organization, we realized an incremental sales increase of approximately 10% again in essentially a flat growth market. Our brand organization security significant agreement with the Pantry to sell a very large portion of our new transportation fuels from our Garyville project into the Southeast market and this is a long-term agreement.
And with that, I will turn it back to Howard Thill."

While asset disposals generated proceeds of over $2.1 billion. For 2010 year end cash balance was approximately $4 billion.
Slide 18 provides a summary of the select financial data. At the end of the fourth quarter 2010, our cash and net debt-to-total capital ratio was 14%, a decrease of seven percentage points from the third quarter and a reminder, this debt includes approximately $198 million which is serviced by U.S. steel and this debt is expected to be removed from our balance sheet by the end of this year.

Let me begin with the overriding corporate priority which is to affect the successful spin of our downstream assets effective June 30. And suffice it to say the financing and transaction transition activities are progressing quite well. I think on the upstream David has already talked quite a bit, about the overall objectives there. I would point out of course the increase in rigs and our liquids-rich resource plays from eight to 17. On the downstream Gary has talked about the major priorities there as well and with respect to the cash side, let we address our question upfront that I know you will all want to focus on and that is one of the priorities for the free cash that we will have.
First of all we want to ensure that both companies has spin for a very strong balance sheet such our highest priority for cash. Secondly, as we've said before, we will want to fund profitable growth within the businesses. And again, as we have reflected earlier, an obvious priority in our upstream business is to increase our positions in the liquids-rich resource plays primarily in North America but internationally as well. Dividends, secondly, is always a very high priority for us. But as we see it today, the dividend yield on both of the companies has been very competitive relative to their peers. And lastly, stock buybacks continue to be a consideration and an option for us with respect to free cash flow.
So with that, Howard, back to you."

I think one of the things that we've consistently done is we alter our completion technique based on where we are in the play because as we all know, it's a very big play and the reservoir is not ubiquitous and so you have to change as the conditions warrant. And so I think there is some of areas that we are moving into right now, where we are actually pumping higher stages in the 15 to 20 states range. But I don't think that signal necessarily a shift to us going to that. We basically let the wells in the reservoir tells us what it is that we're going to need to do there. As far as that goes. Droshky question, Q4, we had a 31,000 barrels per day average that exit rate for the year is right at 28,000. We still expect this year to average between 15,000 and 17,000 barrels per day depending on what kind of hurricane seasons we have. So still a very substantial decline but still very strong rate at the present time. With respect to the question in the Woodford, I think what we're saying is that our growth in the Bakken and the Woodford play in particular, where we will see some pretty strong response to offset a lot of the declines that we'll see as we transition to some of our activities in Norway. And while about our program there, we are going to Europe to have the rigs running. We probably got on the order of 12 to 20 some odd wells drilled with that portfolio depending on when the rigs are ultimately delivered. We do expect very strong activity from outside operated activities and I think we estimate on the order of 30 to 50 potential wells. The only thing I would caution here is our working interest on the call upside is essentially 60% on average on the OBO basis is about 15%. So most of the activity the tribes our production is going to come from the stuff that we do."

I think it remains to be seen possibly later this year where the State Department on down on the new pipeline into the Gulf Coast. We had a lot of transportation system so I am not to all the details. But when you look at incremental Canadian company coming down and then you look at the old incremental Bakken crude's and the gap is pretty wide on when you look at production forecast on Bakken. There's immune trains are taking some crude into different markets. But I see a lot of that crude landing in the Patoka Wood River arena and as you said earlier, we are very advantaged with our logistics system in and around the market that we can take advantage and get that into our system. Here again, with Detroit coming on stream and in 2012 and having the infrastructure, we are having some infrastructure built or modified in order to be able to get some additional Canadian heavy into that stream. I think we're going to be very, very well-positioned. But I still believe it's probably latter part of the decade at the earliest until you see a system actually built in functioning to get heavy crudes into the Gulf Coast. Yes, we do both some barrels down to Garyville from time-to-time depending on the differentials.

Back to the first part of the question, when you look at LLS and Mars, and yes, absolutely it's very expensive crude versus WTI. But WTI is not a very big market to begin with. And everyday when you look at those crudes that are available that you run, certainly base on your infrastructure, you're going to fill up all the WTI reference type crudes first, Canadian referenced type crudes that your infrastructure will allow. But to be very honest, and then you're left with LLS, Mars and some foreign cargoes and you're constantly looking at the yields and looking at the alternative price. What the industry can do, I really believe that you are going to continue this dislocation, somewhat or version if you want to call it like I had answered earlier, until you get some more takeaway capacity in place because certainly as Dave has mentioned from the upstream side, those crudes are kind of continue to be developed and produced as well as new production coming on in Canada.

I think we ought to distinguish between that. We don't count in their the acreage we got in Marcellus or Haynesville or others. Our focus is specific to the liquids-rich resource plays and certainly the four that Dave has talked about here today. So I think when you look at that competitive comparison as we sit today, we are actually in pretty good shape relative to our E&P universe and indeed we've already increased beyond what we showed from that time. And as Dave said, we continue to increase that. We certainly are and I think as I referred to when I talk about uses of cash, we certainly are looking at other opportunities that would give us an opportunity to affect the step change in our position in some of the key plays. But again, I think it's important to look at where we are and where we are going with respect to the liquids-rich resource plays at this stage. We will maintain the future optionality on our gas-rich plays but we have no intent of pursuing those or spending much money on it at this time."

Again, we are not going to chase natural gas. We're in a fortunate position that where we have our best resource for the most part, it has helped production. We can wait until we see better prices and better economics before beginning to invest in that.

Slide 2 contains the forward-looking statement and other information related to this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms, 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
In the Appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of: net income to adjusted net income, by quarter, for 2009 and 2010; preliminary balance sheet information; first quarter and full year 2011 operating estimates; and other data that you may find useful. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $780 million was a 241% increase over the fourth quarter 2009 and 10% higher than the third quarter 2010. Slide 4 shows key drivers to the fourth quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted net income. 
Earnings before tax for all four segments were lower but the decrease was offset by lower taxes, which resulted from a shift within the quarter toward greater domestic versus foreign income along with normal year-end true-ups. The quarter-to-quarter difference in taxes was also impacted by the absence of currency fluctuations in prior quarters. The overall income tax for 2010 was 50%, within our previously provided guidance of 49% to 54%. For 2011, we expect the rates between 54% and 59%. And please remember, the overall rate is highly sensitive to the mix of income and can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As shown on Slide 5, our adjusted net income more than doubled year-over-year going from $1.2 billion in 2009 to almost $2.6 billion in 2010. Slide 6 shows the key drivers to this year-over-year increase in adjusted net income, including significantly better earnings in both our E&P [Exploration and Production] and Downstream businesses, partially offset by higher income taxes and lower earnings in our Oil Sands Mining [OSM] segment. 
As shown on Slide 7, E&P segment income was slightly lower for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2010. Higher realizations and sales volumes were largely offset by higher domestic DD&A associated primarily with the Droshky field and higher exploration expenses. 
Average E&P realizations and market indicators are shown on Slide 8. Quarter-over-quarter, our average E&P realization per BOE [barrels of oil equivalent] increased $6, while NYMEX prompt WTI [West Texas Intermediate] increased $9 per barrel and the bid week natural gas price decreased $0.58 per MMBTU [Million Metric British Thermal Units].
Slide 9 shows our E&P production volumes. Production sold increased 5% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter 2010 as compared to the third quarter were a result of a smaller underlift in the fourth quarter. We ended the year approximately 3.4 million BOE underlifted. The makeup of this underlift was 2.1 million BOE in Alaska gas storage and underlift in Europe of about 700,000 BOE in both EG [Equatorial Guinea] and Libya being underlifted by approximately 300,000 BOE. Fourth quarter 2010 production available for sale increased 3% from the third quarter 2010 and 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. These increases were primarily a result of a full quarter of Droshky production.
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to the prior quarter, fourth quarter E&P earnings per BOE decreased $12.95, primarily a result of the higher exploration expenses largely attributable to unsuccessful exploration wells in Indonesia and Norway, higher DD&A from Droshky and higher field level controllable costs and other expenses. These negatives were partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Total operating costs per BOE increased from $24.47 to $33.34 quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 11 shows the trend, by quarter, over the last three years for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses per BOE. The increase in exploration expense per BOE is attributable to the aforementioned dry wells. The increase in field level controllable cost per BOE is largely a result of work-over costs in the Gulf of Mexico, timing of international listings and year-end accruals from outside operator properties, which added $0.66 per BOE to the fourth quarter results.
Turning to Slide 12. In Oil Sands Mining, fourth quarter segment income was $9 million, which reflects both positive price and volume variances over the third quarter, offset by onetime start-up and ongoing costs at the Jackpine Mine, an increase blend stock volumes and costs. Net synthetic crude sales for the quarter increased 38,000 barrels per day as production continue to ramp up at the Jackpine Mine.
We'll now move to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call over to Dave Roberts to discuss 2010 Upstream highlights."

As noted in our release this morning, we have expanded our presence in unconventional reso",601,"Thanks, Howard. Despite significant challenges in 2010, the Upstream business continued on the path to create sustainable profitable growth options for the company. As noted in our release this morning, we have expanded our presence in unconventional resource plays, both in the United States and internationally, with a strong preference for liquids-rich opportunities. 
Our Bakken position now stands almost 400,000 acres. Production continues to grow, and our targeted peak of over 22,000 barrels per day is in view. We have six rigs in continuous drilling operations and one rig planned to handle completions across our assets. Marathon also holds 86,000 acres in the Anadarko Woodford area, an area where we have operated for decades, and we have line in sight on new opportunity to increase that position to over 100,000 acres shortly. Importantly, we will have eight rigs in the play by 2011 by the end of this year.
We've also entered two new unconventional plays in the Lower 48 and believe there are further opportunities we can access. We have an option on 75,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas and we'll likely expand that position further in 2011. And we built a position of over 170,000 acres in the Niobrara play across the DJ Basin. Again, importantly, we'll be drilling wells in both these plays in 2011 for two- and one-rig programs, respectively, to begin with and a capability to expand this condition as warranted.
Internationally, we built our position in Poland to over 2 million acres, and we'll drill in 2011 to begin testing this play. And in Canada, we started an evaluation drilling program over the winter to test our 100%-owned in-situ asset Birchwood. As we remain committed to impact exploration opportunities, we took a position in four blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq moving from early-stage discussions to completion in less than three months. We are currently engaged in drilling and testing operations on two of the blocks, and we'll be progressing operating activity on two 100% blocks throughout this year. A key driver for 2011 performance began to debut in 2010 as the Jackpine Mine commenced start-up in the third quarter. The upgrader for the project is currently in start-up phase, so we will soon see the full benefit of our first expansion at the Athabasca project. We also had continued successful exploration in Libya with seven new discoveries.
As we look forward to a potentially different future as an Upstream enterprise, we're focused on two things that will make us successful in the future. The first is disciplined investment leading to sustained reserve and production growth. In 2010, we replaced, on an organic E&P basis, 95% of our reserves, offsetting a significant impact to the negative in the Gulf of Mexico. Importantly, showing our focus and discipline towards liquid-based activities, we replaced 109% of our liquid hydrocarbon production, with 72% on gas replacement, as we focused on value with our capital dollars. Our strong held-by production asset base gives us tremendous flexibility in this regard.
Finally, our operational reliability continues to improve at Marathon. We executed several major turnaround flawlessly in 2010, and we had, overall, 94% operational reliability across our operated assets. High reliability yield is our most cost-effective and valuable barrel. 
All in, 2010 was a solid year for us. We have a lot more to do, that's for certain. But we are building in reliability to our base portfolio and adding significant growth options in both unconventional and impact areas, all creating a sustainable growth platform for the future.
I'll turn the call back over to Howard."

Moving to our Downstream results in Slide 14.

RM&T's [Refining, Marketing and Transportation] fourth quarter 2010 segment profit totaled $213 million compared to an $18 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our fourth quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009.
Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS [Light Louisiana Sweet] during the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the corresponding quarter last year. As shown on Slide 15, the primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the increase in the sweet/sour differential of approximately $2.25 per barrel and an increase in the percentage of our sour crude processed through our refinery of approximately 15%. In addition, the futures market was in contango, $1.20 per barrel, on average, in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $0.71 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also reduced our actual crude cost compared to the LLS price used in the crack spread calculation.
While we completed the sale of our St. Paul Park refinery December 1, 2010, we still increased our total throughputs, about 200,000 barrels per day or approximately 20%, over the same quarter last year primarily because the Garyville Major Expansion project was online for the entire fourth quarter 2010. In addition, some other work, which we recently completed in our refineries to improve the efficiency of our fluid catalytic crack units, also improved results over the fourth quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive improvements compared to the corresponding quarter last year, manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the fourth quarter 2010 primarily because of higher maintenance and other manufacturing costs.
Speedway SuperAmerica's [SSA] refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $16 million higher in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $0.10 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.14 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2010. SSA's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 4% while same-store gasoline volumes increased 1% quarter-to-quarter. 
Slide 15 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads. 
We'll now move to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for a review of 2010 Downstream highlights."

We completed the integration of what is essentially the first new refinery in the U.S. in over 30 years. The Garyville Major Expansion has exceeded our expectations by outperforming the design specifications. In addition, the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project [DHOUP] approached the halfway mark on schedule and on budget, and we have accomplished outstanding safety records along the way. Our Speedway and brand marketing components managed to continue to excel in, basically, a flat growth market. 
Now let me give you a little more color on the highlights that I just mentioned. First of all, the Garyville Major Expansion project has been operating for almost a year, and we are very pleased with the performance and additional value generated in the new plant. Most process units are outperforming their design criteria, and we have raised the rate of capacity to 464,000 barrels per day or an increase of 208,000 barrels per day.
The new dock we constructed as part of the project increases our takeaway capacity by approximately 40%. This dock, in conjunction with the additional barrels of distillate produce, has opened world sales markets. And we began exporting distillate and gasoline since last spring to markets in Europe and South and Latin America.
Our DHOUP project remains on schedule for start-up in the second half of 2012. 25% of the construction is complete, and we plan a very robust construction season here in 2011. And then we will complete the project in the second half of 2012.
Now turning to our marketing components. Speedway had one of the best years ever, and they were voted for the second straight year as best gasoline brand in the U.S. Same-store light product volume was up 3.7% for the year and 1.7% for the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Speedway team increased same-store merchandise sales by 4.4% for the year and 3.8% for the quarter.
Turning to our Marathon brand organization. We realized an incremental sales increase of approximately 10%, again, in essentially a flat growth market. Our brand organization secured a significant agreement with The Pantry to sell a very large portion of our new transportation fuels from our Garyville project into the Southeast market, and this is a long-term agreement.
And with that, I will turn it back to Howard Thill."

Slide 17 provides an analysis of total company preliminary cash flows for the year of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes and working capital was $5.2 billion while working capital changes from continuing operations contributed $750 million. Cash, capital expenditures for 2010 were $4.8 billion, and dividend paid totaled $704 million. While asset disposals generated proceeds of over $2.1 billion, the 2010 year end cash balance was approximately $4 billion.
Slide 18 provides a summary of the select financial data. At the end of the fourth quarter 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 14%, a decrease of seven percentage points from the third quarter. And a reminder, this debt includes approximately $198 million, which is serviced by U.S. Steel, and this debt is expected to be removed from our balance sheet by the end of this year.

Let me begin with the overriding corporate priority, which is to affect the successful spin of our Downstream assets effective June 30. And suffice it to say, the financing and transition activities are progressing quite well. I think on the Upstream, Dave has already talked quite a bit about the overall objectives there. I would point out, of course, the increase in rigs in our liquids-rich resource plays from eight to 17. On the Downstream, Gary has talked about the major priorities there as well. 
And with respect to the cash side, let me address a question upfront that I know you will all want to focus on and that is what are the priorities for the free cash that we'll have. First of all, we want to ensure that both companies have spin for a [ph] very strong balance sheet. That's our highest priority for cash. Secondly, as we have said before, we will want to fund profitable growth within the businesses. And again, as we have reflected earlier, an obvious priority in our Upstream business is to increase our positions in the liquids-rich resource plays, primarily in North America but internationally as well. Dividends, secondly, is always a very high priority for us. But as we see it today, the dividend yields on both of the companies has been, will be very competitive relative to their peers.  And lastly, stock buybacks continue to be a consideration and an option for us with respect to free cash flow.
So with that, Howard, back to you."

Basically, the Canadian markets and some of the West Texas Intermediate proves that we can move to our system, we've been able to get those into the marketplace. So the spreads have been, really, what has been a benefit to us here so far in the first quarter.

I think one of the things that we've consistently done is we alter our completion technique based on where we are in the play. Because as we all know, it's a very big play, and the reservoir is not ubiquitous. And so you have to change as the conditions warrant. And so I think there is some of areas that we're moving into right now, where we are actually pumping higher stages in the 15 to 20 stage range. But I don't think that, that signal necessarily a shift to us going to that. We basically let the wells in the reservoir tell us what it is that we're going to need to do there as far as that goes. Droshky question, Q4, we had 31,000 barrels per day average. The exit rate for the year is right at 28,000. We still expect this year to average between 15,000 and 17,000 barrels a day depending on what kind of hurricane season we have. So still a very substantial decline, but still very strong rate at the present time. With respect to the question in the Woodford, I think what we're seeing is that our growth in the Bakken and the Woodford play, in particular, where we'll see some pretty strong response will offset a lot of the declines that we'll see as we transition to some of our new activities in Norway. And what I would say about our program there is we're going to gear up to have eight co-op rigs running. So we'll probably get on the order of 12, 20-some-odd wells drilled with that portfolio, depending on when the rigs are ultimately delivered. We do expect a very strong activity from outside-operated activities, and I think we estimate on the order of 30 to 50 potential wells. The only thing I would caution you is our working interest on the co-op side is essentially 60% on average. On OBO [operated by others] basis, it's about 15%. So most of the activity that drives our production is going to come from stuff that we do."

Until you get new major takeaway capacity possibly into the Gulf Coast, whether it's the Houston corridor or the Louisiana corridor of refining or maybe both, but until you get that I think you're going to be in a bottleneck in PAD II and possibly in the upper West side of PAD II. And I think some are going to be for quite some time. I think it remains to be seen possibly later this year on where the State Department will come down on the new pipeline into the Gulf Coast. We now have parties to that transportation system so I am not privy to all the details. But when you look at incremental Canadian coming down and then you look at all of the incremental Bakken crudes, then the gap is pretty wide on when you look at production forecast on Bakken. There are some unit trains that are taking some crude into different markets. But I see a lot of that crude landing in the Patoka, Wood River arena. And as you said earlier, we are very advantaged with our logistics system in and around that market that we can take advantage and get that into our system. Here again, with Detroit coming on stream in 2012 and having the infrastructure, we are having some infrastructure built or modified in order to be able to get some additional Canadian heavy into that stream. I think we're going to be very, very well-positioned. But I still believe it's probably latter part of the decade at the earliest until you see a system actually built and functioning to get heavy crudes into the Gulf Coast. Yes, we do move some barrels down to Garyville from time-to-time depending on the differentials.

Still, as I try to model out that level of drilling activity, and I look at the growth from 15,000 barrels a day to something above 18,000 barrels a day in 2011 in the Bakken, the 18,000 looks conservative. Could you provide some color there. Is this program back-end loaded? Do you expect to complete a number of the wells later in the year? Or can you help me with that?"

When we talk about a 60% co-op interest and 50% OBO of speaking about the Woodford. And I'm quite sure that -- I probably misstated the wells. We'll drill at least 20 company-operated wells with upside of 30 plus and then the range on OBO will be 30% to 50%. So that's the Woodford side of things and that's where we have three rigs operating presently and are moving to eight by the end of the year. The rest of your question, with Bakken, we have a very high working interest percentage on the Bakken. We will probably drill on the order of 70 wells in addition to the 200 that we already have in the play out there. And we typically carry greater than 80% working interest. We'll drill that 70 number on an upside operated basis but those are typically very small interest because of the way the play is segregated. And again, I think what we continue to see is we continue to give guidance, it takes about 25 days to drill one of these wells. We are moving in a rig that's going to do nothing but completions. This year we are going to add a dedicated frac crew to our business. This is going to shorten the cycle time in terms of spread of the frac. But even given all those numbers, the way we bring wells on in terms of trying to manage the drawdown in developing our IP rate, we think that the very consistent way to look at this from say 14,700 barrels a day which is essentially what we are running today, assuming the people have been frozen to death up there, it's a little over 18,000 on an exit rate. So it could get better because we are moving in to stronger areas of the play in terms of what we think the EURs are. But I'm not sandbagging you here either with the way we ultimately are developing the play."

Back to the first part of your question, when you look at LLS and Mars, and yes, absolutely it's very expensive crude versus WTI. But WTI is not a very big market to begin with. And everyday when you look at those crudes that are available that you run, certainly based on your infrastructure, you're going to fill up all the WTI-referenced-type crudes first and Canadian-referenced-type crudes that your infrastructure will allow. But to be very honest, then you're left with LLS, Mars and some foreign cargoes and you're constantly looking at the yields and looking at the alternative price. So what the industry can do, I really believe that you're going to continue see this dislocation somewhat or aversion if you want to call it like I had answered earlier, until you get some more takeaway capacity in place. Because certainly as Dave has mentioned from the upstream side, those crudes kind of continue to be developed and produced, as well as new production coming on in Canada. So I think bottom line to your question, I believe it puts us into a very good position in order to be able to, with our infrastructure, have a fairly decent allocation of pipeline space to run some of those. But LLS and Mars are still going to come up Capline and be your next alternative crude."

And indeed we've already increased beyond what we showed from that time. And as Dave said, we continue to increase that. We certainly are and I think as I referred to when I talked about uses of cash, we certainly are looking at other opportunities that would give us an opportunity to affect the step change in our position in some of the key plays. But again, I think it's important to look at where we are and where we are going with respect to the liquids-rich resource plays at this stage.

Slide 2 contains the forward-looking statement and other information related to this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms, 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
In the Appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income, by quarter, for 2009 and 2010; preliminary balance sheet information; first quarter and full year 2011 operating estimates; and other data that you may find useful. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $780 million was a 241% increase over the fourth quarter 2009 and 10% higher than the third quarter 2010. Slide 4 shows key drivers to the fourth quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted net income. 
Earnings before tax for all four segments were lower but the decrease was offset by lower taxes, which resulted from a shift within the quarter toward greater domestic versus foreign income along with normal year-end true-ups. The quarter-to-quarter difference in taxes was also impacted by the absence of currency fluctuations in prior quarters. The overall income tax for 2010 was 50%, within our previously provided guidance of 49% to 54%. For 2011, we expect the rates between 54% and 59%. And please remember, the overall rate is highly sensitive to the mix of income and can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As shown on Slide 5, our adjusted net income more than doubled year-over-year going from $1.2 billion in 2009 to almost $2.6 billion in 2010. Slide 6 shows the key drivers to this year-over-year increase in adjusted net income, including significantly better earnings in both our E&P [Exploration and Production] and Downstream businesses, partially offset by higher income taxes and lower earnings in our Oil Sands Mining [OSM] segment. 
As shown on Slide 7, E&P segment income was slightly lower for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2010. Higher realizations and sales volumes were largely offset by higher domestic DD&A associated primarily with the Droshky field and higher exploration expenses. 
Average E&P realizations and market indicators are shown on Slide 8. Quarter-over-quarter, our average E&P realization per BOE [barrels of oil equivalent] increased $6, while NYMEX prompt WTI [West Texas Intermediate] increased $9 per barrel and the bid week natural gas price decreased $0.58 per MMBTU [Million Metric British Thermal Units].
Slide 9 shows our E&P production volumes. Production sold increased 5% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter 2010 as compared to the third quarter were a result of a smaller underlift in the fourth quarter. We ended the year approximately 3.4 million BOE underlifted. The makeup of this underlift was 2.1 million BOE in Alaska gas storage and underlift in Europe of about 700,000 BOE in both EG [Equatorial Guinea] and Libya being underlifted by approximately 300,000 BOE. Fourth quarter 2010 production available for sale increased 3% from the third quarter 2010 and 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. These increases were primarily a result of a full quarter of Droshky production.
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to the prior quarter, fourth quarter E&P earnings per BOE decreased $12.95, primarily a result of the higher exploration expenses largely attributable to unsuccessful exploration wells in Indonesia and Norway, higher DD&A from Droshky and higher field level controllable costs and other expenses. These negatives were partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Total operating costs per BOE increased from $24.47 to $33.34 quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 11 shows the trend, by quarter, over the last three years for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses per BOE. The increase in exploration expense per BOE is attributable to the aforementioned dry wells. The increase in field level controllable cost per BOE is largely a result of work-over costs in the Gulf of Mexico, timing of international listings and year-end accruals from outside operator properties, which added $0.66 per BOE to the fourth quarter results.
Turning to Slide 12. In Oil Sands Mining, fourth quarter segment income was $9 million, which reflects both positive price and volume variances over the third quarter, offset by onetime start-up and ongoing costs at the Jackpine Mine, an increase blend stock volumes and costs. Net synthetic crude sales for the quarter increased 38,000 barrels per day as production continue to ramp up at the Jackpine Mine.
We'll now move to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call over to Dave Roberts to discuss 2010 Upstream highlights."

Despite significant challenges in 2010, the Upstream business continued on the path to create sustainable profitable growth options for the company. As noted in our release this morning, we have expanded our presence in unconventional resource plays, both in the United States and internationally, with a strong preference for liquids-rich opportunities. 
Our Bakken position now stands almost 400,000 acres. Production continues to grow, and our targeted peak of over 22,000 barrels per day is in view. We have six rigs in continuous drilling operations and one rig planned to handle completions across our assets. Marathon also holds 86,000 acres in the Anadarko Woodford area, an area where we have operated for decades, and we have line in sight on new opportunity to increase that position to over 100,000 acres shortly. Importantly, we will have eight rigs in the play by 2011 by the end of this year.
We've also entered two new unconventional plays in the Lower 48 and believe there are further opportunities we can access. We have an option on 75,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas and we'll likely expand that position further in 2011. And we built a position of over 170,000 acres in the Niobrara play across the DJ Basin. Again, importantly, we'll be drilling wells in both these plays in 2011 for two- and one-rig programs, respectively, to begin with and a capability to expand this condition as warranted.
Internationally, we built our position in Poland to over 2 million acres, and we'll drill in 2011 to begin testing this play. And in Canada, we started an evaluation drilling program over the winter to test our 100%-owned in-situ asset Birchwood. As we remain committed to impact exploration opportunities, we took a position in four blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq moving from early-stage discussions to completion in less than three months. We are currently engaged in drilling and testing operations on two of the blocks, and we'll be progressing operating activity on two 100% blocks throughout this year. A key driver for 2011 performance began to debut in 2010 as the Jackpine Mine commenced start-up in the third quarter. The upgrader for the project is currently in start-up phase, so we will soon see the full benefit of our first expansion at the Athabasca project. We also had continued successful exploration in Libya with seven new discoveries.
As we look forward to a potentially different future as an Upstream enterprise, we're focused on two things that will make us successful in the future. The first is disciplined investment leading to sustained reserve and production growth. In 2010, we replaced, on an organic E&P basis, 95% of our reserves, offsetting a significant impact to the negative in the Gulf of Mexico. Importantly, showing our focus and discipline towards liquid-based activities, we replaced 109% of our liquid hydrocarbon production, with 72% on gas replacement, as we focused on value with our capital dollars. Our strong held-by production asset base gives us tremendous flexibility in this regard.
Finally, our operational reliability continues to improve at Marathon. We executed several major turnaround flawlessly in 2010, and we had, overall, 94% operational reliability across our operated assets. High reliability yield is our most cost-effective and valuable barrel. 
All in, 2010 was a solid year for us. We have a lot more to do, that's for certain. But we are building in reliability to our base portfolio and adding significant growth options in both unconventional and impact areas, all creating a sustainable growth platform for the future.
I'll turn the call back over to Howard."

RM&T's [Refining, Marketing and Transportation] fourth quarter 2010 segment profit totaled $213 million compared to an $18 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our fourth quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009.
Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS [Light Louisiana Sweet] during the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the corresponding quarter last year. As shown on Slide 15, the primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the increase in the sweet/sour differential of approximately $2.25 per barrel and an increase in the percentage of our sour crude processed through our refinery of approximately 15%. In addition, the futures market was in Contango, $1.20 per barrel, on average, in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $0.71 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also reduced our actual crude cost compared to the LLS price used in the crack spread calculation.
While we completed the sale of our St. Paul Park refinery December 1, 2010, we still increased our total throughputs, about 200,000 barrels per day or approximately 20%, over the same quarter last year primarily because the Garyville Major Expansion project was online for the entire fourth quarter 2010. In addition, some other work, which we recently completed in our refineries to improve the efficiency of our fluid catalytic crack unit, also improved results over the fourth quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive improvements compared to the corresponding quarter last year, manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the fourth quarter 2010 primarily because of higher maintenance and other manufacturing costs.
Speedway SuperAmerica's [SSA] refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $16 million higher in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $0.10 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.14 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2010. SSA's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 4% while same-store gasoline volumes increased 1% quarter-to-quarter. 
Slide 15 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads. 
We'll now move to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for a review of 2010 Downstream highlights."

We completed the integration of what is essentially the first new refinery in the U.S. in over 30 years. The Garyville Major Expansion has exceeded our expectations by outperforming the design specifications. In addition, the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project [DHOUP] approached the halfway mark on schedule and on budget, and we have accomplished outstanding safety records along the way. Our Speedway and brand marketing components managed to continue to excel in, basically, a flat growth market. 
Now let me give you a little more color on the highlights that I just mentioned. First of all, the Garyville Major Expansion project has been operating for almost a year, and we are very pleased with the performance and additional value generated in the new plant. Most process units are outperforming their design criteria, and we have raised the rate of capacity to 464,000 barrels per day or an increase of 208,000 barrels per day.
The new dock we constructed as part of the project increases our takeaway capacity by approximately 40%. This dock, in conjunction with the additional barrels of distillate produce, has opened world sales markets. And we began exporting distillate and gasoline since last spring to markets in Europe and South and Latin America.
Our DHOUP project remains on schedule for start-up in the second half of 2012. 25% of the construction is complete, and we plan a very robust construction season here in 2011. And then we will complete the project in the second half of 2012.
Now turning to our marketing components. Speedway had one of the best years ever, and they were voted for the second straight year as best gasoline brand in the U.S. Same-store light product volume was up 3.7% for the year and 1.7% for the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Speedway team increased same-store merchandise sales by 4.4% for the year and 3.8% for the quarter.
Turning to our Marathon brand organization. We realized an incremental sales increase of approximately 10%, again, in essentially a flat growth market. Our brand organization secured a significant agreement with The Pantry to sell a very large portion of our new transportation fuels from our Garyville project into the Southeast market, and this is a long-term agreement.
And with that, I will turn it back to Howard Thill."

Cash, capital expenditures for 2010 were $4.8 billion, and dividends paid totaled $704 million. While asset disposals generated proceeds of over $2.1 billion, the 2010 year end cash balance was approximately $4 billion.
Slide 18 provides a summary of the select financial data. At the end of the fourth quarter 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 14%, a decrease of seven percentage points from the third quarter. And a reminder, this debt includes approximately $198 million, which is serviced by U.S. Steel, and this debt is expected to be removed from our balance sheet by the end of this year.

Let me begin with the overriding corporate priority, which is to affect the successful spin of our Downstream assets effective June 30. And suffice it to say, the financing and transition activities are progressing quite well. I think on the Upstream, Dave has already talked quite a bit about the overall objectives there. I would point out, of course, the increase in rigs in our liquids-rich resource plays from eight to 17. On the Downstream, Gary has talked about the major priorities there as well. 
And with respect to the cash side, let me address a question upfront that I know you will all want to focus on and that is what are the priorities for the free cash that we'll have. First of all, we want to ensure that both companies have spin for a [ph] very strong balance sheet. That's our highest priority for cash. Secondly, as we have said before, we will want to fund profitable growth within the businesses. And again, as we have reflected earlier, an obvious priority in our Upstream business is to increase our positions in the liquids-rich resource plays, primarily in North America but internationally as well. Dividends, secondly, is always a very high priority for us. But as we see it today, the dividend yields on both of the companies has been, will be very competitive relative to their peers.  And lastly, stock buybacks continue to be a consideration and an option for us with respect to free cash flow.
So with that, Howard, back to you."

I think one of the things that we've consistently done is we alter our completion technique based on where we are in the play. Because as we all know, it's a very big play, and the reservoir is not ubiquitous. And so you have to change as the conditions warrant. And so I think there is some of areas that we're moving into right now, where we are actually pumping higher stages in the 15 to 20 stage range. But I don't think that, that signal necessarily a shift to us going to that. We basically let the wells in the reservoir tell us what it is that we're going to need to do there as far as that goes. Droshky question, Q4, we had 31,000 barrels per day average. The exit rate for the year is right at 28,000. We still expect this year to average between 15,000 and 17,000 barrels a day depending on what kind of hurricane season we have. So still a very substantial decline, but still very strong rate at the present time. With respect to the question in the Woodford, I think what we're seeing is that our growth in the Bakken and the Woodford play, in particular, where we'll see some pretty strong response will offset a lot of the declines that we'll see as we transition to some of our new activities in Norway. And what I would say about our program there is we're going to gear up to have eight co-op rigs running. So we'll probably get on the order of 12, 20-some-odd wells drilled with that portfolio, depending on when the rigs are ultimately delivered. We do expect a very strong activity from outside-operated activities, and I think we estimate on the order of 30 to 50 potential wells. The only thing I would caution you is our working interest on the co-op side is essentially 60% on average. On OBO [operated by others] basis, about 15%. So most of the activity that drives our production is going to come from stuff that we do."

Until you get new major takeaway capacity possibly into the Gulf Coast, whether it's the Houston corridor or the Louisiana corridor of refining or maybe both, but until you get that I think you're going to be in a bottleneck in PAD II and possibly in the upper West side of PAD II. And I think some are going to be for quite some time. I think it remains to be seen possibly later this year on where the State Department will come down on the new pipeline into the Gulf Coast. We now have parties to that transportation system so I am not privy to all the details. But when you look at incremental Canadian coming down and then you look at all of the incremental Bakken crudes, then the gap is pretty wide on when you look at production forecast on Bakken. There are some unit trains that are taking some crude into different markets. But I see a lot of that crude landing in the Patoka, Wood River arena. And as you said earlier, we are very advantaged with our logistics system in and around that market that we can take advantage and get that into our system. Here again, with Detroit coming on stream in 2012 and having the infrastructure, we are having some infrastructure built or modified in order to be able to get some additional Canadian heavy into that stream. I think we're going to be very, very well-positioned. But I still believe it's probably latter part of the decade at the earliest until you see a system actually built and functioning to get heavy crudes into the Gulf Coast. Yes, we do move some barrels down to Garyville from time-to-time depending on the differentials. And while I can't give you the exact number, from a competitive nature, I don't want to get that number out.

When we talk about a 60% co-op interest and 50% OBO is speaking about the Woodford. And I'm quite sure that -- I probably misstated the wells. We'll drill at least 20 company-operated wells with upside of 30 plus and then the range on OBO will be 30% to 50%. So that's the Woodford side of things and that's where we have three rigs operating presently and are moving to eight by the end of the year. The rest of your question, with Bakken, we have a very high working interest percentage on the Bakken. We will probably drill on the order of 70 wells in addition to the 200 that we already have in the play out there. And we typically carry greater than 80% working interest. We'll drill that 70 number on an upside operated basis but those are typically very small interest because of the way the play is segregated. And again, I think what we continue to see is we continue to give guidance, it takes about 25 days to drill one of these wells. We are moving in a rig that's going to do nothing but completions. This year we are going to add a dedicated frac crew to our business. This is going to shorten the cycle time in terms of spread of the frac. But even given all those numbers, the way we bring wells on in terms of trying to manage the drawdown in developing our IP rate, we think that the very consistent way to look at this from say 14,700 barrels a day which is essentially what we are running today, assuming the people have been frozen to death up there, it's a little over 18,000 on an exit rate. So it could get better because we are moving in to stronger areas of the play in terms of what we think the EURs are.

Back to the first part of your question, when you look at LLS and Mars, and yes, absolutely it's very expensive crude versus WTI. But WTI is not a very big market to begin with. And everyday when you look at those crudes that are available that you run, certainly based on your infrastructure, you're going to fill up all the WTI-referenced-type crudes first and Canadian-referenced-type crudes that the infrastructure will allow. But to be very honest, then you're left with LLS, Mars and some foreign cargoes and you're constantly looking at the yields and looking at the alternative price. So what the industry can do, I really believe that you're going to continue see this dislocation somewhat or aversion if you want to call it like I had answered earlier, until you get some more takeaway capacity in place. Because certainly as Dave has mentioned from the upstream side, those crudes kind of continue to be developed and produced, as well as new production coming on in Canada. So I think bottom line to your question, I believe it puts us into a very good position in order to be able to, with our infrastructure, have a fairly decent allocation of pipeline space to run some of those.

And as you know, when we're booking income taxes, we estimate what the effective tax rate will be for the full year and book to that. And you know that our income is from tax jurisdictions with widely different tax rates, anything from 25% to 93%. So as we get through the year and the next changes, our expectation of the full year effective tax rate also changes. What happened this year in the fourth quarter was that the mixed had changed to a lower tax jurisdiction and effectively we have been overbooking taxes the first nine months so we had to adjustment in the fourth quarter so that for the full year, we have the accurate effective tax rate. I think last year we might have had some pretty significant FX adjustments on our deferred taxes. And as you know, we sold the biggest portion of that by converting our different tax liability in Canada to U.S. dollars. So we don't have that noise in the numbers anymore."

Again, we are not going to chase natural gas. We're in a fortunate position that where we have our gas resource for the most part, it has helped production. We can wait until we see better prices and better economics before beginning to invest in that. So while we will probably target as we've said before the 3% to 5% production growth, that may not compare with those that are double-digit.

Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information related to this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms, 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the Appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2010 and first quarter of 2011, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full year 2011 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows that our adjusted net income of almost $1.2 billion was 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 276% increase from the first quarter of 2010. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2010. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, partially offset by lower E&P production sold as a result of the suspension of Libyan production operations and the downtime associated with the completion during the quarter. Pretax earnings increased in all segments. 
Slide 5 shows the various impacts, which led to a 35% increase in E&P segment income, higher liquid hydrocarbon prices and lower DD&A were partially offset by the lower sales volumes just discussed, along with higher income taxes. 
Slide 6 shows our historical price realizations. Our first quarter average price realization increased $9.39 per BOE compared to the fourth quarter 2010. Our liquid hydrocarbon realization increased $14.29 per barrel compared to an increase of $9.36 per barrel increase in the NYMEX prompt WTI price. About 65% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were priced off of Brent, which increased substantially more than WTI during the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the production volumes sold in the first quarter of 2011 were down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 to 400,000 BOE per day. While production available per sale decreased 5% to 398,000 BOE per day. As previously noted, the largest contributor to these decreases was the suspension of Libyan productions and the downtime associated with the Droshky site completion. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an over lift for the quarter of approximately 975,000 BOE in the U.K., Norway and Alaska, offset by another lift of 782,000 BOE in Libya and EG.
Slide 8 demonstrates the 18% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. For the full year 2011, we now expect production available for sale to be between 345,000 and 365,000 BOE per day, which includes the first quarter production available for sale from Libya but excludes any additional Libya production for the year. This is about a 7,000 BOE PD increase to our previous guidance when excluding Libya.
Turning to Slide 9, sales level controllable costs per BOE return to trend from the higher fourth quarter level when we had higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. 2010 domestic build level controllable costs was $7.10 per BOE and for 2011, we expect it to be in the range of $7.25 to $8.30 per BOE. In international E&P, the 2010 field level controllable costs were $2.95 per BOE and for 2011, we expect the range of $3.20 to $4.40 per BOE with the largest portion of the increase due to the loss of the Libya production.
Exploration expense increased as a result of the approximately $159 million in dry well cost during the first quarter. This is attributed to costs associated with the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well and the Romeo prospect in Indonesia, which water bearing carbonates. In March 2011, we completed our evaluation to determine the option to develop the Flying Dutchman were not viable. 
Total expenses per BOE as shown on Slide 10 increased $0.59 per BOE from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the higher exploration expense and DD&A, partially offset by lower field level controllable costs. First quarter E&P segment income was $18.54 per BOE, a 43% increase compared to the fourth quarter 2010, again primarily due to increased realizations.
Turning to Slide 11 in Oil Sands Mining, the segment income for the first quarter was $32 million, an increase of $23 million from the $9 million earned in the fourth quarter 2010, largely driven by higher synthetic crude realizations. Marathon's first quarter 2011 net synthetic crude sales, which is bitumen after upgrading including stocks, from the AOSP mining operation was 37,000 barrels per day compared to 38,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realizations increased $10 per barrel from their fourth quarter level.
Turning to Slide 12, in the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter segment income was $60 million, an increase of $27 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of the turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2010, methanol sales volumes increased. Moving to our Downstream financial results, as noted on Slide 13, RM&T's first quarter 2011 segment profit totaled $527 million compared to a $237 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2011 results against the same quarter in 2010.
Primary factors contributing to the increased segment income for the first quarter 2011 included a wider sweet/sour crew differential, increased sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs resulting from decreased plant turnaround and major maintenance expenses compared to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, the company was able to take advantage of the wider-than-normal crude oil differentials between WTI and other light sweet crude such as LLS and Dated Brent, which resulted in relatively lower crude oil acquisition costs versus the comparable quarter last year. Sales volumes increased as a result of higher first quarter 2011 refining throughputs compared to the same quarter in the previous year.
Primarily because of operating a fully integrated Garyville refinery for the entire first quarter 2011, our total throughputs were up approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the December 1, 2010, sale of the St. Paul Park refinery. In addition, some other work, which we recently completed in our refineries to enhance the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, also improved last quarter's results over the first quarter 2010, as well as the higher prices we realized in the first quarter of 2011 on our SCCU gains.
Our manufacturing and other expenses were lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the corresponding quarter last year, primarily because we had much lower plant turnaround and major maintenance expenses and other major Downstream project costs in the current quarter. Partially offsetting these positive improvements quarter-over-quarter, the average LLS crack spread decreased from $3.03 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010 based upon 57% of our production in the Midwest and 43% in the U.S. Gulf Coast during that quarter to $0.71 per barrel in the first quarter 2011 based upon 53% of the production being in the Midwest market at 47% in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations did not increase as much as the average of the spot market gasoline, diesel and 3% prices used in the LLS 6321 crack spread calculation in the first quarter 2011 versus the comparable quarter last year. Total refinery, crude throughput averaged 1,114,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2011 compared to 1,003,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,321,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010. Speedways' refined product and merchandise gross margins was about $23 million lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter 2010.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of outlets as a result of the Minnesota asset sale in December 2010. On a per gallon basis, Speedways' gasoline and distillate margins increased from $0.1195 per gallon in the first quarter of 2010 to $0.1308 per gallon in the first quarter of 2011. Speedways' same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 2%, while same-store gasoline volumes were comparable in both quarters.
Slide 15 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $2.2 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $436 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion, proceeds from disposals of assets were $212 million and dividends paid totaled $178 million. 
This slide also reflects the financing activities carried out during the quarter in anticipation of the spinoff of our gas stream business at June 30 of this year. 
Slide 16 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 10%, a 4 percentage point reduction from the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 was 43%. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 42% to 47%. As you may recall, these tax rates reflect a full year as an integrated company, both the quarter and estimated annual rates are lower than expected primarily due to the suspension of production operations in Libya, where as you know, our effective tax rate is over 90%. The inclusion of only 2 months Libyan income and associated taxes in our estimated annual effective tax rate accordingly reduced the effective tax rate applicable to the first quarter.
With that, I will turn it over to Clarence Cazalot for a few comments."

I think the first question in terms of the increased guidance, which we would say is in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 barrels a day, largely is the result of our focus on reliability over the last several years that we believe has finally yielded some significant results expressed in the first quarter. And that specifically, we saw 100% reliability out of our complex and saw 95% reliability out of our Alpine complex. Both of those for the type of assets they are, are world-class results and what we're forecasting is where we can't expect to achieve those rates even though that we will certainly strive for that. We are expecting to achieve industry-leading reliability in those assets, which should allow us to show production increases for the remainder of the year. In addition, we obviously are showing continued growth from a resource plays, particularly in Oklahoma and the Bakken and we do expect to bring Arizona on stream as expected during the remainder of this year. So that I hope takes care of the first question that you had. The second question, with respect to oil sands, what I will say is that we're very excited and John made the announcement today that the 10th of 11 units in the upgrader has been delivered and so basically we are fully on schedule with the upgrader being able to match the mine performance. Essentially what that allows us to say is that we now have the capacity to actually produce this asset on a gross basis at 255,000 barrels a day, Marathon has a 20% share of that obviously. And what we expect is that our operating costs will now start to continue to decline as we have this larger fixed production against the fixed cost base. And so what we talked about operating expense being in a circa $55 per barrel range in the first quarter, we expect that, that would continue to fall for the year to give us a year range in that particular asset of maybe $35 to $45 a barrel we're continuing to try to push down to lower levels. We are already are seeing some outstanding production performance for the mine and then obviously, with the fact that crudes are essentially trading at a par to Brent, with those operating cost numbers, you could see what the economic power of this asset is going to be for us we think on a perspective basis."

However, I've said many times in presentations over the first quarter year that we expected if you get to around $3.75 or higher a range that's when you would start to see a reduction in volume and that has been the case. In fact, it started that the last week of March, we started to see a degradation in volume and we're down month-to-date here in April right around 5%. Now let me add, I don't believe all of that is demand from price across the biggest part of our market. We've had about 25 straight days of rain, which has completely shut down the farm and planting season and a lot of the outside contractor worked as well. So 5%, if you take into account weather and we're up against the quarter last year, I guess April last year, that was a very, very good weather season.

But we'll certainly add on 1,000 or 2,000 acres as we go forward. The broader question I think I'll start with the fact that we are oil-focused and so those assets that we're going to focus on are largely in liquids-rich places, as we've been pretty consistent On. I think you'll see us continue to move away from the Marcellus as an example because while we think that's a great play, and has great potential, in terms of being a hydrocarbon resource base cover, it doesn't really fit our strategy. We would obviously like to increase our position in the Bakken since it's a key play for Marathon and we continue to think we have a leading operating position there. But financially, that doesn't make a lot of sense right now. It's a very overheated basin and you've seen us focus on the other 3 liquids-rich play that we're focusing on in the Anadarko Oklahoma, where we've now pushed our acreage position in 100,000 acres which is quite substantially in that play. The 200,000 gross acres that we subsequently farm down in the Niobrara, we'll continue to look for opportunities there. And I think clearly the Eagle Ford is a play that we've got a significant focus on and we'll continue to have focus on as we still think there's opportunities out there and I think that gives us the coverage that we need across the number of basins that give us exposure liquid and appropriate risk profile."

Paul, the second part of your question is, and I know there's been sort of reports out, Marathon pumps multistage fracs. I think there is this misperception out there that we somehow don't do what some of the operators are doing. But it's really dependent on what area you're in and so when I think about the activities that we're engaged in and what we would call our area, which is an area that we think typically has a 500,000 barrels plus or minus recoverable per well, we're pumping 20 stages, 3 million pounds of frac jobs in those wells. We typically pump smaller jobs in some of the areas that we think have less recoverable oil because obviously the key there is to try to make the completions as financially attractive as possible.

Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the Appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2010 and first quarter of 2011, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full-year 2011 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows that our adjusted net income of almost $1.2 billion, was 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 276% increase from the first quarter of 2010. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2010. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, partially offset by lower E&P production sold as a result of the suspension of Libyan production operations and the downtime associated with the Droshky sidetrack completion during the quarter. Pretax earnings increased in all segments. 
Slide 5 shows the various impacts which led to a 35% increase in E&P segment income. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices and lower DD&A were partially offset by the lower sales volumes just discussed, along with higher income taxes. 
Slide 6 shows our historical price realizations. Our first quarter average price realization increased $9.39 per BOE compared to the fourth quarter 2010. Our liquid hydrocarbon realization increased $14.29 per barrel compared to an increase of $9.36 per barrel increase in the NYMEX prompt WTI price. About 65% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were priced off of Brent, which increased substantially more than WTI during the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the production volumes sold in the first quarter of 2011 were down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 to 400,000 BOE per day. While production available for sale decreased 5% to 398,000 BOE per day. As previously noted, the largest contributor to these decreases was the suspension of Libyan productions and the downtime associated with the Droshky sidetrack completion. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 975,000 BOE in the U.K., Norway and Alaska, offset by another lift of 782,000 BOE in Libya and EG.
Slide 8 demonstrates the 18% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. For the full-year 2011, we now expect production available for sale to be between 345,000 and 365,000 BOE per day, which includes the first quarter production available for sale from Libya but excludes any additional Libya production for the year. This is about a 7,000 boepd increase to our previous guidance when excluding Libya.
Turning to Slide 9, field level controllable costs per BOE returned to trend from the higher fourth quarter level when we had higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. 2010 domestic field level controllable costs was $7.10 per BOE and for 2011, we expect it to be in the range of $7.25 to $8.30 per BOE. In International E&P, the 2010 field level controllable costs were $2.95 per BOE and for 2011, we expect the range of $3.20 to $4.40 per BOE with the largest portion of the increase due to the loss of the Libya production.
Exploration expense increased as a result of the approximately $159 million in dry well costs during the first quarter. This is attributed to costs associated with the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well and the Romeo prospect in Indonesia, which encountered water-bearing carbonates. In March 2011, we completed our evaluation to determine the option to develop the Flying Dutchman were not viable. 
Total expenses per BOE as shown on Slide 10 increased $0.59 per BOE from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the higher exploration expense and DD&A, partially offset by lower field level controllable costs. First quarter E&P segment income was $18.54 per BOE, a 43% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, again, primarily due to increased realizations.
Turning to Slide 11, in Oil Sands Mining. The segment income for the first quarter was $32 million, an increase of $23 million from the $9 million earned in the fourth quarter 2010, largely driven by higher synthetic crude realizations. Marathon's first quarter 2011 net synthetic crude sales, which is bitumen after upgrading including blendstocks. From the AOSP mining operation was 37,000 barrels per day compared to 38,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realization increased $10 per barrel from their fourth quarter level.
Turning to Slide 12, in the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter segment income was $60 million, an increase of $27 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of the turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2010, methanol sales volumes increased. Moving to our Downstream financial results, as noted on Slide 13, RM&T's first quarter 2011 segment profit totaled $527 million compared to a $237 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2011 results against the same quarter in 2010.
Primary factors contributing to the increased segment income for the first quarter 2011 included a wider sweet/sour crude differential, increased sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs resulting from decreased planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses compared to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, the company was able to take advantage of the wider-than-normal crude oil differentials between WTI and other light sweet crude such as LLS and Dated Brent, which resulted in relatively lower crude oil acquisition costs versus the comparable quarter last year. Sales volumes increased as a result of higher first quarter 2011 refining throughputs compared to the same quarter in the previous year.
Primarily because of operating a fully integrated Garyville refinery for the entire first quarter of 2011, our total throughputs were up approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the December 1, 2010 sale of the St. Paul Park refinery. In addition, some other work, which we recently completed in our refineries to enhance the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, also improved last quarter's results over the first quarter 2010, as well as the higher prices we realized in the first quarter of 2011 on our SCCU gains.
Our manufacturing and other expenses were lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the corresponding quarter last year, primarily because we had much lower planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and other major Downstream project costs in the current quarter. Partially offsetting these positive improvements quarter-over-quarter, the average LLS crack spread decreased from $3.03 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010 based upon 57% of our production in the Midwest and 43% in the U.S. Gulf Coast during that quarter to $0.71 per barrel in the first quarter 2011 based upon 53% of the production being in the Midwest market at 47% in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations did not increase as much as the average of the spot market gasoline, distillate and 3% resin prices used in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread calculation in the first quarter 2011 versus the comparable quarter last year. Total refinery, crude oil throughput averaged 1,114,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2011 compared to 1,003,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,321,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010. Speedways' refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $23 million lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter 2010.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of outlets as a result of the Minnesota asset sale in December 2010. On a per gallon basis, Speedways' gasoline and distillate margins increased from $0.1195 per gallon in the first quarter of 2010 to $0.1308 per gallon in the first quarter of 2011. Speedways' same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 2%, while same-store gasoline volumes were comparable in both quarters.
Slide 15 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $2.2 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $436 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Proceeds from disposals of assets were $212 million and dividends paid totaled $178 million. 
This slide also reflects the financing activities carried out during the quarter in anticipation of the spinoff of our Downstream business at June 30 this year. 
Slide 16 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 10%, a 4 percentage point reduction from the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 was 43%. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 42% to 47%. As you may recall, these tax rates reflect a full year as an integrated company. Both the quarter and estimated annual rates are lower than expected primarily due to the suspension of production operations in Libya, where as you know, our effective tax rate is over 90%. The inclusion of only 2 months Libyan income and associated taxes in our estimated annual effective tax rate accordingly reduced the effective tax rate applicable to the first quarter.
With that, I will turn it over to Clarence Cazalot for a few comments."

I think the first question in terms of the increased guidance, which we would say is in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 barrels a day, largely is the result of our focus on reliability over the last several years that we believe has finally yielded some significant results expressed in the first quarter. And that specifically, we saw 100% reliability out of our Equatorial Guinea complex and we saw 95% reliability out of our Alpine complex. Both of those, for the type of assets they are, are world-class results and what we're forecasting is -- well, we can't expect to achieve those rates even though that we will certainly strive for that. We are expecting to achieve industry-leading reliability in those assets, which should allow us to show production increases for the remainder of the year. In addition, we obviously are showing continued growth from resource plays, particularly in Oklahoma and Bakken and we do expect to bring Arizona on stream as expected during the remainder of this year. So that I hope takes care of the first question that you had. The second question, with respect to Oil Sands, what I will say is that we're very excited and Charles made the announcement today that the 10th of 11 units in the upgrader has been delivered and so basically we are fully on schedule with the upgrader being able to match the mine performance. Essentially what that allows us to say is that we now have the capacity to actually produce this asset on a gross basis at 255,000 barrels a day, Marathon has a 20% share of that obviously. And what we expect is that our operating costs will now start to continue to decline as we have this larger fixed production against the fixed cost base. And so while we talked about operating expense being in the circa $55 per barrel range in the first quarter, we expect that, that would continue to fall for the year to give us a year range in that particular asset of maybe $35 to $45 a barrel which continuing to try to push down to lower levels. We already are seeing some outstanding production performance for the mine and then obviously, with the ISD, the fact that syncrudes are essentially trading at a par to Brent, with those operating cost numbers, you could see what the economic power of this asset is going to be for us, we think, on a perspective basis."

Now let me add, I don't believe all of that is demand from price across the biggest part of our market. We've had about 25 straight days of rain, which has completely shut down the farm and planting season and a lot of the outside contractor work as well. So 5%, if you take into account weather and we're up against the quarter last year that -- I mean, up against in April last year, that was a very, very good weather season.

And I think what we've done already in the Eagle Ford is a great example of that because certainly we're looking for opportunities to add the 10,000 plus acre positions. But we'll certainly add on 1,000 or 2,000 acres as we go forward. The broader question I think I'll start with the fact that we are oil-focused and so those assets that we're going to focus on are largely in liquids-rich plays as we've been pretty consistent on. I think you'll see us continue to move away from the Marcellus as an example because while we think that's a great play, has great potential, in terms of being a hydrocarbon resource base, it doesn't really fit our strategy. We would obviously like to increase our position in the Bakken since it's a key play for Marathon and we continue to think we have a leading operating position there. But financially, that doesn't make a lot of sense right now. It's a very overheated basin and so I think we're -- you've seen us focused. It's the other 3 liquids-rich plays that we're focusing on in the Anadarko Woodford in Oklahoma, where we've now pushed our acreage position at 100,000 acres, which is quite substantially in that play. The 200,000 gross acres that we subsequently farm down in the Niobrara. We'll continue to look for opportunities there. And I think clearly the Eagle Ford is a play that we've got a significant focus on and we'll continue to have focus on as we still think there's opportunities out there. And I think that gives us the coverage that we need across a number of basins that give us exposure liquids and appropriate risk profile."

And I'll let Garry comment on that."

Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the Appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2010 and first quarter of 2011, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full-year 2011 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows that our adjusted net income of almost $1.2 billion, was 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 276% increase from the first quarter of 2010. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2010. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, partially offset by lower E&P production sold as a result of the suspension of Libyan production operations and the downtime associated with the Droshky sidetrack completion during the quarter. Pretax earnings increased in all segments. 
Slide 5 shows the various impacts which led to a 35% increase in E&P segment income. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices and lower DD&A were partially offset by the lower sales volumes just discussed, along with higher income taxes. 
Slide 6 shows our historical price realizations. Our first quarter average price realization increased $9.39 per BOE compared to the fourth quarter 2010. Our liquid hydrocarbon realization increased $14.29 per barrel compared to an increase of $9.36 per barrel increase in the NYMEX prompt WTI price. About 65% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were priced off of Brent, which increased substantially more than WTI during the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the production volumes sold in the first quarter of 2011 were down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 to 400,000 BOE per day. While production available for sale decreased 5% to 398,000 BOE per day. As previously noted, the largest contributor to these decreases was the suspension of Libyan productions and the downtime associated with the Droshky sidetrack completion. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 975,000 BOE in the U.K., Norway and Alaska, offset by an underlift of 782,000 BOE in Libya and EG.
Slide 8 demonstrates the 18% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. For the full-year 2011, we now expect production available for sale to be between 345,000 and 365,000 BOE per day, which includes the first quarter production available for sale from Libya but excludes any additional Libya production for the year. This is about a 7,000 boepd increase to our previous guidance when excluding Libya.
Turning to Slide 9, field level controllable costs per BOE returned to trend from the higher fourth quarter level when we had higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. 2010 domestic field level controllable costs were $7.10 per BOE and for 2011, we expect it to be in the range of $7.25 to $8.30 per BOE. In International E&P, the 2010 field level controllable costs were $2.95 per BOE and for 2011, we expect a range of $3.20 to $4.40 per BOE with the largest portion of the increase due to the loss of the Libya production.
Exploration expense increased as a result of the approximately $159 million in dry well costs during the first quarter. This is attributed to costs associated with the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well and the Romeo prospect in Indonesia, which encountered water-bearing carbonates. In March 2011, we completed our evaluation to determine the options to develop the Flying Dutchman were not viable. 
Total expenses per BOE as shown on Slide 10 increased $0.59 per BOE from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the higher exploration expense and DD&A, partially offset by lower field level controllable costs. First quarter E&P segment income was $18.54 per BOE, a 43% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, again, primarily due to increased realizations.
Turning to Slide 11, in Oil Sands Mining. The segment income for the first quarter was $32 million, an increase of $23 million from the $9 million earned in the fourth quarter 2010, largely driven by higher synthetic crude realizations. Marathon's first quarter 2011 net synthetic crude sales, which is bitumen after upgrading including blendstocks, from the AOSP mining operation was 37,000 barrels per day compared to 38,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realizations increased $10 per barrel from their fourth quarter level.
Turning to Slide 12, in the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter segment income was $60 million, an increase of $27 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of the turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2010, methanol sales volumes increased. Moving to our Downstream financial results, as noted on Slide 13, RM&T's first quarter 2011 segment profit totaled $527 million compared to a $237 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2011 results against the same quarter in 2010.
Primary factors contributing to the increased segment income for the first quarter 2011 included a wider sweet/sour crude differential, increased sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs resulting from decreased planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses compared to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, the company was able to take advantage of the wider-than-normal crude oil differentials between WTI and other light sweet crudes such as LLS and Dated Brent, which resulted in relatively lower crude oil acquisition costs versus the comparable quarter last year. Sales volumes increased as a result of higher first-quarter 2011 refining throughputs compared to the same quarter in the previous year.
Primarily because of operating a fully integrated Garyville refinery for the entire first quarter of 2011, our total throughputs were up approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the December 1, 2010 sale of the St. Paul Park refinery. In addition, some other work, which we recently completed in our refineries to enhance the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, also improved last quarter's results over the first quarter 2010, as well as the higher prices we realized in the first quarter of 2011 on our SCCU gains.
Our manufacturing and other expenses were lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the corresponding quarter last year, primarily because we had much lower planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and other major Downstream project costs in the current quarter. Partially offsetting these positive improvements quarter-over-quarter, the average LLS crack spread decreased from $3.03 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010, based upon 57% of our production in the Midwest and 43% in the U.S. Gulf Coast during that quarter, to $0.71 per barrel in the first quarter 2011, based upon 53% of the production being in the Midwest market and 47% in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations did not increase as much as the average of the spot market gasoline, distillate and 3% resin prices used in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread calculation in the first quarter of 2011 versus the comparable quarter last year. Total refinery, crude oil throughput averaged 1,114,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 1,003,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,321,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010. Speedways' refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $23 million lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter 2010.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of outlets as a result of the Minnesota asset sale in December 2010. On a per gallon basis, Speedways' gasoline and distillate margins increased from $0.1195 per gallon in the first quarter of 2010 to $0.1308 per gallon in the first quarter of 2011. Speedways' same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 2%, while same-store gasoline volumes were comparable in both quarters.
Slide 15 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $2.2 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $436 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Proceeds from disposals of assets were $212 million and dividends paid totaled $178 million. 
This slide also reflects the financing activities carried out during the quarter in anticipation of the spinoff of our Downstream business at June 30 this year. 
Slide 16 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 10%, a 4 percentage point reduction from the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 was 43%. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 42% to 47%. As you may recall, these tax rates reflect a full year as an integrated company. Both the quarter and estimated annual rates are lower than expected primarily due to the suspension of production operations in Libya, where as you know, our effective tax rate is over 90%. The inclusion of only 2 months Libyan income and associated taxes in our estimated annual effective tax rate accordingly reduced the effective tax rate applicable to the first quarter.
With that, I will turn it over to Clarence Cazalot for a few comments."

I think the first question in terms of the increased guidance, which we would say is in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 barrels a day, largely is the result of our focus on reliability over the last several years that we believe has finally yielded some significant results expressed in the first quarter. And that specifically, we saw 100% reliability out of our Equatorial Guinea complex and we saw 95% reliability out of our Alpine complex. Both of those, for the type of assets they are, are world-class results and what we're forecasting is -- well, we can't expect to achieve those rates even though that we will certainly strive for that. We are expecting to achieve industry-leading reliability in those assets, which should allow us to show production increases for the remainder of the year. In addition, we obviously are showing continued growth from resource plays, particularly in Oklahoma and Bakken and we do expect to bring Arizona on stream as expected during the remainder of this year. So that, I hope, takes care of the first question that you had. The second question, with respect to Oil Sands, what I will say is that we're very excited and Charles made the announcement today that the 10th of 11 units in the upgrader has been delivered and so basically we are fully on schedule with the upgrader being able to match the mine performance. Essentially what that allows us to say is that we now have the capacity to actually produce this asset on a gross basis at 255,000 barrels a day, Marathon has a 20% share of that obviously. And what we expect is that our operating costs will now start to continue to decline as we have this larger fixed production against the fixed cost base. And so while we talked about operating expense being in the circa $55 per barrel range in the first quarter, we'd expect that, that would continue to fall for the year to give us a year range in that particular asset of maybe $35 to $45 a barrel which continuing to try to push down to lower levels. We already are seeing some outstanding production performance for the mine and then obviously, with the ISD, the fact that syncrudes are essentially trading at a par to Brent, with those operating cost numbers, you could see what the economic power of this asset is going to be for us, we think, on a perspective basis."

As we illustrated in the documents or in the slide presentation, we are about flat on first quarter same-store volume. However, I've said many times in presentations over the first quarter here that we expected if you get to around $3.75 or higher range, that's when you would start to see a reduction in volume and that has been the case. In fact, it started at the last week of March. We started to see a degradation in volume and we're down month-to-date here in April right around 5%. Now let me add, I don't believe all of that is demand from price across the biggest part of our market. We've had about 25 straight days of rain, which has completely shut down the farm and planting season and a lot of the outside contractor work as well. So 5%, if you take into account weather and we're up against the quarter last year that -- I mean, up against an April last year, that was a very, very good weather season.

And I think what we've done already in the Eagle Ford is a great example of that because certainly we're looking for opportunities to add the 10,000 plus acre positions. But we'll certainly add on 1,000 or 2,000 acres as we go forward. The broader question I think I'll start with the fact that we are oil-focused and so those assets that we're going to focus on are largely in liquids-rich plays as we've been pretty consistent on. I think you'll see us continue to move away from the Marcellus as an example because while, we think that's a great play and has great potential in terms of being a hydrocarbon resource base, it doesn't really fit our strategy. We would obviously like to increase our position in the Bakken since it's a key play for Marathon and we continue to think we have a leading operating position there. But financially, that doesn't make a lot of sense right now. It's a very overheated basin and so I think where you've seen us focus is the other three liquids-rich plays that we're focusing on in the Anadarko Woodford in Oklahoma, where we've now pushed our acreage position at 100,000 acres, which is quite substantially in that play. The 200,000 gross acres that we subsequently farm down in the Niobrara. We'll continue to look for opportunities there. And I think clearly the Eagle Ford is a play that we've got a significant focus on and we'll continue to have focus on as we still think there's opportunities out there. And I think that gives us the coverage that we need across a number of basins that give us exposure to liquids and appropriate risk profile."

Paul, the second part of your question is, and I know there's been sort of reports out, Marathon pumps multistage fracs. I think there is this misperception out there that we somehow don't do what some of the operators are doing. But it's really dependent on what area you're in and so when I think about the activities that we're engaged in and what we would call our Ramadan [ph] area, which is an area that we think typically has 500,000 barrels plus or minus that's recoverable per well, we are pumping 20 stage, 3 million pounds of frac jobs on those wells. We typically pump smaller jobs in some of the areas that we think have less recoverable oil because obviously the key there is to try to make the completions as financially attractive as possible. In our good wells, we're pumping up to 20 and 3 million pounds. And as we see results that indicate that we should pump more, then we will certainly be open to that."

For Marathon, because of the way that we're positioned and particularly because we have a proprietary storage, and we also have firm contracts with a number of the utilities, we are not going to see any impacts relative to our productive capacity.

Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the Appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2010 and first quarter of 2011, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full-year 2011 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows that our adjusted net income of almost $1.2 billion, was 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 276% increase from the first quarter of 2010. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2010. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, partially offset by lower E&P production sold as a result of the suspension of Libyan production operations and the downtime associated with the Droshky sidetrack completion during the quarter. Pretax earnings increased in all segments. 
Slide 5 shows the various impacts which led to a 35% increase in E&P segment income. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices and lower DD&A were partially offset by the lower sales volumes just discussed, along with higher income taxes. 
Slide 6 shows our historical price realizations. Our first quarter average price realization increased $9.39 per BOE compared to the fourth quarter 2010. Our liquid hydrocarbon realization increased $14.29 per barrel compared to an increase of $9.36 per barrel increase in the NYMEX prompt WTI price. About 65% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were priced off of Brent, which increased substantially more than WTI during the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the production volumes sold in the first quarter of 2011 were down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 to 400,000 BOE per day. While production available for sale decreased 5% to 398,000 BOE per day. As previously noted, the largest contributor to these decreases was the suspension of Libyan productions and the downtime associated with the Droshky sidetrack completion. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 975,000 BOE in the U.K., Norway and Alaska, offset by an underlift of 782,000 BOE in Libya and EG.
Slide 8 demonstrates the 18% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. For the full-year 2011, we now expect production available for sale to be between 345,000 and 365,000 BOE per day, which includes the first quarter production available for sale from Libya but excludes any additional Libya production for the year. This is about a 7,000 boepd increase to our previous guidance when excluding Libya.
Turning to Slide 9, field level controllable costs per BOE returned to trend from the higher fourth quarter level when we had higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. 2010 domestic field level controllable costs were $7.10 per BOE and for 2011, we expect it to be in the range of $7.25 to $8.30 per BOE. In International E&P, the 2010 field level controllable costs were $2.95 per BOE and for 2011, we expect a range of $3.20 to $4.40 per BOE with the largest portion of the increase due to the loss of the Libya production.
Exploration expense increased as a result of the approximately $159 million in dry well costs during the first quarter. This is attributed to costs associated with the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well and the Romeo prospect in Indonesia, which encountered water-bearing carbonates. In March 2011, we completed our evaluation to determine the options to develop the Flying Dutchman were not viable. 
Total expenses per BOE as shown on Slide 10 increased $0.59 per BOE from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the higher exploration expense and DD&A, partially offset by lower field level controllable costs. First quarter E&P segment income was $18.54 per BOE, a 43% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, again, primarily due to increased realizations.
Turning to Slide 11, in Oil Sands Mining. The segment income for the first quarter was $32 million, an increase of $23 million from the $9 million earned in the fourth quarter 2010, largely driven by higher synthetic crude realizations. Marathon's first quarter 2011 net synthetic crude sales, which is bitumen after upgrading including blendstocks, from the AOSP mining operation was 37,000 barrels per day compared to 38,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realizations increased $10 per barrel from their fourth quarter level.
Turning to Slide 12, in the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter segment income was $60 million, an increase of $27 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of the turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2010, methanol sales volumes increased. Moving to our Downstream financial results, as noted on Slide 13, RM&T's first quarter 2011 segment profit totaled $527 million compared to a $237 million segment loss in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2011 results against the same quarter in 2010.
Primary factors contributing to the increased segment income for the first quarter 2011 included a wider sweet/sour crude differential, increased sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs resulting from decreased planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses compared to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, the company was able to take advantage of the wider-than-normal crude oil differentials between WTI and other light sweet crudes such as LLS and Dated Brent, which resulted in relatively lower crude oil acquisition costs versus the comparable quarter last year. Sales volumes increased as a result of higher first quarter  2011 refining throughputs compared to the same quarter in the previous year.
Primarily because of operating a fully integrated Garyville refinery for the entire first quarter of 2011, our total throughputs were up approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the December 1, 2010 sale of the St. Paul Park refinery. In addition, some other work, which we recently completed in our refineries to enhance the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, also improved last quarter's results over the first quarter 2010, as well as the higher prices we realized in the first quarter of 2011 on our SCCU gains.
Our manufacturing and other expenses were lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the corresponding quarter last year, primarily because we had much lower planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and other major Downstream project costs in the current quarter. Partially offsetting these positive improvements quarter-over-quarter, the average LLS crack spread decreased from $3.03 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010, based upon 57% of our production in the Midwest and 43% in the U.S. Gulf Coast during that quarter, to $0.71 per barrel in the first quarter 2011, based upon 53% of the production being in the Midwest market and 47% in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations did not increase as much as the average of the spot market gasoline, distillate and 3% resin prices used in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread calculation in the first quarter of 2011 versus the comparable quarter last year. Total refinery, crude oil throughput averaged 1,114,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 1,003,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,321,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010. Speedways' refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $23 million lower in the first quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter 2010.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of outlets as a result of the Minnesota asset sale in December 2010. On a per gallon basis, Speedways' gasoline and distillate margins increased from $0.1195 per gallon in the first quarter of 2010 to $0.1308 per gallon in the first quarter of 2011. Speedways' same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 2%, while same-store gasoline volumes were comparable in both quarters.
Slide 15 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $2.2 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $436 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Proceeds from disposals of assets were $212 million and dividends paid totaled $178 million. 
This slide also reflects the financing activities carried out during the quarter in anticipation of the spinoff of our Downstream business at June 30 this year. 
Slide 16 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 10%, a 4 percentage point reduction from the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 was 43%. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 42% to 47%. As you may recall, these tax rates reflect a full year as an integrated company. Both the quarter and estimated annual rates are lower than expected primarily due to the suspension of production operations in Libya, where as you know, our effective tax rate is over 90%. The inclusion of only 2 months Libyan income and associated taxes in our estimated annual effective tax rate accordingly reduced the effective tax rate applicable to the first quarter.
With that, I will turn it over to Clarence Cazalot for a few comments."

I think the first question in terms of the increased guidance, which we would say is in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 barrels a day, largely is the result of our focus on reliability over the last several years that we believe has finally yielded some significant results expressed in the first quarter. And that specifically, we saw 100% reliability out of our Equatorial Guinea complex and we saw 95% reliability out of our Alpine complex. Both of those, for the type of assets they are, are world-class results and what we're forecasting is -- well, we can't expect to achieve those rates even though that we will certainly strive for that. We are expecting to achieve industry-leading reliability in those assets, which should allow us to show production increases for the remainder of the year. In addition, we obviously are showing continued growth from resource plays, particularly in Oklahoma and Bakken and we do expect to bring Arizona on stream as expected during the remainder of this year. So that, I hope, takes care of the first question that you had. The second question, with respect to Oil Sands, what I will say is that we're very excited and Charles made the announcement today that the 10th of 11 units in the upgrader has been delivered and so basically we are fully on schedule with the upgrader being able to match the mine performance. Essentially what that allows us to say is that we now have the capacity to actually produce this asset on a gross basis at 255,000 barrels a day, Marathon has a 20% share of that obviously. And what we expect is that our operating costs will now start to continue to decline as we have this larger fixed production against the fixed cost base. And so while we talked about operating expense being in the circa $55 per barrel range in the first quarter, we'd expect that, that would continue to fall for the year to give us a year range in that particular asset of maybe $35 to $45 a barrel which continuing to try to push down to lower levels. We already are seeing some outstanding production performance for the mine and then obviously, with the ISD, the fact that syncrudes are essentially trading at a par to Brent, with those operating cost numbers, you could see what the economic power of this asset is going to be for us, we think, on a perspective basis."

In fact, it started at the last week of March. We started to see a degradation in volume and we're down month-to-date here in April right around 5%. Now let me add, I don't believe all of that is demand from price across the biggest part of our market. We've had about 25 straight days of rain, which has completely shut down the farm and planting season and a lot of the outside contractor work as well. So 5%, if you take into account weather and we're up against the quarter last year that -- I mean, up against an April last year, that was a very, very good weather season.

And I think what we've done already in the Eagle Ford is a great example of that because certainly we're looking for opportunities to add the 10,000 plus acre positions. But we'll certainly add on 1,000 or 2,000 acres as we go forward. The broader question I think I'll start with the fact that we are oil-focused and so those assets that we're going to focus on are largely in liquids-rich plays as we've been pretty consistent on. I think you'll see us continue to move away from the Marcellus as an example because while, we think that's a great play and has great potential in terms of being a hydrocarbon resource base, it doesn't really fit our strategy. We would obviously like to increase our position in the Bakken since it's a key play for Marathon and we continue to think we have a leading operating position there. But financially, that doesn't make a lot of sense right now. It's a very overheated basin and so I think where  you've seen us focus is the other 3 liquids-rich plays that we're focusing on in the Anadarko Woodford in Oklahoma, where we've now pushed our acreage position at 100,000 acres, which is quite substantially in that play. The 200,000 gross acres that we subsequently farm down in the Niobrara. We'll continue to look for opportunities there. And I think clearly the Eagle Ford is a play that we've got a significant focus on and we'll continue to have focus on as we still think there's opportunities out there. And I think that gives us the coverage that we need across a number of basins that give us exposure to liquids and appropriate risk profile."

Now I think some of the numbers -- and Garry might be able to speak to this here, Peiffer, but some of the numbers and feedstocks, you probably need to add some of those feedstock numbers along with our finished product. And I'll let Garry comment on that."

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found in our website margin of welcome. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark him Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.
Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted income from continuing operations for 2010 and the first 2 quarters of 2011. Preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2011 and 2012 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted income from continuing operations on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted income from continuing operations of $0.96 per share reflects a 9% increase from the first quarter and a 55% increase from the second quarter.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change of pretax adjusted income from continuing operations by segment and the change in income taxes. The increase in income was driven by improved results in Oil Sands Mining and lower income taxes, reflecting no production from our Libya operations in the quarter. These were partially offset by a decrease in E&P pretax earnings. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balances was 67%. Excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balance, the rate was 54%. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2011, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balances to be between 50% and 55%.
As shown on Slide 5, E&P segment income compared to the first quarter was down about 10%, largely due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher realizations and lower costs. The lower sales volumes were a result of the Libyan conflict and downtime in Norway and Equatorial Guinea. 
Our historical realizations are shown on Slide 6. Our liquid hydrocarbon average realization increased $9.14 per barrel compared to the first quarter, which is largely in line with the $7.74 per barrel increase in WTI and the $11.61 per barrel increase in Dated Brent.
Moving to Slide 7, as a result of lower international [indiscernible], our second quarter sales volumes decreased 15%, while production available for sale decreased 13%, both primarily a result of the previously discussed downtime and conflict in Libya. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an underlift for the quarter of approximately 674,000 boe in the U.K. and Alaska, offset by an overlifted of 341,000 boe in EG and Norway. 
At the end of the second quarter, our cumulative international operations were underlifted by approximately 1.6 million barrels. Domestically, we remained 2 million boe cumulatively underlifted due to gas storage in Alaska.
Slide 8 shows that 7.5% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010 excluding Libya by quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9, exploration expense fell in the second quarter with lower drywell expense while field level control of cost per boe increased as a result of additional domestic workover expense, the lack of lower-cost Libyan production and turnaround cost of [indiscernible]. Also influencing per barrel costs were lower volumes in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 10, the second quarter E&P segment income increased 6%, primarily due to higher per boe realizations, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Total E&P expenses per boe were relatively unchanged.
Turning to Slide 11, the Oil Sands Mining segments improved results were largely driven by higher price and increased volumes, partially offset by higher operating and blend stock costs. DD&A and foreign income taxes were also higher because of the increased volumes. On a boe basis, operating cost or synthetic barrel actually declined moving from $54 per barrel in the first quarter to $46 per barrel in the second quarter. We expect the per barrel cost to continue to trend downward as reliability and production increased.
Moving to Slide 12 in the Integrated Gas segment. Second quarter segment income decreased $17 million, primarily as a result of lower sales volumes. 
Slide 13, while rather busy, provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2011. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $2.4 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $872 million as a result of increased commodity prices and ensuing higher payables related to Norwegian taxes. Capital expenditure were $1.7 billion, asset disposals generated proceeds of $371 million and dividends paid totaled $356 million, reflecting a $0.25 dividend of which we were retained 60% on a go-forward basis. As a result of the spinoff of the Downstream businesses, debt was reduced by $2.8 billion and distribution was made to NPC of just over $1.6 billion, while discontinued operations contributed $3.6 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $4.7 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the second quarter, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 2% but I would remind you we have the pending outcast Eagle Ford acquisition of $3.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments, expected to close November 1. Taking this into consideration, had the Eagle Ford acquisition closed in the second quarter of 2011, cash adjusted debt-to-capital would have been approximately 18%. As a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $221 million of debt service by U.S. Steel. 
With that, I will turn over the call to Clarence Cazalot for a few remarks."

As you're well aware, this was our last quarter as an integrated company, having spun-off NPC June 30 and I'm proud of the team that worked so diligently to make this happen. I wish everyone at NPC all the best. From a standpoint of our continuing operations, I'm personally not satisfied with our overall second quarter performance and I know our team feels the same way. The short-term liability issues and some of our international assets, which is as you know, have historically demonstrated outstanding reliability and a disappointing result at Droshky impacted both our second quarter production and financial results. Our international operations are now back at full speed and we are properly addressed the reliability issues.
Going forward, we are pursuing a more balanced lower risk and I believe more sustainable program of investment and growth in unconventional resource plays. This move is best demonstrated by the outstanding position we have built in the Eagle Ford, particularly with our pending 141,000 net acres acquisition, largely in the heart of the play. Building the position we have across the premier liquids-rich resource plays in North America is only the start and every member of our team understands that execution and results are how we will be judged. We'll be focused on growing both production and reserves on an absolute and per share basis and generating sufficient free cash flow to fund this growth.
Our emergence as an E&P company is more than just a name only. It's about delivering profitable growth and our increased guidance of 5% to 7% compound average growth between 2010 and 2016 is a good start in this regard. It's about a significantly higher level of drilling activity to deliver this growth, going from a 15 U.S. operated land rigs currently to over 40 rigs operating 18 months from now. It's about continuing to increase our overall resource position with a focus on liquids-rich plays and we are doing this.
Bottom line, it's about consistent execution and demonstrating profitable growth year-after-year and funding this growth from internally generated cash flow and that's precisely what we intend to do.
And now we will move to the Q&A."

And we consistently see 30-day IPs across the play of between 500 and 700 barrels per day. In terms of completed well costs, we generally are on the order of $7 million to $7.5 million of our wealth the Dave Dudlyke at this point to really talk about what's going to happen in the future because as you know, we have been probably a little bit slow in the minds of a lot of people in terms of how aggressively we completed our wells. And we got a significant stock of wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. The 28 that we have waiting are 26 of them will be 20 stage frac jobs, but they'll be pumped at 300 pounds per foot, which will put us in the range of what most people are seeing in terms of the larger states frac jobs. And we will be moving beginning in the next month or so towards outfitting our wells to be able to pump 30 stage fracs on a perspective basis for the remainder of life of the play. We expect that, that will add on the order of $500,000 to $1 million to the cost of our well. So we will be seeing those kinds of increases on a go-forward basis but we do expect that, that will at least increase the initial rates consistent with other operators have seen. And we're continuing to monitor the play to see if we should continue to move forward increasing the stages to accelerate the recovery in the play."

I would simply say that you characterize my position of the past correct. There are no sacred cows. I said many times before that we constantly review our portfolio in terms of those assets and opportunities that have the kind of growth and value creation that we want to invest in the future. And as you've seen in the past, we haven't hesitated to divest those assets that don't fit that. But we are indeed looking at our portfolio, particularly as we seek to generate additional funds to invest in profitable growth. We continue to see good opportunities coming our way in the attractive poor resource plays that we want to grow in. And as we view our investment, it's not all incremental. It's really about redeploying proceeds out of again less promising lower growth, more mature declining assets and into growth. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, I don't want to speculate about anyone asset at this time. We certainly, from an exploration standpoint, see the Gulf of Mexico as one of our better high potential exploration focus areas around the world. And as soon as we can get some permits to get back to drilling, that's what we intend to do out there. So that's where we are."

I think the measures that you'll see us focusing on with respect to our new business are really two-fold. One is production growth per share and we'll do that on a debt-adjusted basis. And again, that's an area that we recognize that a 5% to 7% compound average growth on a pure volumetric basis we may not be as high as some of our E&P brethren. But the reality is again from our standpoint, we believe we generate sufficient cash flows internally to fund our growth and so we won't be issuing equity or necessarily happen to go to the debt markets to fund our CapEx and indeed with sufficient free cash flow, having the ability to either pay down debt or potentially in certain instances buy back stocks. So that's a measure we think we can perform quite well on. And the other metric of course is the generation and growth in free cash flow and again we believe with the strong base, with a solid set of liquids-focused growth assets that we'll be executing on, we believe we'll perform well against that metric as well. So it is clearly a shift from what has been an earnings focus, a competitive group to now what is a cash focused group for all the reasons you know well in terms of different accounting methods between the 2 and again moving away from ROCE to really growth in volumes, both reserves and production."

The same time, one of the things we mentioned previously having a greater depth of rig inventory has given us a little bit more impact in cloud in terms of being able to contract for pressure pumping services.

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.
Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted income from continuing operations for 2010 and the first 2 quarters of 2011, preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2011 and 2012 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted income from continued operations on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted income from continued operations of $0.96 per share reflects a 9% increase from the first quarter and a 55% increase from the second quarter.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change in pretax adjusted income from continued operations by segment and the change in income taxes. The increase in income was driven by improved results in Oil Sands Mining and lower income taxes, reflecting no production from our Libya operations in the quarter. These were partially offset by a decrease in E&P pretax earnings.
The effective income tax rate for the second quarter, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, was 67%. Excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balance, the rate was 54%. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2011, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balances to be between 50% and 55%.
As shown on Slide 5, E&P segment income compared to the first quarter was down about 10% largely due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher realizations and lower cost. The lower sales volumes were a result of the Libyan conflict and downtime in Norway and Equatorial Guinea.
Our historical realizations are shown on Slide 6. Our liquid hydrocarbon average realization increased $9.14 per barrel compared to the first quarter, which is largely in line with the $7.74 per barrel increase in WTI and the $11.61 per barrel increase in Dated Brent.
Moving to Slide 7. As a result of lower international liftings, our second quarter sales volumes decreased 15%, while production available for sale decreased 13%, both primarily a result of the previously discussed downtime and conflict in Libya. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an underlift for the quarter of approximately 674,000 boe in the U.K. and Alaska, offset by an overlift of 341,000 boe in EG and Norway.
At the end of the second quarter, our cumulative international operations were underlifted by approximately 1.6 million barrels. Domestically, we remained 2 million boe cumulatively underlifted due to gas storage in Alaska.
Slide 8 shows the 7.5% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya, by quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Exploration expense fell in the second quarter with lower dry well expense, while field level controllable cost per boe increased as a result of additional domestic workover expense, the lack of lower-cost Libyan production and turnaround cost of Bre. Also influencing per barrel costs were lower volumes in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. The second quarter E&P segment income increased 6%, primarily due to higher per boe realizations, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Total E&P expenses per boe were relatively unchanged.
Turning to Slide 11. The Oil Sands Mining segment's improved results were largely driven by higher prices and increased volumes, partially offset by higher operating and blendstock costs. DD&A and foreign income taxes were also higher because of the increased volumes. On a boe basis, operating cost per synthetic barrel actually declined, moving from $54 per barrel in the first quarter to $46 per barrel in the second quarter. We expect the per barrel cost to continue to trend downward as reliability and production increase.
Moving to Slide 12, in the Integrated Gas segment. Second quarter segment income decreased $17 million, primarily as a result of lower sales volumes.
Slide 13, while rather busy, provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2011. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $2.4 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $872 million as a result of increased commodity prices and the ensuing higher payables related to Norwegian taxes. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion. Asset disposals generated proceeds of $371 million. And dividends paid totaled $356 million, reflecting a $0.25 dividend of which we will retain 60% on a go-forward basis. As a result of the spinoff of the Downstream businesses, debt was reduced by $2.8 billion and a distribution was made to MPC of just over $1.6 billion, while discontinued operations contributed $3.6 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $4.7 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the second quarter, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 2%. But I would remind you, we have the pending all-cash Eagle Ford acquisition of $3.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments, expected to close November 1. Taking this into consideration, had the Eagle Ford acquisition closed in the second quarter of 2011, cash adjusted debt-to-capital would have been approximately 18%. As a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $221 million of debt service by U.S. Steel.
With that, I will turn over the call to Clarence Cazalot for a few remarks."

And I'm proud of the team that worked so diligently to make this happen. I wish everyone at MPC all the best.
From the standpoint of our continuing operations, I'm personally not satisfied with our overall second quarter performance, and I know our team feels the same way. The short-term liability issues in some of our international assets, which as you know have historically demonstrated outstanding reliability, and the disappointing results at Droshky impacted both our second quarter production and financial results. Our international operations are now back at full speed, and we appropriately addressed the reliability issues.
Going forward, we are pursuing a more balanced lower risk and, I believe, more sustainable program of investment and growth in unconventional resource plays. This move is best demonstrated by the outstanding position we have built in the Eagle Ford, particularly with our pending 141,000 net acre acquisition, largely in the heart of the play. Building the position we have across the premier liquids-rich resource plays in North America is only the start, and every member of our team understands that execution and results are how we will be judged. We'll be focused on growing both production and reserves on an absolute and per-share basis and generating sufficient free cash flow to fund this growth.
Our emergence as an E&P company is more than just a name only. It's about delivering profitable growth, and our increased guidance of 5% to 7% compound average growth between 2010 and 2016 is a good start in this regard. It's about a significantly higher level of drilling activity to deliver this growth, going from a 15 U.S.-operated land rigs currently to over 40 rigs operating 18 months from now. It's about continuing to increase our overall resource position with a focus on liquids-rich plays, and we are doing this.
Bottom line, it's about consistent execution and demonstrating profitable growth year-after-year and funding this growth from internally generated cash flow. And that's precisely what we intend to do.
And now we will move to the Q&As."

And we consistently see 30-day IPs across the play of between 500 and 700 barrels per day. In terms of completed well costs, we generally are on the order of $7 million to $7.5 million for our wells today. But I'd like, at this point, really to talk about what's going to happen in the future because, as you know, we have been probably a little bit slow in the minds of a lot of people in terms of how aggressively we completed our wells. And we got a significant stock of wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. The 28 that we have waiting are 26 of them will be 20 stage frac jobs, but they'll be pumped at 300 pounds per foot, which will put us in the range of what most people are seeing in terms of the larger states frac jobs. And we will be moving beginning in the next month or so towards outfitting our wells to be able to pump 30 stage fracs on a perspective basis for the remainder of life in the play. We expect that, that will add on the order of $500,000 to $1 million to the costs of our well. So we'll be seeing those kind of increases on a go-forward basis, but we do expect that, that will at least increase the initial rates consistent with other operators have seen. And we'll to continue to monitor the play to see if we should continue to move forward by increasing the stages to accelerate the recovery in the play."

I would simply say that you characterize my position of the past correctly. There are no sacred cows. I've said many times before that we constantly review our portfolio in terms of those assets and opportunities that have the kind of growth and value creation that we want to invest in the future. And as you've seen in the past, we haven't hesitated to divest those assets that don't fit that. We are indeed looking at our portfolio, particularly as we seek to generate additional funds to invest in profitable growth. We continue to see good opportunities coming our way in the attractive poor resource plays that we want to grow in. And as we view our investment, it's not all incremental. It's really about redeploying proceeds out of, again, less-promising, lower-growth, more mature declining assets and into growth. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, Arjun, I don't want to speculate about any one asset at this time.

And so we won't be issuing equity or necessarily having to go to the debt markets to fund our CapEx and indeed with sufficient free cash flow, having the ability to either pay down debt or potentially, in certain instances, buy back stocks.

They're outfitted obviously a little bit differently for cold weather service than they might be for the ones that we're going to have in South Texas. Part and parcel of that is they have a very diligent training program to make sure that we that qualified crews at the same time we get the rigs, so that's important. The same time, one of the things that we mentioned is previously having a greater depth of rig inventory has given us a little bit more impact in cloud in terms of being able to contract for pressure pumping services. And we're on the cusp of getting contractual line of sight on the pumping services requirements and ancillary services that we need in order to get all the stuff done.

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.
Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted income from continuing operations for 2010 and the first 2 quarters of 2011, preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2011 and 2012 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted income from continued operations on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted income from continued operations of $0.96 per share reflects a 9% increase from the first quarter and a 55% increase from the second quarter.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change in pretax adjusted income from continued operations by segment and the change in income taxes. The increase in income was driven by improved results in Oil Sands Mining and lower income taxes, reflecting no production from our Libya operations in the quarter. These were partially offset by a decrease in E&P pretax earnings.
The effective income tax rate for the second quarter, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, was 67%. Excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balance, the rate was 54%. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2011, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our deferred tax balances to be between 50% and 55%.
As shown on Slide 5, E&P segment income compared to the first quarter was down about 10% largely due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher realizations and lower cost. The lower sales volumes were a result of the Libyan conflict and downtime in Norway and Equatorial Guinea.
Our historical realizations are shown on Slide 6. Our liquid hydrocarbon average realization increased $9.14 per barrel compared to the first quarter, which is largely in line with the $7.74 per barrel increase in WTI and the $11.61 per barrel increase in Dated Brent.
Moving to Slide 7. As a result of lower international liftings, our second quarter sales volumes decreased 15%, while production available for sale decreased 13%, both primarily a result of the previously discussed downtime and conflict in Libya. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an underlift for the quarter of approximately 674,000 boe in the U.K. and Alaska, offset by an overlift of 341,000 boe in EG and Norway.
At the end of the second quarter, our cumulative international operations were underlifted by approximately 1.6 million barrels. Domestically, we remained 2 million boe cumulatively underlifted due to gas storage in Alaska.
Slide 8 shows the 7.5% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya, by quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Exploration expense fell in the second quarter with lower dry well expense, while field level controllable cost per boe increased as a result of additional domestic work over expense, the lack of lower-cost Libyan production and turnaround cost of Brae. Also influencing per barrel costs were lower volumes in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. The second quarter E&P segment income increased 6%, primarily due to higher per boe realizations, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Total E&P expenses per boe were relatively unchanged.
Turning to Slide 11. The Oil Sands Mining segment's improved results were largely driven by higher prices and increased volumes, partially offset by higher operating and blend stock costs. DD&A and foreign income taxes were also higher because of the increased volumes. On a boe basis, operating cost per synthetic barrel actually declined, moving from $54 per barrel in the first quarter to $46 per barrel in the second quarter. We expect the per barrel cost to continue to trend downward as reliability and production increase.
Moving to Slide 12, in the Integrated Gas segment. Second quarter segment income decreased $17 million, primarily as a result of lower sales volumes.
Slide 13, while rather busy, provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2011. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $2.4 billion. Our cash balance was increased by working capital changes of $872 million as a result of increased commodity prices and the ensuing higher payables related to Norwegian taxes. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion. Asset disposals generated proceeds of $371 million. And dividends paid totaled $356 million, reflecting a $0.25 dividend of which we will retain 60% on a go-forward basis. As a result of the spin-off of the Downstream businesses, debt was reduced by $2.8 billion and a distribution was made to MPC of just over $1.6 billion, while discontinued operations contributed $3.6 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $4.7 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the second quarter, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 2%. But I would remind you, we have the pending all-cash Eagle Ford acquisition of $3.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments, expected to close November 1. Taking this into consideration, had the Eagle Ford acquisition closed in the second quarter of 2011, cash adjusted debt-to-capital would have been approximately 18%. As a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $221 million of debt service by U.S. Steel.
With that, I will turn over the call to Clarence Cazalot for a few remarks."

And I'm proud of the team that worked so diligently to make this happen. I wish everyone at MPC all the best.
From the standpoint of our continuing operations, I'm personally not satisfied with our overall second quarter performance, and I know our team feels the same way. The short-term liability issues in some of our international assets, which as you know have historically demonstrated outstanding reliability, and the disappointing results at Droshky impacted both our second quarter production and financial results. Our international operations are now back at full speed, and we have properly addressed the reliability issues.
Going forward, we are pursuing a more balanced lower risk and, I believe, more sustainable program of investment and growth in unconventional resource plays. This move is best demonstrated by the outstanding position we have built in the Eagle Ford, particularly with our pending 141,000 net acre acquisition, largely in the heart of the play. Building the position we have across the premier liquids-rich resource plays in North America is only the start, and every member of our team understands that execution and results are how we will be judged. We'll be focused on growing both production and reserves on an absolute and per-share basis and generating sufficient free cash flow to fund this growth.
Our emergence as an E&P company is more than just a name only. It's about delivering profitable growth, and our increased guidance of 5% to 7% compound average growth between 2010 and 2016 is a good start in this regard. It's about a significantly higher level of drilling activity to deliver this growth, going from a 15 U.S.-operated land rigs currently to over 40 rigs operating 18 months from now. It's about continuing to increase our overall resource position with a focus on liquids-rich plays, and we are doing this.
Bottom line, it's about consistent execution and demonstrating profitable growth year-after-year and funding this growth from internally generated cash flow. And that's precisely what we intend to do.
And now we will move to the Q&As."

I think we're still very happy with the estimates that we have across the play for the various EURs that we have. And I think we've been fairly consistent that in what we would consider the poorer areas there on the border of 450,000 barrels, and we're seeing 500,000 to 600,000 in our more promising areas, Myrmidon and EMEA. And we consistently see 30-day IPs across the play of between 500 and 700 barrels per day. In terms of completed well costs, we generally are on the order of $7 million to $7.5 million for our wells today. But I'd like, at this point, really to talk about what's going to happen in the future because, as you know, we have been probably a little bit slow in the minds of a lot of people in terms of how aggressively we completed our wells. And we got a significant stock of wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. The 28 that we have waiting are -- 26 of them will be 20 stage frac jobs, but they'll be pumped at 300 pounds per foot, which will put us in the range of what most people are seeing in terms of the larger states frac jobs. And we will be moving beginning in the next month or so towards outfitting our wells to be able to pump 30 stage fracs on a perspective basis for the remainder of life in the play. We expect that, that will add on the order of $500,000 to $1 million to the costs of our well. So we'll be seeing those kind of increases on a go-forward basis, but we do expect that, that will at least increase the initial rates consistent with other operators have seen. And we'll to continue to monitor the play to see if we should continue to move forward by increasing those stages to accelerate the recovery in the play."

I'm just curious, now as an independent, how do you see the areas you're in, and the Gulf of Mexico is one of the areas I'm thinking about. Droshky is obviously a recent disappointment, as the Neptune before it. It's a shorter reserve life area. You're starting to gain some critical mass in the shale plays, which tended to receive better valuations amongst the E&P analysts. How are you thinking about your portfolio now as independent and, I guess, specifically the Gulf of Mexico and should that remain a part of your portfolio?"

I would simply say that you characterize my position of the past correctly. There are no sacred cows. I've said many times before that we constantly review our portfolio in terms of those assets and opportunities that have the kind of growth and value creation that we want to invest in the future. And as you've seen in the past, we haven't hesitated to divest of those assets that don't fit that. But we are indeed looking at our portfolio, particularly as we seek to generate additional funds to invest in profitable growth. We continue to see good opportunities coming our way in the attractive poor resource plays that we want to grow in. And as we view our investment, it's not all incremental. It's really about redeploying proceeds out of, again, less-promising, lower-growth, more mature declining assets and into growth. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, Arjun, I don't want to speculate about any one asset at this time. We certainly, from an exploration standpoint, see the Gulf of Mexico as one of our better high-potential exploration focus areas around the world. And as soon as we can get some permits to get back to drilling, that's what we intend to do out there. So that's where we are."

That's indeed critical mass. But at the same time, I think, as we've indicated, we continue to seek bolt-on acquisitions in those core areas to grow our position. Again, this is a program that we operate, that we drive the value creation in and to the extent we can have a broader opportunity set or indeed even have a higher interest in the wells that we're already going to be drilling. That's of great interest to us. So that's where you're going to see us putting our incremental dollars in terms of building our positions there. You know what I like about the Eagle Ford is not simply our total position but our position in the core area. As we've indicated, we believe we have a top-5 leasehold position in that core area, and we see a great deal of upside certainly in terms of productivity but also the ability to down space in those areas.

And the first well that we'll drill will be to test that particular concept, and then we'll go ahead and drill out. I guess I would say one of the reasons that we did the farm-downs that we did was to make sure that we had a very large acreage exposure, but making sure that the financial exposure to the play is relevant to the size of the company we are.

And again, that's an area that we recognized that, at 5% to 7% compound average growth on a pure volumetric basis, we may not be as high as some of our E&P brethren. But the reality is, again from our standpoint, we believe we generate sufficient cash flows internally to fund our growth. And so we won't be issuing equity or necessarily having to go to the debt markets to fund our CapEx and indeed with sufficient free cash flow, having the ability to either pay down debt or potentially, in certain instances, buy back stocks. So that's a measure we think we can perform quite well on. And the other metric of course is the generation and growth in free cash flow. And again we believe, with the strong base, with a solid set of liquids-focused growth assets that we'll be executing on, we believe, will perform well against that metric as well. So it is clearly a shift from what has been an earnings focus, a competitive group, to now what is a cash-focused group for all the reasons you know well in terms of different accounting methods between the 2 and again moving away from ROCE to really growth in volumes, both reserves and production."

These are fairly elementary-type systems, so it's not that big of a deal, but 2 things that gives you. Number one, and most importantly, it tests the fiscal regime that you have because there's reports that the people are getting paid for the cost barrels in Kurdistan. We think that's very important, from an overall risk standpoint. And then secondly, these are fractured carbonate reservoirs, notoriously tricky, and so getting some extended production data out of this will tell us what it is that we ultimately have.

They're outfitted obviously a little bit differently for cold weather service than they might be for the ones that we're going to have in South Texas. Part and parcel of that is they have a very diligent training program to make sure that we that qualified crews at the same time we get the rigs, so that's important. The same time, one of the things that we mentioned is previously having a greater depth of rig inventory has given us a little bit more impact and clout in terms of being able to contract for pressure pumping services. And we're on the cusp of getting contractual line of sight on the pumping services requirements and ancillary services that we need in order to get all the stuff done.

Obviously, for independent, the dividend yield is probably less important than it was for the integrated, and as it is, we're that near the top end of our competitor group in terms of yield. So to the extent that we've got excess cash being generated, stock buyback is absolutely one of the tools that we would use to optimize our balance sheet."

We continue to have discussions with the government of EG about what's the most practical way to continue to expand our position there, but we continue to believe, and we think the government supports the fact that the most economic and viable way is to utilize the equipment that we already have in EG LNG.

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.
Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix to this presentation there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted income from continuing operations for 2010 and the first 3 quarters of 2011 and preliminary balance sheet information.
On Slide 3, you'll see the third quarter 2011 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $421 million with a 39% decrease, excuse me  from the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was largely driven by noncash charge of $227 million for foreign tax credits that we currently expect the company to be unable to utilized in the future periods.
This noncash charge is largely driven by an outlook of higher-than-originally-anticipated Brent pricing and a higher production outlook for Norway. 
As indicated on Slide 4, excluding the higher effective tax rate for the quarter, segment income improved across all 3 segments compared to the second quarter results. In addition to the previously discussed increase in taxes related to foreign tax credits, a higher proportion of third quarter earnings came from the international operations also contributing to an increase in taxes.
As shown on Slide 5, the E&P segment third quarter to second quarter price and volume [indiscernible], essentially offset lower DD&A and exploration expenses were largely offset by an increase in other expenses. The other expense category was higher primarily because of higher field level controllable, associated with the timing of international liftings. This leads almost entire difference in the quarters related to previously discussed change in mix and noncash deferred taxes.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights 305 per BOE decrease in our average realization. This decrease was driven by $5.69 per barrel decline in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations were $0.40 per Mcf lower quarter-to-quarter. Our liquids realizations were in line with the average of $12.80 decrease in WTI and a $4.02 decrease in Brent, largely because of our higher exposure to Brent.
Our natural gas price realizations fell more than the move and the market indicators because we had a higher percentage of lower price international gas and the lagging price impacts in Alaska.
Moving to Slide 7, E&P production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 4% from the second quarter while production available for sale increased 1%. Europe was overlifted by almost 1 million BOE in the quarter, while EG was underlifted by 330,000 BOE and Alaska added 100,000 BOE to gas storage. As of the end of the quarter, our cumulative international underlift position was approximately 950,000 barrels you could this consists of underlifts in EG and Libya of 600,000 and 850,000 barrels, respectively, offset by cumulative overlift in Europe of 500,000 barrels. Domestically, we are 2.1 million BOE underlifted as a result of gas storage in Alaska.
Slide 8 shows the more than 8% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. 
Slide 9 shows Marathon's E&P cost structure by category over the past 7 quarters. DD&A increased through the fourth quarter 2010, but has started to decline in the past 2 quarters as a result of lower Gulf of Mexico volumes exploration expenses per boe dropped again this quarter primarily driven by lower dry well expense.
Turning to Slide 10, the third quarter E&P segment income decreased 48% primarily due to the previously discussed higher taxes. Lower per BOE realizations were partially offset by reduced expenses. Total E&P expenses per BOE were lower by $2.01. 
Turning to Slide 11, improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income third quarter to second was primarily a result of higher volumes from a full quarter with the expanded facility partially offset by lower price realizations. 
And to finish our segment reporting, Slide 12, shows that the Integrated Gas segment income was $55 million compared to the $43 million recorded in the second quarter 2011. This was primarily a result of the sale of our 30% interest in the [indiscernible] Alaska LNG facility and higher LNG and methanol sales volumes in EG. 
Slide 13 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, before changes in our working capital, was approximately $1.3 billion. While working capital changes reduced cash by $262 million, we had capital expenditures of $735 million. Asset sales contributed $14 million. We paid dividends of $106 million and we repurchased 12 million shares of common stock for $300 million. Our cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $4.6 billion. 
Slide 14 goes to the 9-month preliminary cash flow analysis but for the second time, I won't go through this line by line.
As shown on slide 15, at the end of the third quarter of 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 2%. But remember, that we are today closing on the 141,000-acre Hilcorp deal and by the end of this year, including the Hilcorp deal, expect to close in the purchase of nearly 167,000 acres in Eagle Ford, largely in the quarter, totaling approximately $4.5 billion.
As a reminder, the net debt-to-capital ratio, includes about $217 million of debt service by U.S. deal and almost all is contractually required to be removed from our balance sheet by the end of this year. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from Kenai operations to be between 55% and 62% from Q4 2011, the full year 2011 effective tax rate, including discontinued operations, is estimated to be between 50% and 56% and both of these estimates exclude special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurements of our balances.
Slide 16 is one we generally have in the Appendix, but we want to highlight the production targets for the fourth quarter of this year and for 2012. Excluding any production from Libya, we expect our 2012 production to be approximately 5% higher than 2011. 
This is even more evident as we turn to Slide 17, where you can see that our projected lower 48 production, excluding the Gulf of Mexico, is estimated to grow from 75,000 boepd to between 120,000 and 130,000 boepd over the next 5 quarters, a 60% to 73% increase.
And on Slide 18, we have provided estimates, production and effective tax rates by country for 2012. 
And with that, we will open up the call to questions. I would ask you to keep your questions to one and a follow-up, or 2 separate questions. Thank you."

We also said -- excuse me, that the effective date of the transaction was May 1. And so certainly, any of the costs that were realized between the May 1 effective date and the November 1 closing date, those costs less whatever revenue, would be reflected in the closing adjustments. So you recognize that the activity continued very strongly on that Hilcorp acreage. They actually exceeded the number of wells they had committed to both drill and complete. So pretty significant expenditure on the assets, took the production as you know from 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, as of June 1 to, as we said almost 13,000 barrels a day net, currently. So you certainly have the closing adjustments -- excuse, me, as a portion of that. We also said at the time of the acquisition that was roughly 14,000 net acres made up of those tag along rights under the existing lease agreement, as well as follow-on acreage that we would attempt to secure. So as compared to the 14,000 as you've seen now, we've actually acquired some 26,000 net acres and what I would say is that 26,000 acres is largely as Howard said in his remarks, in the core part of the play. And importantly, it is associated with the Hilcorp acreage. And so that's [indiscernible] we said our average working interest was 65%. Our average working interest now in the Hilcorp acreage will be 76.5%. The other component that's in that $4.5 billion that wasn't talked about back in June, it was the purchase of the gas gathering line that is really key to these assets. It's the main gas gathering line that runs through this acreage and allows us to tie in indirectly to Kinder Morgan and access their gas plants and the South gas plants. And so put that together, additional acreage, closing adjustments and the gas gathering line and that's how you get to the higher closing costs."

We will generate more income from Norway and more foreign tax credit Form Norway in the future years that we will be able to utilize. So therefore the foreign tax credit that we are generating this year, we have to put an announced against. But I think the important thing is that on a go-forward basis, we will be able to continue to repatriate cash earnings from low tax jurisdictions without having to pay an incremental U.S. that's because of the foreign tax credit situation we're in."

We're going to allocate our drilling rig resources as quickly as we can to the highest value part of this way, which is in the condensate window. So we obviously have some work to do in terms of making sure we maintain our lease position in those areas that we want to maintain our lease position in 2012. But whenever we have discretionary ability, we will devote for the majority of the 17 rigs to the core of the Eagle Ford and to drilling gas condensate well. I would say though that is consistent to Woodford as well. All of the wells we have in the plan are going to be in the condensate window, the Woodford because clearly that is the strongest portion of that play.

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO and Treasurer; and David Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.
Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix to this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted income from continuing operations for 2010 and the first 3 quarters of 2011 and preliminary balance sheet information.
On Slide 3, you'll see the third quarter 2011 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $421 million with a 39% increase -- decrease, excuse me, from the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was largely driven by a noncash charge of $227 million for foreign tax credit that we currently expect the company to be unable to utilized in the future periods. This noncash charge is largely driven by an outlook of higher than originally anticipated Brent pricing and a higher production outlook for Norway. 
As indicated on Slide 4, excluding the higher effective tax rate for the quarter, segment income improved across all 3 segments compared to the second quarter results. In addition to the previously discussed increase in taxes related to foreign tax credits, a higher proportion of third quarter earnings came from the international operations, also contributing to an increase in taxes.
As shown on Slide 5, the E&P segment third quarter to second quarter price and volume variances essentially offset. Lower DD&A and exploration expenses were largely offset by an increase in other expenses. The other expense category was higher primarily because of higher field level controllable associated with the timing of international liftings. This leads almost the entire difference in the quarters related to previously discussed change in mix and noncash deferred taxes.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights $3.05 per BOE decrease in our average realization. This decrease was driven by a $5.69 per barrel decline in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations were $0.40 per Mcf lower quarter-to-quarter. Our liquids realizations were in line with the average of a $12.80 decrease in WTI and a $4.02 decrease in Brent, largely because of our higher exposure to Brent. Our natural gas price realizations fell more than the move and the market indicators because we had a higher percentage of lower priced international gas and the lagging price impacts in Alaska.
Moving to Slide 7, E&P production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 4% from the second quarter, while production available for sale increased 1%. Europe was overlifted by almost 1 million BOE in the quarter, while EG was underlifted by 330,000 BOE and Alaska added 100,000 BOE to gas storage. As of the end of the quarter, our cumulative international underlift position was approximately 950,000 barrels. This consists of underlifts in EG and Libya of 600,000 and 850,000 barrels, respectively, offset by cumulative overlift in Europe of 500,000 barrels. Domestically, we are 2.1 million BOE underlifted as a result of gas storage in Alaska.
Slide 8 shows the more than 8% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. 
Slide 9 shows Marathon's E&P cost structure by category over the past 7 quarters. DD&A increased through the fourth quarter of 2010 but has started to decline in the past 2 quarters as a result of lower Gulf of Mexico volumes, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped again this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense.
Turning to Slide 10. The third quarter E&P segment income decreased 48% primarily due to the previously discussed higher taxes. Lower per BOE realizations were partially offset by reduced expenses. Total E&P expenses per BOE were lower by $2.01. 
Turning to Slide 11. The improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income, third quarter to second, was primarily a result of higher volumes from a full quarter with the expanded facility partially offset by lower price realizations. 
And to finish our segment reporting, Slide 12 shows that the Integrated Gas segment income was $55 million compared to the $43 million recorded in the second quarter of 2011. This was primarily a result of the sale of our 30% interest in the Kenai, Alaska LNG facility and higher LNG and methanol sales volumes in EG. 
Slide 13 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, before changes in our working capital, was approximately $1.3 billion, while working capital changes reduced cash by $262 million. We had capital expenditures of $735 million. Asset sales contributed $14 million. We paid dividends of $106 million, and we repurchased 12 million shares of common stock for $300 million. Our cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $4.6 billion. 
Slide 14 goes to the 9-month preliminary cash flow analysis, but for the second time, I won't go through this line by line.
As shown on Slide 15, at the end of the third quarter of 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 2%. But remember that we are today closing on the 141,000-acre Hilcorp deal and by the end of this year, including the Hilcorp deal, expect to close on the purchase of nearly 167,000 acres in the Eagle Ford, largely in the core, totaling approximately $4.5 billion. As a reminder, the net debt-to-capital ratio includes about $217 million of debt service by U.S. deal and almost all is contractually required to be removed from our balance sheet by the end of this year. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 55% and 62% from Q4 2011. The full year 2011 effective tax rate, including discontinued operations, is estimated to be between 50% and 56%. And both of these estimates exclude special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurements of our tax balances.
Slide 16 is one we generally have in the appendix, but we want to highlight the production targets for the fourth quarter of this year and for 2012. Excluding any production from Libya, we expect our 2012 production to be approximately 5% higher than 2011. 
This is even more evident as we turn to Slide 17, where you can see that our projected Lower 48 production, excluding the Gulf of Mexico, is estimated to grow from 75,000 boepd to between 120,000 and 130,000 boepd over the next 5 quarters, a 60% to 73% increase.
And on Slide 18, we have provided estimates, production and effective tax rates by country for 2012. 
And with that, we will open up the call to questions. I would ask you to keep your questions to one and a follow-up or 2 separate questions. Thank you."

But as we've said, consistently, our #1 priority is reinvesting back in the business. And I think you've really seen that here in this quarter. You've seen it with our acquisitions in the Eagle Ford. But again, I think it demonstrates that, that is a vehicle with respect to the use of our cash that we're not hesitant to use."

I think you have to go back and remember June 1, when we talked about the Hilcorp acquisition. We said 141,000 net acres for $3.5 billion. We also said -- excuse me, that the effective date of the transaction was May 1. And so certainly, any of the c",360,"Yes. I think you have to go back and remember June 1, when we talked about the Hilcorp acquisition. We said 141,000 net acres for $3.5 billion. We also said -- excuse me, that the effective date of the transaction was May 1. And so certainly, any of the costs that were realized between the May 1 effective date and the November 1 closing date, those costs less whatever revenue would be reflected in the closing adjustment. So you recognize that the activity continued very strongly on that Hilcorp acreage. They actually exceeded the number of wells they had committed to both drill and complete. So pretty significant expenditure on the assets. It took the production, as you know, from 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net as of June 1, to as we said almost 13,000 barrels a day net currently. So you certainly have the closing adjustments -- excuse me, as a portion of that -- excuse me. We also said at the time of the acquisition, there was roughly 14,000 net acres made up of those tag-along rights under the existing lease agreements, as well as follow-on acreage that we would attempt to secure. And so as compared to the 14,000, as you've seen now, we've actually acquired some 26,000 net acres and what I would say is that 26,000 acres is largely, as Howard said in his remarks, in the core part of the play. And importantly, it is associated with the Hilcorp acreage. And so back in June, we said our average working interest was 65%. Our average working interest now in the Hilcorp acreage will be 76.5%. The other component that's in that $4.5 billion that wasn't talked about back in June, it was the purchase of the gas gathering line that is really key to these assets. It's the main gas gathering line that runs through this acreage and allows us to tie in directly to Kinder Morgan and access their gas plant and the Southcross gas plants. So put all that together, additional acreage, closing adjustments and the gas gathering line, and that's how you get to the higher closing cost."

What we basically did was pick an allowance against our foreign tax credit because we are seeing now with the higher Brent price. We think that can last longer than we initially have at the beginning of the year. And in fact, production outlook has improved during the planned period. We will generate more income from Norway and more foreign tax credit from Norway in the future years than we will be able to utilize. So therefore, the foreign tax credit that we are generating this year, we have to put an allowance against. But I think the important thing is that on a go-forward basis, we will be able to continue to repatriate cash earnings from low tax jurisdictions without having to pay any incremental U.S. tax because of the foreign tax credit situation we're in."

And then that's indeed we have a slide here in the presentation showing the Lower 48, excluding Gulf of Mexico with very substantial growth because clearly, it's the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and perhaps the Woodford that are the primary drivers of that growth year-on-year, '11 to '12."

And we're clearly going to take a look at that because it goes to the first question you asked. We're going to allocate our drilling rig resources as quickly as we can to the highest value part of this play, which is in the condensate window. So we obviously have some work to do in terms of making sure we maintain our lease position in those areas that we want to maintain our lease position in 2012. But whenever we have discretionary ability, we will devote the majority of the 17 rigs to the core of the Eagle Ford and to drilling gas condensate well. I would say though that is consistent to Woodford as well.

Those are pieces of equipment that do well when they're left idle for the period of time that we've been away. And so we have to physically get out there and see what we have on the surface. We have to be able to return a lot of our employees to be able to actually physically do that work, and then we'll have to engage in some subsurface work to see exactly what it is we've got in terms of repair jobs so we can determine when the restoration is going to be. All of that is predicated on the front-end work, making sure that it's a secure place for our people to work and that the United States government is on site in terms of making sure that our re-entry is compliant with all their laws and regulations.

And so certainly, by the end of the year, we'll have a much broader understanding of what's going on out there. But the big area, a lot of work to do before we get too overconfident, the Eagle Ford, we'll be doing multiple pilots both at looking at a simple 80-acre downspacing and then further downspacing to see exactly what's an optimum drainage pattern at various places in the field. That will happen in the first half of next year.

But more importantly, there's a lot of activity of driving towards the Corpus Christi Bay, which is going to put this on a water-based market, which we feel pretty good about. We have very good coverage for our volumes for the initial stages of the play, and we're currently engaged in looking at what our longer term optionality is going to be. So we feel very good about the exit capacity there. We've been a little bit concerned about some of the bottlenecking -- bottlenecks that have been developing the Bakken, largely around road traffics in terms of the able to truck most of our crew at least to the transit point either through rail or piping. As you know, we had a pretty solid base arrangement with what we thought was going to be our top end volumes with some local refineries. And we've now -- are now in the process of making arrangements to get our oil on pipes and rail to get it out of there so we can continue to enjoy some of the benefit of higher netback there.

On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO and Treasurer; and David Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.
Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix to this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted income from continuing operations for 2010 and the first 3 quarters of 2011 and preliminary balance sheet information.
On Slide 3, you'll see the third quarter 2011 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $421 million with a 39% increase -- decrease, excuse me, from the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was largely driven by a noncash charge of $227 million for foreign tax credit that we currently expect the company to be unable to utilized in the future periods. This noncash charge is largely driven by an outlook of higher than originally anticipated Brent pricing and a higher production outlook for Norway. 
As indicated on Slide 4, excluding the higher effective tax rate for the quarter, segment income improved across all 3 segments compared to the second quarter results. In addition to the previously discussed increase in taxes related to foreign tax credits, a higher proportion of third quarter earnings came from the international operations, also contributing to an increase in taxes.
As shown on Slide 5, the E&P segment third quarter to second quarter price and volume variances essentially offset. Lower DD&A and exploration expenses were largely offset by an increase in other expenses. The other expense category was higher primarily because of higher field level controllable associated with the timing of international liftings. This leads almost the entire difference in the quarters related to previously discussed change in mix and noncash deferred taxes.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights $3.05 per BOE decrease in our average realization. This decrease was driven by a $5.69 per barrel decline in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations were $0.40 per Mcf lower quarter-to-quarter. Our liquids realizations were in line with the average of a $12.80 decrease in WTI and a $4.02 decrease in Brent, largely because of our higher exposure to Brent. Our natural gas price realizations fell more than the move and the market indicators because we had a higher percentage of lower priced international gas and the lagging price impacts in Alaska.
Moving to Slide 7, E&P production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 4% from the second quarter, while production available for sale increased 1%. Europe was overlifted by almost 1 million BOE in the quarter, while EG was underlifted by 330,000 BOE and Alaska added 100,000 BOE to gas storage. As of the end of the quarter, our cumulative international underlift position was approximately 950,000 barrels. This consists of underlifts in EG and Libya of 600,000 and 850,000 barrels, respectively, offset by cumulative overlift in Europe of 500,000 barrels. Domestically, we are 2.1 million BOE underlifted as a result of gas storage in Alaska.
Slide 8 shows the more than 8% growth in E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. 
Slide 9 shows Marathon's E&P cost structure by category over the past 7 quarters. DD&A increased through the fourth quarter of 2010 but has started to decline in the past 2 quarters as a result of lower Gulf of Mexico volumes, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped again this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense.
Turning to Slide 10. The third quarter E&P segment income decreased 48% primarily due to the previously discussed higher taxes. Lower per BOE realizations were partially offset by reduced expenses. Total E&P expenses per BOE were lower by $2.01. 
Turning to Slide 11. The improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income, third quarter to second, was primarily a result of higher volumes from a full quarter with the expanded facility partially offset by lower price realizations. 
And to finish out segment reporting, Slide 12 shows that the Integrated Gas segment income was $55 million compared to the $43 million recorded in the second quarter of 2011. This was primarily a result of the sale of our 30% interest in the Kenai, Alaska LNG facility and higher LNG and methanol sales volumes in EG. 
Slide 13 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, before changes in our working capital, was approximately $1.3 billion, while working capital changes reduced cash by $262 million. We had capital expenditures of $735 million. Asset sales contributed $14 million. We paid dividends of $106 million, and we repurchased 12 million shares of common stock for $300 million. Our cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $4.6 billion. 
Slide 14 goes to the 9-month preliminary cash flow analysis, but for the second time, I won't go through this line by line.
As shown on Slide 15, at the end of the third quarter of 2011, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 2%. But remember that we are today closing on the 141,000-acre Hilcorp deal and by the end of this year, including the Hilcorp deal, expect to close on the purchase of nearly 167,000 acres in the Eagle Ford, largely in the core, totaling approximately $4.5 billion. As a reminder, the net debt-to-capital ratio includes about $217 million of debt service by U.S. deal and almost all is contractually required to be removed from our balance sheet by the end of this year. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 55% and 62% from Q4 2011. The full year 2011 effective tax rate, including discontinued operations, is estimated to be between 50% and 56%. And both of these estimates exclude special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurements of our tax balances.
Slide 16 is one we generally have in the appendix, but we want to highlight the production targets for the fourth quarter of this year and for 2012. Excluding any production from Libya, we expect our 2012 production to be approximately 5% higher than 2011. 
This is even more evident as we turn to Slide 17, where you can see that our projected Lower 48 production, excluding the Gulf of Mexico, is estimated to grow from 75,000 boepd to between 120,000 and 130,000 boepd over the next 5 quarters, a 60% to 73% increase.
And on Slide 18, we have provided estimates, production and effective tax rates by country for 2012. 
And with that, we will open up the call to questions. I would ask you to keep your questions to one and a follow-up or 2 separate questions. Thank you."

I think you have to go back and remember June 1, when we talked about the Hilcorp acquisition. We said 141,000 net acres for $3.5 billion. We also said -- excuse me, that the effective date of the transaction was May 1. And so certainly, any of the costs that were realized between the May 1 effective date and the November 1 closing date, those costs less whatever revenue would be reflected in the closing adjustment. So you recognize that the activity continued very strongly on that Hilcorp acreage. They actually exceeded the number of wells they had committed to both drill and complete. So pretty significant expenditure on the assets. It took the production, as you know, from 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net as of June 1, to as we said almost 13,000 barrels a day net currently. So you certainly have the closing adjustments -- excuse me, as a portion of that -- excuse me. We also said at the time of the acquisition, there was roughly 14,000 net acres made up of those tag-along rights under the existing lease agreements, as well as follow-on acreage that we would attempt to secure. And so as compared to the 14,000, as you've seen now, we've actually acquired some 26,000 net acres and what I would say is that 26,000 acres is largely, as Howard said in his remarks, in the core part of the play. And importantly, it is associated with the Hilcorp acreage. And so back in June, we said our average working interest was 65%. Our average working interest now in the Hilcorp acreage will be 76.5%. The other component that's in that $4.5 billion that wasn't talked about back in June, it was the purchase of the gas gathering line that is really key to these assets. It's the main gas gathering line that runs through this acreage and allows us to tie in directly to Kinder Morgan and access their gas plant and the Southcross gas plants. So put all that together, additional acreage, closing adjustments and the gas gathering line, and that's how you get to the higher closing cost."

So that's slightly less than the third of the pre-conflict level. But as we've kind of pointed out, our production is largely driven by electric submersible pumps. Those are pieces of equipment that do well when they're left idle for the period of time that we've been away. And so we have to physically get out there and see what we have on the surface. We have to be able to return a lot of our employees to be able to actually physically do that work, and then we'll have to engage in some subsurface work to see exactly what it is we've got in terms of repair jobs so we can determine when the restoration is going to be. All of that is predicated on the front-end work, making sure that it's a secure place for our people to work and that the United States government is on site in terms of making sure that our re-entry is compliant with all their laws and regulations. So it's still some time away before, I think, you'll see us talk with any confidence about Libya."

And so certainly, by the end of the year, we'll have a much broader understanding of what's going on out there. But the big area, a lot of work to do before we get too overconfident, the Eagle Ford, we'll be doing multiple pilots both at looking at a simple 80-acre downspacing and then further downspacing to see exactly what's an optimum drainage pattern at various places in the field. That will happen in the first half of next year. And so as the next 2 quarters go along, we'll be able to give a lot more color in terms of what we think that we're ultimately going to be able to develop this field at, but it's clearly not 160."

We certainly have the capability to potentially do that on the acreage, but I think what we're going to do is get our feet on the ground. We can certainly deliver the numbers that we suggested over the next 5 years with that kind of rig complement. So I don't think it's changed.

But more importantly, there's a lot of activity of driving towards the Corpus Christi Bay, which is going to put this on a water-based market, which we feel pretty good about. We have very good coverage for our volumes for the initial stages of the play, and we're currently engaged in looking at what our longer term optionality is going to be. So we feel very good about the exit capacity there. We've been a little bit concerned about some of the bottlenecking -- bottlenecks that have been developing in the Bakken, largely around road traffic in terms of the able to truck most of our crew at least to the transit point either through rail or piping. As you know, we had a pretty solid base arrangement with what we thought was going to be our top end volumes with some local refineries. And we've now -- are now in the process of making arrangements to get our oil on pipes and rail to get it out of there so we can continue to enjoy some of the benefit of higher netback there. So we're in good shape in both places. I would say we're a little bit behind the Bakken. We're well in front in the Eagle Ford."
