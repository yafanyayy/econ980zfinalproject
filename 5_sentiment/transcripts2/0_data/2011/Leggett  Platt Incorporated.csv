Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results.For the quarter, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the",707,"Good morning from sunny Missouri, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results.
For the quarter, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the Specialized Products and Industrial Materials segments. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.21 versus $0.26 for the same quarter last year. The earnings benefit from higher unit volumes and a lower effective tax rate were offset by a net change in LIFO impact and higher raw material costs.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized the LIFO benefit of $15 million. As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year. Instead, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we incurred LIFO expense of $5 million for a year-over-year net change of $20 million.
In late 2010, steel costs began increasing again. These increases along with higher than anticipated LIFO expense led to 150 to 200 basis points of margin compression in the fourth quarter. We have announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses to recover the higher cost. These increases vary in magnitude depending upon the product category, and our being implemented during the first quarter of 2011.
Because of the lag and cost recovery, our first quarter margins will likely be under pressure, but we expect margins to normalize by the second quarter. 
For the full year 2010, we are pleased with the improvements we posted. In both sales and earnings per share, we achieved the full year results at or above the high end of guidance issued at the start of the year. Sales grew 10% to $3.36 billion. Demand improved in many of our markets during the year. The Automotive and Office Furniture markets experienced significant growth from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong. Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong, but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume. 
Full year earnings increased to $1.15 per share, which is a 64% improvement versus the $0.70 per share reported in 2009.
During 2010, we completed the sale of the seven and final divestiture identified as the part of our strategic realignment. The seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds over the past three years, exceeding the original $400 million goal. 
Our focus on optimizing returns was reflected throughout 2010 in part through the low level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover. We ended the year with working capital add 14.1% of annualized sales.
For the year, we generated operating cash of $363 million, which significantly exceeded the $223 million required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
In August, we raised the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $22.96, the current dividend yield is at 4.7%. As planned, much of the excess operating cash was used to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our stock during 2010.
Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital at 23.3%, well below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. No significant fixed term debt maturing until 2013 and over $500 million available under our existing bank facility. We continue to assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return on a rolling three-year basis to other peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three years ended December 31 of 2010, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which ranks among the top 8% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details on yesterday's press release and in the Slide presentation on our website. As Dave mentioned, our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Fourth quarter sales in the residential furnishings segment decreased slightly versus the prior year. Steel related price inflation from price increases implemented earlier in 2010, was more than offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses.
In our U.S. spring business, in our spring unit volumes decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and box spring units were flat. Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our international spring, fabric converting and corporate underlay businesses. In our furniture hardware business, the unit volume increased slightly in the fourth quarter. The majority of the full year revenue growth that we experienced in the Residential Furnishings segment is attributable to our furniture components business. This growth is primarily due to market share gains, a well-established international presence and ongoing strength in motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor seating with added functionality and comfort.
Lower unit volumes and higher raw material cost led to a decrease in the segments fourth quarter EBIT and EBIT margins versus the prior year. We have recently announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses including bedding and furniture components to recover the higher raw material cost. The selling price increases vary by product line ranging from approximately 8% in bedding components to 12% in furniture hardware. We have also announced price increases in our fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses to recover recent inflation in the cost of fabrics and scrap. All of the announced selling price increases will be implemented during the first quarter of 2011. 
Current demand in our residential end markets remained well below historical levels. This presents a notable opportunity for both sales and earnings growth over the next few years as those markets recover.
We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements in these markets during 2011.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Commercial segment, fourth quarter sales grew slightly. We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the office furniture industry. Fourth quarter sales in our office components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that we have been awarded. This was the third consecutive quarter that we experienced strong growth in this business.
Sales in our Fixture & Display business decreased approximately 10% during the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of 2009. Our prior year comps were difficult due to a high level of late year activity in 2009 by some of our large customers.
For the full year 2010, sales in our Store Fixtures & Display business grew approximately 5%. Seasonality of this business changed in 2010, with the volume in the first three quarters of the year roughly proportional as retailers increased remodeling activity and reduced new store construction. We expect similar seasonality in 2011. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Component segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009. The benefit from sales growth in office components was offset by restructuring-related cost associated with the closure of a wood store fixtures operation. 
Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 8%. Growth from higher unit volumes and steel-related price inflation was partially offset by a small divestiture.
EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009, as higher unit volumes were offset by the absence of EBIT associated with a small divestiture and lower metal margins in the steel industry that reduced the profitability of our steel rod mill. Price increases have recently been announced and implemented in our rod and wire drawing operations in response to the escalation and in steel scrap cost. 
In the Specialist Product segment, we post a 17% sales growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in global Automotive demand. We also experienced sales growth in Commercial Vehicle Products during the quarter. Automotive industry forecast continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Over the last three years, we significantly reduced our fixed cost structure that have retained spare production capacity so that we can accommodate additional sales without the need for large capital investments. As a result, we have meaningful operating leverage that should benefit earnings as sales increase. 
For 2011, we expect that sales of approximately $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, reflecting our belief that the economy will continue to improve modestly. Based on this sales expectation and considering other uncertainties including inflation and steel costs, we project 2011 earnings to be between $1.20 and $1.40 per share.
Cash from operations should exceed $300 million again in 2011. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $85 million and dividend payments should approximate $155 million.
For the full year, we anticipate purchasing up to 10 million shares of our stock and issuing approximately 3 million shares. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have no specific repurchase commitment or timetable associated with that authorization.
While challenges continue in certain areas of our business, we are addressing those. We are pleased with many of the business units and their continued progress. We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to our customers for their ongoing support. We remain committed to working together with you for our mutual long-term prosperity.

The other thing, John, you'll remember is that we are up with some pretty difficult comps at least in the first half. So we are trying to deal with that. At the same time that our customers, if you heard much of this at the Las Vegas Market last week, our customers are very, very optimistic about the full year, but have some near-term concerns as it relates to weather. This week certainly isn't helping much of the country. And then the fact that the income tax refunds are delayed anywhere from two to four weeks. And in the Residential Furnishings part of our business, there is an element at price points that is very sensitive to the receipt of those refunds. So that may delay some purchasing ability into the latter part of the first quarter. But the significant issue truly is this lag of recovering raw material inflation magnified by the fact that we don't know that we talk out on steel pricing. So the scrap inflation certainly was significant in December and January. We think that there maybe a continuation of that, which we've warned our customers that the increases that we've announced to date may in fact not be the last. So we are fearful of that type of inflationary run again."

And it was due to the fact that the U.S. steel inflation in the early half of last year just came earlier than the inflation in Europe, magnified by a very low currency euro-dollar exchange rate. We have regained much of that business as we speak, but John's point's valid, in the fourth quarter demand of U.S. innerspring units was impacted that units were down from a trend standpoint in October about 6%. November was worse, about 8% off. But those of you that look at the ISPA statistics will remember that the ISPA report for November was particularly soft. And then in December, we have recovered to the point that we were about flat. As we speak today, January was flat through the first three shipping weeks. Last week, we were up about 15%. We believe most of that was weather-related. So we've regained most of that business as it relates to the industry, our box springs, as we commented in the quarter, fourth quarter were flat. We expect -- we believe that our box spring sellthrough data is more tightly co-related to industry demand than any other statistic that we see, including the ISPA numbers. They also correlate to some reports from some publicly held companies previous to ours. So we think the industry was flattish 4Q. We think we've recovered the vast majority of that lost volume. Box springs by the way, through the first three shipping weeks of January, were up about 1%. So you can see that connectivity between innerspring and box spring sellthrough is narrowed to its normal point. As it relates to Sealy, Sealy did have a relaunch of the Posturepedic line first time in three years. And we are backwardly integrated with Sealy from the standpoint that all of their box springs are ours, and about 2/3 of their wires are ours, to the degree that they do experience some success in that line, we'll benefit from that. Also if the Las Vegas market sort of introduced the new perfect sleep offering and did a fantastic job of that introduction also, a 100% of that componentry is ours and that product is positioned at some real velocity price points. So good value for the consumer in both those manufacturer's offerings. We expect that the retailers will promote heavily both of the introduction of those new lines and expect some really good things as the year progresses."

But a combination of that topline as well as continued share repurchase, of course, aids significantly. The margin contribution to that plan is very important to. We continue to see progression on our annualized margins. And I think that we will ultimately get to those goals that we established. But again, it's going to be a function of capacity utilization to get there. So don't know exactly when it will happen. Is it going to be 2012? Don't know for sure. One other thing that becomes very important is the product proliferation as we develop new products either that takes the place of existing products. We need to do so with a mindset to improve our margins in the process. And then also like what we've spoken before, the implementation of brand-new products, new to Leggett, with margins that are above average will certainly assist in that pursuit Again, disappointed that we haven't seen a little more aggressive progression. But it's primarily topline oriented and we're waiting for that to improved significantly more than it already has."

And as you know, part of that growth phase has to do with getting back into the acquisition saddle but in a way that we're very comfortable with. So in conjunction with the M&A department, Karl, Matt, Dave and the various segment heads, we've established acquisition criteria for each one of the segments and indeed in the business groups. Those criteria have been submitted to an outside agency that will assist us in finding fits for those types of potential acquisitions.

Yesterday we reported fourth quarter and full year results.  For the quarter sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the specialized products and industrial materials segments.  Earnings per share for the quarter were 21 cents versus 26 cents for the same quarter last year.
The earnings benefit from higher unit volumes and a lower effective tax rate were offset by a net change in LIFO impact and higher raw material costs.  In the fourth quarter of 2009 we recognized a LIFO benefit of $15 million.  As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year.  Instead in the fourth quarter of 2010 we incurred LIFO expense of $5 million for a year over year net change of $20 million.  In late 2010 steel costs began increasing again.
These increases along with higher than anticipated LIFO expense led to 150-200 basis points of margin compression in the fourth quarter.  We have announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses to recover the higher costs.  These increases vary in magnitude depending upon the product category and are being implemented during the first quarter of 2011.  Because of the lag in cost recovery our first quarter margins will likely be under pressure.  But we expect margins to normalize by the second quarter.
For the full year 2010 we’re pleased with the improvements we posted in both sales and earnings per share we achieved full year results at or above the high end of guidance issued at the start of the year.  Sales grew 10% to $3.36 billion.  Demand improved in many of our markets during the year.  The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant growth from very depressed demand levels in 2009.
Retail fixture demand was also reasonably strong.  Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.  Activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain underperforming and under utilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume.
Full year earnings increased to $1.15 per share, which is a 64% improvement versus the 70 cents per share reported in 2009.  During 2010 we completed the sale of the seventh and final divestiture identified as a part of our strategic realignment.  The seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after tax cash proceeds over the past three years, exceeding our original $400 million goal.  Our focus on optimizing returns was reflected throughout 2010 in part through the lower level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover.
We ended the year with working capital at 14.1% of annualized sales.  For the year we generated operating cash of $363 million, which significantly exceeded the 223 million required to fund capital expenditures and dividends.  In August we raised the quarterly dividend to 27 cents per share and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases.  At yesterday’s closing price of $22.96 the current dividend yield is 4.7%.  As planned, much of the excess operating cash was used to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our stock during 2010.
Our financial profile remains strong.  We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital at 23.3%, well below our long term targeted range of 30-40%.  No significant fixed term debt maturing until 2013 and over $500 million available under our existing bank facility.  We continue to assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling three-year basis to that of peer companies.  We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12-15% per year.
For the three years ended December 31, 2010 we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which ranks among the top 8% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.  And with those comments I’ll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights.  Karl.

You will find segment details in yesterday’s press release and in the slide presentation on our Web site.  As Dave mentioned, our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Fourth quarter sales in the residential furnishings segment decreased slightly versus the prior year.  Steel related price inflation from price increases implemented earlier in 2010 was more than offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses.  In our US frame business inner spring unit volumes decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and box spring units were flat.  Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our international spring, fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses.
In our furniture hardware business the unit volume increased slightly in the fourth quarter.  The majority of the full year revenue growth that we experienced in the residential furnishings segment is attributable to our furniture components business.  This growth is primarily due to market share gains, a well established international presence and ongoing strength in motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor seating with added functionality and comfort.  Lower unit volumes and higher raw material costs led to a decrease in the segment’s fourth quarter EBIT and EBIT margins versus the prior year.
We have recently announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses including bedding and furniture components to recover the higher raw material costs.  The selling price increases vary by product line ranging from approximately l8% in bedding components to 12% in furniture hardware.  We have also announced price increases in our fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses to recover recent inflation in the cost of fabrics and chrome scrap.  All of the announced selling price increases will be implemented during the first quarter of 2011.
Current demand in our residential end markets remains well below historical levels.  This presents a notable opportunity for both sales and earnings growth over the next few years as those markets recover.  We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements in these markets during 2011.  In the commercial fixturing and component segment fourth quarter sales grew slightly.  We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the office furniture industry.
Fourth quarter sales in our office components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that we have been awarded.  This was the third consecutive quarter that we experienced strong growth in this business.  Sales in our fixture and display business decreased approximately 10% during the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of 2009.  Our prior year comps were difficult due to a high level of late year activity in 2009 by some of our large customers.  For the full year 2010 sales in our store fixtures and display business grew approximately 5%.
Seasonality of this business changed in 2010 with volume in the first three quarters of the year roughly proportional as retailers increased remodeling activity and reduced new store construction.  We expect similar seasonality in 2011.  EBIT and EBIT margins in the commercial fixturing and component segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009.  The benefit from sales growth and office components was offset by restructuring related costs associated with the closure of our wood store fixtures operation.
Fourth quarter sales in our industrial materials segment increased 8%.  Growth from higher unit volumes and steel related price inflation was partially offset by a small divestiture.  EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009 as higher unit volumes were offset by the absence of EBIT associated with a small divestiture and lower metal margins in the steel industry that reduced the profitability of our steel rod mill.  Price increases have recently been announced and implemented in our rod and wire drawing operations in response to the escalation in steel scrap cost.
In our specialized product segment we posted 17% sales growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in global automotive demand.  We also experienced sales growth in commercial vehicle products during the quarter.  Automotive industry forecasts continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011.  With those comments I’ll turn the call back over to Dave.

Over the last three years we significantly reduced our fixed cost structure but have retained spare production capacity so that we can accommodate additional sales without the need for large capital investments.  As a result, we have meaningful operating leverage that should benefit earnings as sales increase.  For 2011 we expect sales of approximately $3.4-3.6 billion, reflecting our belief that the economy will continue to improve modestly.
Based on this sales expectation and considering other uncertainties including inflation and steel costs, we project 2011 earnings to be between $1.20-1.40 per share.  Cash from operations should exceed $300 million again in 2011.  Capital expenditures are expected to be about $85 million and dividend payments should approximate $155 million.  For the full year we anticipate purchasing up to 10 million shares of our stock and issuing approximately 3 million shares.
We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but we have no specific repurchase commitment or time table associated with that authorization.  While challenges continue in certain areas of our business, we are addressing those.  We are pleased with many of the business units and their continued progress.  We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to our customers for their ongoing support.  We remain committed to working together with you for our mutual long-term prosperity.
We would also like to thank our employee partners, the men and women whose hard work has contributed to the past year’s progress and helped position Leggett for long-term success.  And with those comments I’ll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.  Dave.

The other thing John you’ll remember is that we’re up against some pretty difficult comps at least in the first half.  So we’re trying to deal with that.  At the same time that our customers, you heard much of this at the Las Vegas market last week - our customers are very, very optimistic about the full year but have some near term concerns as it relates to weather.  This week certainly isn’t helping much of the country.
And then the fact that the income tax refunds are delayed anywhere from two to four weeks and in the residential furnishings part of our business there is an element at price points that is very sensitive to the receipt of those refunds.  So that may delay some purchasing ability into the latter part of the first quarter.  But the significant issue truly is this lag of recovering raw material inflation magnified by the fact that we don’t know that we have topped out on steel pricing.
So the scrap inflation certainly was significant in December and January.  WE think that there may be a continuation of that, which we have warned our customers that the increases that we have announced to date may in fact not be the last.  So we are fearful of that type of inflationary run again.

As we spoke on the third quarter call, we had lost temporarily a little bit of inner spring business to some low pricing that was coming out of Europe at that time and it was due to the fact that US steel inflation in the early half of last year ju",442,"Yeah.  As we spoke on the third quarter call, we had lost temporarily a little bit of inner spring business to some low pricing that was coming out of Europe at that time and it was due to the fact that US steel inflation in the early half of last year just came earlier than the inflation in Europe magnified by a very low currency euro/dollar exchange rate.  We have regained much of that business as we speak.
But John’s point is valid in the fourth quarter demand of US inner spring units was impacted.  The units were down from a trend standpoint in October about 6%.  November was worse, about eight off but those of you that look at the ISPA statistics will remember that the ISPA report for November was particularly soft.  And then in December we had recovered to the point that we were about flat.
As we speak today, January was flat through the first three shipping weeks.  Last week we were up about 15%.  We believe most of that was weather related so we have regained most of that business.  As it relates to the industry, our box springs as we commented in the fourth quarter were flat.  We expect or we believe that our box spring sell through data is more tightly correlated to industry demand than any other statistic that we see including the ISPA numbers.  They also correlate to some reports from some publicly held companies previous to ours.
So we think the industry was flattish 4Q.  We think we’ve recovered the vast majority of that lost volume.  Box springs by the way through the first three shipping weeks of January were up about 1% so you can see that connectivity between inner spring and box spring sell through has narrowed to its normal point.  As it relates to Sealy, Sealy did have a re-launch of the Posturepedic line, the first time in three years.  And we are backwardly integrated with Sealy from the standpoint that all of their box springs are ours and about 2/3 of their wire are ours.
So to the degree that they do experience some success in that line, we’ll benefit from that.  Also at the Las Vegas market Serta introduced the new Perfect Sleeper offering and did a fantastic job of that introduction also.  100% of that componentry is ours and that product is positioned at some real velocity price points.  So good value for the consumer in both those manufacturers’ offerings.  We expect that the retailers will promote heavily both off the introduction of those new lines and expect some really good things as the year progresses.

We still feel comfortable that we’ll get to that $2 per share earnings.  It’s going to take top line.  Don’t know exactly - is it 2012 now that we get there?  Don’t really know.  But a combination of that top line as well as continued share repurchase of course aids significantly.
The margin contribution to that plan is very important too.  We continue to see progression on our annualized margins and I think that we will ultimately get to those goals that we established.  But again, it’s going to be a function of capacity utilization to get there.  So I don’t know exactly when it will happen.  Is it going to be 2012?  Don’t know for sure.  One other thing that becomes very important is the product proliferation as we develop new products either that take the place of existing products.
We need to do so with a mindset to improve our margins in the process.  And then also like we have spoken before, the implementation of brand new products new to Leggett with margins that are above average will certainly assist in that pursuit.  Again, disappointed that we haven’t seen a little more aggressive progression but it’s primarily top line oriented and we’re waiting for that to improve significantly more than it already has.

So in conjunction with the M&A department, Karl, Matt, Dave and the various segment heads we’ve established acquisition criteria for each one of the segments and indeed the business groups.  Those criteria have been submitted to an outside agency that will assist us in finding fits for those types of potential acquisitions.

But in terms of the next few years, that 85 million is probably a good number because of the existing capacity that we have in our operations.
As we said in the conference call script, we believe we can pass through about $4 billion of demand with the capital that we have in place all the while continuing obviously to maintain the mechanical and the structural side of our investment.  So absent a significant increase in demand that’s a good plan.  Might range up to 100 million as we move into the 3.8 billion of sales but who knows?

I’ll just add one other because it’s a hot topic here in the last several questions and that is if you think about our incremental margin, which we’ve used as a frame of reference, which is 30%, for each 100 million increase in sales unit driven mind you, that should bring about $30 million give or take in EBIT.
And if you do the math at an EPS level, that’s adding between 12 or 13 cents of earnings per share not bearing in mind share contraction if that continues to take place and product mix assumes it’s basically where it is right now.  So the gearing on every 100 million increase in sales should be all things else being relatively stable, somewhere in that 12-13% range.  I would also quickly add and I know Dave and Karl would as well, is some of our businesses our incremental margin would be better than 30% and some wouldn’t be quite as good as 30%.  So but again, as a rule of thumb for many of you asking that sort of question, that might be helpful.

Our position in the market has been a long one.  We’ve been consistent and fair in our dealings.  So they weren’t traumatic.  I will say at the Las Vegas furniture market last week, a lot of those conversations face to face with customers and they clearly understood.

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results.For the quarter, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the",706,"Good morning from sunny Missouri, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results.
For the quarter, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the Specialized Products and Industrial Materials segments. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.21 versus $0.26 for the same quarter last year. The earnings benefit from higher unit volumes and a lower effective tax rate were offset by a net change in LIFO impact and higher raw material costs.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized a LIFO benefit of $15 million. As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year. Instead, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we incurred LIFO expense of $5 million for a year-over-year net change of $20 million.
In late 2010, steel costs began increasing again. These increases along with higher than anticipated LIFO expense led to 150 to 200 basis points of margin compression in the fourth quarter. We have announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses to recover the higher costs. These increases vary in magnitude depending upon the product category and are being implemented during the first quarter of 2011.
Because of the lag in cost recovery, our first quarter margins will likely be under pressure, but we expect margins to normalize by the second quarter. 
For the full year 2010, we're pleased with the improvements we posted. In both sales and earnings per share, we achieved full year results at or above the high end of guidance issued at the start of the year. Sales grew 10% to $3.36 billion. 
Demand improved in many of our markets during the year. The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant growth from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong. Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume. 
Full year earnings increased to $1.15 per share, which is a 64% improvement versus the $0.70 per share reported in 2009.
During 2010, we completed the sale of the seventh and final divestiture identified as a part of our strategic realignment. The seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds over the past three years, exceeding their original $400 million goal. 
Our focus on optimizing returns was reflected throughout 2010 in part through the low level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover. We ended the year with working capital at 14.1% of annualized sales.
For the year, we generated operating cash of $363 million, which significantly exceeded the $223 million required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
In August, we raised the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $22.96, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. As planned, much of the excess operating cash was used to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our stock during 2010.
Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital at 23.3%, well below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%, no significant fixed term debt maturing until 2013 and over $500 million available under our existing bank facility. We continue to assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return on a rolling three-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three years ended December 31 of 2010, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which ranks among the top 8% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details on yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. As Dave mentioned, our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased slightly versus the prior year. Steel-related price inflation from price increases implemented earlier in 2010 was more than offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses.
In our U.S. spring business, innerspring unit volumes decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and box spring units were flat. Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our international spring, fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses. 
In our furniture hardware business, the unit volume increased slightly in the fourth quarter. The majority of the full year revenue growth that we experienced in the Residential Furnishings segment is attributable to our furniture components business. This growth is primarily due to market share gains, a well-established international presence and ongoing strength in motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor seating with added functionality and comfort.
Lower unit volumes and higher raw material costs led to a decrease in the segment's fourth quarter EBIT and EBIT margins versus the prior year. We have recently announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses, including bedding and furniture components, to recover the higher raw material cost. The selling price increases vary by product line ranging from approximately 8% in bedding components to 12% in furniture hardware. We have also announced price increases in our fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses to recover recent inflation in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap. All of the announced selling price increases will be implemented during the first quarter of 2011. 
Current demand in our residential end markets remains well below historical levels. This presents a notable opportunity for both sales and earnings growth over the next few years as those markets recover.
We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements in these markets during 2011.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, fourth quarter sales grew slightly. We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the office furniture industry. Fourth quarter sales in our office components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that we have been awarded. This was the third consecutive quarter that we experienced strong growth in this business.
Sales in our fixture and display business decreased approximately 10% during the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of 2009. Our prior year comps were difficult due to a high level of late year activity in 2009 by some of our large customers.
For the full year 2010, sales in our store fixtures  and display business grew approximately 5%. Seasonality of this business changed in 2010, with  volume in the first three quarters of the year roughly proportional as retailers increased remodeling activity and reduced new store construction. We expect similar seasonality in 2011. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009. The benefit from sales growth in office components was offset by restructuring-related costs associated with the closure of a wood store fixtures operation. 
Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 8%. Growth from higher unit volumes and steel-related price inflation was partially offset by a small divestiture. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009 as higher unit volumes were offset by the absence of EBIT associated with a small divestiture and lower metal margins in the steel industry that reduced the profitability of our steel rod mill. Price increases have recently been announced and implemented in our rod and wire drawing operations in response to the escalation in steel scrap cost. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 17% sales growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in global automotive demand. We also experienced sales growth in commercial vehicle products during the quarter. Automotive industry forecasts continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Over the last three years, we significantly reduced our fixed cost structure but have retained spare production capacity so that we can accommodate additional sales without the need for large capital investments. As a result, we have meaningful operating leverage that should benefit earnings as sales increase. 
For 2011, we expect sales of approximately $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, reflecting our belief that the economy will continue to improve modestly. Based on this sales expectation and considering other uncertainties including inflation and steel costs, we project 2011 earnings to be between $1.20 and $1.40 per share.
Cash from operations should exceed $300 million again in 2011. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $85 million, and dividend payments should approximate $155 million.
For the full year, we anticipate purchasing up to 10 million shares of our stock and issuing approximately 3 million shares. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have no specific repurchase commitment or timetable associated with that authorization.
While challenges continue in certain areas of our business, we are addressing those. We are pleased with many of the business units and their continued progress. We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to our customers for their ongoing support. We remain committed to working together with you for our mutual long-term prosperity. We would also like to thank our employee partners, the men and women whose hard work has contributed to the past year's progress and helped position Leggett for long-term success.

At the same time that our customers, if you heard much of this at the Las Vegas market last week, our customers are very, very optimistic about the full year but have some near-term concerns as it relates to weather. This week certainly isn't helping much of the country. And then the fact that the income tax refunds are delayed anywhere from two to four weeks. And in the residential furnishings part of our business, there's an element at price points that is very sensitive to the receipt of those refunds. So that may delay some purchasing ability into the latter part of the first quarter. But the significant issue truly is this lag of recovering raw material inflation magnified by the fact that we don't know that we've topped out on steel pricing. So the scrap inflation certainly was significant in December and January. We think that there may be a continuation of that which we've warned our customers that the increases that we've announced to date may in fact not be the last. So we're fearful of that type of inflationary run again."

And it was due to the fact that the U.S. steel inflation in the early half of last year just came earlier than the inflation in Europe, magnified by a very low currency euro-dollar exchange rate. We have regained much of that business as we speak, but John's point is valid. And the fourth quarter demand of U.S. innerspring units was impacted; the units were down from a trend standpoint in October about 6%. November was worse, about 8% off. But those of you that look at the ISPA statistics will remember that the ISPA report for November was particularly soft. And then in December, we had recovered to the point that we were about flat. As we speak today, January was flat through the first three shipping weeks. Last week, we were off about 15%. We believe most of that was weather related. So we've regained most of that business as it relates to the industry, our box springs, as we commented, in the fourth quarter were flat. We believe that our box spring sell-through data is more tightly correlated to industry demand than any other statistic that we see, including the ISPA numbers. They also correlate to some reports from some publicly held companies previous to ours. So we think the industry was flattish 4Q. We think we've recovered the vast majority of that lost volume. Box springs, by the way, through the first three shipping weeks of January were up about 1%. So you can see that connectivity between innerspring and box spring sell-through is narrowed to its normal point. As it relates to Sealy, Sealy did have a relaunch of the Posturepedic line, first time in three years. And we are backwardly integrated with Sealy from the standpoint that all of their box springs are ours, and about 2/3 of their wire are ours. So to the degree that they do experience some success in that line, we'll benefit from that. Also at the Las Vegas market, Serta introduced the new Perfect Sleeper offering and did a fantastic job of that introduction also; 100% of that componentry is ours and that product is positioned at some real velocity price points. So good value for the consumer in both those manufacturers' offerings. We expect that the retailers will promote heavily both off the introduction of those new lines and expect some really good things as the year progresses."

The margin contribution to that plan is very important, too. We continue to see progression on our annualized margins. And I think that we will ultimately get to those goals that we established. But again, it's going to be a function of capacity utilization to get there. So don't know exactly when it will happen. Is it going to be 2012? Don't know for sure. One other thing that becomes very important is the product proliferation as we develop new products either that take the place of existing products. We need to do so with a mindset to improve our margins in the process. And then also, like we've spoken before, the implementation of brand new products, new to Leggett, with margins that are above average will certainly assist in that pursuit.

And they clearly understood, I'm not going to say they were appreciative, but they clearly understood our position. And they generally are optimistic enough about demand going forward that it truly was not a significant issue."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results.For the quarter, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the",706,"Good morning from sunny Missouri, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results.
For the quarter, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in unit volumes in the Specialized Products and Industrial Materials segments. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.21 versus $0.26 for the same quarter last year. The earnings benefit from higher unit volumes and a lower effective tax rate were offset by a net change in LIFO impact and higher raw material costs.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized a LIFO benefit of $15 million. As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year. Instead, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we incurred LIFO expense of $5 million for a year-over-year net change of $20 million.
In late 2010, steel costs began increasing again. These increases along with higher than anticipated LIFO expense led to 150 to 200 basis points of margin compression in the fourth quarter. We have announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses to recover the higher costs. These increases vary in magnitude depending upon the product category and are being implemented during the first quarter of 2011.
Because of the lag in cost recovery, our first quarter margins will likely be under pressure, but we expect margins to normalize by the second quarter. 
For the full year 2010, we're pleased with the improvements we posted. In both sales and earnings per share, we achieved full year results at or above the high end of guidance issued at the start of the year. Sales grew 10% to $3.36 billion. 
Demand improved in many of our markets during the year. The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant growth from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong. Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume. 
Full year earnings increased to $1.15 per share, which is a 64% improvement versus the $0.70 per share reported in 2009.
During 2010, we completed the sale of the seventh and final divestiture identified as a part of our strategic realignment. The seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds over the past three years, exceeding their original $400 million goal. 
Our focus on optimizing returns was reflected throughout 2010 in part through the low level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover. We ended the year with working capital at 14.1% of annualized sales.
For the year, we generated operating cash of $363 million, which significantly exceeded the $223 million required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
In August, we raised the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $22.96, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. As planned, much of the excess operating cash was used to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our stock during 2010.
Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital at 23.3%, well below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%, no significant fixed term debt maturing until 2013 and over $500 million available under our existing bank facility. We continue to assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return on a rolling three-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three years ended December 31 of 2010, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which ranks among the top 8% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details on yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. As Dave mentioned, our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed.
Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased slightly versus the prior year. Steel-related price inflation from price increases implemented earlier in 2010 was more than offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses.
In our U.S. spring business, innerspring unit volumes decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and box spring units were flat. Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our international spring, fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses. 
In our furniture hardware business, the unit volume increased slightly in the fourth quarter. The majority of the full year revenue growth that we experienced in the Residential Furnishings segment is attributable to our furniture components business. This growth is primarily due to market share gains, a well-established international presence and ongoing strength in motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor seating with added functionality and comfort.
Lower unit volumes and higher raw material costs led to a decrease in the segment's fourth quarter EBIT and EBIT margins versus the prior year. We have recently announced price increases in our major steel consuming businesses, including bedding and furniture components, to recover the higher raw material cost. The selling price increases vary by product line ranging from approximately 8% in bedding components to 12% in furniture hardware. We have also announced price increases in our fabric converting and carpet underlay businesses to recover recent inflation in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap. All of the announced selling price increases will be implemented during the first quarter of 2011. 
Current demand in our residential end markets remains well below historical levels. This presents a notable opportunity for both sales and earnings growth over the next few years as those markets recover.
We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements in these markets during 2011.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, fourth quarter sales grew slightly. We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the office furniture industry. Fourth quarter sales in our office components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that we have been awarded. This was the third consecutive quarter that we experienced strong growth in this business.
Sales in our fixture and display business decreased approximately 10% during the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of 2009. Our prior year comps were difficult due to a high level of late year activity in 2009 by some of our large customers.
For the full year 2010, sales in our store fixtures  and display business grew approximately 5%. Seasonality of this business changed in 2010, with  volume in the first three quarters of the year roughly proportional as retailers increased remodeling activity and reduced new store construction. We expect similar seasonality in 2011. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009. The benefit from sales growth in office components was offset by restructuring-related costs associated with the closure of a wood store fixtures operation. 
Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 8%. Growth from higher unit volumes and steel-related price inflation was partially offset by a small divestiture. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus fourth quarter of 2009 as higher unit volumes were offset by the absence of EBIT associated with a small divestiture and lower metal margins in the steel industry that reduced the profitability of our steel rod mill. Price increases have recently been announced and implemented in our rod and wire drawing operations in response to the escalation in steel scrap cost. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 17% sales growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in global automotive demand. We also experienced sales growth in commercial vehicle products during the quarter. Automotive industry forecasts continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Over the last three years, we significantly reduced our fixed cost structure but have retained spare production capacity so that we can accommodate additional sales without the need for large capital investments. As a result, we have meaningful operating leverage that should benefit earnings as sales increase. 
For 2011, we expect sales of approximately $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, reflecting our belief that the economy will continue to improve modestly. Based on this sales expectation and considering other uncertainties including inflation and steel costs, we project 2011 earnings to be between $1.20 and $1.40 per share.
Cash from operations should exceed $300 million again in 2011. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $85 million, and dividend payments should approximate $155 million.
For the full year, we anticipate purchasing up to 10 million shares of our stock and issuing approximately 3 million shares. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have no specific repurchase commitment or timetable associated with that authorization.

At the same time that our customers, if you heard much of this at the Las Vegas market last week, our customers are very, very optimistic about the full year but have some near-term concerns as it relates to weather. This week certainly isn't helping much of the country. And then the fact that the income tax refunds are delayed anywhere from two to four weeks. And in the residential furnishings part of our business, there's an element at price points that is very sensitive to the receipt of those refunds. So that may delay some purchasing ability into the latter part of the first quarter. But the significant issue truly is this lag of recovering raw material inflation magnified by the fact that we don't know that we've topped out on steel pricing. So the scrap inflation certainly was significant in December and January. We think that there may be a continuation of that which we've warned our customers that the increases that we've announced to date may in fact not be the last. So we're fearful of that type of inflationary run again."

And it was due to the fact that the U.S. steel inflation in the early half of last year",433,"As we spoke on the third quarter call that we had lost temporarily a little bit of innerspring business to some low pricing that was coming out of Europe at that time. And it was due to the fact that the U.S. steel inflation in the early half of last year just came earlier than the inflation in Europe, magnified by a very low currency euro-dollar exchange rate. We have regained much of that business as we speak, but John's point is valid. And the fourth quarter demand of U.S. innerspring units was impacted; the units were down from a trend standpoint in October about 6%. November was worse, about 8% off. But those of you that look at the ISPA statistics will remember that the ISPA report for November was particularly soft. And then in December, we had recovered to the point that we were about flat. As we speak today, January was flat through the first three shipping weeks. Last week, we were off about 15%. We believe most of that was weather related. So we've regained most of that business as it relates to the industry, our box springs, as we commented, in the fourth quarter were flat. We believe that our box spring sell-through data is more tightly correlated to industry demand than any other statistic that we see, including the ISPA numbers. They also correlate to some reports from some publicly held companies previous to ours. So we think the industry was flattish 4Q. We think we've recovered the vast majority of that lost volume. Box springs, by the way, through the first three shipping weeks of January were up about 1%. So you can see that connectivity between innerspring and box spring sell-through is narrowed to its normal point. As it relates to Sealy, Sealy did have a relaunch of the Posturepedic line, first time in three years. And we are backwardly integrated with Sealy from the standpoint that all of their box springs are ours, and about 2/3 of their wire are ours. So to the degree that they do experience some success in that line, we'll benefit from that. Also at the Las Vegas market, Serta introduced the new Perfect Sleeper offering and did a fantastic job of that introduction also; 100% of that componentry is ours and that product is positioned at some real velocity price points. So good value for the consumer in both those manufacturers' offerings. We expect that the retailers will promote heavily both off the introduction of those new lines and expect some really good things as the year progresses."

The margin contribution to that plan is very important, too. We continue to see progression on our annualized margins. And I think that we will ultimately get to those goals that we established. But again, it's going to be a function of capacity utilization to get there. So don't know exactly when it will happen. Is it going to be 2012? Don't know for sure. One other thing that becomes very important is the product proliferation as we develop new products either that take the place of existing products. We need to do so with a mindset to improve our margins in the process. And then also, like we've spoken before, the implementation of brand new products, new to Leggett, with margins that are above average will certainly assist in that pursuit.

Good morning, and thank you all for participation in our call. We were very encouraged to see higher market demand in sales growth during the first quarter. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 10%, reflecting unit volume",546,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, and thank you all for participation in our call. We were very encouraged to see higher market demand in sales growth during the first quarter. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 10%, reflecting unit volume growth and raw material-related price inflation. Earnings per year -- per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of last year. The earnings benefit from higher unit volume was offset by higher raw material cost as previously expected. 
We continue to experience strong demand in several of our key businesses during the first quarter, including automotive and Office Furniture. In contrast, Store Fixtures' volume declined versus the prior year as this business faced very difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers in the first quarter of 2010. 
During the quarter, we implemented price increases in response to rising commodity cost. The magnitude of the price increases varied by product category and the timing generally lagged the cost inflation. First quarter margins were compressed approximately 100 to 150 basis points due to the lag, but should improve in subsequent quarters. 
Our Intermarket has stabilized and appeared to be gradually improving. As a result, we utilized a significant portion of our share purchase authorization during the first quarter and repurchased 5.4 million shares of our stock. Under the current authorization we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 1.8 million shares during the quarter through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $24.54 the current dividend yield is 4.4%. We ended the first quarter with net debt to net capital at 27.5%, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. No significant fixed-term debt matures until 2013, and we have over $450 million available under our existing bank facility. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital which reflects our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales. 
For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $47 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million which once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million for this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return on a rolling per year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. To date for the 3-year period that will end on December 31 of 2011, we have generated TSR of 29% per year on average, which ranks in the top half but not yet among the top 1/3 of the companies in the S&P 500 index. So we still have some work to do in order to reach our goal. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
First quarter sale in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 6% reflecting the combination of raw material-related price increases and modest unit volume growth. In our U.S. Spring business innerspring unit volumes decreased 2% and box spring units grew 3% versus a strong first quarter of 2010. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, the unit volume increased slightly during the quarter. The continued growth in this business is primarily due to ongoing strength and motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor CD with added functionality and comfort. We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements during 2011. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased during the quarter as unit volume growth was more than offset by higher raw material cost and less income from building sales. We have implemented price increases to recover the higher raw material cost. However as expected. There was a lag in the timing of the recovery and margins were temporarily compressed during the quarter. The selling price increases vary by product line, ranging from approximately 8% in bedding components to more than 20% in furniture hardware as flat rods steel pricing has increased to a greater extent than rod and wire pricing. We continue to closely monitor commodity trends. And while certain of our input costs appear to have stabilized, we will adjust pricing further if we believe sustained changes and cost have occurred. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, first quarter sales decreased 9% as lower fixture and display sale were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture components. Sales in our Fixtures and Display business decreased approximately 20% versus a very strong first quarter of 2010 which included a high level of remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the Office Furniture industry. The first quarter sales in our Office Components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that have been awarded. Our comparisons in this business are becoming more difficult as we anniversary share gains and early stages of market recovery in 2010. 
EBIT in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment was flat and EBIT margins improved versus first quarter of 2010. The impact from lower sales was offset by a gain associated with the sale of a building. 
First quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 19%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher unit volumes in all major areas of the segment. EBIT improved slightly but EBIT margins decreased versus first quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from higher sales was largely offset by higher material costs in the absence of a divestiture gain in the first quarter of last year. Price increases have been implemented to recover the higher steel cost and as a result, margin should improve in subsequent quarters. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 28% sales growth from the first quarter, reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand as well as growth in machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Higher sales and a reduction in the unusual cost led to increase EBIT and EBIT margins during the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by higher raw material cost. 
Automotive industry forecast continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even after considering the tragedy in Japan and its impact on the industry. The industry's 2011 forecast for Asia has been lowered by approximately 1.3 million units by this volume expected to be recovered in 2012. Supply chains disruptions outside of Japan are expected to be resolved within the next few months. And as a result, full year 2011 production in North America and Europe is not expected to be significantly impacted. With those comments I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Given our solid first quarter results and our current view on inflation we increased full year guidance and now expect sales of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. This represents an increase of 4% to 13% versus 2010 and includes approximately 4% sales growth from inflation. Based on the sales forecast, we now project 2011 earnings of $1.25 to $1.50 per share. We expect continued recovery in the economy and our in markets. However we recognize that recovery can be choppy and have allowed for that potential with the lower end of our guidance range. 
We are moving in to the third step of our strategic plan which envisions long-term average growth of 4% to 5% per year. For the next couple of years, growth should exceed this level as our markets continue to recover. Longer term, we recognize the need to supplement the approximate 2% to 3% growth that our markets typically produce with other opportunities. This additional growth should come from both new product innovation and development of new growth areas. 
Some of our growth will likely occur through carefully screened acquisitions. Beginning last fall, we stepped up our solicitation activity and are beginning to see some opportunities into the pipeline. These targets must meet stringent, screening criteria including high confidence and value creation and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets. Disciplined growth takes time, so we are not expecting significant benefits from these efforts for a while. 
An off script before I pass the microphone, I'd like to mention that today we are celebrating Susan McCoy's 25th anniversary with the company. She's such a dedicated partner to all of us and provides excellent investor relations service. Thanks, Susan for all you do and congratulation on this noteworthy milestone. I know you didn't I was going to say that. And with those comments I'll now turn the call back to David DeSonier."

It was up significantly more than in currency as there is a better mix of product there that the low end has been much more compressed than the high end. The pocket coil volume has been extremely good here up and there was earlier selling price inflation in Europe than there was in North America. Our Asian volume was up about 35%. And that is our walking away from some very low margin business. It's relatively small. If we break it down in magnitude of absolute units, Europe is obviously larger than any of the other regions.

We don't see that demand, though we see maybe more normalized but possibly at a somewhat lower level. But we're hearing significant optimism about 2012. So but we know that industry is volatile. It's almost impossible to predict units to the other questions that you had. But it's so directly correlated to consumer confidence that we'll see. There's just not a lot of visibility in that market. I will say though, that our people are doing a wonderful job performing in those businesses. We have gained market share. I think that the quality of our relationships with our customers are at all-time highs. The manufacturing efficiencies of our facilities. We're really pleased to be in that Store Fixture business."

We were very encouraged to see higher market demand and sales growth during the first quarter. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 10%, reflecting unit volume growth and raw material-related price inflation. Earnings per year -- per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of last year. The earnings benefit from higher unit volume was offset by higher raw material cost as previously expected. 
We continue to experience strong demand in several of our key businesses during the first quarter, including Automotive and Office Furniture. In contrast, Store Fixtures volume declined versus the prior year as this business faced very difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers in the first quarter of 2010. 
During the quarter, we implemented price increases in response to rising commodity cost. The magnitude of the price increases varied by product category and the timing generally lagged the cost inflation. First quarter margins were compressed approximately 100 to 150 basis points due to the lag, but should improve in subsequent quarters. 
Our Intermarkets have stabilized and appeared to be gradually improving. As a result, we utilized a significant portion of our share purchase authorization during the first quarter and repurchased 5.4 million shares of our stock. Under the current authorization we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 1.8 million shares during the quarter through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $24.54 the current dividend yield is 4.4%. We ended the first quarter with net debt to net capital at 27.5%, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. No significant fixed-term debt matures until 2013, and we have over $450 million available under our existing bank facility. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital, which reflects our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales. 
For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $47 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million, which had once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million for this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. To date for the 3-year period that will end on December 31 of 2011, we have generated TSR of 29% per year on average, which ranks in the top half but not yet among the top 1/3 of the companies in the S&P 500 index. So we still have some work to do in order to reach our goal. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
First quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 6%,  reflecting the combination of raw material-related price increases and modest unit volume growth. In our U.S. Spring business Innerspring unit volumes decreased 2% and Boxspring units grew 3% versus a strong first quarter of 2010. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, the unit volume increased slightly during the quarter. The continued growth in this business is primarily due to ongoing strength and motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor seating with added functionality and comfort. We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be somewhat choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements during 2011. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased during the quarter as unit volume growth was more than offset by higher raw material cost and less income from building sales. We have implemented price increases to recover the higher raw material cost. However as expected, there was a lag in the timing of the recovery and margins were temporarily compressed during the quarter. The selling price increases vary by product line, ranging from approximately 8% in bedding components to more than 20% in furniture hardware as flat rolled steel pricing has increased to a greater extent than rod and wire pricing. We continue to closely monitor commodity trends. And while certain of our input costs appear to have stabilized, we will adjust pricing further if we believe sustained changes in cost have occurred. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, first quarter sales decreased 9% as lower fixture and display sale were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture components. Sales in our Fixtures and Display business decreased approximately 20% versus a very strong first quarter of 2010 which included a high level of remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. 
We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the Office Furniture industry. First quarter sales in our Office Components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that have been awarded. Our comparisons in this business are becoming more difficult as we anniversary share gains and early stages of market recovery in 2010. 
EBIT in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment was flat and EBIT margins improved versus first quarter of 2010. The impact from lower sales was offset by a gain associated with the sale of a building. 
First quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 19%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher unit volumes in all major areas of the segment. EBIT improved slightly but EBIT margins decreased versus first quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from higher sales was largely offset by higher material costs in the absence of a divestiture gain in the first quarter of last year. Price increases have been implemented to recover the higher steel cost, and as a result margin should improve in subsequent quarters. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 28% sales growth from the first quarter, reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand as well as growth in Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Higher sales and a reduction in the unusual cost led to increases EBIT and EBIT margins during the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by higher raw material cost. 
Automotive industry forecast continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even after considering the tragedy in Japan and its impact on the industry. The industry's 2011 forecast for Asia has been lowered by approximately 1.3 million units but this volume is expected to be recovered in 2012. Supply chain disruptions outside of Japan are expected to be resolved within the next few months. And as a result, full year 2011 production in North America and Europe is not expected to be significantly impacted. With those comments I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

This represents an increase of 4% to 13% versus 2010 and includes approximately 4% sales growth from inflation. Based on the sales forecast, we now project 2011 earnings of $1.25 to $1.50 per share. We expect continued recovery in the economy and our in markets. However we recognize that recovery can be choppy and have allowed for that potential with the lower end of our guidance range. 
We are moving into the third step of our strategic plan, which envisions long-term average growth of 4% to 5% per year. For the next couple of years, growth should exceed this level as our markets continue to recover. Longer term, we recognize the need to supplement the approximate 2% to 3% growth that our markets typically produce with other opportunities. This additional growth should come from both new product innovation and development of new growth areas. 
Some of our growth will likely occur through carefully screened acquisitions. Beginning last fall, we stepped up our solicitation activity and are beginning to see some new opportunities into the pipeline. These targets must meet stringent, screening criteria, including high confidence and value creation and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets. Disciplined growth takes time, so we are not expecting significant benefits from these efforts for a while.

She's such a dedicated partner to all of us and provides excellent investor relations service. Thanks, Susan for all you do and congratulations on this noteworthy milestone.

So we were pretty satisfied to get through the first quarter with that negative 2% on the industry on units, 3% off the Boxspring. The 3% up in Boxspring, I think, is maybe a sign that the middle price points of the bedding industry starting to recover a little bit, which is good news for all of us. But in terms of the industry it's difficult -- our view of the industry is that innerspring mattresses was probably up 1% to 2%. And as you see it [indiscernible]  over the next few days obviously, it will be tweaked up because the Specialty guys had another fantastic first quarter.

It was up significantly more than in currency as there is a better mix of product there that the low end has been much more compressed than the high end. The pocket coil volume has been extremely good in Europe and there was earlier selling price inflation in Europe than there was in North America. Our Asian volume was up about 35%. And that is our walking away from some very low margin business. It's relatively small. If we break it down in magnitude of absolute units, Europe is obviously larger than any of the other regions. So it was all over the board but we were certainly pleased with our International Spring and that the individuals that run those facilities are faced with the same raw material inflation issues that we are in the United States. And their ability to have pricing discipline and pass-through with that inflation in a very difficult environment is commendable. They've done a fabulous job."

As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 10%, reflecting unit volume growth and raw material-related price inflation. Earnings per year -- per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of last year. The earnings benefit from higher unit volume was offset by higher raw material cost as previously expected. 
We continue to experience strong demand in several of our key businesses during the first quarter, including Automotive and Office Furniture. In contrast, Store Fixtures volume declined versus the prior year as this business faced very difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers in the first quarter of 2010. 
During the quarter, we implemented price increases in response to rising commodity cost. The magnitude of the price increases varied by product category and the timing generally lagged the cost inflation. First quarter margins were compressed approximately 100 to 150 basis points due to the lag, but should improve in subsequent quarters. 
Our Intermarkets have stabilized and appeared to be gradually improving. As a result, we utilized a significant portion of our share purchase authorization during the first quarter and repurchased 5.4 million shares of our stock. Under the current authorization we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 1.8 million shares during the quarter through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $24.54 the current dividend yield is 4.4%. We ended the first quarter with net debt to net capital at 27.5%, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. No significant fixed-term debt matures until 2013, and we have over $450 million available under our existing bank facility. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital, which reflects our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales. 
For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $47 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million, which had once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million for this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. To date for the 3-year period that will end on December 31 of 2011, we have generated TSR of 29% per year on average, which ranks in the top half but not yet among the top 1/3 of the companies in the S&P 500 index. So we still have some work to do in order to reach our goal. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

First quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment gr",673,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments I will discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
First quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 6%, reflecting the combination of raw material-related price increases and modest unit volume growth. In our U.S. Spring business Innerspring unit volumes decreased 2% and Boxspring units grew 3% versus a strong first quarter of 2010. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, the unit volume increased slightly during the quarter. The continued growth in this business is primarily due to ongoing strength and motion upholstery as consumers continue to favor seating with added functionality and comfort. We believe our residential end markets have stabilized and while recovery may continue to be somewhat choppy, we are expecting modest overall demand improvements during 2011. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased during the quarter as unit volume growth was more than offset by higher raw material costs and less income from building sales. We have implemented price increases to recover the higher raw material cost. However as expected, there was a lag in the timing of the recovery and margins were temporarily compressed during the quarter. The selling price increases vary by product line, ranging from approximately 8% in bedding components to more than 20% in furniture hardware as flat rolled steel pricing has increased to a greater extent than rod and wire pricing. We continue to closely monitor commodity trends. And while certain of our input costs appear to have stabilized, we will adjust pricing further if we believe sustained changes in cost have occurred. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, first quarter sales decreased 9% as lower fixture and display sales were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture components. Sales in our Fixtures and Display business decreased approximately 20% versus a very strong first quarter of 2010, which included a high level of remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. 
We continue to see convincing signs of improvement in the Office Furniture industry. First quarter sales in our Office Components business grew approximately 20%, reflecting both market recovery and new programs that have been awarded. Our comparisons in this business are becoming more difficult as we anniversary share gains and early stages of market recovery in 2010. 
EBIT in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment was flat and EBIT margins improved versus first quarter of 2010. The impact from lower sales was offset by a gain associated with the sale of a building. 
First quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 19%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher unit volumes in all major areas of the segment. EBIT improved slightly but EBIT margins decreased versus first quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from higher sales was largely offset by higher raw material costs and the absence of a divestiture gain in the first quarter of last year. Price increases have been implemented to recover the higher steel cost, and as a result margin should improve in subsequent quarters. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 28% sales growth from the first quarter, reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand as well as growth in Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Higher sales and a reduction in the unusual cost led to increased EBIT and EBIT margins during the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by higher raw material cost. 
Automotive industry forecast continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even after considering the tragedy in Japan and its impact on the industry. The industry's 2011 forecast for Asia has been lowered by approximately 1.3 million units but this volume is expected to be recovered in 2012. Supply chain disruptions outside of Japan are expected to be resolved within the next few months. And as a result, full year 2011 production in North America and Europe is not expected to be significantly impacted. With those comments I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Given our solid first quarter results and our current view on inflation, we increased full year guidance and now expect sales of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. This represents an increase of 4% to 13% versus 2010 and includes approximately 4% sales growth from inflation. Based on the sales forecast, we now project 2011 earnings of $1.25 to $1.50 per share. We expect continued recovery in the economy and our end markets. However we recognize that recovery can be choppy and have allowed for that potential with the lower end of our guidance range. 
We are moving into the third step of our strategic plan, which envisions long-term average growth of 4% to 5% per year. For the next couple of years, growth should exceed this level as our markets continue to recover. Longer term, we recognize the need to supplement the approximate 2% to 3% growth that our markets typically produce with other opportunities. This additional growth should come from both new product innovation and development of new growth areas.
Some of our growth will likely occur through carefully screened acquisitions. Beginning last fall, we stepped up our solicitation activity and are beginning to see some new opportunities enter the pipeline. These targets must meet stringent, screening criteria, including high confidence and value creation and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets. Disciplined growth takes time, so we are not expecting significant benefits from these efforts for a while. 
And off script before I pass the microphone, I'd like to mention that today we are celebrating Susan McCoy's 25th anniversary with the company. She's such a dedicated partner to all of us and provides excellent investor relations service. Thanks, Susan for all you do and congratulations on this noteworthy milestone. I know you didn't know I was going to say that. And with those comments, I'll now turn the call back to Dave DeSonier."

So we were pretty satisfied to get through the first quarter with that negative 2% on units, 3% up in Boxspring. The 3% up in Boxspring, I think, is maybe a sign that the middle price points of the bedding industry starting to recover a little bit, which is good news for all of us. But in terms of the industry it's difficult -- our view of the industry is that innerspring mattresses was probably up 1% to 2%.

It was up significantly more than that in currency as there is a better mix of product there that the low end has been much more compressed than the high end. The pocket coil volume has been extremely good in Europe and there was earlier selling price inflation in Europe than there was in North America. Our Asian volume was off about 35%.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales grew 8% versus the prior year, from a combination of inflation, currency exchange rates and higher trade sales from our steel mill.",695,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales grew 8% versus the prior year, from a combination of inflation, currency exchange rates and higher trade sales from our steel mill. Excluding these factors, sales during the quarter, were roughly flat with prior year. Unit volumes declined, both year-over-year and sequentially. In most of our major residential businesses reflecting continued uncertainty on the parts of consumers and choppiness in the broader global economies. Store Fixtures volume also decrease versus the prior year, as this business continues to face difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers last year in 2010. The markets where we saw year-over-year growth during the quarter, were Automotive, Office Furniture Components, Power Foundations, Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Earnings for the second quarter, were $0.37 per share and included a $0.02 per share benefit from an unusual tax item. In the second quarter of last year, earnings were $0.34 per share. Operationally, we performed well during the quarter, given the macro and market demand headwinds. Growth profit dollars increased slightly versus second quarter of 2010, which was our strongest operational quarter last year. Gross margin percentages for the quarter were diluted, as typically occurs during inflationary periods, when we raised selling prices to recover significant cost increases. EBIT decreased year-over-year as a result of unusually high selling and administrative expense. Several items led to the increase in SG&A cost. Some of those included, the pledge we made towards Joplin tornado relief efforts, professional fees, including consulting services associated with growth projects, and trade show expense related to a bi-annual show that many of our businesses attend in Germany. We continue to strive for annualize SG&A cost at 10% of sales or less. As expected, earnings improved sequentially as a result of price increases we implemented late in the first quarter to recover high material costs.
Raw material costs have stabilized since the first quarter, which has allowed pricing to catch up with the higher cost in most of our businesses. During the quarter, we bought back 2 million shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to 7.4 million shares. Under the current authorization, we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 900,000 shares during the quarter, through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. Year-to-date issuance for these programs are at 2.7 million shares. In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett. At yesterday's closing price at $22.10, the current dividend yield is 4.9%. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital at 28.3%, which is below our long term targeted range of 30% to 40%. Our operating folks continue to closely monitor working capital levels. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales, below our 15% target. For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $54 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million, which should once again, comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling three-year basis, to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. To-date for the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2011, we have generated TSR of 23% per year on average, which is a top half performance. While that is a very good shareholder return, it does not place us in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, so we still have some work to do in order to achieve our goal.
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights."

In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Second quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew",552,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Second quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 2%, unit sales -- unit volume declined in nearly all of the segment's business units but this contraction was more than offset by raw material related price increases and changes in currency exchange rates. The only business within the segment that had meaningful unit growth was Power Foundations. Those operations were up 46% during the quarter. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes decreased 5% and boxspring units were down 3% during the quarter. In our Furniture Hardware business, second quarter unit volume decreased 12% versus the prior year. Prior-year comparisons continue to be difficult during the second quarter in both bedding and furniture, as demand was relatively strong in 2010 through mid-year, and then weakened substantially in the back half of the year. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the prior year, primarily from lower unit volume. In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, second quarter sales decreased 2%, as lower fixture and display sales were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture Components. Sales in our Fixture and Display business decreased approximately 10% versus a very strong second quarter of 2010, which include a significant remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Office Furniture Components business, as that industry continues to show convincing signs of recovery. Our second quarter sales in the business unit grew approximately 15%, which is notable since we posted 20% growth in the second quarter of 2010.
Comparisons in this business become more difficult in the coming quarters. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily from lower sales. Second quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 18% reflecting steel related price inflation and a higher trade sales from our steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing reflecting weakness in bedding furniture demand and also, the second quarter disruption in Automotive production. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume in Wire and Tubing and higher raw material and transportation cost. In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 20% sales growth in the second quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand, as well as growth in machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to our year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. Higher sales lead to increase EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material cost and currency impacts. Automotive industry forecast continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even with the impact from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The current 2011 production forecast in North America and Europe has increased by approximately 1 million units in total, compared to the forecast issued at the start of the year and the forecast ratio has been reduced by roughly 1 million units, since the earthquake. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

This is actually Chad filling in for Budd. David, your balance sheet remains under-levered relative to your target capital structure and you have signaled a greater willingness to make acquisitions but we have yet to see any real movement. Should we read that as perhaps there's a lack of opportunities that fit the Fundamental operating criteria you're looking for or have there been businesses that maybe match the fundamental criteria but maybe not at the price that you'd like. And then just kind of a follow-up to that, does the softening macro-environment make you more hesitant to make a deal in the second term?"

There have been a couple, so we continue to look for acquisitions.

There are some continued businesses that we are likely to acquire, nothing of significant size at this point to report at this point. And as you know, we comment on those after we make the acquisitions but I guess what I want to leave you, Chad and you can relate this to Budd, is that is we still believe that there are some good acquisitions to be had for the company and even though the market does tend to put a bit of a bias or more conservatism into our valuations, I think that you should expect to see some acquisitions of between here and at the end of the year."

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales grew 8% versus the prior year, from a combination of inflation, currency exchange rates and higher trade sales from our steel mill.",695,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales grew 8% versus the prior year, from a combination of inflation, currency exchange rates and higher trade sales from our steel mill. Excluding these factors, sales during the quarter, were roughly flat with the prior year. Unit volumes declined, both year-over-year and sequentially, in most of our major residential businesses, reflecting continued uncertainty on the parts of consumers and choppiness in the broader global economies. 
Store Fixtures volume also decrease versus the prior year, as this business continued to face difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers last year in 2010. The markets where we saw year-over-year growth during the quarter, were Automotive, Office Furniture components, Power Foundations, Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Earnings for the second quarter, were $0.37 per share and included a $0.02 per share benefit from an unusual tax item. In the second quarter of last year, earnings were $0.34 per share. 
Operationally, we performed well during the quarter, given the macro and market demand headwinds. Gross profit dollars increased slightly versus second quarter of 2010, which was our strongest operational quarter last year. Gross margin percentages for the quarter were diluted, as typically occurs during inflationary periods when we raise selling prices to recover significant cost increases. EBIT decreased year-over-year as a result of unusually high selling and administrative expense. 
Several items led to the increase in SG&A cost. Some of those included: the pledge we made towards Joplin tornado relief efforts; professional fees, including consulting services associated with growth projects; and trade show expense related to a biannual show that many of our businesses attend in Germany. We continue to strive for annualize SG&A costs at 10% of sales or less. As expected, earnings improved sequentially as a result of price increases we implemented late in the first quarter to recover high material costs.
Raw material costs have stabilized since the first quarter, which has allowed pricing to catch up with the higher cost in most of our businesses. During the quarter, we bought back 2 million shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to 7.4 million shares. Under the current authorization, we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 900,000 shares during the quarter, through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. Year-to-date issuance for these programs are at 2.7 million shares. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett. At yesterday's closing price of $22.10, the current dividend yield is 4.9%. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital at 28.3%, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
Our operating folks continue to closely monitor working capital levels. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales, below our 15% target. For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $54 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million, which should once again, comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
To date for the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2011, we have generated TSR of 23% per year on average, which is a top half performance. While that is a very good shareholder return, it does not place us in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, so we still have some work to do in order to achieve our goal. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who'll provide some operating highlights."

Second quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment gr",552,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Second quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 2%. Unit sales -- unit volume declined in nearly all of the segment's business units, but this contraction was more than offset by raw material-related price increases and changes in currency exchange rates. The only business within the segment that had meaningful unit growth was Power Foundations. Those operations were up 46% during the quarter. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes decreased 5% and boxspring units were down 3% during the quarter. In our Furniture Hardware business, second quarter unit volume decreased 12% versus the prior year. Prior year comparisons continue to be difficult during the second quarter in both bedding and furniture, as demand was relatively strong in 2010 through mid-year, and then weakened substantially in the back half of the year. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the prior year, primarily from lower unit volume. In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, second quarter sales decreased 2%, as lower fixture and display sales were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture Components. Sales in our Fixture and Display business decreased approximately 10% versus a very strong second quarter of 2010, which include a significant remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Office Furniture Components business, as that industry continues to show convincing signs of recovery. Our second quarter sales in the business unit grew approximately 15%, which is notable since we posted 20% growth in the second quarter of 2010.
Comparisons in this business become more difficult in the coming quarters. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily from lower sales. Second quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 18%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and a higher trade sales from our steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing, reflecting weakness in bedding furniture demand and also the second quarter disruption in Automotive production. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume in wire and tubing and higher raw material and transportation cost. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 20% sales growth in the second quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand, as well as growth in machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to our year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. Higher sales led to increase EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material costs and currency impacts. 
Automotive industry forecast continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even with the impact from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The current 2011 production forecast in North America and Europe has increased by approximately 1 million units in total, compared to the forecast issued at the start of the year and the forecast for Asia has been reduced by roughly 1 million units, since the earthquake. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We have 50% to 60% is what we put out there for a long time, is where we intend to navigate back toward. If you just look at the second quarter, I know that's not a real good metric, but if you look at the $0.37 we just earned and we paid out $0.27 on July 15, that's about a 73% payout ratio. Certainly not particularly proud of that, but we're certainly making some headway. And for the full year, at the midpoint of our guidance, if we're going to pay something around $0.27, $0.28 sort of range for this year in those quarters, that continues to have us below 90% as a payout ratio. We are very mindful that the fact that our earnings continue to be well south of $2 right now and we're paying more than $1 every year. So until that math lines up, we're going to out of field on our payout ratio. But having said all of that, our free cash flow continues to strongly support our current rate of dividend payouts and expected growth.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales grew 8% versus the prior year, from a combination of inflation, currency exchange rates and higher trade sales from our steel mill. Excluding these factors, sales during the quarter were roughly flat with the prior year. Unit volumes declined, both year-over-year and sequentially, in most of our major residential businesses, reflecting continued uncertainty on the parts of consumers and choppiness in the broader global economies. 
Store Fixtures volume also decrease versus the prior year, as this business continued to face difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers last year in 2010. The markets where we saw year-over-year growth during the quarter, were Automotive, Office Furniture components, Power Foundations, Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Earnings for the second quarter, were $0.37 per share and included a $0.02 per share benefit from an unusual tax item. In the second quarter of last year, earnings were $0.34 per share. 
Operationally, we performed well during the quarter, given the macro and market demand headwinds. Gross profit dollars increased slightly versus second quarter of 2010, which was our strongest operational quarter last year. Gross margin percentages for the quarter were diluted, as typically occurs during inflationary periods when we raise selling prices to recover significant cost increases. EBIT decreased year-over-year as a result of unusually high selling and administrative expense. 
Several items led to the increase in SG&A cost. Some of those included: the pledge we made towards Joplin tornado relief efforts; professional fees, including consulting services associated with growth projects; and trade show expense related to a biannual show that many of our businesses attend in Germany. We continue to strive for annualize SG&A costs at 10% of sales or less. As expected, earnings improved sequentially as a result of price increases we implemented late in the first quarter to recover high material costs.
Raw material costs have stabilized since the first quarter, which has allowed pricing to catch up with the higher cost in most of our businesses. During the quarter, we bought back 2 million shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to 7.4 million shares. Under the current authorization, we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 900,000 shares during the quarter, through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. Year-to-date issuance for these programs are at 2.7 million shares. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett. At yesterday's closing price of $22.10, the current dividend yield is 4.9%. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital at 28.3%, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
Our operating folks continue to closely monitor working capital levels. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales, below our 15% target. For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $54 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million, which should once again, comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
To date for the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2011, we have generated TSR of 23% per year on average, which is a top half performance. While that is a very good shareholder return, it does not place us in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, so we still have some work to do in order to achieve our goal. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who'll provide some operating highlights."

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Second quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 2%. Unit sales -- unit volume declined in nearly all of the segment's business units, but this contraction was more than offset by raw material-related price increases and changes in currency exchange rates. The only business within the segment that had meaningful unit growth was Power Foundations. Those operations were up 46% during the quarter. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes decreased 5% and boxspring units were down 3% during the quarter. In our Furniture Hardware business, second quarter unit volume decreased 12% versus the prior year. Prior year comparisons continue to be difficult during the second quarter in both bedding and furniture, as demand was relatively strong in 2010 through mid-year, and then weakened substantially in the back half of the year. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the prior year, primarily from lower unit volume. In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, second quarter sales decreased 2%, as lower fixture and display sales were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture Components. Sales in our Fixture and Display business decreased approximately 10% versus a very strong second quarter of 2010, which include a significant remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Office Furniture Components business, as that industry continues to show convincing signs of recovery. Our second quarter sales in the business unit grew approximately 15%, which is notable since we posted 20% growth in the second quarter of 2010.
Comparisons in this business become more difficult in the coming quarters. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily from lower sales. Second quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 18%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and a higher trade sales from our steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing, reflecting weakness in bedding furniture demand and also the second quarter disruption in Automotive production. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume in wire and tubing and higher raw material and transportation cost. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 20% sales growth in the second quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand, as well as growth in machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to our year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. Higher sales led to increase EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material costs and currency impacts. 
Automotive industry forecasts continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even with the impact from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The current 2011 production forecast in North America and Europe has increased by approximately 1 million units in total, compared to the forecast issued at the start of the year and the forecast for Asia has been reduced by roughly 1 million units since the earthquake. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Certainly not particularly proud of that, but we're certainly making some headway. And for the full year, at the midpoint of our guidance, if we're going to pay something around $0.27, $0.28 sort of range for this year in those quarters, that continues to have us below 90% as a payout ratio. We are very mindful that the fact that our earnings continue to be well south of $2 right now and we're paying more than $1 every year. So until that math lines up, we're going to out of field on our payout ratio.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales grew 8% versus the prior year, from a combination of inflation, currency exchange rates and higher trade sales from our steel mill. Excluding these factors, sales during the quarter were roughly flat with the prior year. Unit volumes declined, both year-over-year and sequentially, in most of our major residential businesses, reflecting continued uncertainty on the parts of consumers and choppiness in the broader global economies. 
Store Fixtures volume also decrease versus the prior year, as this business continued to face difficult comparisons related to high levels of remodeling activity by large customers last year in 2010. The markets where we saw year-over-year growth during the quarter, were Automotive, Office Furniture components, Power Foundations, Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Earnings for the second quarter, were $0.37 per share and included a $0.02 per share benefit from an unusual tax item. In the second quarter of last year, earnings were $0.34 per share. 
Operationally, we performed well during the quarter, given the macro and market demand headwinds. Gross profit dollars increased slightly versus second quarter of 2010, which was our strongest operational quarter last year. Gross margin percentages for the quarter were diluted, as typically occurs during inflationary periods when we raise selling prices to recover significant cost increases. EBIT decreased year-over-year as a result of unusually high selling and administrative expense. 
Several items led to the increase in SG&A cost. Some of those included: the pledge we made towards Joplin tornado relief efforts; professional fees, including consulting services associated with growth projects; and trade show expense related to a biannual show that many of our businesses attend in Germany. We continue to strive for annualize SG&A costs at 10% of sales or less. As expected, earnings improved sequentially as a result of price increases we implemented late in the first quarter to recover high material costs.
Raw material costs have stabilized since the first quarter, which has allowed pricing to catch up with the higher cost in most of our businesses. During the quarter, we bought back 2 million shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to 7.4 million shares. Under the current authorization, we can purchase up to 10 million shares annually. We also issued 900,000 shares during the quarter, through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. Year-to-date issuance for these programs are at 2.7 million shares. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett. At yesterday's closing price of $22.10, the current dividend yield is 4.9%. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital at 28.3%, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
Our operating folks continue to closely monitor working capital levels. We ended the quarter with working capital at 14.3% of annualized sales, below our 15% target. For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $54 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $300 million, which should once again, comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should approximate $85 million this year and dividends should require about $155 million. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
To date for the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2011, we have generated TSR of 23% per year on average, which is a top half performance. While that is a very good shareholder return, it does not place us in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, so we still have some work to do in order to achieve our goal. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who'll provide some operating highlights."

Second quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment grew 2%. Unit sales -- unit volume declined in nearly all of the segment's business units, but this contraction was more than offset by raw material-related price increases and changes in currency exchange rates. The only business within the segment that had meaningful unit growth was Power Foundations. Those operations were up 46% during the quarter. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes decreased 5% and boxspring units were down 3% during the quarter. In our Furniture Hardware business, second quarter unit volume decreased 12% versus the prior year. Prior year comparisons continue to be difficult during the second quarter in both bedding and furniture, as demand was relatively strong in 2010 through mid-year, and then weakened substantially in the back half of the year. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the prior year, primarily from lower unit volume. In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, second quarter sales decreased 2%, as lower fixture and display sales were partially offset by continued growth in Office Furniture Components. Sales in our Fixture and Display business decreased approximately 10% versus a very strong second quarter of 2010, which include a significant remodeling activity by some of our large value-oriented customers. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Office Furniture Components business, as that industry continues to show convincing signs of recovery. Our second quarter sales in the business unit grew approximately 15%, which is notable since we posted 20% growth in the second quarter of 2010.
Comparisons in this business become more difficult in the coming quarters. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily from lower sales. Second quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 18%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and a higher trade sales from our steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing, reflecting weakness in bedding furniture demand and also the second quarter disruption in Automotive production. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume in wire and tubing and higher raw material and transportation cost. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 20% sales growth in the second quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand, as well as growth in machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to our year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. Higher sales led to increase EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material costs and currency impacts. 
Automotive industry forecasts continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth in 2011, even with the impact from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The current 2011 production forecast in North America and Europe has increased by approximately 1 million units in total, compared to the forecast issued at the start of the year and the forecast for Asia has been reduced by roughly 1 million units since the earthquake. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Certainly not particularly proud of that, but we're certainly making some headway.

As we reported yesterday, earnings for the third quarter were $0.31 per share or flat with the same quarter of last year. Third quarter sales grew 9% versus the prior year from items that brought little incremental profits. Inflation and currency rate fluctuation accounted for the bulk of the growth, and trade sales from steel mil provided 3% unit growth. 
Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was essentially flat. We are not satisfied with our results this quarter. 
Earnings and margins decreased both year-over-year and sequentially. Competitive pricing and customer downspec-ing, both of which Karl will talk about in his segment comments, are impacting certain product categories. When combined with our efforts to reduce inventory by curtailing production, which also reduced overhead absorption, earnings and margins were under pressure. Earlier in the year, we had expected overall unit demand to improve this fall. That has not happened, and many of the recent forecasts and surveys from well-regarded sources suggest that our economy will be facing headwinds for longer than previously expected. We have been too patient and are no longer willing to wait for an economic recovery to bolster earnings. As a result, we have recently initiated additional efforts to decrease excess production capacity, reduce overhead and trim our cost structure.
For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $101 million, which includes the reduction in inventory levels that I mentioned earlier. With ongoing concerns about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels. 
We ended the quarter with working capital 12.5% of annualized sales. New this quarter was a $30 million current liability associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in late 2010. Excluding that item, working capital was at 13.3% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. 
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share, reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett and only two that have higher growth rates over that 40-year period. 
Maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us. And again, this year, we expect operating cash to comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital investitures and dividends. For the year, operating cash should approximate $300 million. Capital expenditures should not exceed $80 million, and dividends should require about $155 million. 
During the quarter, as planned, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. So far this year, we have repurchased 9.4 million shares under current 10 million share authorization. We have also issued 2.9 million shares year-to-date through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. 
We ended the third quarter with net debt at 31% of net capital, which is at the low end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year. To date, for the 3-year period that will end of December 31 of 2011, we generated TSR of 22% per year on average, which is top half performance. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Third quarter sales in Residential Furnishing segment grew 6%, primarily from inflation and changes in currency exchange rates. Unit volumes were up slightly versus a weak third quarter 2010. 
In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes were, and boxspring units were up slightly during the quarter. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, third quarter unit volume decreased 9% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in power foundations, with unit shipments of 46%. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the third quarter of 2010, primarily from higher raw material costs and increased restructuring-related expenses. Competitive industry pricing and customer downspec-ing are also impacting EBIT and margin both year-over-year and sequentially. With depressed industry volumes in anticipation of lower steel cost in certain cases, we have reduced prices to retain market share. Also, in an effort to manage their own cost, customers in certain instances, have chosen to replace higher value components with lower value components. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we have initiated additional efforts to decrease excess production capacity. The activities announced today in the Residential segment include operations in bedding and carpet underlay. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, third quarter sales decreased 5%, as lower Fixture & Display sales were partially offset by continued growth in office furniture components. Sales in our Fixture & Display business decreased approximately 10% versus third quarter of 2010. Our major retail customers have significantly curtailed their current year remodeling activity. 
Sales in our Office Furniture business grew 7%,  versus a more difficult comparison in the third quarter last year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business, as the office furniture industry continues to recover. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing and Component segment decreased versus third quarter of 2010, primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales. As part of our efforts to reduce overhead and trim our cost structure, we have initiated the closing of 1 of our point-of-purchase fixture display locations. 
Third quarter sales in our Industrial Material segment increased 18%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trader sales from steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing, primarily reflecting weakness in bedding, furniture and store fixtures demand.
EBIT decreased versus third quarter 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume and wire and tubing and higher raw material costs. EBIT margins also decreased as a result of a change in sales from interest segment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution, in addition to covering overhead cost, and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rods has been down. However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales, while preserving comparable EBIT levels. 
Our efforts to reduce the production capacity also impact this segment. We have recently announced plans to close 1 of our 6 domestic wire-drawing operations. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 17% sales growth in the third quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand as well as growth in machinery and commercial vehicle products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. 
Higher sales led to increased EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material costs and currency impacts. Automotive industry forecast continued to anticipate meaningful global production growth for the remainder of 2011 and in 2012. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced yesterday, we reduced our full-year earnings guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 range. The decrease versus previous guidance reflects the weaker-than-anticipated the third quarter results and lower-than-previous expectations for the economy. 
For the full year, we expect sales of approximately $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% versus 2010, largely due to inflation, currency fluctuation and trade sales growth at the steel mill. Unit volumes are expected to be essentially flat for the year. 
And in closing, to repeat myself, we are not pleased with this quarter's results. And as we have done before, we are acutely focused on actions that will yield improved ongoing profitability in the future.

To date in October, shipments were up about 2%, so it's just flattish, more of the same. Boxspring units were slightly positive in the third quarter, and they were also up about 2% in October. The outlook for the quarter in U.S. spring is flat, a continuation of that. We continue to feel that we have regained the share. You remember in our third quarter comments of last year, we had noted that we had lost some share. We've regained that share, so we believe that the innerspring portion of the U.S. mattress business is flattish to maybe slightly negative. But we will quickly admit that the innerspring portion of the finished mattress sector is losing some share. So my comments are directly related to the innerspring portion of the Finished Mattress business. As far as furniture hardware goes, the demand there was disappointing. July was much softer than anticipated. Saw more of that in August. We saw some recovery in September and continued to see that recovery in the first few shipping weeks of October. As you know, unlike bedding which is in the trough of its seasonal selling, that furniture should be closer to the peak. What we think that we experienced, and this is somewhat anecdotal, is a destocking in the finished inventory industry -- from a furniture perspective, in early third quarter. We saw that at the OEM level. We believe that the retailers were doing the same thing. So we don't believe that we lost share, but we certainly are under some pricing pressures in that industry."

As you know, there's some connectivity into industrial from both a wire and from a tubing perspective, so downspec-ing truly affects both segments. But what we experienced, to make this a little broader, there's a constant question of us about as it relates to pricing power, specifically in residential as it relates to steel. We did raise prices in the second quarter based on significant increase in raw material. We successfully passed through that inflation. At the same time, our bedding and furniture customers were dealing with inflation from a number of different sources, primarily petrochemical-based impacting polyurethane foam and some of the non-fashion fabrics. And as those customers tried to pass through that inflation that they were receiving from all sectors of the raw material supply, they had problem passing through to retail. So the response to that was to decontent, at the same time, that the consumer is bifurcating. They're trading down at the low end, and we're dealing with a situation were both the furniture and bedding that it's almost as if the product can't get cheap enough. And at the top end, we're seeing real strength in both furniture and bedding. So that bifurcation is a real issue that has become more acute as the consumer has become more pessimistic as the years gone on, so it truly is a Residential Furnishings issue."

In the long products, which are wire and rod, we are not seeing price decreases and are not seeing much down pressure. So this is a flat products issue, so therefore more significantly impacts furniture than bedding and steel peat from an input cost perspective in the second quarter. As I said earlier, we raised prices based on that. That cost inflation ran through our cost sheets in the third quarter. We are now replacing that steel with lower steel cost, again from a threat perspective. And steel continues to deflate. Part of the margin squeeze issue that we got ourselves into is our customers were pressuring us for price reductions earlier than we ran that lower cost through our cost of goods sold. So it will continue into the fourth. We believe that it will be through the system by the end of the fourth quarter."

As we reported yesterday, earnings for the third quarter were $0.31 per share or flat with the same quarter of last year. Third quarter sales grew 9% versus the prior year from items that brought",613,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call.  As we reported yesterday, earnings for the third quarter were $0.31 per share or flat with the same quarter of last year. Third quarter sales grew 9% versus the prior year from items that brought little incremental profit. Inflation and currency rate fluctuation accounted for the bulk of the growth, and trade sales from our steel mill provided 3% unit growth. 
Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was essentially flat. We are not satisfied with our results this quarter.  Earnings and margins decreased both year-over-year and sequentially. Competitive pricing and customer down spec-ing, both of which Karl will talk about in his segment comments, are impacting certain product categories. When combined with our efforts to reduce inventory by curtailing production, which also reduced overhead absorption, earnings and margins were under pressure. Earlier in the year, we had expected overall unit demand to improve this fall. That has not happened, and many of the recent forecasts and surveys from well-regarded sources suggest that our economy will be facing headwinds for longer than previously expected. We have been too patient and are no longer willing to wait for an economic recovery to bolster earnings. As a result, we have recently initiated additional efforts to decrease excess production capacity, reduce overhead and trim our cost structure.
For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $101 million, which includes the reduction in inventory levels that I mentioned earlier. With ongoing concerns about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels. 
We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.5% of annualized sales. New this quarter was a $30 million current liability associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in late 2010. Excluding that item, working capital was at 13.3% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. 
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share, reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett, and only 2 that have higher growth rates over that 40-year period. 
Maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us. And again, this year, we expect operating cash to comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. For the year, operating cash should approximate $300 million. Capital expenditures should not exceed $80 million, and dividends should require about $155 million. 
During the quarter, as planned, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. So far this year, we have repurchased 9.4 million shares under the current 10 million share authorization. We have also issued 2.9 million shares year-to-date through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. 
We ended the third quarter with net debt at 31% of net capital, which is at the low-end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.  
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year. To date, for the 3-year period that will end on December 31 of 2011, we generated TSR of 22% per year on average, which is top half performance. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Third quarter sales in Residential Furnishing segment grew 6%, primarily from inflation and changes in currency exchange rates. Unit volumes were up slightly versus a weak third quarter 2010. 
In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes were flat, and boxspring units were up slightly during the quarter.  In our Furniture Hardware business, third quarter unit volume decreased 9% versus the prior year. Again, this quarter, we had significant growth in power foundations, with unit shipments of 46%. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the third quarter of 2010, primarily from higher raw material costs and increased restructuring-related expenses. Competitive industry pricing and customer down spec-ing are also impacting EBIT and margins both year-over-year and sequentially. With depressed industry volumes and anticipation of lower steel costs in certain cases, we have reduced prices to retain market share. Also, in an effort to manage their own cost, customers in certain instances have chosen to replace higher value components with lower value components. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we have initiated additional efforts to decrease excess production capacity. The activities announced today in the Residential segment include operations in bedding and carpet underlay. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, third quarter sales decreased 5%, as lower Fixture & Display sales were partially offset by continued growth in office furniture components. Sales in our Fixture & Display business decreased approximately 10% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our major retail customers have significantly curtailed their current year remodeling activity. 
Sales in our Office Furniture business grew 7%  versus a more difficult comparison in the third quarter last year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business as the office furniture industry continues to recover. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus third quarter of 2010, primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales. As part of our efforts to reduce overhead and trim our cost structure, we have initiated the closing of one of our point-of-purchase fixture display locations. 
Third quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 18%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing, primarily reflecting weakness in bedding, furniture and store fixtures demand.
EBIT decreased versus third quarter 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume and wire and tubing and higher raw material costs. EBIT margins also decreased as a change of -- as a result of a change in sales from intersegment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs, and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rod has been down. However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales, while preserving comparable EBIT levels.  Our efforts to reduce production capacity also impact this segment. We have recently announced plans to close 1 of our 6 domestic wire-drawing operations. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 17% sales growth in the third quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand as well as growth in machinery and commercial vehicle products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. 
Higher sales led to increased EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material costs and currency impacts. Automotive industry forecast continued to anticipate meaningful global production growth for the remainder of 2011 and in 2012. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced yesterday, we reduced our full-year earnings guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 range. The decrease versus previous guidance reflects the weaker-than-anticipated third quarter results and lower than previous expectations for the economy. 
For the full year, we expect sales of approximately $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% versus 2010, largely due to inflation, currency fluctuation and trade sales growth at the steel mill. Unit volumes are expected to be essentially flat for the year. 
And in closing, to repeat myself, we are not pleased with this quarter's results. And as we have done before, we are acutely focused on actions that will yield improved ongoing profitability in the future.

To date, in October, shipments are up about 2%, so it's just flattish, more of the same. Boxspring units were slightly positive in the third quarter, and they were also up about 2% in October. The outlook for the quarter in U.S. Spring is flat, a continuation of that. We continue to feel that we have regained the share. You remember in our third quarter comments of last year, we had noted that we had lost some share. We've regained that share, so we believe that the innerspring portion of the U.S. mattress business is flattish to maybe slightly negative. But we will quickly admit that the innerspring portion of the finished mattress sector is losing some share. So my comments are directly related to the innerspring portion of the Finished Mattress business. As far as Furniture Hardware goes, the demand there was disappointing. July was much softer than anticipated, saw more of that in August. We saw some recovery in September and continued to see that recovery in the first few shipping weeks of October. As you know, unlike bedding, which is in the trough of its seasonal selling, that furniture should be closer to the peak. What we think that we experienced is -- and this is somewhat anecdotal, is a destocking in the finished inventory industry -- from a furniture perspective, in early third quarter. We saw that at the OEM level. We believe that the retailers were doing the same thing. So we don't believe that we lost share, but we certainly are under some pricing pressures in that industry."

As you know, there's some connectivity into industrial from both a wire and from a tubing perspective, so down spec-ing truly affects both segments. But what we experienced in -- to make this a little broader, there's a constant question of us about -- as it relates to pricing power, specifically, in residential as it relates to steel. We did raise prices in the second quarter based on significant increase in raw material. We successfully passed through that inflation. At the same time, our bedding and furniture customers were dealing with inflation from a number of different sources, primarily petrochemical-based, impacting polyurethane foam and some of the non-fashion fabrics. And as those customers tried to pass through that inflation that they were receiving from all sectors of the raw material supply, they had problem passing through to retail. So the response to that was to de-content at the same time that the consumer is bifurcating. They're trading down at the low-end, and we're dealing with a situation, where both the furniture and bedding, that it's almost as if the product can't get cheap enough. And at the top-end, we're seeing real strength in both furniture and bedding. So that bifurcation is a real issue that has become more acute as the consumer has become more pessimistic as the years gone on, so it truly is a Residential Furnishings issue."

And what's happening, I need to separate what's happening in a steel industry from a long products and a flat products perspective. And the long products, which are wire and rod, we are not seeing price decreases and are not seeing much price down pressure. So this is a flat products issue so, therefore, more significantly impacts furniture than bedding, and steel peaked from an input cost perspective in the second quarter. As I said earlier, we raised prices based on that. That cost inflation ran through our cost sheets in the third quarter. We are now replacing that steel with lower steel cost, again, from a flat perspective. And steel continues to deflate. Part of the margin squeeze issue that we got ourselves into is our customers were pressuring us for price reductions earlier than we ran that lower cost through our cost of goods sold. So it will continue into the fourth. We believe that it will be through the system by the end of the fourth quarter."

As we reported yesterday, earnings for the third quarter were $0.31 per share or flat with the same quarter of last year. Third quarter sales grew 9% versus the prior year from items that brought little incremental profit. Inflation and currency rate fluctuation accounted for the bulk of the growth, and trade sales from our steel mill provided 3% unit growth. 
Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was essentially flat. We are not satisfied with our results this quarter.  Earnings and margins decreased both year-over-year and sequentially. Competitive pricing and customer down spec-ing, both of which Karl will talk about in his segment comments, are impacting certain product categories. When combined with our efforts to reduce inventory by curtailing production, which also reduced overhead absorption, earnings and margins were under pressure. Earlier in the year, we had expected overall unit demand to improve this Fall. That has not happened, and many of the recent forecasts and surveys from well-regarded sources suggest that our economy will be facing headwinds for longer than previously expected. We have been too patient and are no longer willing to wait for an economic recovery to bolster earnings. As a result, we have recently initiated additional efforts to decrease excess production capacity, reduce overhead and trim our cost structure.
For the quarter, we generated operating cash of $101 million, which includes the reduction in inventory levels that I mentioned earlier. With ongoing concerns about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels. 
We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.5% of annualized sales. New this quarter was a $30 million current liability associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in late 2010. Excluding that item, working capital was at 13.3% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. 
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share, reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Out of all the S&P 500, there are only 11 companies that have a longer string of annual increases than Leggett, and only 2 that have higher growth rates over that 40-year period. 
Maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us. And again, this year, we expect operating cash to comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. For the year, operating cash should approximate $300 million. Capital expenditures should not exceed $80 million, and dividends should require about $155 million. 
During the quarter, as planned, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. So far this year, we have repurchased 9.4 million shares under the current 10 million share authorization. We have also issued 2.9 million shares year-to-date through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. 
We ended the third quarter with net debt at 31% of net capital, which is at the low-end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.  
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return on a rolling 3-year basis to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year. To date, for the 3-year period that will end on December 31 of 2011, we've generated TSR of 22% per year on average, which is top half performance. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

Third quarter sales in Residential Furnishings segment grew 6%,",636,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Third quarter sales in Residential Furnishings segment grew 6%, primarily from inflation and changes in currency exchange rates. Unit volumes were up slightly versus a weak third quarter 2010. 
In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes were flat, and boxspring units were up slightly during the quarter.  In our Furniture Hardware business, third quarter unit volume decreased 9% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in power foundations, with unit shipments of 46%. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the third quarter of 2010, primarily from higher raw material costs and increased restructuring-related expenses. Competitive industry pricing and customer down spec-ing are also impacting EBIT and margins both year-over-year and sequentially. With depressed industry volumes and anticipation of lower steel costs in certain cases, we have reduced prices to retain market share. Also, in an effort to manage their own cost, customers in certain instances have chosen to replace higher value components with lower value components. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we have initiated additional efforts to decrease excess production capacity. The activities announced today in the Residential segment include operations in bedding and carpet underlay. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, third quarter sales decreased 5%, as lower Fixture & Display sales were partially offset by continued growth in office furniture components. Sales in our Fixture & Display business decreased approximately 10% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our major retail customers have significantly curtailed their current year remodeling activity. 
Sales in our Office Furniture business grew 7%  versus a more difficult comparison in the third quarter last year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business as the office furniture industry continues to recover. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus third quarter of 2010, primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales. As part of our efforts to reduce overhead and trim our cost structure, we have initiated the closing of one of our point-of-purchase fixture display locations. 
Third quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 18%, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill. Unit volumes decreased in both wire and tubing, primarily reflecting weakness in bedding, furniture and store fixtures demand.
EBIT decreased versus third quarter 2010, primarily due to lower unit volume and wire and tubing and higher raw material costs. EBIT margins also decreased as a change of -- as a result of a change in sales from intersegment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs, and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rod has been down. However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales, while preserving comparable EBIT levels.  Our efforts to reduce production capacity also impact this segment. We have recently announced plans to close 1 of our 6 domestic wire-drawing operations. 
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 17% sales growth in the third quarter, primarily reflecting continued strength in global automotive demand as well as growth in machinery and commercial vehicle products. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth during the quarter. 
Higher sales led to increased EBIT during the quarter, but EBIT margins contracted slightly as these gains were partially offset by higher raw material costs and currency impacts. Automotive industry forecasts continue to anticipate meaningful global production growth for the remainder of 2011 and in 2012. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced yesterday, we reduced our full year earnings guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 range. The decrease versus previous guidance reflects the weaker-than-anticipated third quarter results and lower than previous expectations for the economy. 
For the full year, we expect sales of approximately $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% versus 2010, largely due to inflation, currency fluctuation and trade sales growth at the steel mill. Unit volumes are expected to be essentially flat for the year. 
And in closing, to repeat myself, we are not pleased with this quarter's results. And as we have done before, we are acutely focused on actions that will yield improved ongoing profitability in the future. 
And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

To date in October, shipments are up about 2%, so it's just flattish, more of the same. Boxspring units were slightly positive in the third quarter, and they were also up about 2% in October. The outlook for the quarter in U.S. Spring is flat, a continuation of that. We continue to feel that we have regained the share. You'll remember in our third quarter comments of last year, we had noted that we had lost some share. We've regained that share. So we believe that the innerspring portion of the U.S. mattress business is flattish to maybe slightly negative, but we will quickly admit that the innerspring portion of the finished mattress sector is losing some share. So my comments are directly related to the innerspring portion of the Finished Mattress business. As far as Furniture Hardware goes, the demand there was disappointing. July was much softer than anticipated. Saw more of that in August. We saw some recovery in September and continued to see that recovery in the first few shipping weeks of October. As you know, unlike bedding, which is in the trough of its seasonal selling, that furniture should be closer to the peak. What we think that we experienced is -- and this is somewhat anecdotal, is a de-stocking in the finished inventory industry -- from a furniture perspective, in early third quarter. We saw that at the OEM level. We believe that the retailers were doing the same thing. So we don't believe that we lost share, but we certainly are under some pricing pressures in that industry."

As you know, there's some connectivity into industrial from both a wire and from a tubing perspective, so down spec-ing truly affects both segments. But what we experienced in -- to make this a little broader, there's a constant question of us about -- as it relates to pricing power, specifically, in Residential as it relates to steel. We did raise prices in the second quarter based on significant increase in raw material. We successfully passed through that inflation. At the same time, our bedding and furniture customers were dealing with inflation from a number of different sources, primarily petrochemical-based, impacting polyurethane foam and some of the non-fashion fabrics. And as those customers tried to pass through that inflation that they were receiving from all sectors of the raw material supply, they had problem passing through to retail. So the response to that was to de-content at the same time that the consumer is bifurcating. They're trading down at the low-end, and we're dealing with a situation where, both  furniture and bedding, that it's almost as if the product can't get cheap enough. And at the top end, we're seeing real strength in both furniture and bedding. So that bifurcation is a real issue that has become more acute as the consumer has become more pessimistic as the year's gone on, so it truly is a Residential Furnishings issue."

And what's happening, I need to separate what's happening in a steel industry from a long products and a flat products perspective. And the long products, which are wire and rod, we are not seeing price decreases and are not seeing much price down pressure. So this is a flat products issue so, therefore, more significantly impacts furniture than bedding. And steel peaked from an input cost perspective in the second quarter. As I said earlier, we raised prices based on that. That cost inflation ran through our cost sheets in the third quarter. We are now replacing that steel with lower steel cost, again, from a flat perspective, and steel continues to deflate. Part of the margin squeeze issue that we got ourselves into is our customers were pressuring us for price reductions earlier than we ran that lower cost through our cost of goods sold. So it will continue into the fourth. We believe that it will be through the system by the end of the fourth quarter."

And then I know it's repetitive and I apologize, but that shift from an intercompany sale of rod to our wire mills to trade, even though the EBIT was the same, the reported trade sales went up and that also had that negative impact on our margins. If production goes back up, of course, we'll absorb all that overhead in a much better fashion and then at any shift back towards internal sales of our products out of the steel mill will also have a positive effect."

The big difference is we will admit, as I said, that specialty sleep products are taking some share from innerspring. We think that the specialty, from a unit perspective, has about a 10% market share, so that is some competition. But as you'll note, we've said that our units were flat. As it relates to the de-spec-ing situation, that's more consumer driven than anything. It's the consumer trading down to a price point, the retailer becoming more promotional to drive the consumer into that retail environment. So it's not a significant competitive issue as it is a consumption issue."
