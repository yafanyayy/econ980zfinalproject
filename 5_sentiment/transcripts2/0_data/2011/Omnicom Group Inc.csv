Before I talk about the quarter and some of our views about moving forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes to comment about 2010. 
When I spoke to a year ago at this time, we believed we were at the beginning of the end of the recession. Over the course of 2010, we've seen a steady increase in the number of clients around the world who are again investing in their own growth. At the same time, we also understood that the rapid pace of economic and technological change affecting our industry would require us to make continuous judgment to our businesses, to improve our operations in our core structures, to push ourselves to innovate business models and product offering, to continue to invest in our high-performing businesses and rapidly growing markets, to reorganize or close businesses that were not well positioned to recover from the recession or that no longer met our strategic plans; and more recently, to make several important acquisitions in key growth markets and disciplines. 
Despite these challenges, we asked our agencies to get closer to their clients, deepen relationships even in the absence of significant budgets and to make some decisions quickly so that they could turn their attention to growth.
We're happy to say that we believe our 2010 results demonstrate that we're making significant progress towards these goals. For this, I'd like to thank all of Omnicom's employees for their hard work and professionalism and our clients for their continued trust. 
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter results. Overall, our fourth quarter results showed significant improvements over Q4 2009 and improved trends relative to previous quarters. In particular, I want to highlight a few of these things today. 
First, organic growth in the fourth quarter was up 10%, this, despite the loss of Chrysler in the first quarter of 2010 which lowered our organic growth by 1.5% for the quarter. The fourth quarter was the strongest of the year. 
Second, during the quarter, we've identified underperforming businesses, and we started to dispose and/or reorganize some of these businesses. As Randy will discuss, we plan to take additional steps in the first half of 2011.
We believe these actions will allow us to make steady progress towards our objective of improving our margins to 2007 levels by 2012. These changes will also allow us to focus greater management attention and resources on businesses well positioned for growth. 
During the quarter, we completed and announced a number of acquisitions designed to help us build our footprint geographically and to add important skill sets, where appropriate. The largest of these transactions was our acquisition of the controlling stake in Clemenger, which closed earlier this month. Clemenger is the largest and premier communications group in Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition will give us additional flexibility truly leverage the skills, reputation and people of climate sure to grow our combined businesses and throughout the Asia Pacific region. 
Fourth, following the announcement of our partnership with Google in the third quarter, we have completed additional partnerships with Microsoft and Yahoo!, which will be announced this week. We expect to complete several other strategic partnerships in the coming weeks. These partnerships are consistent with our philosophy of building internal competencies in digital marketing and media, while partnering with the most innovative technology companies.
We've also continued to invest in our people by expanding our digital education efforts to ensure continued training and development of every Omnicom employee. Our goal is to ensure that our employees are continuously improving their skills to keep pace with the technological changes affecting our business and to share the learnings of our agencies around the world. 
I'd like to make a comment on our awards and our product this year, too. During 2010, Omnicom agencies again demonstrated their leadership across a wide range of creative categories and geographic markets. I want to highlight just three. Omnicom agencies once again topped the rankings at the international advertising festival in, including agency of the year and a number one and two rankings for the most awarded agency networks. 
Omnicom agencies led the in 2010, finishing with three of the top five honors in both the most awarded network in the world and the most awarded digital agency in the world competitions. 
And agency of the our award in Singapore, Omnicom agencies picked up top honors in the Asia Pacific region including the three network of the year titles for creative agency of the year, DVD, digital agency network of the year and media agency network of the year, PhD. I'm very proud of these awards and the efforts that we've made in these over the last several years.
And I might add that these awards are only representative of an outstanding job of all our agencies and what they continue to perform and do for our clients.
Turning back to our revenue growth, which Randy will cover in detail, I have a few additional comments. In the U.S., fourth quarter organic growth was 12.7%, which exceeded our internal forecast. Looking forward, our outlook remains positive but cautious. The midterm elections have signaled focus of fiscal restraint and the reduction in the level of business rhetoric from Washington. 
On the other hand, unemployment and housing still represents a drag on potential growth. At this point, we expect growth in 2011 to return to normal levels. We should be able to outpace GDP growth by 100 to 200 basis points with a caveat and, I might add, that we still have one more quarter of year-over-year comps on the Chrysler business.
Outside of the United States, we're also seeing a generally improving picture. In 2010, we experienced significant double digits top line organic growth in Asia. In South America, we continue to see strong positive results that were also pleased to see the continuation of a turnaround across Europe.
Turning to disciplines. Our business growth is also broad-based across every discipline, advertising, public relations, CRM and specialty; and across a spectrum of industries we serve, we saw improve growth against trend. In new business, our organic growth continues to be driven by determined focus on client service and delivering value to our clients. For the quarter, we generated in excess of $2.1 billion in new business. We continue to see a robust pipeline as our clients and prospective clients reignite efforts to invest money as we move into 2011.
On margins, our results are slightly better than the fourth quarter of 2009 and in line with what we expected. As I mentioned in the previous quarter, our goal is to restore margins by 2012 to our 2007 levels, and we expect to achieve progress towards this goal during 2011 as we execute our strategic initiatives.
Let me finally turn to our balance sheet and free cash flow for a moment. As you know, we believe a strong balance sheet gives us tremendous flexibility to deploy capital in the most effective ways. We also continue to demonstrate the cash flow strength of our businesses with over $1 billion in free cash flow generated in 2010. 
Given our balance sheet's strength and free cash flow, we regularly review our capital deployment policies with the Board of Directors, and we'll continue to drive return equity by using our free cash flow to pay dividends, make acquisitions and repurchase our shares. 
Dividends. Many of you have probably see in the Board of Directors authorized a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend last evening. Share buybacks in October, the board authorized us to resume share repurchases. As Randy will explain, we began to purchase shares in the back end of the fourth quarter, and we plan to continue share buybacks in 2011. 
Taken together, through buybacks and dividends, we will return to $1.3 billion to shareholders in 2010.
Lastly, in addition to the acquisition of Clemenger, we completed several smaller but important acquisitions during the fourth quarter, as described in our presentation. And since year end, we have closed several other acquisitions in important developing markets and social media. 
Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our business in 2010. As we look into 2011 and beyond, we feel confident in how we are positioned. While we recognize that the continued risk of the economy, we're excited about the growth prospects we see around the globe, and we believe we have the right platform in place to harness that growth. 
Our strategy remains in place. We will continue to build our digital skill sets, both inside existing agencies and with new partnerships and acquisitions. We'll also continue to look for strongly managed organizations that will help us expand our presence in rapidly growing markets. And as always, we are working to retain, recruit and train our talented teams and rationales around the world.
I'll now turn the call back to Randy, who'll take you through the numbers in more detail. And then we'll both be available for questions."

Again, this quarter, the world could be described as having three speeds. But this quarter, they were all moving forward. 
In the quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in each of our marketing disciplines and in every industry group to which we provide services. On a sequential or quarter-over-quarter basis, we also experienced improvement in every geographical market we operate in. Even the markets with negative growth or less negative. 
Financially, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and return on capital. In 2010, we again demonstrated strong performance on these metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later.
The overall revenue results for the quarter exceeded our expectations with total year-over-year growth of just under 10%, bringing revenue for the quarter to $3.6 billion. 
EBITDA increased almost 11% to $460 million,  resulting in an EBITDA margin of 12.8%. That was up about 10 basis points from last year. EBITDA for the full year was $1.53 billion, and our margin was in line with our expectations coming into the year at 12.2%, which was flat with last year. And our operating income or EBIT increased 10% to $439.6 million, also resulting in a margin improvement of about 10 basis points.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $32.1 million, up $3.5 million from Q4 last year and up about $2.3 million from Q3 2010. The increase versus the third quarter was primarily reflective of this being the first full quarter of interest on the $1 billion of 10-year senior notes we issued midway through the third quarter and increased stock repurchases in Q4, partially offset by the positive effect of the interest rate swap we entered into in Q3 2016 senior notes, as well as lower borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and improvements in our working capital management efforts. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.2%, bringing the full year rate up to 34.1%, which was up slightly from last year. We do expect there to be some upward pressure and tax rates with law changes in several states and various international markets. As a result, we currently expect to see our reported tax rate increase 20 to 30 basis points in 2011.
Net income for the quarter increased 7.4% to $246.5 million, and our diluted earnings per share increased 13.7% to $0.83 a share. The diluted share count for the quarter was 295.7 million shares. 
Looking into our revenue performance in more detail, with regards to FX, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar experienced mixed results versus our major currencies, strengthening against the euro and the pound and weakening versus the yen, the real and the Canadian and Australian dollars. And that result was a negative FX impact for the quarter of $41.9 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, the breaks stay where they are, we expect FX to be positive about 0.5% in Q1 and a little more than 1% for the full year. 
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue right $37.5 million in the quarter or about 1.1%. This was due, primarily to the acquisition of a controlling interest in ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of 2009.
We did complete eight small acquisitions during the fourth quarter. And in January, we closed the acquisition of. Also in early February, we completed the acquisition of additional 27% interest in our long-time affiliate in Australia and New Zealand, the Clemenger Group, bringing our ownership up to about 75%. 
As a result of this acquisition, under U.S. GAAP GAAP guidelines, we expect to record remeasurement gain on historic investment in Q1 of approximately $120 million.
Also in Q4, we completed the sale of two small agencies in an ongoing strategic review of our businesses. We also expect to complete several additional divestitures and dispositions in 2011 beginning in the first quarter. The agencies that are currently under consideration for disposal have revenue of about $300 million, which is approximately equal to the revenue of our business is that we've recently acquired. 
In addition to these strategic reviews, we've initiated a number of actions to gain further operating efficiencies, including the consolidation of agency operations in several smaller markets, the establishment of several shared service centers to increase the centralization of IT and other operating function and a number of real estate consolidation. As a result of these actions, we expect to record severance, real estate and other charges in Q1 between $90 million and $110 million.
With regard to organic growth, we had a very strong quarter. As we previously mentioned, we saw growth across every industry sector that we serve and improvements quarter-to-quarter in every geographic market. Driven by the combination of new business wins, the improving economic environment and an increase in project revenue, organic revenue in the quarter grew by 10% or $325 million. As we've noted on the last few quarters, the above gross figures include the effect of the loss of the Chrysler account in the first quarter of 2010. That loss had a negative impact on our global organic growth in the quarter of about 1.5% and our U.S. organic growth of approximately 3%.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 47% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 53%. As with their respective growth rates, brand advertising and organic growth of 10.9% and Marketing Services was up 9.2%. 
Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had an 8.3% organic growth. Within the sector of our Field Marketing, Branding and Events businesses, all had outstanding performances, each with double-digit growth. 
Public Relations had organic growth of just over 7%, and Specialty Communications was up 15%, with almost every agency in the sector had solid growth. 
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 51% U.S. and 49% international. 
In the United States, revenue increased to $206 million or 12.6% acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $1.2 million or about 1/10 from 1%. And organic growth was exceptionally strong 12.7% or about $207 million. This was obviously a great quarter that benefited from strong new business wins, new initiatives in the digital area and some pent-up spending.
International revenue increased $114.9 million or about 7%. FX decreased revenue $41.9 million or about 2.6%. Acquisitions, net of disposition, increased revenue by $38.7 million, and organic growth was 7.2% or $118 million. 
Internationally, we had for strong performances in China, India, Singapore and Russia. and developed Asia, South Korea had another positive quarter while Japan was negative. And with the exception of the Netherlands, Greece, Ireland and Spain, most markets across Western Europe performed well, while results in Eastern Europe continue to be mixed but generally improving.
Looking at our revenue by industry, food and beverage continues to be our largest sector, representing 16% of our revenue in both 2010 and 2009. Our fastest-growing sectors for the quarter and for the year was technology, followed by financial services and then consumer products and pharma and healthcare. 
Although the percentage of revenue from the auto sector decreased to 10% in 2010, excluding the effects of the loss of Chrysler, we experienced double-digit organic growth in the auto sector the sector for the year. And reflective of the breadth of the recovery, all of our industry sectors increase experience positive organic growth, both in the quarter and for the full year. 
Turning to cash flow. For the year, our performance continue to be very strong. We generated approximately $1 billion of free cash flows after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital, which was also positive another $310 million. 
Our primary uses of cash during the year were dividends to our common shareholders, which totaled $229.7 million. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders was $81 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments and the purchase of additional interest in controlled subsidiaries net of the proceeds of the sale of investment, was approximately $172 million. And share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and the related tax benefits, totaled approximately $1.13 billion. 
In total, between common dividends and net share repurchases, we returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2010, for net use of cash, excluding working capital of $587 million.
The next chart, showing our credit current credit picture, including changes in working capital, shows that our net debt at year end was $900 million. That was a year-over-year increase of $237 million, which was largely driven by an increased share of repurchase activity during the year, offset by further improvements in working capital management.
Our current liquidity continues to be very strong. We finished the quarter with cash and undrawn committed credit facility totaling $4.3 billion, and we had additional on commit and facilities available totaling $610 million. 
As you know, in December, we extended our credit facility for three years and reduced the capacity from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. Previously used credit facility for both liquidity purposes and convertible notes we should repeat well over $2 billion. Since we've reduced the balance of convertible notes to only $660 million, we did need the additional credit capacity.
And finally, to sum up our financial performance for the year, we've included a schedule of our return on equity and return on invested capital.  Overall, we think ROIC and our OE as performance measures collectively shows a balance of all our various metrics that we used to gauge our performance. Revenue growth, operating margins, capital deployment, capital structure and tax structure. They also highlight the effectiveness of our long-term investment and operating strategies for shareholders.
For the year, return on invested capital was 16.8%, close to our historic 10-year average of 17.1%. And our return on equity for the year increased to 21.3%, re-approaching our 10-year average of' $0.225. 
Overall, we believe our agencies have done an excellent job of navigating through the economic turbulence that we've experienced over the past few years at the same time maintained their focus on the quality of their services, changes in the technology, expanding their presence in the emerging markets and controlling the costs. 
And with that, I'm now going to ask our operator to open the call for questions."

And would that apply in other emerging markets as well? That's the first question. The second question is looking at your cash flows again, it looks like you had a negative $587 million i.e. use $587 million beyond the net cash flow, I'm saying this revenue, used $587 million beyond the net free cash that you generate, typically you would be that number about zero I guess you wouldn't use the free cash flow the to generate. Should we interpret that as meaning you spent roughly half last day of the $1 billion bond naturally raised and if so, should we expect another $500 million or so of share buybacks per share in the next year?"

I think our company has done an excellent job in working capital management, so I think it was pretty good. As far as your China question goes, we had an excellent year in China, up very strong double digits, so north of 20%, north of 30% organic growth in China.

Before I talk about the quarter and some of our views about moving forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes to comment about 2010. 
When I spoke to a year ago at this time, we believed we were at the beginning of the end of the recession. Over the course of 2010, we've seen a steady increase in the number of clients around the world who are again investing in their own growth. At the same time, we also understood that the rapid pace of economic and technological change affecting our industry would require us to make continuous adjustment to our businesses, to improve our operations in our core structures, to push ourselves to innovate business models and product offering, to continue to invest in our high-performing businesses and rapidly growing markets, to reorganize or close businesses that were not well positioned to recover from the recession or that no longer met our strategic plans; and more recently, to make several important acquisitions in key growth markets and disciplines. 
Despite these challenges, we asked our agencies to get closer to their clients, deepen relationships even in the absence of significant budgets and to make the tough decisions quickly so that they could turn their attention to growth. We're happy to say that we believe our 2010 results demonstrate that we're making significant progress towards these goals. For this, I'd like to thank all of Omnicom's employees for their hard work and professionalism and our clients for their continued trust. 
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter results. Overall, our fourth quarter results showed significant improvements over Q4 2009 and improved trends relative to previous quarters. In particular, I want to highlight a few of these things today. 
First, organic growth in the fourth quarter was up 10%, this despite the loss of Chrysler in the first quarter of 2010 which lowered our organic growth by 1.5% for the quarter. The fourth quarter was the strongest of the year. Second, during the quarter, we've identified underperforming businesses and we started to dispose and/or reorganize some of these businesses. As Randy will discuss, we plan to take additional steps in the first half of 2011.
We believe these actions will allow us to make steady progress towards our objective of improving our margins to 2007 levels by 2012. These changes will also allow us to focus greater management attention and resources on businesses well positioned for growth. 
During the quarter, we completed and announced a number of acquisitions designed to help us build our footprint geographically, and to add important skill sets where appropriate. The largest of these transactions was our acquisition of the controlling stake in Clemenger, which closed earlier this month. Clemenger is the largest in premier communications group in Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition will give us additional flexibility to truly leverage the skills, reputation and people of Clemenger to grow our combined businesses throughout the Asia Pacific region. 
Fourth, following the announcement of our partnership with Google in the third quarter, we have completed additional partnerships with Microsoft and Yahoo!, which will be announced this week. We expect to complete several other strategic partnerships in the coming weeks. These partnerships are consistent with our philosophy of building internal competencies in digital marketing and media, while partnering with the most innovative technology companies.
We've also continued to invest in our people by expanding our digital education efforts to ensure continued training and development of every Omnicom employee. Our goal is to ensure that our employees are continuously improving their skills to keep pace with the technological changes affecting our business and to share the learnings of our agencies around the world. 
I'd like to make a comment on our awards and our products this year, too. During 2010, Omnicom agencies again demonstrated their leadership across a wide range of creative categories in geographic markets. I want to highlight just three. Cannes. Omnicom agencies once again topped the rankings at the International Advertising Festival in Cannes, including Agency of the Year and the number one in two rankings for the most awarded agency networks. 
Gunn Report. Omnicom agencies led the Gunn Report  in 2010, finishing with three of the top five honors in both the most awarded network in the world and the most awarded digital agency in the world competition. And that Agency of the Year award in Singapore, Omnicom agencies picked up the top honors in the Asia Pacific region including the three network of the year titles for Creative Agency of the Year, DDB; Digital Agency Network of the Year, Tribal DDB; and Media Agency Network of the Year, PHD. I'm very proud of these awards and the efforts that we've made in these over the last several years. And I might add that these awards are only representative of an outstanding job of all our agencies and what they continue to perform and do for our clients.
Turning back to our revenue growth, which Randy will cover in detail, I have a few additional comments. In the U.S., fourth quarter organic growth was 12.7%, which exceeded our internal forecast. Looking forward, our outlook remains positive but cautious. The midterm elections have signaled the renewed focus of fiscal restraint and the reduction in the level of anti-business rhetoric from Washington. 
On the other hand, unemployment and housing still represents a drag on potential growth. At this point, we expect growth in 2011 to return to normal levels. We should be able to outpace GDP growth by 100 to 200 basis points with a caveat, and I might add, that we still have one more quarter of year-over-year comps on the Chrysler business.
Outside of the United States, we're also seeing a generally improving picture. In 2010, we experienced significant double digits top line organic growth in Asia. In South America, we continue to see strong positive results and we're also pleased to see the continuation of a turnaround across Europe.
Turning to disciplines. Our business growth is also broad-based across every discipline, advertising, public relations, CRM and specialty; and across a spectrum of industries we serve, we saw improved growth against trend. In new business, our organic growth continues to be driven by determined focus on client service and delivering value to our clients. For the quarter, we generated in excess of $2.1 billion in new business. We continue to see a robust pipeline as our clients and prospective clients reignite efforts to invest money as we move into 2011.
On margins, our results are slightly better than the fourth quarter of 2009 and in line with what we expected. As I mentioned in the previous quarter, our goal is to restore margins by 2012 to our 2007 levels, and we expect to achieve progress towards this goal during 2011 as we execute our strategic initiatives.
Let me finally turn to our balance sheet and free cash flow for a moment. As you know, we believe a strong balance sheet gives us tremendous flexibility to deploy capital in the most effective ways. We also continue to demonstrate the cash flow strength of our businesses with over $1 billion in free cash flow generated in 2010. 
Given our balance sheet's strength and free cash flow, we regularly review our capital deployment policies with the Board of Directors, and we'll continue to drive return on equity by using our free cash flow to pay dividends, make acquisitions and repurchase our shares. 
Dividends. Many of you have probably see in the Board of Directors authorized a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend last evening. Share buybacks in October, the board authorized us to resume share repurchases. As Randy will explain, we began to purchase shares in the back end of the fourth quarter, and we plan to continue share buybacks in 2011. Taken together through share buybacks and dividends, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders in 2010.
Lastly, in addition to the acquisition of Clemenger, we completed several smaller but important acquisitions during the fourth quarter, as described in our presentation. And since year end, we have closed several other acquisitions in important developing markets and social media. 
Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our business in 2010. As we look into 2011 and beyond, we feel confident in how we are positioned. While we recognize the continued risk to the economy, we're excited about the growth prospects we see around the globe, and we believe we have the right platform in place to harness that growth. 
Our strategy remains in place. We will continue to build our digital skill sets, both inside existing agencies and with new partnerships and acquisitions. We'll also continue to look for a strongly managed organizations that will help us expand our presence in rapidly growing markets. And as always, we are working to retain, recruit and train our talented teams and professionals around the world.
I'll now turn the call back to Randy, who'll take you through the numbers in more detail. And then we'll both be available for questions."

Again, this quarter, the world could be described as having three speeds. But this quarter, they were all moving forward. 
In the quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in each of our marketing disciplines and in every industry group to which we provide services. On a sequential or quarter-to-quarter basis, we also experienced improvement in every geographical market we operate in. Even the markets with negative growth or less negative. 
Financially, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and return on capital. In 2010, we again demonstrated strong performance on these metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later. The overall revenue results for the quarter exceeded our expectations with total year-over-year growth of just under 10%, bringing revenue for the quarter to $3.6 billion. 
EBITDA increased almost 11% to $460 million,  resulting in an EBITDA margin of 12.8%. That was up about 10 basis points from last year. EBITDA for the full year was $1.53 billion, and our margin was in line with our expectations coming into the year at 12.2%, which was flat with last year. And our operating income or EBIT increased 10% to $439.6 million, also resulting in a margin improvement of about 10 basis points.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $32.1 million, up $3.5 million from Q4 last year and up about $2.3 million from Q3 2010. The increase versus the third quarter was primarily reflective of this being the first full quarter of interest on the $1 billion of 10-year senior notes we issued midway through the third quarter and increased stock repurchases in Q4, partially offset by the positive effect of the interest rate swap we entered into in Q3 on a 2016 senior notes, as well as lower borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and improvements in our working capital management efforts. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.2%, bringing the full year rate up to 34.1%, which was up slightly from last year. We do expect there to be some upward pressure on tax rates with law change in several states and various international markets. As a result, we currently expect to see our reported tax rate increase 20 to 30 basis points in 2011. Net income for the quarter increased 7.4% to $246.5 million, and our diluted earnings per share increased 13.7% to $0.83 a share. The diluted share count for the quarter was 295.7 million shares. 
Looking into our revenue performance in more detail. With regards to FX, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar experienced mixed results versus our major currencies. Strengthening against the euro and the pound and weakening versus the yen, the real and the Canadian and Australian dollars, the net result was a negative FX impact for the quarter of $41.9 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, the breaks stay where they are. We expect FX to be positive about 0.5% in Q1 and a little more than 1% for the full year. 
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $37.5 million in the quarter or about 1.1%. This was due primarily to the acquisition of a controlling interest in ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of 2009.
We did complete eight small acquisitions during the fourth quarter. And in January, we closed the acquisition of Communispace. Also in early February, we completed the acquisition of additional 27% interest in our long-time affiliate in Australia and New Zealand, the Clemenger Group, bringing our ownership up to about 75%. As a result of this acquisition, under U.S. GAAP guidelines, we expect to record a remeasurement gain on historic investment in Q1 of approximately $120 million.
Also in Q4, we completed the sale of two small agencies in an ongoing strategic review of our businesses. We also expect to complete several additional divestitures and dispositions in 2011 beginning in the first quarter. The agencies that are currently under consideration for disposal have revenue of about $300 million, which is approximately equal to the revenue of our businesses that we've recently acquired. 
In addition to these strategic reviews, we've initiated a number of actions to gain further operating efficiencies, including the consolidation of agency operations in several smaller markets, the establishment of several shared service centers to increase the centralization of IT and other operating function and a number of real estate consolidation. As a result of these actions, we expect to record severance, real estate and other charges in Q1 of between $90 million and $110 million.
With regard to organic growth, we had a very strong quarter. As we previously mentioned, we saw growth across every industry sector that we serve and improvements quarter-to-quarter in every geographic market. Driven by the combination of new business wins, the improving economic environment and an increase in year-end project revenue, organic revenue in the quarter grew by 10% or $325 million. As we've noted over the last few quarters, the above gross figures include the effect of the loss of the Chrysler account in the first quarter of 2010. That loss had a negative impact on our global organic growth in the quarter of about 1.5% and our U.S. organic growth of approximately 3%.
Turning to our mix of business. Brand advertising accounted for 47% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 53%. As with their respective growth rates, brand advertising had organic growth of 10.9% and Marketing Services was up 9.2%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 8.3% organic growth. Within the sector of our Field Marketing, Branding and Events businesses, all had outstanding performances, each with double-digit growth. Public Relations had organic growth of just over 7%, and Specialty Communications was up 15%, with almost every agency in the sector having solid growth. Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 51% U.S. and 49% international. 
In the United States, revenue increased $206 million or 12.6%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $1.2 million or about 1/10 from 1%. And organic growth was exceptionally strong at 12.7% or about $207 million. This was obviously a great quarter that benefited from strong new business wins, new initiatives in the digital area and some pent-up spending.
International revenue increased $114.9 million or about 7%. FX decreased revenue of $41.9 million or about 2.6%. Acquisitions, net of disposition, increased revenue by $38.7 million, and organic growth was 7.2% or $118 million. 
Internationally, we had for strong performances in China, India, Singapore and Russia. In developed Asia, South Korea had another positive quarter while Japan was negative. And with the exception of the Netherlands, Greece, Ireland and Spain, most markets across Western Europe performed well, while results in Eastern Europe continue to be mixed but generally improving.
Looking at our revenue by industry, food and beverage continues to be our largest sector, representing 16% of our revenue in both 2010 and 2009. Our fastest-growing sectors for the quarter and for the year was technology, followed by financial services and then consumer products and pharma and healthcare. 
Although the percentage of revenue from the auto sector decreased to 10% in 2010, excluding the effects of the loss of Chrysler, we experienced double-digit organic growth in the auto sector for the year. And reflective of the breadth of the recovery, all of our industry sectors experienced positive organic growth both in the quarter and the full year. 
Turning to cash flow. For the year, our performance continue to be very strong. We generated approximately $1 billion of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital, which was also positive another $310 million. 
Our primary uses of cash during the year were dividends to our common shareholders, which totaled $229.7 million. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders was $81 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments and the purchase of additional interest in controlled subsidiaries, net of the proceeds of the sale of investments was approximately $172 million. And share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and the related tax benefits, totaled approximately $1.13 billion. In total, between common dividends and net share repurchases, we returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2010, bringing net use of cash excluding working capital of $587 million.
The next chart, showing our current credit picture including changes in working capital, shows that our net debt at year end was $900 million. That was a year-over-year increase of $237 million, which was largely driven by an increased share of repurchase activity during the year, offset by further improvements in working capital management.
Our current liquidity continues to be very strong. We finished the quarter with cash and undrawn committed credit facility totaling $4.3 billion, and we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $610 million. As you know, in December, we extended our credit facility for three years and reduced the capacity from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. Previously used the credit facility for both liquidity purposes and the back stopper convertible notes, which should repeat well over $2 billion. Since we've reduced the balance of convertible notes to only $660 million, we didn't need the additional credit capacity.
And finally, to sum up our financial performance for the year, we've included a schedule of our return on equity and return on invested capital. Overall, we think ROIC and ROE as performance measures collectively showed the balance of all of our various metrics that we used to gauge our performance. Revenue growth, operating margins, capital deployment, capital structure and tax structure. They also highlight the effectiveness of our long-term investment and operating strategies for shareholders.
For the year, return on invested capital was 16.8%, close to our historic 10-year average of 17.1%. And our return on equity for the year increased to 21.3%, reapproaching our 10-year average of $0.225. 
Overall, we believe our agencies have done an excellent job of navigating through the economic turbulence that we've experienced over the past few years, at the same time maintain their focus on the quality of their services, adapting to changes in technology, expanding their presence in the emerging markets and controlling their cost. 
And with that, I'm now going to ask our operator to open the call for questions."

You used $587 million beyond the net free cash flow that you generate. Typically, that number would be about zero I guess. You would use the free cash flow that you generate.

Before I talk about the quarter and some of our views about moving forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes to comment about 2010. 
When I spoke to you a year ago at this time, we believed we were at the beginning of the end of the recession. Over the course of 2010, we've seen a steady increase in the number of clients around the world who are again investing in their own growth. At the same time, we also understood that the rapid pace of economic and technological change affecting our industry would require us to make continuous adjustment to our businesses, to improve our operations and our core structures, to push ourselves to innovate business models and product offerings, to continue to invest in our high-performing businesses and rapidly growing markets, to reorganize or close businesses that were not well positioned to recover from the recession or that no longer met our strategic plans; and more recently, to make several important acquisitions in key growth markets and disciplines. 
Despite these challenges, we asked our agencies to get closer to their clients, deepen relationships, even in the absence of significant budgets, and to make the tough decisions quickly so that they could turn their attention to growth. We're happy to say that we believe our 2010 results demonstrate that we're making significant progress towards these goals. For this, I'd like to thank all of Omnicom's employees for their hard work and professionalism and our clients for their continued trust. 
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter results. Overall, our fourth quarter results showed significant improvements over Q4 2009 and improved trends relative to previous quarters. In particular, I want to highlight a few of these things today. 
First, organic growth in the fourth quarter was up 10%, this despite the loss of Chrysler in the first quarter of 2010, which lowered our organic growth by 1.5% for the quarter. The fourth quarter was the strongest of the year. Second, during the quarter, we've identified underperforming businesses and we started to dispose and/or reorganize some of these businesses. As Randy will discuss, we plan to take additional steps in the first half of 2011.
We believe these actions will allow us to make steady progress towards our objective of improving our margins to 2007 levels by 2012. These changes will also allow us to focus greater management attention and resources on businesses well positioned for growth. 
During the quarter, we completed and announced a number of acquisitions designed to help us build our footprint geographically and to add important skill sets where appropriate. The largest of these transactions was our acquisition of the controlling stake in Clemenger, which closed earlier this month. Clemenger is the largest in premier communications group in Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition will give us additional flexibility to truly leverage the skills, reputation and people of Clemenger to grow our combined businesses throughout the Asia Pacific region. 
Fourth, following the announcement of our partnership with Google in the third quarter, we have completed additional partnerships with Microsoft and Yahoo!, which will be announced this week. We expect to complete several other strategic partnerships in the coming weeks. These partnerships are consistent with our philosophy of building internal competencies in digital marketing and media while partnering with the most innovative technology companies.
We've also continued to invest in our people by expanding our digital education efforts to ensure continued training and development of every Omnicom employee. Our goal is to ensure that our employees are continuously improving their skills to keep pace with the technological changes affecting our business and to share the learnings of our agencies around the world. 
I'd like to make a comment on our awards and our product this year, too. During 2010, Omnicom agencies again demonstrated their leadership across a wide range of creative categories and geographic markets. I want to highlight just three. Cannes. Omnicom agencies once again topped the rankings at the International Advertising Festival in Cannes, including Agency of the Year and the number one and two rankings for the most awarded agency networks. 
Gunn Report. Omnicom agencies led the Gunn Report  in 2010, finishing with three of the top five honors in both the most awarded network in the world and the most awarded digital agency in the world competition. And at Agency of the Year awards in Singapore, Omnicom agencies picked up the top honors in the Asia Pacific region, including the three network of the year titles for Creative Agency of the Year, DDB; Digital Agency Network of the Year, Tribal DDB; and Media Agency Network of the Year, PHD. I'm very proud of these awards and the efforts that we've made in Asia over the last several years. And I might add that these awards are only representative of an outstanding job of all our agencies and what they continue to perform and do for our clients.
Turning back to our revenue growth, which Randy will cover in detail, I have a few additional comments. In the U.S., fourth quarter organic growth was 12.7%, which exceeded our internal forecast. Looking forward, our outlook remains positive but cautious. The midterm elections have signaled the renewed focus on fiscal restraint and a reduction in the level of anti-business rhetoric from Washington. 
On the other hand, unemployment and housing still represents a drag on potential growth. At this point, we expect growth in 2011 to return to normal levels. We should be able to outpace GDP growth by 100 to 200 basis points, with the caveat, and I might add, that we still have one more quarter of year-over-year comps on the Chrysler business.
Outside of the United States, we're also seeing a generally improving picture. In 2010, we experienced significant double-digits top line organic growth in Asia. In South America, we continue to see strong positive results, and we're also pleased to see the continuation of a turnaround across Europe.
Turning to disciplines. Our business growth is also broad-based across every discipline; advertising, public relations, CRM and specialty; and across a spectrum of industries we serve, we saw improved growth against trend. In new business, our organic growth continues to be driven by determined focus on client service and delivering value to our clients. For the quarter, we generated in excess of $2.1 billion in new business. We continue to see a robust pipeline as our clients and prospective clients reignite efforts to invest money as we move into 2011.
On margins, our results are slightly better than the fourth quarter of 2009 and in line with what we expected. As I mentioned in the previous quarter, our goal is to restore margins by 2012 to our 2007 levels, and we expect to achieve progress towards this goal during 2011 as we execute our strategic initiatives.
Let me finally turn to our balance sheet and free cash flow for a moment. As you know, we believe a strong balance sheet gives us tremendous flexibility to deploy capital in the most effective ways. We also continue to demonstrate the cash flow strength of our businesses, with over $1 billion in free cash flow generated in 2010. 
Given our balance sheet's strength and free cash flow, we regularly review our capital deployment policies with the Board of Directors, and we'll continue to drive return on equity by using our free cash flow to pay dividends, make acquisitions and repurchase our shares. 
Dividends. Many of you have probably seen the Board of Directors authorized a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend last evening. Share buybacks in October, the board authorized us to resume share repurchases. As Randy will explain, we began to purchase shares in the back end of the fourth quarter, and we plan to continue share buybacks in 2011. Taken together through share buybacks and dividends, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders in 2010.
Lastly, in addition to the acquisition of Clemenger, we completed several smaller but important acquisitions during the fourth quarter, as described in our presentation. And since year end, we have closed several other acquisitions in important developing markets and social media. 
Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our business in 2010. As we look into 2011 and beyond, we feel confident in how we are positioned. While we recognize the continued risk to the economy, we're excited about the growth prospects we see around the globe, and we believe we have the right platform in place to harness that growth. 
Our strategy remains in place. We will continue to build our digital skill sets, both inside existing agencies and with new partnerships and acquisitions. We'll also continue to look for strongly managed organizations that will help us expand our presence in rapidly growing markets. And as always, we are working to retain, recruit and train our talented management teams and professionals around the world.
I'll now turn the call back to Randy, who'll take you through the numbers in more detail. And then we'll both be available for questions."

Again, this quarter, the world could be described as having three speeds. But this quarter, they were all moving forward. 
In the quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in each of our marketing disciplines and in every industry group to which we provide services. On a sequential or quarter-to-quarter basis, we also experienced improvement in every geographical market we operate in. Even the markets with negative growth were less negative. 
Financially, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and return on capital. In 2010, we again demonstrated strong performance on these metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later. The overall revenue result for the quarter exceeded our expectations with total year-over-year growth of just under 10%, bringing revenue for the quarter to $3.6 billion. 
EBITDA increased almost 11% to $460 million,  resulting in an EBITDA margin of 12.8%. That was up about 10 basis points from last year. EBITDA for the full year was $1.53 billion, and our margin was in line with our expectations coming into the year at 12.2%, which was flat with last year. And our operating income, or EBIT, increased 10% to $439.6 million, also resulting in a margin improvement of about 10 basis points.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $32.1 million, up $3.5 million from Q4 last year and up about $2.3 million from Q3 2010. The increase versus the third quarter was primarily reflective of this being the first full quarter of interest on the $1 billion of 10-year senior notes we issued midway through the third quarter and increased stock repurchases in Q4, partially offset by the positive effect of the interest rate swap we entered into in Q3 on our 2016 senior notes as well as lower borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and improvements in our working capital management efforts. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.2%, bringing the full year rate up to 34.1%, which was up slightly from last year. We do expect there to be some upward pressure on tax rates with law changes in several states and various international markets. As a result, we currently expect to see our reported tax rate increase 20 to 30 basis points in 2011. Net income for the quarter increased 7.4% to $246.5 million, and our diluted earnings per share increased 13.7% to $0.83 a share. The diluted share count for the quarter was 295.7 million shares. 
Looking into our revenue performance in more detail. With regards to FX, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar experienced mixed results versus our major currencies. Strengthening against the euro and the pound and weakening versus the yen, the real and the Canadian and Australian dollars, the net result was a negative FX impact for the quarter of $41.9 million, or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, the breaks stay where they are. We expect FX to be positive about 0.5% in Q1 and a little more than 1% for the full year. 
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $37.5 million in the quarter, or about 1.1%. This was due primarily to the acquisition of a controlling interest in ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of 2009.
We did complete eight small acquisitions during the fourth quarter. And in January, we closed the acquisition of Communispace. Also, in early February, we completed the acquisition of additional 27% interest in our long-time affiliate in Australia and New Zealand, the Clemenger Group, bringing our ownership up to about 75%. As a result of this acquisition, under U.S. GAAP guidelines, we expect to record a remeasurement gain on our historic investment in Q1 of approximately $120 million.
Also in Q4, we completed the sale of two small agencies in an ongoing strategic review of our businesses. We also expect to complete several additional divestitures and dispositions in 2011 beginning in the first quarter. The agencies that are currently under consideration for disposal have revenue of about $300 million, which is approximately equal to the revenue of our businesses that we've recently acquired. 
In addition to these strategic reviews, we've initiated a number of actions to gain further operating efficiencies, including the consolidation of agency operations in several smaller markets, the establishment of several shared service centers to increase the centralization of IT and other operating function and a number of real estate consolidation. As a result of these actions, we expect to record severance, real estate and other charges in Q1 of between $90 million and $110 million.
With regard to organic growth, we had a very strong quarter. As we previously mentioned, we saw growth across every industry sector that we serve and improvements quarter-to-quarter in every geographic market. Driven by the combination of new business wins, the improving economic environment and an increase in year-end project revenue, organic revenue in the quarter grew by 10%, or $325 million. As we've noted over the last few quarters, the above gross figures include the effect of the loss of the Chrysler account in the first quarter of 2010. That loss had a negative impact on our global organic growth in the quarter of about 1.5% and our U.S. organic growth of approximately 3%.
Turning to our mix of business. Brand advertising accounted for 47% of our revenue, and Marketing Services, 53%. As with their respective growth rates, brand advertising had organic growth of 10.9% and Marketing Services was up 9.2%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 8.3% organic growth. Within the sector of our Field Marketing, Branding and Events businesses, all had outstanding performances, each with double-digit growth. Public Relations had organic growth of just over 7%, and Specialty Communications was up 15%, with almost every agency in the sector having solid growth. Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 51% U.S. and 49% international. 
In the United States, revenue increased $206 million, or 12.6%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $1.2 million, or about 0.1%. And organic growth was exceptionally strong at 12.7%, or about $207 million. This was obviously a great quarter that benefited from strong new business wins, new initiatives in the digital area and some pent-up spending.
International revenue increased $114.9 million, or about 7%. FX decreased revenue $41.9 million, or about 2.6%. Acquisitions, net of disposition, increased revenue by $38.7 million, and organic growth was 7.2%, or $118 million. 
Internationally, we had for strong performances in China, India, Singapore and Russia. In developed Asia, South Korea had another positive quarter, while Japan was negative. And with the exception of the Netherlands, Greece, Ireland and Spain, most markets across Western Europe performed well, while results in Eastern Europe continued to be mixed but generally improving.
Looking at our revenue by industry, food and beverage continues to be our largest sector, representing 16% of our revenue in both 2010 and 2009. Our fastest-growing sectors for the quarter and for the year was technology, followed by financial services and then consumer products and pharma and healthcare. 
Although the percentage of revenue from the auto sector decreased 10% in 2010, excluding the effects of the loss of Chrysler, we experienced double-digit organic growth in the auto sector for the year. And reflective of the breadth of the recovery, all of our industry sectors experienced positive organic growth, both in the quarter and the full year. 
Turning to cash flow. For the year, our performance continued to be very strong. We generated approximately $1 billion of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital, which was also positive another $310 million. 
Our primary uses of cash during the year were dividends to our common shareholders, which totaled $229.7 million. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders was $81 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments and the purchase of additional interest in controlled subsidiaries, net of the proceeds of the sale of investments was approximately $172 million. And share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and the related tax benefits totaled approximately $1.13 billion. In total, between common dividends and net share repurchases, we returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2010, bringing net use of cash excluding working capital of $587 million.
The next chart, showing our current credit picture, including changes in working capital, shows that our net debt at year end was $900 million. That was a year-over-year increase of $237 million, which was largely driven by an increased share of repurchase activity during the year, offset by further improvements in working capital management.
Our current liquidity continues to be very strong. We finished the quarter with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling $4.3 billion, and we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $610 million. As you know, in December, we extended our credit facility for three years and reduced the capacity from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. Previously used the credit facility for both liquidity purposes and to backstop our convertible notes, which at their peaks were over $2 billion. Since we've reduced the balance of convertible notes to only $660 million, we didn't need the additional credit capacity.
And finally, to sum up our financial performance for the year, we've included a schedule of our return on equity and return on invested capital. Overall, we think ROIC and ROE as performance measures collectively show the balance of all of our various metrics that we used to gauge our performance:  revenue growth, operating margins, capital deployment, capital structure and tax structure. They also highlight the effectiveness of our long-term investment and operating strategies for shareholders.
For the year, return on invested capital was 16.8%, close to our historic 10-year average of 17.1%. And our return on equity for the year increased to 21.3%, reapproaching our 10-year average of $0.225. 
Overall, we believe our agencies have done an excellent job of navigating through the economic turbulence that we've experienced over the past two years, at the same time maintaining their focus on the quality of their services, adapting to changes in technology, expanding their presence in the emerging markets and controlling their cost. 
And with that, I'm now going to ask our Operator to open the call for questions."

We're pleased with our operating results for the first quarter. These results build on the progress we made during 2010 and also showed the strengthening of our business over the last year. This morning in particu",1016,"Thank you, Randi. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our operating results for the first quarter. These results build on the progress we made during 2010 and also showed the strengthening of our business over the last year. This morning in particular, I want to highlight several areas. First, organic growth. Organic growth in the quarter was up 5.2% over the same period in 2010. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth and the last quarter where we've faced comparisons to the Chrysler business.  Excluding its effect, organic growth would have been 6%.
Second, we completed the Clemenger acquisition in early February. This is one of a series of strategic acquisitions in markets such as Columbia, Russia, Indiana and China that will help us deepen and expand our presence in Asia and developing markets.
In addition, our acquisitions of Communispace, Voche and Fan Escape, helped us expand our digital capabilities and consumer insight, analytics and social media.
Each of these acquisitions meets the test of strategic fit and price, and that each represent an investment in what we believe ours some of the best companies in their respective disciplines and markets.
As many of you know, in March, we announced that we have made significant progress in digital through new strategic partnerships with Microsoft, Yahoo and AOL. This come on the heels of our Google partnership announced in 2010. Each of these partnerships is designed to leverage our skills in areas of brand building, storytelling and creative, with our partner's technological skills, platforms and reach.
Our goal with each of these partnerships is to continue to build the strongest competencies for our agencies and deliver innovative and effective tools and ideas to our clients worldwide.
Lastly, we continue to make progress towards our goal of returning margins to 2007 levels by 2012. Late last year, we embarked on a review of all of our businesses with the goal of improving margins while also investing in our best growth opportunities. We also challenged each of our companies to identify opportunities to improve margins while continuing to drive growth.
I'm happy to report that we made substantial progress disposing and of reorganizing nonstrategic and underperforming businesses in our portfolio. Total annual revenue for businesses disposed of to date is approximately $120 million. During the quarter, we did incur charges affecting the P&L as a result of these repositioning activities.
We also recognized the gain in connection with the completion of our acquisition of a majority interest in Clemenger. Randy will walk you through these items and their implications on the quarter in more detail during his part of the presentation.
Although we are not finished with our review of all the companies in our portfolio, we do not expect to incur significant charges for the remainder of the year. 
Taken together, these actions demonstrate a focus on executing our core strategies of building our presence in key markets outside the United States, improving our digital competencies, and driving margin improvement without hampering growth.
Turning to an analysis of revenue by region. In the U.S., we continue to see strong organic growth of 4.1% versus the first quarter of last year and 6.8% excluding Chrysler. As I noted in February, we expect growth for the year to return to more historic levels as we face more difficult year-over-year comps.
With that said though, we expect to see solid growth in the U.S. market, as employment and business fundamentals continue to improve. 
In Europe, organic growth was 2.1%. We saw a strong growth in both the U.K. and France. France, we believe, will continue.
Outside the euro zone, we also saw solid positive growth. In the Middle East, the recent political term loan did not have a significant impact on our revenue. 
In Asia and South America, our investments continue to generate significant positive returns with double digit growth in each of the regions. That events independent of it today negative from that market in the quarter. However, based upon what we know today, we do not see a significant impact to our operations for the remainder of 2011.
With the people of Japan and the families of our clients and staff who were affected. I want to thank our agencies and employees around the world for their numerous efforts and support for the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Lastly, I want to note that as part of our continuing effort to diversify our geographic revenue mix, Non-U.S. revenues have increased to 47.6% from 45.5% in the year-ago quarter even while U.S. revenues continue to grow significantly.
Our revenues from markets other than the U.S., U.K. and Europe, now represent over 20% of our revenue for the first time in our history. Our growth is also coming from the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, including Pharma and healthcare, financials services, food and beverage, and consumer products. All of these areas performed exceptionally well.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continued to utilize our free cash flow and cash on hand for acquisition, dividend and share repurchases. In addition to the acquisitions we completed, we repurchased 6.8 million shares, and increased our quarterly dividend by 25% during the quarter.
Finally, overall, we are pleased with the continued performance of our business. As we talk with our clients, we see significant opportunities to help them execute their plans for growth. As we talked our agencies, we see an organization that is working aggressively to anticipate trends and develop innovative ideas for our clients. 
As we look forward for ways to deploy our capital, we continue to see reasonably priced companies in the market while we specialize skills that we believe will continue to further our overall growth strategies.
Lastly, but certainly not least, we remain vigilant seeking to optimize our portfolio to ensure that when we invest, we are doing so in companies that are well-positioned for profitable growth.
I will now turn the call back to Randy, and he'll take us through the quarter in detail."

The underlying fundamentals of our business has continued to improve, and our new business efforts have been very successful. As a result, we continued to experience positive organic growth across each of our business disciplines and across all of the industry segments that we serve.
In addition, we've successfully closed several acquisitions in the quarter that we're very excited about.
Before I discuss the results for the quarter, I want to point out that there are a couple of items included in the reported figures that we need to break out, so that the numbers are more comparable against the prior period.
As we discussed in the Q4 Earnings Call, as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in our long-term affiliate, the Clemenger Group, which is the leading marketing communications market Australia and New Zealand, in accordance with GAAP, we recorded a gain resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to fair value. 
In addition, we continue to implement the strategic review process that we initiated last year. Our agencies were very busy in the quarter, taking a number of actions, including disposing of several businesses, consolidating several of our smaller operations, as well as certain businesses consolidating several of their locations, and taking numerous actions to further increase our operating efficiencies.
As a result of these repositioning actions, we incurred a cost in the quarter of $131.3 million. There were also a number of disruptive and tragic events that occurred in the quarter that many of our agency personnel and their families had to work through, including the disaster in Japan, the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, the flood in Brisbane, Australia, and the political unrest and turmoil in the Middle East.
I commend our agencies in those affected regions for managing what an extremely difficult situations with exceptional scale.
Now turning to our financial performance. As I said, it was a very solid quarter and largely in line with our expectations. Year-over-year revenue grew 7.9%, bringing revenue for the quarter to $3.15 billion. Reported EBITDA increased 11.6% to $343 million, and our resulting EBITDA margin was 10.9%, up about 40 basis points from last year.
As I mentioned, there were several items in the quarter that impacted our reported earnings. First, the cost associated with the repositioning actions that were executed in the quarter totaled approximately $131.3 million, and second, the remeasurement date associated with our acquisition of a controlling interest in Clemenger of $123.4 million. In that effect to these two items reduced EBITDA by $7.9 million, or about 25 basis points.
Our reported operating income, or EBIT, increased 10.7% to $322 million for a year-over-year margin improvement of about 20 basis points. Adjusting for the repositioning costs and the remeasurement gain, our EBIT margin was 10.5%, off about 50 basis points. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $32.1 million, up $8 million from the Q1 last year, and essentially flat from the fourth quarter.
The increase versus the first quarter of 2010 was primarily reflective of interest on $1 billion of 10-year senior notes issued in August of 2010, partially offset by the positive effect to our interest rate swaps on our 2016 senior notes and increased interest income.
From the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%. The reduction in the rate is primarily the result of minimal tax expense associated with the Clemenger remeasurement gain, offset by a lower-than-average tax benefits on certain of the repositioning charges, and a $9 million tax charge associated with closing various audit issues for the years 2005, '06 and '07.
Going forward, as we outlined at the end of last year, we expect our operating tax rate to be in the 34.2% to 34.4% range.
Net income for the quarter increased 23.6% to $201.9 million, and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 32.7% to $0.69 per share.  The diluted share count for the quarter was 289 million shares, down about 7% from the same period last year.
Before we review our financial performance, we added a slide on Page 3 that lays out where the remeasurement gain and the repetition in charges are reflected in our P&L. The repositioning expenses primarily included severance, real estate and other charges related to underperforming businesses that were disposed of, as well as our efforts to correct staffing imbalances and make operating improvements in certain underperforming businesses that we believe our strategically important.
We also undertook the consolidation of certain back-office operations and infrastructure for a number of our smaller businesses. The severance charges, which will be cash, totaled approximately $92.8 million, and were included in salary and service expense.
Additional, primarily non-cash charges related to asset and goodwill write-offs, real estate charges net of gains on dispositions, totaled $38.5 million, were included in office and general expenses. The re-measurement gain of $123.4 million is included as a reduction in office and general expenses.
While the bulk of our actions associated with our strategic review activities were completed in the first quarter, we do anticipate several additional dispositions and some additional repositioning expenses later this year.  The exact timing is difficult to predict with certainty, but our goal is to complete these actions in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar weekend versus most of our major currencies, with the exception of the euro. And that result was a positive impact for the quarter of $37 million, or about 1.3%. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive around 4% in the second quarter, and then flattened out in the second half of the year. We expect the full-year impact of the positive only about 2%.
Revenue growth from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $42 million in the quarter, or about 1.4%. A few of the larger transactions were Clemenger, and Communispace this quarter, and DDB in Columbia and OMG Middle East at the end of last year. 
As I mentioned before, we do expect to complete a couple of additional dispositions before year end. And in all likelihood, we will also close at least a few more acquisitions.
With regards organic growth, we had a very solid quarter. We continued to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve, our new business efforts have been strong, and we continue to see economic recovery, although slow, in most of the markets that we operate. As a result, organic revenue growth was 5.2%, or $152 million.
Fortunately, this was the last quarter before we cycle on the Chrysler loss. Excluding Chrysler, which was just over $47 million in revenue in Q1 of 2010, organic growth was 6.8%.
A couple of other items in the quarter worth mentioning. We've experienced loss revenue in the quarter as a result of the political turmoil in the Middle East. As a result, growth in the region slowed from strong double digits to single-digits. The Middle East region accounts for about 1% of our revenue.
Also, as a result of the tragic events that occurred in Japan, we experienced some disruption at the end of the quarter, and expected to continue for the next couple of quarters. Japan accounts for about 1.5% of our revenue.  But While it has not yet impacted us, the issues in Japan may also affect spending by Japanese clients outside of Japan over the balance of the year.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue, and marketing services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising had 4.2% organic growth, and marketing services was up 6.1%. However with brand advertising, we have to keep in mind the Chrysler loss. Excluding Chrysler, brand advertising had organic growth of about 7%.
Within the marketing services category, CRM had 7.1% organic growth. Within this sector, direct and field marketing, branding, research and design, all had outstanding performances. 
Our Events business was flat year-over-year, which we actually believe was quite strong, given in Q1 last year, we had the Winter Olympics.  Public relations had organic growth of 1.9%, and Specialty Communications was up 6.6%.
On Slide 6, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 52% U.S. and 48% international. In the United States, revenue increased $60 million, or 3.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $5 million, or 0.3%, an organic growth was 4.1%, or about $65 million.
Again, the Chrysler loss had a disproportionate impact on the U.S. numbers given it was almost entirely a U.S. account. Excluding Chrysler, the U.S. had organic growth of 6.8%.
International revenue increased $171.6 million, or about 12.9%. FX increased revenue by $37 million, or 2.8%. Acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $47 million, and organic growth was 6.6%, or about $87 million.
Internationally, in Asia, we had strong performances in China, Singapore, Australia and South Korea. And as I've said before, Japan was negative. 
In Europe, we had good performances in the U.K., France, Russia, Poland and Spain. However, in the other so-called big countries, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Greece, they continue to be negative, although less negative than last year.  And Latin America continues to perform well across the region. 
Slide 7 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter. And again, this quarter, we experienced positive growth across all of the industry segments that we serve. 
In the auto industry, while we had low single-digit growth overall, excluding Chrysler, it was up over 26%.
In the financial services, technology, healthcare and Pharma, food and beverage and consumer products segments, led our growth this quarter, each having double-digit growth rates.
Turning to Slide 8, cash flow. Our cash performance on the quarter was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $160 million of free cash flow after CapEx, and excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash during the quarter were dividends to our Common Shareholders, which totaled $58 million. Dividends paid to our Non-Controlling Interests shareholders of $25 million, acquisitions, including earn-out payments, and the purchase of additional interest in controlled subsidiaries, net of proceeds from the sale of investments of approximately $260 million, and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans as a related tax benefit, totaled approximately $302 million.
Slide 9 shows our current capital structure. Including changes in working capital, our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of about $350 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven predominantly by our stock repurchase activity, which has totaled $1.2 billion over the last 12 months.
And our total debt was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from year end, and up about $1 billion year-over-year due to the issuance of the 2020 bonds last August.
Our leverage ratio, or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.8x, and net debt to EBITDA is just under 1x. Our interest coverage ratio remains very strong at 11.9x. While liquidity continues to be very strong as well, we finished the quarter with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities, totaling about $3.5 billion. We had additional uncommitted facilities available, totaling another $670 million. 
And finally, on Slide 11, where all the numbers come together, both our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.7% and 23.3%, respectively, both re-approaching our 20-year averages.
And with that, in going to now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

What we said last year is that, organic growth over time is going to reconnect with GDP. We think we can outpace GDP by 100 to 200 basis points, is that sort of the timing of that reconnection. We thought last year, we stated in the fourth quarter, that we thought the U.S. organic growth rate would low. As a result of that, we think the European organic growth rate will be improved overall. And that's largely going to be the negative countries getting these are less negative, or returning to positive as their comps lineup. And in some of the larger markets that had performed pretty well throughout last year, in all likelihood, their organic growth rates will slow. And I don't think 9% organic growth in the U.K. is probably going to occur at that level, given the current GDP growth rates for a year or two. But our agencies with strong individual performance can certainly prove us strong. Those are kind of macro predictions."

I mean there's been some chatter about how various underlying media businesses are doing there, so I'm just curious on your take on it. And then a couple of items on margins. I think you addressed dispositions impact on revenue is being, organic revenue growth is being minimal. Any impact of dispositions on margin that you saw in the quarter? And then one other thing on margin, are you seeing any differences of note in incremental margins, either across your disciplines or across geographies?

For Europe, Europe is I guess playing out over the last few quarters, and this quarter, kind of as I expected. As the larger markets recovered earlier, keep in mind we have a fairly substantial base of multinational clients that are going to focus their resources on what they believe are important markets. So France, Germany, the U.K., all did fairly well last year, and we think will continue. The smaller markets across Europe, they were hurt by their local economies Tom and I'm sure are probably less focused for some of the multinational clients. We felt that those countries that were significantly negative would be at a minimum, less negative. So they're going to have less of an impact, or at least less of a negative impact. So with that reduction our European growth would improve. Basically, it's what continue to happened this quarter, that the larger markets have performed fairly well, and I pointed out that the biggest markets, Spain is actually positive for us this quarter. The other markets were negative but they were less negative than they were last year. So the European growth rates, overall, improved. Trying to get to some of your other questions. You talked about margins by discipline, we've pointed out for a while, the Media business, in general, has higher margins, and some of our field marketing, shopper marketing businesses has lower margins than field marketing, especially, but they have very good returns on equities. They have very little capital committed to those businesses, so they're frankly, excellent businesses from a return perspective. But their overall EBIT margins are a bit lower. And they probably forgot."

Obviously, we're not targets both of our higher margin businesses, so we do expect some benefit over time from selling those businesses. As far as going back to sort of Bill's question on dispositions with organic growth, the way we calculate organic growth, the revenues from the companies we disposed of, would be in that base. To the extent those companies would've had flat growth, it wouldn't have affected us if they had negative growth, not having the business in it, and we wouldn't have that negative revenue piece but the base is still in it. And we're talking a very small amount of revenue here, annualized revenue, about $120 million, is what's been disposed of to date. So I don't think you can have really much of an impact if it does, it could be positive, 0.1 negative, 0.1. It would be very, very minor, and the margins again, it will also be fairly minor. It could maybe move the number 0.1 or something."

96161,129814181,115639,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our operating results for the first quarter. These results build on the progress we made during 2010 and also showed the strengthening of our business over the last year. This morning, in part",1021,"Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our operating results for the first quarter. These results build on the progress we made during 2010 and also showed the strengthening of our business over the last year. 
This morning, in particular, I want to highlight several areas. First, organic growth. Organic growth in the quarter was up 5.2% over the same period in 2010. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth and the last quarter where we face comparisons to the Chrysler business.  Excluding its effect, organic growth would have been 6.8%. Second, we completed the Clemenger acquisition in early February. This is one of a series of strategic acquisitions in markets such as Columbia, Russia, India and China that will help us deepen and expand our presence in Asia and developing markets. In addition, our acquisitions of Communispace, Voce and Fanscape help us to expand our digital capabilities and consumer insights, analytics and social media. Each of these acquisitions meets the test of strategic fit and price, and each represents an investment in what we believe are some of the best companies in their respective disciplines and markets.
As many of you know, in March, we announced that we have made significant progress in digital through new strategic partnerships with Microsoft, Yahoo! and AOL. This come on the heels of our Google partnership announced in 2010. Each of these partnerships is designed to leverage our skills in areas of brand building, storytelling and creative, with our partner's technological skills, platforms and reach. Our goal with each of these partnerships is to continue to build the strongest competencies for our agencies and deliver innovative and effective tools and ideas to our clients worldwide.
Lastly, we continue to make progress towards our goal of returning margins to 2007 levels by 2012. Late last year, we embarked on a review of all of our businesses with the goal of improving margins while also investing in our best growth opportunities. We also challenged each of our companies to identify opportunities to improve margins while continuing to drive growth.
I'm happy to report that we made substantial progress disposing and of reorganizing non-strategic and underperforming businesses in our portfolio. Total annual revenue for businesses disposed of to date is approximately $120 million. During the quarter, we did incur charges affecting the P&L as a result of these repositioning activities. We also recognized the gain in connection with the completion of our acquisition of a majority interest in Clemenger. Randy will walk you through these items and their implications on the quarter in more detail during his part of the presentation. Although we are not finished with our review of all the companies in our portfolio, we do not expect to incur significant charges for the remainder of the year. 
Taken together, these actions demonstrate a focus on executing our core strategies of building our presence in key markets outside the United States, improving our digital competencies, and driving margin improvement without hampering growth.
Turning to an analysis of revenue by region. In the U.S., we continue to see strong organic growth of 4.1% versus the first quarter of last year and 6.8% excluding Chrysler. As I noted in February, we expect growth for the year to return to more historic levels as we face more difficult year-over-year comps. With that said though, we expect to see solid growth in the U.S. market, as employment and business fundamentals continue to improve. 
In Europe, organic growth was 2.1%. We saw a strong growth in both the U.K. and France. France, we believe, will continue. Outside the euro zone, we also saw solid positive growth. In the Middle East, the recent political turmoil did not have a significant impact on our revenue. 
In Asia and South America, our investments continue to generate significant positive returns with double digit growth in each of the regions. The tragic events in Japan contributed to a negative performance in that market for the quarter. However, based upon what we know today, we do not see a significant impact to our operations for the remainder of 2011. Our thoughts are with the people of Japan and the families of our clients and staff who were affected. I want to thank our agencies and employees around the world for their numerous efforts and support for the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Lastly, I want to note that as part of our continuing efforts to diversify our geographic revenue mix, non-U.S. revenues have increased to 47.6% from 45.5% in the year-ago quarter even while U.S. revenues continue to grow significantly. Our revenues from markets other than the U.S., U.K. and Euro, now represent over 20% of our revenue for the first time in our history. Our growth is also coming from the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, including pharma and healthcare, financials services, food and beverage, and consumer products. All these areas performed exceptionally well.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to utilize our free cash flow and cash on hand for acquisition, dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the acquisitions we completed, we repurchased 6.8 million shares, and increased our quarterly dividend by 25% during the quarter.
Finally, overall, we were pleased with the continued performance of our business. As we talk with our clients, we see significant opportunities to help them execute their plans for growth. As we talk to our agencies, we see an organization that is working aggressively to anticipate trends and develop innovative ideas for our clients. 
As we look forward for ways to deploy our capital, we continue to see reasonably priced companies in the market or we specialize skills that we believe will continue to further our overall growth strategies.
Lastly, but certainly not least, we remain vigilant in seeking to optimize our portfolio to ensure that when we invest, we are doing so in companies that are well-positioned for profitable growth.
I will now turn the call back to Randy, and he'll take us through the quarter in detail."

The underlying fundamentals of our business has continued to improve, and our new business efforts have been very successful. As a result, we continue to experience positive organic growth across each of our business disciplines and across all of the industry segments that we serve. In addition, we successfully closed several acquisitions in the quarter that we're very excited about.
Before I discuss the results for the quarter, I want to point out that there are a couple of items included in the reported figures that we need to break out, so that the numbers are more comparable against the prior period.
As we discussed in the Q4 earnings call, as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in our long-term affiliate, the Clemenger Group, which is the leading marketing communications group in Australia and New Zealand, in accordance with GAAP, we recorded a gain resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to fair value. In addition, we continue to implement the strategic review process that we initiated last year. Our agencies were very busy in the quarter, taking a number of actions, including disposing of several businesses, consolidating several of our smaller operations, as well as certain businesses consolidating several of their locations, and taking numerous actions to further increase operating efficiencies.
As a result of these repositioning actions, we incurred a cost in the quarter of $131.3 million. There were also a number of disruptive and tragic events that occurred in the quarter that many of our agency personnel and their families had to work through, including the disaster in Japan, the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, the floods in Brisbane, Australia, and the political unrest and turmoil in the Middle East. I commend our agencies in those affected regions for managing what an extremely difficult situations with exceptional skill.
Now turning to our financial performance. As I said, it was a very solid quarter and largely in line with our expectations. Year-over-year revenue grew 7.9%, bringing revenue for the quarter to $3.15 billion. Reported EBITDA increased 11.6% to $343 million, and our resulting EBITDA margin was 10.9%, up about 40 basis points from last year.
As I mentioned, there were several items in the quarter that impacted our reported earnings. First, the cost associated with the repositioning actions that were executed in the quarter totaled approximately $131.3 million, and second, the remeasurement date associated with our acquisition of a controlling interest in Clemenger of $123.4 million. The net effect of these two items reduced EBITDA by $7.9 million, or about 25 basis points. Our reported operating income, or EBIT, increased 10.7% to $322 million for a year-over-year margin improvement of about 20 basis points. Adjusting for the repositioning costs and the remeasurement gain, our EBIT margin was 10.5%, off about 50 basis points. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $32.1 million, up $8 million from Q1 last year, and essentially flat from the fourth quarter. The increase versus the first quarter of 2010 was primarily reflective of interest on a $1 billion of 10-year senior notes issued in August of 2010, partially offset by the positive effects of our interest rate swaps on our 2016 senior notes and increased interest income.
From the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%. The reduction in the rate is primarily the result of minimal tax expense associated with the Clemenger remeasurement gain, offset by a lower-than-average tax benefits on certain of the repositioning charges, and a $9 million tax charge associated with closing various audit issues for the years 2005, '06 and '07. Going forward, as we outlined at the end of last year, we expect our operating tax rate to be in the 34.2% to 34.4% range.
Net income for the quarter increased 23.6% to $201.9 million, and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 32.7% to $0.69 per share.  The diluted share count for the quarter was 289 million shares, down about 7% from the same period last year.
Before we review our financial performance, we added a slide on Page 3 that lays out where the remeasurement gain and the repositioning charges are reflected in our P&L. The repositioning expenses primarily included severance, real estate and other charges related to underperforming businesses that were disposed of, as well as our efforts to correct staffing imbalances and make operating improvements in certain underperforming businesses that we believe are strategically important. We also undertook the consolidation of certain back-office operations and infrastructure for a number of our smaller businesses. 
The severance charges, which will be cash, totaled approximately $92.8 million, and were included in salary and service expense. Additional, primarily non-cash charges related to asset and goodwill write-offs, real estate charges net of gains on dispositions, totaled $38.5 million, were included in office and general expenses. The remeasurement gain of $123.4 million is included as a reduction in office and general expenses.
While the bulk of our actions associated with our strategic review activities were completed in the first quarter, we do anticipate several additional dispositions and some additional repositioning expenses later this year. The exact timing is difficult to predict with certainty, but our goal is to complete these actions in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar weakened versus most of our major currencies, with the exception of the euro. The net result was a positive FX impact for the quarter of $37 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive around 4% in the second quarter, and then flattened out in the second half of the year. We expect the full year impact to be positive only about 2%.
Revenue growth from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $42 million in the quarter or about 1.4%. A few of the larger transactions were Clemenger and Communispace this quarter, and DDB Columbia and OMG in Middle East at the end of last year. As I mentioned before, we do expect to complete a couple of additional dispositions before year end. And in all likelihood, we will also close at least a few more acquisitions.
With regard to organic growth, we had a very solid quarter. We continued to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve. Our new business efforts have been strong, and we continue to see economic recovery, although slow, in most of the markets that we operate. As a result, organic revenue growth was 5.2% or $152 million.
Fortunately, this was the last quarter before we cycle on the Chrysler loss. Excluding Chrysler, which was just over $47 million in revenue in Q1 of 2010, organic growth was 6.8%.
A couple of other items in the quarter worth mentioning. We did experience lost revenue in the quarter as a result of the political turmoil in the Middle East. As a result, growth in the region slowed from strong double digits to single digits. The Middle East region accounts for about 1% of our revenue.
Also, as a result of the tragic events that occurred in Japan, we experienced some disruption at the end of the quarter, and expect it to continue for the next couple of quarters. Japan accounts for about 1.5% of our revenue. Although it has not yet impacted us, the issues in Japan may also effect spending by Japanese clients outside of Japan over the balance of the year.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue, and marketing services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising had 4.2% organic growth, and marketing services was up 6.1%. However, with brand advertising, we have to keep in mind the Chrysler loss. Excluding Chrysler, brand advertising had organic growth of about 7%.
Within the marketing services category, CRM had 7.1% organic growth. Within this sector, direct and field marketing, branding, research and design, all had outstanding performances. Our Events business was flat year-over-year, which we actually believe was quite strong, given in Q1 last year, we had the Winter Olympics. Public relations had organic growth of 1.9%, and Specialty Communications was up 6.6%.
On Slide 6, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 52% U.S. and 48% international. In the United States, revenue increased $60 million, or 3.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $5 million, or 0.3%, and organic growth was 4.1%, or about $65 million. Again, the Chrysler loss had a disproportionate impact on the U.S. numbers given it was almost entirely a U.S. account. Excluding Chrysler, the U.S. had organic growth of 6.8%.
International revenue increased $171.6 million, or about 12.9%. FX increased revenue by $37 million, or 2.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $47 million, and organic growth was 6.6%, or about $87 million.
Internationally, in Asia, we had strong performances in China, Singapore, Australia and South Korea. And as I said before, Japan was negative. In Europe, we had good performances in the U.K., France, Russia, Poland and Spain. However, in the other so-called PIIG countries, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Greece, they continue to be negative, although less negative than last year. And Latin America continues to perform well across the region. 
Slide 7 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter. And again, this quarter, we experienced positive growth across all of the industry segments that we serve. In the auto industry, while we had low single-digit growth overall, excluding Chrysler, it was up over 26%. In the financial services, technology, healthcare and pharma, food and beverage and consumer products segments, led our growth this quarter, each having double-digit growth rates.
Turning to Slide 8, cash flow. Our cash performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $160 million of free cash flow after CapEx, and excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash during the quarter were dividends to our common shareholders, which totaled $58 million, dividends paid to our non-controlling interests shareholders of $25 million. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, and the purchase of additional interest in controlled subsidiaries, net of proceeds from the sale of investments of approximately $216 million, and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and the related tax benefits totaled approximately $302 million.
Slide 9 shows our current capital structure. Including changes in working capital, our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of about $350 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven predominantly by our stock repurchase activity, which has totaled $1.2 billion over the last 12 months.
And our total debt was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from year end, and up about $1 billion year-over-year due to the issuance of the 2020 bonds last August. Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.8x, and net debt to EBITDA is just under 1x. Our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 11.9x. Our liquidity continues to be very strong as well, we finished the quarter with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities, totaling about $3.5 billion.

For Europe, Europe's I guess playing out over the last few quarters, and this quarter, kind of as I expected. The larger markets recovered earlier, keeping in mind we have a fairly substantial base of multinational clients that are going to focus their resources on what they believe are important markets. So France, Germany, and the U.K., all did fairly well last year, and we think will continue. The smaller markets across Europe, they were hurt by their local economies and I'm sure are probably less than a focus for some of the multinational clients. We felt that those countries that were significantly negative would be at a minimum, less negative. So they're going to have less of an impact, or at least less of a negative impact. So with that reduction our European growth would improve, basically, is what continue to happen this quarter. The larger markets performed fairly well, and I pointed out the PIGS markets, Spain is actually positive for us this quarter. The other markets were negative but they were less negative than they were last year. So the European growth rates, overall, improved. Trying to get to some of your other questions, you talked about margins by discipline. We've pointed out for a while the Media business, in general, has higher margins and some of our field marketing, shopper marketing businesses has lower margins of field marketing especially, but they have very good returns on equities. They have very little capital committed to those businesses, so they're frankly, excellent businesses from a return perspective, but their overall EBIT margins are a bit lower.

Obviously, we're not trying to dispose of our higher margin businesses, so we do expect some benefit over time from selling those businesses. As far as going back to sort of Bill's question on dispositions with organic growth, the way we calculate organic growth, the revenues from the companies we disposed of, would be in that base. To the extent those companies would've had flat growth, it wouldn't have affected us if they would have had negative growth, not having the business -- and we wouldn't have that negative revenue piece but the base is still in it.

96161,129814181,115651,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our operating results for the first quarter. These results build on the progress we made during 2010 and also show the strengthening of our business over the last year. This morning, in partic",1019,"Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our operating results for the first quarter. These results build on the progress we made during 2010 and also show the strengthening of our business over the last year. 
This morning, in particular, I want to highlight several areas. First, organic growth. Organic growth in the quarter was up 5.2% over the same period in 2010. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth and the last quarter where we face comparisons to the Chrysler business.  Excluding its effect, organic growth would have been 6.8%. Second, we completed the Clemenger acquisition in early February. This is one of a series of strategic acquisitions in markets such as Columbia, Russia, India and China that will help us deepen and expand our presence in Asia and developing markets. In addition, our acquisitions of Communispace, Voce and Fanscape help us to expand our digital capabilities in consumer insights, analytics and social media. Each of these acquisitions meets the test of strategic fit and price, and each represents an investment in what we believe are some of the best companies in their respective disciplines and markets.
As many of you know, in March, we announced that we have made significant progress in digital through new strategic partnerships with Microsoft, Yahoo! and AOL. This come on the heels of our Google partnership announced in 2010. Each of these partnerships is designed to leverage our skills in areas of brand building, storytelling and creative, with our partner's technological skills, platforms and reach. Our goal with each of these partnerships is to continue to build the strongest competencies for our agencies and deliver innovative and effective tools and ideas to our clients worldwide.
Lastly, we continue to make progress towards our goal of returning margins to 2007 levels by 2012. Late last year, we embarked on a review of all of our businesses with the goal of improving margins while also investing in our best growth opportunities. We also challenged each of our companies to identify opportunities to improve margins while continuing to drive growth.
I'm happy to report that we made substantial progress disposing and of reorganizing non-strategic and underperforming businesses in our portfolio. Total annual revenue for businesses disposed of to date is approximately $120 million. During the quarter, we did incur charges affecting the P&L as a result of these repositioning activities. We also recognized the gain in connection with the completion of our acquisition of a majority interest in Clemenger. Randy will walk you through these items and their implications on the quarter in more detail during his part of the presentation. Although we are not finished with our review of all the companies in our portfolio, we do not expect to incur significant charges for the remainder of the year. 
Taken together, these actions demonstrate a focus on executing our core strategies of building our presence in key markets outside the United States, improving our digital competencies and driving margin improvement without hampering growth.
Turning to an analysis of revenue by region. In the U.S., we continue to see strong organic growth of 4.1% versus the first quarter of last year and 6.8% excluding Chrysler. As I noted in February, we expect growth for the year to return to more historic levels as we face more difficult year-over-year comps. With that said though, we expect to see solid growth in the U.S. market, as employment and business fundamentals continue to improve. 
In Europe, organic growth was 2.1%. We saw a strong growth in both the U.K. and France, trends, we believe, will continue. Outside the Eurozone, we also saw solid positive growth. In the Middle East, the recent political turmoil did not have a significant impact on our revenue. 
In Asia and South America, our investments continue to generate significant positive returns with double-digit growth in each of the regions. The tragic events in Japan contributed to a negative performance in that market for the quarter. However, based upon what we know today, we do not see a significant impact to our operations for the remainder of 2011. Our thoughts are with the people of Japan and the families of our clients and staff who were affected. I want to thank our agencies and employees around the world for their numerous efforts to support the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Lastly, I want to note that as part of our continuing efforts to diversify our geographic revenue mix, non-U.S. revenues have increased to 47.6% from 45.5% in the year-ago quarter, even while U.S. revenues continue to grow significantly. Our revenues from markets other than the U.S., U.K. and Euro, now represent over 20% of our revenue for the first time in our history. Our growth is also coming from the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, including pharma and healthcare, financial services, food and beverage and consumer products. All these areas performed exceptionally well.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to utilize our free cash flow and cash on hand for acquisition, dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the acquisitions we completed, we repurchased 6.8 million shares and increased our quarterly dividend by 25% during the quarter.
Finally, overall, we are pleased with the continued performance of our business. As we talk with our clients, we see significant opportunities to help them execute their plans for growth. As we talk to our agencies, we see an organization that is working aggressively to anticipate trends and develop innovative ideas for our clients. 
As we look forward for ways to deploy our capital, we continue to see reasonably priced companies in the market or we specialize skills that we believe will continue to further our overall growth strategies.
Lastly, but certainly not least, we remain vigilant in seeking to optimize our portfolio to ensure that when we invest, we are doing so in companies that are well positioned for profitable growth.
I will now turn the call back to Randy, and he'll take us through the quarter in detail."

The underlying fundamentals of our business have continued to improve, and our new business efforts have been very successful. As a result, we continue to experience positive organic growth across each of our business disciplines and across all of the industry segments that we serve. In addition, we successfully closed several acquisitions in the quarter that we're very excited about.
Before I discuss the results for the quarter, I want to point out that there are a couple of items included in the reported figures that we need to break out so that the numbers are more comparable against the prior period.
As we discussed in the Q4 earnings call, as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in our long-term affiliate, the Clemenger Group, which is the leading marketing communications group in Australia and New Zealand, in accordance with GAAP, we recorded a gain resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to fair value. In addition, we continue to implement the strategic review process that we initiated last year. Our agencies were very busy in the quarter, taking a number of actions, including disposing of several businesses, consolidating several of our smaller operations, as well as certain businesses consolidating several of their locations and taking numerous actions to further increase operating efficiencies.
As a result of these repositioning actions, we incurred a cost in the quarter of $131.3 million. There were also a number of disruptive and tragic events that occurred in the quarter that many of our agency personnel and their families had to work through, including the disaster in Japan; the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand; the floods in Brisbane, Australia; and the political unrest and turmoil in the Middle East. I commend our agencies in those affected regions for managing what are extremely difficult situations with exceptional skill.
Now turning to our financial performance. As I said, it was a very solid quarter and largely in line with our expectations. Year-over-year revenue grew 7.9%, bringing revenue for the quarter to $3.15 billion. Reported EBITDA increased 11.6% to $343 million, and our resulting EBITDA margin was 10.9%, up about 40 basis points from last year.
As I mentioned, there were several items in the quarter that impacted our reported earnings. First, the cost associated with the repositioning actions that were executed in the quarter totaled approximately $131.3 million and, second, the remeasurement gain associated with our acquisition of a controlling interest in Clemenger of $123.4 million. The net effect of these two items reduced EBITDA by $7.9 million or about 25 basis points. Our reported operating income, or EBIT, increased 10.7% to $322 million for a year-over-year margin improvement of about 20 basis points. Adjusting for the repositioning costs and the remeasurement gain, our EBIT margin was 10.5%, off about 50 basis points. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $32.1 million, up $8 million from Q1 last year and essentially flat from the fourth quarter. The increase versus the first quarter of 2010 was primarily reflective of interest on the $1 billion of 10-year senior notes issued in August of 2010, partially offset by the positive effects for interest rate swaps on our 2016 senior notes and increased interest income.
From the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%. The reduction in the rate is primarily the result of minimal tax expense associated with the Clemenger remeasurement gain, offset by a lower-than-average tax benefits on certain of the repositioning charges and a $9 million tax charge associated with closing various audit issues for the years 2005, '06 and '07. Going forward, as we outlined at the end of last year, we expect our operating tax rate to be in the 34.2% to 34.4% range.
Net income for the quarter increased 23.6% to $201.9 million, and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 32.7% to $0.69 per share.  The diluted share count for the quarter was 289 million shares, down about 7% from the same period last year.
Before we review our financial performance, we added a slide on Page 3 that lays out where the remeasurement gain and the repositioning charges are reflected in our P&L. The repositioning expenses primarily included severance, real estate and other charges related to underperforming businesses that were disposed of, as well as our efforts to correct staffing imbalances and make operating improvements in certain underperforming businesses that we believe are strategically important. We also undertook the consolidation of certain back-office operations and infrastructure for a number of our smaller businesses. 
The severance charges, which will be cash, totaled approximately $92.8 million and were included in salary and service expense. Additional, primarily non-cash charges related to asset and goodwill write-offs, real estate charges net of gains on dispositions, totaled $38.5 million, were included in office and general expenses. The remeasurement gain of $123.4 million is included as a reduction in office and general expenses.
While the bulk of our actions associated with our strategic review activities were completed in the first quarter, we do anticipate several additional dispositions and some additional repositioning expenses later this year. The exact timing is difficult to predict with certainty, but our goal is to complete these actions in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar weakened versus most of our major currencies, with the exception of the euro. The net result was a positive FX impact for the quarter of $37 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive around 4% in the second quarter and then flatten out in the second half of the year. We expect the full year impact to be positive only about 2%.
Revenue growth from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $42 million in the quarter or about 1.4%. A few of the larger transactions were Clemenger and Communispace this quarter and DDB Columbia and OMG Middle East at the end of last year. As I mentioned before, we do expect to complete a couple of additional dispositions before year end. And in all likelihood, we will also close at least a few more acquisitions.
With regard to organic growth, we had a very solid quarter. We continued to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve. Our new business efforts have been strong, and we continue to see economic recovery, although slow, in most of the markets that we operate. As a result, organic revenue growth was 5.2% or $152 million.
Fortunately, this was the last quarter before we cycle on the Chrysler loss. Excluding Chrysler, which was just over $47 million in revenue in Q1 of 2010, organic growth was 6.8%.
A couple of other items in the quarter worth mentioning. We did experience lost revenue in the quarter as a result of the political turmoil in the Middle East. As a result, growth in the region slowed from strong double digits to single digits. The Middle East region accounts for about 1% of our revenue.
Also, as a result of the tragic events that occurred in Japan, we experienced some disruption at the end of the quarter and expect it to continue for the next couple of quarters. Japan accounts for about 1.5% of our revenue. Although it has not yet impacted us, the issues in Japan may also affect spending by Japanese clients outside of Japan over the balance of the year.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue, and marketing services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising had 4.2% organic growth, and marketing services was up 6.1%. However, with brand advertising, we have to keep in mind the Chrysler loss. Excluding Chrysler, brand advertising had organic growth of about 7%.
Within the marketing services category, CRM had 7.1% organic growth. Within this sector, direct and field marketing, branding, research and design all had outstanding performances. Our Events business was flat year-over-year, which we actually believe was quite strong, given in Q1 last year, we had the Winter Olympics. Public Relations had organic growth of 1.9%, and Specialty Communications was up 6.6%.
On Slide 6, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 52% U.S. and 48% international. In the United States, revenue increased $60 million or 3.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $5 million or 0.3% and organic growth was 4.1% or about $65 million. Again, the Chrysler loss had a disproportionate impact on the U.S. numbers given it was almost entirely a U.S. account. Excluding Chrysler, the U.S. had organic growth of 6.8%.
International revenue increased $171.6 million or about 12.9%. FX increased revenue by $37 million or 2.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $47 million, and organic growth was 6.6% or about $87 million.
Internationally, in Asia, we had strong performances in China, Singapore, Australia and South Korea. And as I said before, Japan was negative. In Europe, we had good performances in the U.K., France, Russia, Poland and Spain. However, in the other so-called PIIG countries, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Greece, they continued to be negative, although less negative than last year. And Latin America continues to perform well across the region. 
Slide 7 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter. And again, this quarter, we experienced positive growth across all of the industry segments that we serve. In the auto industry, while we had low single-digit growth overall, excluding Chrysler, it was up over 26%. In the financial services, technology, healthcare and pharma, food and beverage and consumer products segments led our growth this quarter, each having double-digit growth rates.
Turning to Slide 8, cash flow. Our cash performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $160 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash during the quarter were dividends to our common shareholders, which totaled $58 million; dividends paid to our non-controlling interests shareholders of $25 million; acquisitions, including earn-out payments, and the purchase of additional interest in controlled subsidiaries, net of proceeds from the sale of investments of approximately $216 million; and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and the related tax benefits, totaled approximately $302 million.
Slide 9 shows our current capital structure. Including changes in working capital, our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of about $350 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven predominantly by our stock repurchase activity, which has totaled $1.2 billion over the last 12 months.
And our total debt was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from year end and up about $1 billion year-over-year due to the issuance of the 2020 bonds last August. Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.8x, and net debt-to-EBITDA is just under 1x. Our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 11.9x. Our liquidity continues to be very strong as well. We finished the quarter with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities, totaling about $3.5 billion. We had additional uncommitted facilities available, totaling another $670 million. 
And finally, on Slide 11, where all the numbers come together, both our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.7% and 23.3%, respectively, both reapproaching our 20-year averages.
And with that, I'm going to now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

For Europe, Europe's I guess playing out over the last few quarters, and this quarter, kind of as I expected. The larger markets recovered earlier, keeping in mind we have a fairly substantial base of multinational clients that are going to focus their resources on what they believe are important markets. So France, Germany, and the U.K. all did fairly well last year, and we think will continue. The smaller markets across Europe, they were hurt by their local economies and I'm sure are probably less of a focus for some of the multinational clients. We felt that those countries that were significantly negative would be, at a minimum, less negative. So they're going to have less of an impact or at least less of a negative impact. So with that reduction, our European growth would improve, basically, is what continue to happen this quarter. The larger markets performed fairly well, and I pointed out the PIGS markets, Spain is actually positive for us this quarter. The other markets were negative but they were less negative than they were last year. So the European growth rates, overall, improved. Trying to get to some of your other questions, you talked about margins by discipline. We've pointed out for a while the Media business, in general, has higher margins and some of our field marketing, shopper marketing businesses have lower margins, field marketing especially, but they have very good returns on equity. They have very little capital committed to those businesses, so they're, frankly, excellent businesses from a return perspective, but their overall EBIT margins are a bit lower.

Obviously, we're not trying to dispose of our higher margin businesses, so we do expect some benefit over time from selling those businesses. As far as going back to sort of Bill's question on dispositions with organic growth, the way we calculate organic growth, the revenues from the companies we disposed of would be in that base. To the extent those companies would've had flat growth, it wouldn't have affected us if they would have had negative growth, not having the business -- and we wouldn't have that negative revenue piece but the base is still in it. And we're talking a very small amount of revenue here, annualized revenue, about $120 million, is what's been disposed of to date. So I don't think you can have really much of an impact.

We're pleased to announce strong operating results for the second quarter. It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Despite the challenging worldwide economic backdrop, our results reflect our continued focus on disciplined growth by enhancing the capabilities in the performance of our portfolio of agencies around the world. 
While every market is different, we remain consistent in our focus of driving profitable and sustainable growth. The result is we believe we are executing against our 2011 business performance objectives, and we're improving our market position for tomorrow. I want to highlight several areas this morning.
In the second quarter, organic growth was up 7.2% over the same period in 2010. Growth was particularly strong in our advertising and CRM businesses. Geographically, the strongest performing areas were the U.S., Asia and South America. Second, we're continuing to execute against our strategic objective of building a deeper presence in rapidly growing markets. 
In the second quarter, we announced the creation of a new business unit, Omnicom Greater China. This unit will enhance our ability to maximize global marketing and brand building opportunities for our Chinese and multinational clients.
The group already operates in more than 40 agencies in over 30 locations covering 130 cities in Greater China, and the new operating structure will allow for greater coordination and integration. Looking to the second half, we expect to increase our acquisition activities in other high-growth evolving markets.
Third, we continue to make progress towards our goal of returning margins to 2007 levels by 2012, which began in earnest late last year. Randy will take you through more detail of our margin for the second quarter a bit later. However, we began to see the effects of our strategic and repositioning activities on our margins during the quarter and expect the margin improvements to continue during the second half of the year and into 2012.
Although we're not finished yet with our review of all the companies in our portfolio, and we still have a little bit more work to do, we do not expect to incur any significant charges for the remainder of the year. Finally, our agencies continue to create groundbreaking, award-winning work that deliver value for our clients. At the international Festival of creativity in Cannes held in June, our network and agencies once again demonstrated their leadership by garnering top honors with BBDO and DDB ranking among the top 3 networks worldwide. 
BBDO is the number one -ranked network for the fifth year in a row and took home 3 Grand Prix awards. The most awarded to any agency network at the festival. And for the first time, they received the network global creative effectiveness award, BBDO in Brazil was also named agency of the year for the second time in a row. And DDB included. Now let me touch on a few more specifics.
Across the globe, our business has remained resilient despite some significant challenges facing individual markets in Europe and the continued challenges facing Japan. In the U.S., we saw very strong organic growth, which was 8.1% versus the second quarter of last year. Though the job and the pace of economic improvement is more negative than it was last quarter, and we remain concerned about the failure to complete a debt sealing deal, we believe that this situation will improve over the coming weeks and months. And as a result, we expect to see moderate growth in the U.S. throughout the rest of 2011.
In Europe, the picture is largely positive. Growth remained strong in the U.K. and in most European countries inside and outside the Eurozone. Overall, organic growth in Eurozone was positive despite a year-over-year difficult comparison in France and the loss of an important client in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe, outside of the Eurozone, we saw very solid positive growth.
In Asia, we continue to see double-digit growth even as Japan continues to recover from the tragic events of the first quarter, which resulted in negative growth in that country. And in the Middle East and South America, we also experienced very strong double-digit organic growth.
Thanks in part to the strong growth in developing markets, together with new investments in these markets, we continue to diversify our businesses globally. Non-U.S. revenues for the quarter increased to 49% from 46% in the year-ago period, even as the U.S. continues to grow very, very significantly. And revenues from markets other than the U.S., the U.K. and the Eurozone represent almost 22% of our revenue in the quarter compared to 18% in the prior year.
By industry, our growth is coming from across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category with audio, financial services, technology and travel and entertainment having performed very, very well. Turning to our cash flow, we remain committed to maximizing returns by utilizing free cash flow and cash on hand for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
While acquisition activity was slower during the quarter than in the past several quarters, we continue to see a broad range of well priced opportunities, and we would expect activity to pick up again in the second half of the year with a continued focus on expanding our presence in rapidly growing markets.
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.6 million shares for a total of 13.4 million shares year-to-date. In closing, we're pleased with the performance of our business and the progress on our strategic priorities. We understand that our clients are looking for strategic partners who can not only create great work but can help them address critical business challenges, both globally and locally. 
With this in mind, we continue to develop our management teams and seek leaders and innovators around the world to help us optimize our portfolio and drive profitable and sustainable growth. Together, our strategies will allow us to continue to serve our clients across geographies and disciplines in the face of changes in the geographic landscape and rapidly evolving technologies.
I'll now turn the call back to Randy who'll take us through the numbers and then we'll be available to answer your questions. Thank you."

It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Our agencies performed very well, being recognized by their clients with more than $1 billion in new business wins again this quarter, as well as being recognized by their peers in the numer",1376,"Thank you, John. It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Our agencies performed very well, being recognized by their clients with more than $1 billion in new business wins again this quarter, as well as being recognized by their peers in the numerous creative shows that have taken place this year around the world.
And not to be left out, our treasury group was awarded the Adam Smith award for best practice and innovation for 2011. In the second quarter, we continued to make solid progress towards the goals we set for ourselves for 2011 and 2012. In spite of continued uncertainties in the domestic and global economies, Omnicom recorded strong revenue growth in most of our major markets and all of our targeted of growth markets, as well as across the full breadth of industries that we serve. 
Our agencies also made excellent progress in leveraging our people and resources more effectively and managing our cost more efficiently. We achieved meaningful margin improvements this quarter and continued to track while towards the margin target we set for ourselves for 2012.
Now turning to the details of our financial performance. With very strong organic growth and a fairly significant positive FX impact, our year-over-year revenue grew 14.7%, bringing revenue for the quarter up to $3.49 billion. Our reported EBITDA increased 18.4% to $511 million. Our resulting EBITDA margin was up substantially to 14.7%, which was about a 50 basis point improvement from last year. 
It's also worth noting that this margin improvement was net of what was a negative impact from FX of almost 20 basis points. And our reported operating income or EBIT increased 17.5% to $488 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $27.6 million, up $3.9 million from Q2 of last year and down about $4.5 million from Q1 this year. 
The year-over-year increase primarily reflected the interest on the $1 billion tenure year senior notes issued last August, partially offset by the positive effect of the interest rate swaps we entered into on our 2016 senior notes and the benefits of our strong operating cash performance. On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. Basically in line with our expected operating rate for 2011, which is between 34.2% and 34.4%. As a result, net income for the quarter increased a very strong 13.1% to $275 million. 
And when combined with the year-over-year share reduction of 7.6%, diluted earnings per share on the quarter increased substantially to $0.96 per share or a 21.5% increase.
Turning to Page 3, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. Growth with regard to FX on a year-over-year basis, the dollar continued to weaken versus most of our major currencies. The net result was a positive FX impact on revenue for the quarter of $168 million or about 5.5%. As I mentioned before, the FX impact had a negative impact on our EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive around 4% in Q3 and then about 2% in Q4. Revenue growth from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $60 million in the quarter or about 2%. The second quarter represented the first full quarter impact of the acquisitions of the Clemenger Group in Australia and New Zealand and Communispace in the U.S., as well as several dispositions, primarily in the U.S.
There continue to be several additional dispositions that we are working on that we expect to complete before year end. And as always, there are a number of acquisitions that are being reviewed and considered.
But beyond the organic growth, we had another very strong quarter. Our agencies are doing very well in new business front and on expanding the scope of services they are providing clients, especially with respect to the use of new technologies. As I mentioned, we continue to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve, and we finally cycled on the loss of Chrysler this quarter. As a result, organic revenue growth was a very strong 7.2% or $218 million.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 46% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 54%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising continue to take the lead with 10% organic growth while Marketing Services was up 4.9%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 7.5% organic growth. And within this sector, direct and field marketing, branding and research all had outstanding performances. Public Relations had organic growth of 1.3% and Specialty Communications decreased by about 1.2%.
On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 51% U.S. and 49% international. In the United States, revenue increased $127 million or 7.8%. Acquisitions net of dispositions reduced revenue by about $5 million with 0.03% and organic growth continue to be very strong at 8.1% or about $132 million.
International revenue increased $319 million or 22.7%. A little more than half that growth or $168 million was a result of FX changes. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $65 million or 4.7%, and organic growth although very mixed by country, was overall quite strong and up 6.1% or about $86 million. 
Internationally in Asia, we had stronger performances in China, Australia, South Korea Singapore and India. Japan was modestly negative, with several of our agencies feeling the effects of the earthquake and tsunami.
In Europe, results continue to be very mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well. France was flat, and Germany was up modestly. Elsewhere in Europe, we had good performances in the Czech Republic in Belgium. In the so-called peak markets, organic growth in the aggregate are far better than last year, was only marginally positive with Spain, Portugal and Italy performing okay and Ireland and Greece continuing to be negative. Additionally, Latin America and the Middle East continue to have strong double-digit organic growth.
Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter, and again, this quarter, we experienced positive growth across all of the industry segments that we serve. The strongest sectors for us were financial services, technology, travel and entertainment, retail and now that we cycle through the loss of Chrysler, our auto business was up year-over-year in the quarter, almost 20%.
Turning to Slide 7, cash flow. Our cash performance in the first half of the year was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $470 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. The primary uses of cash year-to-date were dividends to our common shareholders which totals about $129 million. 
Dividends paid to our non-conforming interest shareholders of about $50 million. Acquisitions net of the proceeds from the sale of investments was $277 million and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share blends and their related tax benefits totaled $557 million.
Combined, this resulted in a net use of cash year-to-date of approximately $543 million. Slide 8 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion, which was an increase of about $550 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven predominantly by a return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, which for the last 12 months, totaled about $1.5 billion and that's net of the stock issuance proceeds. And our total debt was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from the end of the first quarter and up about $1 billion year-over-year through the issuance of the 2020 bonds last August.
Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.8x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.2x. Our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 11.9x.
And finally on Slide 9, where all the numbers come together, our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.5% and 24.5%, respectively. Both improved from last quarter and both remain consistent with our 10-year historic averages. And with that, I would now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

But there's certainly nothing of major significance. As far as the breakout of where our operating leverage came from, we had operating leverage everywhere. What came through in the quarter was on I'll say some of our fixed cost and certainly make fairly good progress on rent, depreciation and those types of items that are in control of the cost, making reasonable progress on the salary side as well. That gets offset a little bit by incentive accruals as well. Incentive accruals have been up for the first half. So it creates a bit of a balance. I think we're largely, and you said kind of how we're tracking, I think we're largely on track to where we wanted to be from a margin perspective coming to the year. I was a little bit surprised with the impact that FX on margins. Obviously our domestic margins are a little bit higher than our international margins overall, and with the normal sort of 2% or 3% plus or minus FX, you don't really notice it this quarter with the 5.5% impact from FX, we actually saw it in the margins a little bit almost 20 basis points. So I think overall, we're tracking pretty well. I think we pretty happy with our progress. Certainly have an awful lot of people in the organization, if not everybody, focused on it."

And financial services and auto were the 2 categories were the strongest I believe looking at your slides, which I would sort of describe is kind of cyclical sectors. So you could look at the quarter and sort of say maybe we're seeing continued acceleration off of the prior year's pullback in major corporate spending or maybe you go look at the other way and say your business tend to be a little later cycle given just the timing of how contracts work and so this is reflective of what we've seen in the last 12 months.

Someone asked a question about social media, I extended and talked about new technologies. Those new technologies are ways for our agencies to provide more value enhanced services to existing clients. So I think all of that is helping to lead those growth rates. It's very difficult for us to know how much of our growth is a rebound off of a maybe what was potentially a lower than normal number in prior periods and how much of it is economic recovery. And how much of it frankly is growth of the services with our clients as opposed to new business. So all of those things are certainly helping us right now.

We're pleased to announce strong operating results for the second quarter. It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Despite the challenging worldwide economic backdrop, our results reflect our continued focus on",1043,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We're pleased to announce strong operating results for the second quarter. It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Despite the challenging worldwide economic backdrop, our results reflect our continued focus on disciplined growth by enhancing the capabilities in the performance of our portfolio of agencies around the world. 
While every market is different, we remain consistent in our focus of driving profitable and sustainable growth. The result is we believe we are executing against our 2011 business performance objectives, and we're improving our market position for tomorrow. I want to highlight several areas this morning.
In the second quarter, organic growth was up 7.2% over the same period in 2010. Growth was particularly strong in our advertising and CRM businesses. Geographically, the strongest performing areas were the U.S., Asia and South America. Second, we're continuing to execute against our strategic objective of building a deeper presence in rapidly growing markets. 
In the second quarter, we announced the creation of a new business unit, Omnicom Greater China. This unit will enhance our ability to maximize global marketing and brand building opportunities for our Chinese and multinational clients.
The group already operates in more than 40 agencies in over 30 locations, covering 130 cities in Greater China, and the new operating structure will allow for greater coordination and integration. Looking to the second half, we expect to increase our acquisition activities in other high-growth developing markets.
Third, we continue to make progress towards our goal of returning margins to 2007 levels by 2012, which began in earnest late last year. Randy will take you through more details of our margin for the second quarter a bit later. However, we began to see the effects of our strategic and repositioning activities on our margins during the quarter, and expect the margin improvements to continue during the second half of the year and into 2012.
Although we're not finished yet with our review of all the companies in our portfolio, and we still have a little bit more work to do, we do not expect to incur any significant charges for the remainder of the year. Finally, our agencies continue to create groundbreaking, award-winning work that delivers value for our clients. At the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes held in June, our networks and agencies once again demonstrated their leadership by garnering top honors with BBDO and DDB ranking among the top 3 networks worldwide. 
BBDO is the number one ranked network for the fifth year in a row and took home 3 Grand Prix awards. The most awarded to any agency network at the festival. And for the first time, they received the network Global Creative Effectiveness award, BBDO Almap in Brazil was also named Agency of the Year for the second time in a row. And DDB start wins included, a Titanium line. Now let me touch on a few more specifics.
Across the globe, our business has remained resilient despite some significant challenges facing individual markets in Europe and the continued challenges facing Japan. In the U.S., we saw a very strong organic growth, which was 8.1% versus the second quarter of last year. Though the job picture and the pace of economic improvement is more negative than it was last quarter, and we remain concerned about the failure to complete a debt ceiling deal, we believe that this situation will improve over the coming weeks and months. And as a result, we expect to see a moderate growth in the U.S. throughout the rest of 2011.
In Europe, the picture is largely positive. Growth remained strong in the U.K. and in most European countries inside and outside the Eurozone. Overall, organic growth in Eurozone was positive despite a year-over-year difficult comparison in France and the loss of an important client in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe, outside of the Eurozone, we saw a very solid positive growth.
In Asia, we continue to see double-digit growth even as Japan continues to recover from the tragic events of the first quarter, which resulted in negative growth in that country. And in the Middle East and South America, we also experienced very strong double-digit organic growth.
Thanks in part to the strong growth in developing markets, together with new investments in these markets, we continue to diversify our businesses globally. Non-U.S. revenues for the quarter increased to 49% from 46% in the year-ago period, even as the U.S. continues to grow very, very significantly. And revenues from markets other than the U.S., the U.K. and the Eurozone represent almost 22% of our revenue in the quarter compared to 18% in the prior year.
By industry, our growth is coming from across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category with auto, financial services, technology and travel and entertainment having performed very, very well. 
Turning to our cash flow. We remain committed to maximizing returns by utilizing free cash flow and cash on hand for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
While acquisition activity was slower during the quarter than in the past several quarters, we continue to see a broad range of well priced opportunities, and we would expect activity to pick up again in the second half of the year with a continued focus on expanding our presence in rapidly growing markets.
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.6 million shares for a total of 13.4 million shares year-to-date. In closing, we're pleased with the performance of our business and the progress on our strategic priorities. We understand that our clients are looking for strategic partners who can not only create great work but can help them address critical business challenges, both globally and locally. 
With this in mind, we continue to develop our management teams and seek leaders and innovators around the world to help us optimize our portfolio and drive profitable and sustainable growth. Together, our strategies will allow us to continue to serve our clients across geographies and disciplines in the face of changes in the geographic landscape and rapidly evolving technologies.
I'll now turn the call back to Randy who'll take us through the numbers and then we'll be available to answer your questions. Thank you."

It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Our agencies performed very well, being recognized by their clients with more than $1 billion in new business wins again this quarter, as well as being recognized by their peers in the numerous creative shows that have taken place this year around the world.
And not to be left out, our treasury group was awarded the Adam Smith Award for best practice and innovation for 2011. In the second quarter, we continued to make solid progress towards the goals we set for ourselves for 2011 and 2012. In spite of continued uncertainties in the domestic and global economies, Omnicom recorded strong organic revenue growth in most of our major markets and all of our targeted growth markets, as well as across the full breadth of industries that we serve. 
Our agencies also made excellent progress in leveraging our people and resources more effectively and managing our cost more efficiently. We achieved meaningful margin improvements this quarter and continued to track well towards the margin target we set for ourselves for 2012.
Now turning to the details of our financial performance. With very strong organic growth and a fairly significant positive FX impact, our year-over-year revenue grew 14.7%, bringing revenue for the quarter up to $3.49 billion. Our reported EBITDA increased 18.4% to $511 million. Our resulting EBITDA margin was up substantially to 14.7%, which was about a 50 basis point improvement from last year. 
It's also worth noting that this margin improvement was net of what was a negative impact from FX of almost 20 basis points. And our reported operating income or EBIT increased 17.5% to $488 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $27.6 million, up $3.9 million from Q2 of last year and down about $4.5 million from Q1 this year. 
The year-over-year increase primarily reflected the interest on the $1 billion 10-year senior notes we issued last August, partially offset by the positive effect of the interest rate swaps we entered into on our 2016 senior notes and the benefits of our strong operating cash performance. On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. Basically in line with our expected operating rate for 2011, which is between 34.2% and 34.4%. As a result, net income for the quarter increased a very strong 13.1% to $275 million. 
And when combined with the year-over-year share reduction of 7.6%, diluted earnings per share on the quarter increased substantially to $0.96 per share or a 21.5% increase.
Turning to Page 3. We take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX on a year-over-year basis, the dollar continued to weaken versus most of our major currencies. The net result was a positive FX impact on revenue for the quarter of $168 million or about 5.5%. As I mentioned before, the FX impact had a negative impact on our EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive around 4% in Q3 and then about 2% in Q4. Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $60 million in the quarter or about 2%. The second quarter represented the first full quarter impact of the acquisitions of the Clemenger Group in Australia and New Zealand and Communispace in the U.S., as well as several dispositions, primarily in the U.S.
There continue to be several additional dispositions that we are working on that we expect to complete before year end. And as always, there are a number of acquisitions that are being reviewed and considered.
With regard to organic growth, we had another very strong quarter. Our agencies are doing very well in new business front and on expanding the scope of services they are providing clients, especially with respect to the use of new technologies. As I mentioned, we continue to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve, and we finally cycled on the loss of Chrysler this quarter. As a result, organic revenue growth was a very strong 7.2% or $218 million.
Turning to our mix of business. Brand advertising accounted for 46% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 54%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising continue to take the lead with 10% organic growth while Marketing Services was up 4.9%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 7.5% organic growth. And within this sector, direct and field marketing, branding and research all had outstanding performances. Public Relations had organic growth of 1.3% and Specialty Communications decreased by about 1.2%.
On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 51% U.S. and 49% international. In the United States, revenue increased $127 million or 7.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $5 million with 0.3% and organic growth continue to be very strong at 8.1% or about $132 million.
International revenue increased $319 million or 22.7%. A little more than half that growth or $168 million was a result of FX changes. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $65 million or 4.7%, and organic growth, although very mixed by country, was overall quite strong and up 6.1% or about $86 million. 
Internationally in Asia, we had stronger performances in China, Australia, South Korea Singapore and India. Japan was modestly negative, with several of our agencies feeling the effects of the earthquake and tsunami.
In Europe, results continue to be very mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well. France was flat, and Germany was up modestly. Elsewhere in Europe, we had good performances in the Czech Republic and Belgium. In the so-called peak markets, organic growth in the aggregate are far better than last year, was only marginally positive with Spain, Portugal and Italy performing okay and Ireland and Greece continuing to be negative. Additionally, Latin America and the Middle East continue to have strong double-digit organic growth.
Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter, and again, this quarter, we experienced positive growth across all of the industry segments that we serve. The strongest sectors for us were financial services, technology, travel and entertainment, retail and now that we cycle through the loss of Chrysler, our auto business was up year-over-year in the quarter, almost 20%.
Turning to Slide 7, cash flow. Our cash performance in the first half of the year was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $470 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. The primary uses of cash, year-to-date, were dividends to our common shareholders which totals about $129 million. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders of about $50 million. Acquisitions, net of the proceeds from the sale of investments, was $277 million; and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and the related tax benefits, totaled $557 million. Combined, this resulted in a net use of cash year-to-date of approximately $543 million. 
Slide 8 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion, which was an increase of about $550 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven predominantly by a return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, which for the last 12 months, totaled about $1.5 billion and that's net of the stock issuance proceeds. And our total debt was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from the end of the first quarter and up about $1 billion year-over-year through the issuance of the 2020 bonds last August.
Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.8x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.2x. Our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 11.9x.
And finally on Slide 9, where all the numbers come together, our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.5% and 24.5%, respectively. Both improved from last quarter and both remain consistent with our 10-year historic averages. And with that, I would now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

So certainly, making fairly good progress on rent, depreciation and those types of items that are in control of the cost, making reasonable progress on the salary side as well. That gets offset a little bit by incentive accruals as well. Incentive accruals have been up for the first half. So it creates a bit of a balance. I think we're largely, and you said kind of how we're tracking, I think we're largely on track to where we wanted to be from a margin perspective coming to the year. I was a little bit surprised with the impact that FX had on margins. Obviously, our domestic margins are a little bit higher than our international margins, overall, and with the normal sort of 2% or 3% plus or minus FX. You don't really notice it this quarter with the 5.5% impact from FX, we actually saw it in the margins a little bit almost 20 basis points. So I think, overall, we're tracking pretty well.

And financial services and auto were the 2 categories that were the strongest I believe looking at your slides, which I would sort of describe is kind of cyclical sectors. So you could look at the quarter and sort of say maybe we're seeing continued acceleration off of the prior year's pullback in major corporate spending or maybe you go look at the other way and say your business tend to be a little later cycle, given just the timing of how contracts work and so this is reflective of what we've seen in the last 12 months.

Those new technologies are ways for our agencies to provide more value enhanced services to existing clients. So I think all of that is helping to lead those growth rates. It's very difficult for us to know how much of our growth is a rebound off of a maybe what was potentially a lower than normal number in prior periods and how much of it is economic recovery.

We're pleased to announce strong operating results for the second quarter. It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Despite the challenging worldwide economic backdrop, our results reflect our continued focus on",1042,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We're pleased to announce strong operating results for the second quarter. It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Despite the challenging worldwide economic backdrop, our results reflect our continued focus on disciplined growth by enhancing the capabilities in the performance of our portfolio of agencies around the world. 
While every market is different, we remain consistent in our focus of driving profitable and sustainable growth. The result is we believe we are executing against our 2011 business performance objectives, and we're improving our market position for tomorrow. I want to highlight several areas this morning.
In the second quarter, organic growth was up 7.2% over the same period in 2010. Growth was particularly strong in our advertising and CRM businesses. Geographically, the strongest performing areas were the U.S., Asia and South America. Second, we're continuing to execute against our strategic objective of building a deeper presence in rapidly growing markets. 
In the second quarter, we announced the creation of a new business unit, Omnicom Greater China. This unit will enhance our ability to maximize global marketing and brand building opportunities for our Chinese and multinational clients.
The group already operates in more than 40 agencies in over 30 locations, covering 130 cities in Greater China, and the new operating structure will allow for greater coordination and integration. Looking to the second half, we expect to increase our acquisition activities in other high-growth developing markets.
Third, we continue to make progress towards our goal of returning margins to 2007 levels by 2012, which began in earnest late last year. Randy will take you through more details of our margin for the second quarter a bit later. However, we began to see the effects of our strategic and repositioning activities on our margins during the quarter, and expect the margin improvement to continue during the second half of the year and into 2012.
Although we're not finished yet with our review of all the companies in our portfolio, and we still have a little bit more work to do, we do not expect to incur any significant charges for the remainder of the year. Finally, our agencies continue to create groundbreaking, award-winning work that delivers value for our clients. At the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes held in June, our networks and agencies once again demonstrated their leadership by garnering top honors with BBDO and DDB ranking among the top 3 networks worldwide. 
BBDO is the #1 ranked network for the fifth year in a row and took home 3 Grand Prix awards, the most awarded to any agency network at the festival. And for the first time, they received the network Global Creative Effectiveness award. BBDO Almap in Brazil was also named Agency of the Year for the second time in a row, and DDB's top wins included a Titanium line. Now let me touch on a few more specifics.
Across the globe, our businesses remain resilient despite some significant challenges facing individual markets in Europe and the continued challenges facing Japan. In the U.S., we saw very strong organic growth, which was 8.1% versus the second quarter of last year. Though the job picture and the pace of economic improvement is more negative than it was last quarter, and we remain concerned about the failure to complete a debt ceiling deal, we believe that this situation will improve over the coming weeks and months. And as a result, we expect to see a moderate growth in the U.S. throughout the rest of 2011.
In Europe, the picture is largely positive. Growth remains strong in the U.K. and in most European countries inside and outside the Eurozone. Overall, organic growth in the Eurozone was positive despite a year-over-year difficult comparison in France and the loss of an important client in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, in the rest of Europe outside of the Eurozone, we saw a very solid positive growth.
In Asia, we continue to see double-digit growth even as Japan continues to recover from the tragic events of the first quarter, which resulted in negative growth in that country. And in the Middle East and South America, we also experienced very strong double-digit organic growth.
Thanks in part to the strong growth in developing markets, together with new investments in these markets, we continue to diversify our businesses globally. Non-U.S. revenues for the quarter increased to 49% from 46% in the year-ago period, even as the U.S. continues to grow very, very significantly. And revenues from markets other than the U.S., the U.K. and the Eurozone represent almost 22% of our revenue in the quarter compared to 18% in the prior year.
By industry, our growth is coming from across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category with auto, financial services, technology and travel and entertainment having performed very, very well. 
Turning to our cash flow. We remain committed to maximizing returns by utilizing free cash flow and cash on hand for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
While acquisition activity was slower during the quarter than in the past several quarters, we continue to see a broad range of well-priced opportunities, and we would expect activity to pick up again in the second half of the year with a continued focus on expanding our presence in rapidly growing markets.
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.6 million shares for a total of 13.4 million shares year-to-date. In closing, we're pleased with the performance of our business and the progress on our strategic priorities. We understand that our clients are looking for strategic partners who can not only create great work but can help them address critical business challenges, both globally and locally. 
With this in mind, we continue to develop our management teams and seek leaders and innovators around the world to help us optimize our portfolio and drive profitable and sustainable growth. Together, our strategies will allow us to continue to serve our clients across geographies and disciplines in the face of the changes in the geographic landscape and rapidly evolving technologies.
I'll now turn the call back to Randy who'll take us through the numbers and then we'll be available to answer your questions. Thank you."

It was an excellent quarter all the way around.

It was an excellent quarter all the way around. Our agencies performed very well, being recognized by their clients with more than $1 billion in new business wins again this quarter, as well as being recognized by their peers in the numerous creative shows that have taken place this year around the world.
And not to be left out, our treasury group was awarded the Adam Smith Award for best practice and innovation for 2011. In the second quarter, we continue to make solid progress towards the goals we set for ourselves for 2011 and 2012. In spite of continued uncertainties in the domestic and global economies, Omnicom recorded strong organic revenue growth in most of our major markets and all of our targeted growth markets, as well as across the full breadth of industries that we serve. 
Our agencies also made excellent progress in leveraging our people and resources more effectively and managing our costs more efficiently. We achieved meaningful margin improvements this quarter and continue to track well towards the margin target we set for ourselves for 2012.
Now turning to the details of our financial performance. With very strong organic growth and a fairly significant positive FX impact, our year-over-year revenue grew 14.7%, bringing revenue for the quarter up to $3.49 billion. Our reported EBITDA increased 18.4% to $511 million. Our resulting EBITDA margin was up substantially to 14.7%, which was about a 50 basis point improvement from last year. it's also worth noting that this margin improvement was net of what was a negative impact from FX of almost 20 basis points. And our reported operating income or EBIT increased 17.5% to $488 million. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $27.6 million, up $3.9 million from Q2 of last year and down about $4.5 million from Q1 this year. 
The year-over-year increase primarily reflected the interest on the $1 billion 10-year senior note we issued last August, partially offset by the positive effect of the interest rate swaps we entered into on our 2016 senior notes and the benefits of our strong operating cash performance. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. Basically in line with our expected operating rate for 2011, which is between 34.2% and 34.4%. As a result, net income for the quarter increased a very strong 13.1% to $275 million. And when combined with the year-over-year share reduction of 7.6%, diluted earnings per share on the quarter increased substantially to $0.96 per share or a 21.5% increase.
Turning to Page 3. We take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX on a year-over-year basis, the dollar continued to weaken versus most of our major currencies. The net result was a positive FX impact on revenue for the quarter of $168 million or about 5.5%. As I mentioned before, the FX impact had a negative impact on our EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive around 4% in Q3 and then about 2% in Q4. Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $60 million in the quarter or about 2%. The second quarter represented the first full quarter impact of the acquisitions of the Clemenger Group in Australia and New Zealand and Communispace in the U.S., as well as several dispositions, primarily in the U.S.
There continue to be several additional dispositions that we are working on that we expect to complete before year end. And as always, there are a number of acquisitions that are being reviewed and considered.
With regard to organic growth, we had another very strong quarter. Our agencies are doing very well in the new business front and on expanding the scope of services they are providing clients, especially with respect to the use of new technologies. As I mentioned, we continue to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve, and we finally cycled on the loss of Chrysler this quarter. As a result, organic revenue growth was a very strong 7.2% or $218 million.
Turning to our mix of business. Brand advertising accounted for 46% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 54%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising continue to take the lead with 10% organic growth while Marketing Services was up 4.9%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 7.5% organic growth. And within this sector, direct and field marketing, branding and research all had outstanding performances. Public Relations had organic growth of 1.3% and Specialty Communications decreased by about 1.2%.
On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 51% U.S. and 49% international. In the United States, revenue increased $127 million or 7.8%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by about $5 million or 0.3%, and organic growth continue to be very strong at 8.1% or about $132 million.
International revenue increased $319 million or 22.7%. A little more than half that growth or $168 million was a result of FX changes. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $65 million or 4.7%, and organic growth, although very mixed by country, was overall quite strong and up 6.1% or about $86 million. 
Internationally in Asia, we had stronger performances in China, Australia, South Korea Singapore and India. Japan was modestly negative, with several of our agencies feeling the effect of the earthquake and tsunami.
In Europe, results continue to be very mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well. France was flat, and Germany was up modestly. Elsewhere in Europe, we had good performances in the Czech Republic and Belgium. In the so-called peak markets, organic growth in the aggregate are far better than last year, was only marginally positive with Spain, Portugal and Italy performing okay and Ireland and Greece continuing to be negative. Additionally, Latin America and the Middle East continue to have strong double-digit organic growth.
Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter, and again, this quarter, we experienced positive growth across all of the industry segments that we serve. The strongest sectors for us were financial services, technology, travel and entertainment, retail and now that we've cycled through the loss of Chrysler, our auto business was up year-over-year in the quarter almost 20%.
Turning to Slide 7, cash flow. Our cash performance in the first half of the year was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $470 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash, year-to-date, were dividends to our common shareholders which totaled about $129 million; dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders of about $50 million; acquisitions, net of the proceeds from the sale of investments was $277 million; and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans and their related tax benefits totaled $557 million. Combined, this resulted in a net use of cash year-to-date of approximately $543 million. 
Slide 8 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion, which was an increase of about $550 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven predominantly by a return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, which for the last 12 months, totaled about $1.5 billion and that's net of the stock issuance proceeds. And our total debt was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from the end of the first quarter and up about $1 billion year-over-year through the issuance of the 2020 bonds last August.
Our leverage ratio, or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio, stands at 1.8x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.2x. Our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 11.9x.
And finally on Slide 9, where all the numbers come together, our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.5% and 24.5%, respectively. Both improved from last quarter, and both remain consistent with our 10-year historic averages. And with that, I'm going to now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

What came through in the quarter was on I'll say some of our fixed cost. We're certainly making fairly good progress on rent, depreciation and those types of items that are in control of the cost, making reasonable progress on the salary side as well. That gets offset a little bit by incentive accruals as well. Incentive accruals have been up for the first half. So it creates a bit of a balance. I think we're largely, and you said kind of how we're tracking, I think we're largely on track to where we wanted to be from a margin perspective coming through the year. I was a little bit surprised with the impact that FX had on margins. Obviously, our domestic margins are a little bit higher than our international margins, overall, and with the normal sort of 2% or 3% plus or minus FX you don't really notice it. This quarter with the 5.5% impact from FX, we actually saw it in the margins a little bit. It was almost 20 basis points. So I think, overall, we're tracking pretty well.

And I look at the drivers of it, and branded advertising was up, 10%, I think you said. I know that's not a U.S. number but still, that's an impressive leading growth category. And financial services and auto were the 2 categories that were the strongest I believe looking at your slides, which I would sort of describe is kind of cyclical sectors. So you could look at the quarter and sort of say maybe we're seeing continued acceleration off of the prior year's pullback in major corporate spending, or maybe you could look at it the other way and say your business tend to be a little later cycle, given just the timing of how contracts work and so this is reflective of what we've seen in the last 12 months.

96161,141514564,173168,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with you our thoughts on the progress against our key initiatives. Let me start with our performance for the quarter",950,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with you our thoughts on the progress against our key initiatives. Let me start with our performance for the quarter.
The third quarter reflected very strong operating performance, including significant organic growth and continued margin improvement. Organic growth was up 7.2% over the same period of 2010. Growth was particularly strong in our advertising and CRM businesses, and geographically, all of our major markets experienced solid organic growth. This performance is particularly notable given the worsening of economic and capital market conditions since our last earnings call. We are watching these events carefully to anticipate the impact they may have on our business.
Given this backdrop, our agency management teams are balancing effective growth strategies with a continued eye towards controlling their expense structures. By remaining cautious about the economy, we are encouraged by our discussions with our clients. Focused on investing in their brands and differentiating their products and services and are seeking agency partners that can divide innovative ideas that help them navigate to an increasingly complex marketing environment. We believe that our agencies have the best talent in the business and help us to compete more effectively.
During the quarter, we also continue to execute on several of our strategic initiatives. We continue to make solid progress on our portfolio review and other initiatives to improve our margin performance. The margins for the quarter reflected continued improvement. While there's still work to be done, we remain on course towards achieving our goal of returning to 2007 margins by 2012. Randy will discuss our margin performance in more detail later in the call.
We also continue to execute against our strategic priority of building a deeper presence in rapidly growing markets and disciplines while still growing our business in the developed markets. During the quarter, we closed transactions in India, Vietnam and New Zealand, expanded our offerings in healthcare through the acquisition of synergy in the U.K. Today, over 22% of our revenue is from Asia and Latin America and other rapidly developing markets from 18.5% this time last year.
While these acquisitions will further solidify our presence in the developing markets, our agencies in Asia were once again recognized as leaders for creating groundbreaking award-winning work that deliveries value for our clients. 
In September, Omnicom Group agencies captured the top 2 network of the year rankings at the Spike Asia Advertising Festival in Singapore. The second consecutive year DDB was named network of the year and BBDO took second. The DDB group Singapore and communications placed second and third for agency of the year. Omnicom agencies also won 4 Grand Prix. 
Turning to some of our digital initiatives, our distance-learning digital education program, which we discussed at the beginning of the year has begun to be rolled out in the fourth quarter. We have always recognized that each of our agencies must develop digital skill sets in the respective disciplines, and they're meeting these demands extremely well. The program will further enhance the development of our talents.
Overall, we are very pleased with both the financial performance of our business and the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. Now let me touch on a few more specifics points about our performance during the quarter.
In the U.S., we saw organic growth of 5.8% versus the third quarter of last year, driven by our brand advertising and CRM businesses. Growth was very strong in the U.K., and almost all of our agencies had solid organic growth. In Continental Europe, our results were quite positive in spite of the region's sovereign debt problems. Germany and France experienced solid growth while the Netherlands is negatively impacted by a client loss in that country but that client was retained by another Omnicom agency in the U.S. We also saw strong performance in Eastern Europe, including Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Southern Europe, which at this point a small for us, was positive with the exception of Greece. Asia, Latin America and Middle East continue to perform very well, all experiencing double-digit growth during the quarter even though Asia continues to be negatively impacted by our performance in Japan. At these developing markets, together with our new investments in these markets continue to grow, our business has continued to diversify globally. Our U.S. and non-U.S. revenues were almost evenly split in the third quarter.
Our growth is also coming across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category: auto, technology, retail, travel and entertainment, all have been performing particularly well. We continue to believe the highly diversified nature of our business by geography, by discipline and by industry help us to take advantage of growth opportunities, and our experience demonstrates that we've been able to maintain greater stability even in more volatile economic environment. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the operating performance of our business and the progress we're making towards our strategic priorities. Looking forward, our performance will clearly be affected by a number of external factors: stability of European leaders to deal with the region's sovereign debt, ability to foster economic growth and the role of rapidly growing economies in Asia and other parts of the world will play not only economically but politically.
Even with this backdrop, we continue to focus on the things that we can control, developing, recruiting the best talent to our agencies and delivering innovative ideas for our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Randy, who'll take you through our financial performance, and then we'll both be available for questions."
96161,141514564,173168,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Once again, it was an excellent quarter for our company. Our agencies performed very well, more recognized by their clients with more than $1.4 billion in net new business wins this quarter. In spite of continued uncertainties in the dome",1388,"Thank you, John. Once again, it was an excellent quarter for our company. Our agencies performed very well, more recognized by their clients with more than $1.4 billion in net new business wins this quarter. In spite of continued uncertainties in the domestic and global economies, we continue to record strong organic revenue growth in most of our major markets and in all of our targeted growth markets. Again, this quarter, we had positive organic growth across each of the industries that we serve. Our agencies also continue to progress in leveraging our people and resources more effectively and managing our costs. We once again achieved substantial margin improvements this quarter. We continue to track well towards our margin targets that we set for ourselves for 2012.
Now turning to the details of our financial performance. Combining our very strong organic growth performance as a positive FX impact, our year-over-year revenue grew 12.9% and revenue for the quarter up to $3.38 billion. Good cost control or EBITDA increased 19.6% to $397 million. The resulting EBITDA margin is 11.7%, which was about a 60 basis point improvement from last year, and our operating income or EBIT increased 18.9% to $373 million.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $31.9 million, up $2.9 million from Q3 of last year and up $4.3 million from the second quarter. The increase versus Q2 is primarily the result of reduced interest income earned on our cash balances and our settlement during the quarter of various fixed to floating interest rate swaps had been in place with respect to our 2016 notes. That transaction resulted in a $33 million cash gain. That gain will be amortized over the remaining 5-year life of the bonds as a reduction of interest expense. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%, which continues to track to our expected operating rate for 2011. As a result, net income for the quarter increased 16.7% to $203.7 million. And when combined with the year-over-year share reduction of 7.3%, diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased to $0.72 per share or 26.3%.
On Page 3, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, our U.S. dollar exchange rates were fairly volatile during the quarter. Overall, on a year-over-year basis, dollar was weaker versus most of the major currencies that we operate in. The net result was a positive FX impact on revenue for the quarter of $117.6 million or 3.9%. Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, in Q4, they will continue to have a positive impact over less than 1%, and they will turn negative Q1 but again are less than 1%. Growth from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by about $54 million in the quarter or about 1.8%. 
The 2 larger acquisitions we completed in the first quarter, Clemenger and Communispace, the most significant drivers of our acquisition growth, offset by several dispositions primarily in the United States. We continue to work on a couple of additional dispositions that we anticipate completing at year end or early next year. I'm happy to say the pipeline of potential acquisitions at this point is very strong. This quarter, we completed 4 excellent acquisitions, all in international markets. We anticipate completing several more before year end.
With regard to organic growth, we had another strong quarter, up 7.2% to $215 million. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve. There appear to be 3 primary drivers of our organic growth. First, for the past year or so, our agencies have performed very well on the new business front. And as I mentioned this quarter, net new business wins were again very strong at $1.4 billion. Second, many of our clients have continued to restore their levels of marketing spending after reducing them in late 2008 and 2009. And finally, our agencies are continuing to expand the scope of the services they're providing their clients to support the many new technologies that are being developed and used by marketers today.
Turning to our mix of business, and advertising accounted for 45% of our revenues; and Marketing Services, 55%. For the respective growth rates, brand advertising to organic growth was up a strong 9.1% and Marketing Services was up 5.7%. In the Marketing Services category, CRM had 8.6% organic growth. Within this sector, branding, Field Marketing, events and sales promotion all had outstanding performances. Public Relations sector picked up in the quarter organic growth increasing to 4.2%. Specialty Communications decreased by 4.8%. This was primarily the result of declines in our Recruitment Marketing business and lower client spending to some of our specialty healthcare agencies, although overall spending by pharmaceutical and healthcare clients across our networks and disciplines increased about 2.6% in the quarter.
On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split almost 50-50 between the U.S. and international markets. In the United States, revenue increased $86 million or 5.3%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $7 million and organic growth continued to be strong at 5.8% even though we are cycling on strong year-over-year comparables.
International revenue increased $300 million or about 21.8%. FX increased revenue by $118 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $61 million or 4.4%. And organic growth or results were mixed by country, overall improved to 8.9% in the quarter or $122 million.
Specifically, in Asia, we had strong performances in China, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. We also continue to have very good results in Latin America and the Middle East. In Europe, results continue to be mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well. Plans in Germany were up modestly. We also had solid performances in Belgium, Poland, Sweden and Turkey.
Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter. As I previously mentioned, again this quarter, we experienced positive growth across each of the industry segments that we serve. Strongest sectors for us in the quarter were autos, technology, travel and entertainment and financial services, all experiencing very solid year-over-year growth.
Turning to Slide 7, cash performance year to date was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $751 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. The primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends to our common shareholders of $199 million; dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $70 million; acquisitions including earnout payments; net of the proceeds we received from the sale of investments is $327 million; and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $586 million. Combined, this resulted in a net use of cash year-to-date of approximately $430 million.
Slide 8 shows our current capital structure. The net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of about $780 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven primarily by our return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, which for the last 12 months, totaled about $1.7 billion. Total debt at the end of the quarter is $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from last year and last quarter. Our leverage ratio or total debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7x, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.2x, and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12x.
I should also mention that last week, we amended our bank credit facility, extending the term of the facility to October of 2016. We also increased the size of the facility of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but at the same time, we were able to reduce the annual fees that we pay as well as the interest rates that we would pay if we were to the draw down of the facility.
Finally, on Slide 9, return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.7% and 24.5% lastly, respectively. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'll now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

As you do your 2-year analysis on a year-over-year basis, it should step down a little bit if the actual performance stays in line with what we've just seen in Q3."

96161,141514564,173287,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with you our thoughts on the progress against our key initiatives. Let me start with our performance for the quarter",969,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with you our thoughts on the progress against our key initiatives. Let me start with our performance for the quarter.
The third quarter reflected very strong operating performance, including significant organic growth and continued margin improvement. Organic growth was up 7.2% over the same period of 2010. Growth was particularly strong in our advertising and CRM businesses, and geographically, all of our major markets experienced solid organic growth. This performance is particularly notable given the worsening of economic and capital market conditions since our last earnings call. We're watching these events carefully to anticipate the impact they may have on our business.
Given this backdrop, our agency management teams are balancing effective growth strategies, with a continued eye towards controlling their expense structures. While we remain cautious about the economy, we are encouraged by our discussions with our clients. Marketers remained focused on investing in their brands and differentiating their products and services, and are seeking agency partners that can provide innovative ideas that help them navigate to an increasingly complex marketing environment. We believe that our agencies have the best talent in the business and help us to compete more effectively.
During the quarter, we also continue to execute on several of our strategic initiatives. We continue to make solid progress on our portfolio review and other initiatives to improve our margin performance. Our margins for the quarter reflected continued improvement. And while there's still work to be done, we remain on course towards achieving our goal of returning to 2007 margins by 2012. Randy will discuss our margin performance in more detail later in the call.
We also continue to execute against our strategic priority of building a deeper presence in rapidly growing markets and disciplines, while still growing our business in the developed markets. During the quarter, we closed transactions in India, Vietnam and New Zealand, and expanded our offerings in healthcare through the acquisition of Synergy in the U.K. Today, over 22% of our revenue is from Asia and Latin America and other rapidly developing markets, up from 18.5% this time last year.
While these acquisitions will further solidify our presence in the developing markets, our agencies in Asia will once again recognized as leaders for creating groundbreaking award-winning work that delivers value for our clients. 
In September, Omnicom Group agencies captured the top 2 Network of the Year rankings at the Spike (sic) [Spikes] Asia Advertising Festival in Singapore. For the second consecutive year, DDB was named Network of the Year and BBDO took second. In addition, the DDB Group Singapore and Mudra Communications placed second and third for Agency of the Year. Omnicom agencies also won 4 Grand Prix. 
Turning to some of our digital initiatives, our distance-learning digital education program, which we discussed at the beginning of the year, has begun to be rolled out in the fourth quarter. We have always recognized that each of our agencies must develop digital skill sets in their respective disciplines, and they're meeting these demands extremely well. The program will further enhance the development of our talents.
Overall, we are very pleased with both the financial performance of our business and the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. 
Now let me touch on a few more specific points about our performance during the quarter. In the U.S., we saw organic growth of 5.8% versus the third quarter of last year, driven by our brand advertising and CRM businesses. Growth was very strong in the U.K., and almost all of our agencies had solid organic growth. 
In Continental Europe, our results were quite positive in spite of the region's sovereign debt problems. Germany and France experienced solid growth, while the Netherlands was negatively impacted by a client loss in that country, but that client was retained by another Omnicom agency in the U.S. We also saw strong performance in Eastern Europe, including Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Southern Europe, which at this point is a small for us, was positive with the exception of Greece. 
Asia, Latin America and the Middle East continue to perform very well, all experiencing double-digit growth during the quarter, even though Asia continues to be negatively impacted by our performance in Japan. 
As these developing markets, together with our new investments in these markets, continue to grow, our business has continued to diversify globally. Our U.S. and non-U.S. revenues were almost evenly split in the third quarter.
Our growth is also coming across the spectrum of the industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, with auto, technology, retail, travel and entertainment, all have been performing particularly well. We continue to believe the highly diversified nature of our business by geography, by discipline and by industry help us to take advantage of growth opportunities, and our experience demonstrates that we've been able to maintain greater stability even in more volatile economic environment. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the operating performance of our business and the progress we're making towards our strategic priorities. Looking forward, our performance will clearly be affected by a number of external factors: the ability of European leaders to deal with the region's sovereign debt problems, Washington's ability to foster economic growth and the role of that rapidly growing economies in Asia and other parts of the world will play, not only economically, but politically.
Even with this backdrop, we continue to focus on the things that we can control, developing and recruiting the best talent to our agencies and delivering innovative ideas for our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Randy, who'll take you through our financial performance, and then we'll both be available for questions."
96161,141514564,173287,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Once again, it was an excellent quarter for our company. Our agencies performed very well, and we're recognized by their clients with more than $1.4 billion in net new business wins this quarter. In spite of continued uncertainties in the",1408,"Thank you, John. Once again, it was an excellent quarter for our company. Our agencies performed very well, and we're recognized by their clients with more than $1.4 billion in net new business wins this quarter. In spite of continued uncertainties in the domestic and global economies, we continue to record strong organic revenue growth in most of our major markets and in all of our targeted growth markets. Again, this quarter, we had positive organic growth across each of the industries that we serve, and our agencies also continue to progress in leveraging our people and resources more effectively and managing our costs. We, once again, achieved substantial margin improvements this quarter and we continue to track well towards our margin targets that we set for ourselves for 2012.
Now turning to the details of our financial performance. Combining our very strong organic growth performance with a positive FX impact, our year-over-year revenue grew 12.9%, bringing revenue for the quarter up to $3.38 billion. With good cost control, our EBITDA increased 19.6% to $397 million; our resulting EBITDA margin was 11.7%, which was about a 60 basis point improvement from last year; and our operating income or EBIT increased 18.9% to $373 million.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $31.9 million, up $2.1 million from Q3 of last year and up $4.3 million from the second quarter. The increase versus Q2 was primarily the result of reduced interest income earned on our cash balances and our settlement during the quarter of various fixed to floating interest rate swaps we had in place with respect to our 2016 notes. While that transaction resulted in a $33 million cash gain, that gain will be amortized over the remaining 5-year life of the bonds as a reduction of interest expense. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%, which continues to track to our expected operating rate for 2011. As a result, net income for the quarter increased 16.7% to $203.7 million. And when combined with the year-over-year share reduction of 7.3%, diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased to $0.72 per share or 26.3%.
On Page 3, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. Our U.S. dollar exchange rates were fairly volatile during the quarter. Overall, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar was weaker versus most of the major currencies that we operate in. The net result was a positive FX impact on revenue for the quarter of $117.6 million or 3.9%. Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, in Q4, they will continue to have a positive impact of a less than 1%, and they would then turn negative in Q1, but again, by less than 1%. Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by about $54 million in the quarter or about 1.8%. 
The 2 larger acquisitions we completed in the first quarter, Clemenger and Communispace, were the most significant drivers of our acquisition growth, offset by several dispositions which were primarily in the United States. We continue to work on a couple of additional dispositions that we anticipate completing by year end or early next year, and I'm happy to say the pipeline of potential acquisitions at this point is very strong. This quarter, we completed 4 excellent acquisitions, all in international markets, and we anticipate completing several more before year end.
With regard to organic growth, we had another strong quarter, up 7.2% or $215 million. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve. 
There appear to be 3 primary drivers of our organic growth. First, for the past year or so, our agencies have performed very well on the new business front. And as I mentioned this quarter, net new business wins were again very strong at $1.4 billion. Second, many of our clients have continued to restore their levels of marketing spending after reducing them in late 2008 and in 2009. And finally, our agencies are continuing to expand the scope of the services they're providing their clients to support the many new technologies that are being developed and used by marketers today.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and marketing services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising to organic growth was up a strong 9.1% and marketing services was up 5.7%. Within the marketing services category, CRM had 8.6% organic growth. Within this sector, branding, field marketing, events and sales promotion, all had outstanding performances. The public relations sector picked up in the quarter, with organic growth increasing to 4.2% and specialty communications decreased by 4.8%. This was primarily the result of declines in our recruitment marketing business and lower client spending with some of our specialty healthcare agencies, although overall spending by pharmaceutical and healthcare clients across our networks and disciplines increased about 2.6% a quarter.
On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split almost 50-50 between the U.S. and international markets. In the United States, revenue increased $86 million or 5.3%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $7 million. And organic growth continued to be strong at 5.8%, even though we are cycling on strong year-over-year comparables.
International revenue increased $300 million or about 21.8%. FX increased revenue by $118 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $61 million or 4.4%. And organic growth, while results were mixed by country, overall improved to 8.9% in the quarter or $122 million.
Specifically, in Asia, we had strong performances in China, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. We also continue to have very good results in Latin America and the Middle East. And in Europe, results continue to be mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well. France and Germany were up modestly. We also had solid performances in Belgium, Poland, Sweden and Turkey.
Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter. And as I previously mentioned, again this quarter, we experienced positive growth across each of the industry segments that we serve. The strongest sectors for us in the quarter were autos, technology, travel and entertainment and financial services, with all experiencing very solid year-over-year growth.
Turning to Slide 7, our cash performance year-to-date was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $751 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends to our common shareholders of $199 million; dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $70 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds we received from the sale of investments, was $327 million; and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $586 million. Combined, this resulted in a net use of cash year-to-date of approximately $430 million.
Slide 8 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of about $780 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven primarily by our return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases which, for the last 12 months, totaled about $1.7 billion. Gross or total debt at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from last year and last quarter. Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7x, while our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.2x and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12x.
I should also mention that last week, we amended our bank credit facility, extending the term of the facility to October of 2016. We also increased the size of the facility from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And at the same time, we were able to reduce the annual fees that we pay, as well as the interest rates that we would pay if we were to draw down the facility.
And finally, on Slide 9, our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.7% and 24.5%, respectively.

If the 2-year analysis worked, if our underlying performance was the same, the year-over-year measured performance, the sequential performance of the agency stayed the same and everything is kind of moved along from third quarter to fourth quarter, the year-over-year measurement would be down; if that's what you're addressing. If the year-over-year measurement stays the same, it would mean an equally large organic growth in the fourth quarter to last year's fourth quarter. I don't suspect that will be the case. Last year, in the fourth quarter, I think more of that project revenue returned to normal, and we saw a fairly large step-up from Q3 to Q4 in organic growth. I don't think we'll see that year-over-year step-up certainly in the fourth quarter this year.

96161,141514564,173424,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with you our thoughts on the progress against our key initiatives. Let me start with our performance for the quarter",966,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with you our thoughts on the progress against our key initiatives. Let me start with our performance for the quarter.
The third quarter reflected very strong operating performance, including significant organic growth and continued margin improvement. Organic growth was up 7.2% over the same period of 2010. Growth was particularly strong in our advertising and CRM businesses, and geographically, all of our major markets experienced solid organic growth. This performance is particularly notable given the worsening of economic and capital market conditions since our last earnings call. We're watching these events carefully to anticipate the impact they may have on our business.
Given this backdrop, our agency management teams are balancing effective growth strategies, with a continued eye towards controlling their expense structures. While we remain cautious about the economy, we are encouraged by our discussions with our clients. Marketers remain focused on investing in their brands and differentiating their products and services, and are seeking agency partners that can provide innovative ideas that help them navigate an increasingly complex marketing environment. We believe that our agencies have the best talent in the business and help us to compete more effectively.
During the quarter, we also continue to execute on several of our strategic initiatives. We continue to make solid progress on our portfolio review and other initiatives to improve our margin performance. Our margins for the quarter reflected continued improvement. And while there's still work to be done, we remain on course towards achieving our goal of returning to 2007 margins by 2012. Randy will discuss our margin performance in more detail later in the call.
We also continue to execute against our strategic priority of building a deeper presence in rapidly growing markets and disciplines, while still growing our business in the developed markets. During the quarter, we closed transactions in India, Vietnam and New Zealand, and expanded our offerings in healthcare through the acquisition of Synergy in the U.K. Today, over 22% of our revenue is from Asia and Latin America and other rapidly developing markets, up from 18.5% this time last year.
While these acquisitions will further solidify our presence in the developing markets, our agencies in Asia were once again recognized as leaders for creating groundbreaking award-winning work that delivers value for our clients. 
In September, Omnicom Group agencies captured the top 2 Network of the Year rankings at the Spike (sic) [Spikes] Asia Advertising Festival in Singapore. For the second consecutive year, DDB was named Network of the Year and BBDO took second. In addition, the DDB Group Singapore and Mudra Communications placed second and third for Agency of the Year. Omnicom agencies also won 4 Grand Prix. 
Turning to some of our digital initiatives, our distance-learning digital education program, which we discussed at the beginning of the year, has begun to be rolled out in the fourth quarter. We have always recognized that each of our agencies must develop digital skill sets in their respective disciplines, and they're meeting these demands extremely well. The program will further enhance the development of our talents.
Overall, we are very pleased with both the financial performance of our business and the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. 
Now let me touch on a few more specific points about our performance during the quarter. In the U.S., we saw organic growth of 5.8% versus the third quarter of last year, driven by our brand advertising and CRM businesses. Growth was very strong in the U.K., and almost all of our agencies had solid organic growth. 
In Continental Europe, our results were quite positive in spite of the region's sovereign debt problems. Germany and France experienced solid growth, while the Netherlands was negatively impacted by a client loss in that country, but that client was retained by another Omnicom agency in the U.S. We also saw strong performance in Eastern Europe, including Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Southern Europe, which at this point is a small for us, was positive with the exception of Greece. 
Asia, Latin America and the Middle East continue to perform very well, all experiencing double-digit growth during the quarter, even though Asia continues to be negatively impacted by our performance in Japan. 
As these developing markets, together with our new investments in these markets, continue to grow, our business has continued to diversify globally. Our U.S. and non-U.S. revenues were almost evenly split in the third quarter.
Our growth is also coming across the spectrum of the industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, with auto, technology, retail, travel and entertainment, all having performed particularly well. We continue to believe the highly diversified nature of our business by geography, by discipline and by industry help us to take advantage of growth opportunities, and our experience demonstrates that we've been able to maintain greater stability even in more volatile economic environment. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the operating performance of our business and the progress we're making towards our strategic priorities. Looking forward, our performance will clearly be affected by a number of external factors: The ability of European leaders to deal with the region's sovereign debt problems, Washington's ability to foster economic growth and the role that rapidly growing economies in Asia and other parts of the world will play, not only economically, but politically.
Even with this backdrop, we continue to focus on the things that we can control, developing and recruiting the best talent to our agencies and delivering innovative ideas for our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Randy, who'll take you through our financial performance, and then we'll both be available for questions."
96161,141514564,173424,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Once again, it was an excellent quarter for our company. Our agencies performed very well, and were recognized by their clients with more than $1.4 billion in net new business wins this quarter. In spite of continued uncertainties in the",1408,"Thank you, John. Once again, it was an excellent quarter for our company. Our agencies performed very well, and were recognized by their clients with more than $1.4 billion in net new business wins this quarter. In spite of continued uncertainties in the domestic and global economies, we continue to report strong organic revenue growth in most of our major markets and in all of our targeted growth markets. Again, this quarter, we had positive organic growth across each of the industries that we serve, and our agencies also continue to progress in leveraging our people and resources more effectively and managing our costs. We, once again, achieved substantial margin improvements this quarter and we continue to track well towards our margin targets that we set for ourselves for 2012.
Now turning to the details of our financial performance. Combining our very strong organic growth performance with a positive FX impact, our year-over-year revenue grew 12.9%, bringing revenue for the quarter up to $3.38 billion. With good cost control, our EBITDA increased 19.6% to $397 million; our resulting EBITDA margin was 11.7%, which was about a 60 basis point improvement from last year; and our operating income or EBIT increased 18.9% to $373 million.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $31.9 million, up $2.1 million from Q3 of last year and up $4.3 million from the second quarter. The increase versus Q2 was primarily the result of reduced interest income earned on our cash balances and our settlement during the quarter of various fixed to floating interest rate swaps we had in place with respect to our 2016 notes. While that transaction resulted in a $33 million cash gain, that gain will be amortized over the remaining 5-year life of the bonds as a reduction of interest expense. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%, which continues to track to our expected operating rate for 2011. As a result, net income for the quarter increased 16.7% to $203.7 million. And when combined with the year-over-year share reduction of 7.3%, diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased to $0.72 per share or 26.3%.
On Page 3, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. Our U.S. dollar exchange rates were fairly volatile during the quarter. Overall, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar was weaker versus most of the major currencies that we operate in. The net result was a positive FX impact on revenue for the quarter of $117.6 million or 3.9%. Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, in Q4, they will continue to have a positive impact of less than 1%, and they would then turn negative in Q1, but again, by less than 1%. Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by about $54 million in the quarter or about 1.8%. 
The 2 larger acquisitions we completed in the first quarter, Clemenger and Communispace, were the most significant drivers of our acquisition growth, offset by several dispositions which were primarily in the United States. We continue to work on a couple of additional dispositions that we anticipate completing by year end or early next year, and I'm happy to say the pipeline of potential acquisitions at this point is very strong. This quarter, we completed 4 excellent acquisitions, all in international markets, and we anticipate completing several more before year end.
With regard to organic growth, we had another strong quarter, up 7.2% or $215 million. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see year-over-year growth across every industry sector that we serve. 
There appear to be 3 primary drivers of our organic growth. First, for the past year or so, our agencies have performed very well on the new business front. And as I mentioned this quarter, net new business wins were again very strong at $1.4 billion. Second, many of our clients have continued to restore their levels of marketing spending after reducing them in late 2008 and in 2009. And finally, our agencies are continuing to expand the scope of the services they're providing their clients to support the many new technologies that are being developed and used by marketers today.
Turning to our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and marketing services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising to organic growth was up a strong 9.1% and marketing services was up 5.7%. Within the marketing services category, CRM had 8.6% organic growth. Within this sector, branding, field marketing, events and sales promotion, all had outstanding performances. The public relations sector picked up in the quarter, with organic growth increasing to 4.2% and specialty communications decreased by 4.8%. This was primarily the result of declines in our recruitment marketing business and lower client spending with some of our specialty healthcare agencies, although overall spending by pharmaceutical and healthcare clients across our networks and disciplines increased about 2.6% in the quarter.
On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split almost 50-50 between the U.S. and international markets. In the United States, revenue increased $86 million or 5.3%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $7 million. And organic growth continued to be strong at 5.8%, even though we are cycling on strong year-over-year comparables.
International revenue increased $300 million or about 21.8%. FX increased revenue by $118 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $61 million or 4.4%. And organic growth, while results were mixed by country, overall improved to 8.9% in the quarter or $122 million.
Specifically, in Asia, we had strong performances in China, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. We also continue to have very good results in Latin America and the Middle East. And in Europe, results continue to be mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well. France and Germany were up modestly. We also had solid performances in Belgium, Poland, Sweden and Turkey.
Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes in our mix of business in the quarter. And as I previously mentioned, again this quarter, we experienced positive growth across each of the industry segments that we serve. The strongest sectors for us in the quarter were autos, technology, travel and entertainment and financial services, with all experiencing very solid year-over-year growth.
Turning to Slide 7, our cash performance year-to-date was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $751 million of free cash flow after CapEx and excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends to our common shareholders of $199 million; dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $70 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds we received from the sale of investments, was $327 million; and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $586 million. Combined, this resulted in a net use of cash year-to-date of approximately $430 million.
Slide 8 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of about $780 million over the last 12 months. That increase was driven primarily by our return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases which, for the last 12 months, totaled about $1.7 billion. Gross or total debt at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion, which was effectively unchanged from last year and last quarter. Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7x, while our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.2x and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12x.
I should also mention that last week, we amended our bank credit facility, extending the term of the facility to October of 2016. We also increased the size of the facility from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And at the same time, we were able to reduce the annual fees that we pay, as well as the interest rates that we would pay if we were to draw down the facility.
And finally, on Slide 9, our return on invested capital and return on equity for the last 12 months increased to 15.7% and 24.5%, respectively. 
There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions."

If the 2-year analysis worked, if our underlying performance was the same, the year-over-year measured performance, the sequential performance of the agency stayed the same and everything is kind of moved along from third quarter to fourth quarter, the year-over-year measurement would be down; if that's what you're addressing. If the year-over-year measurement stays the same, it would mean an equally large organic growth in the fourth quarter to last year's fourth quarter. I don't suspect that will be the case. Last year, in the fourth quarter, I think more of that project revenue returned to normal, and we saw a fairly large step-up from Q3 to Q4 in organic growth. I don't think we'll see that year-over-year step-up certainly in the fourth quarter this year. As you do your 2-year analysis on a year-over-year basis, it should step down a little bit if the actual performance stays in line with what we've just seen in Q3."

As we move down further and further, John pointed out in his comments Netherlands. So you get a client movement in the Netherlands, it can be a very significant impact on the Netherlands that has nothing to do with the economy in the Netherlands. That's a global account that was being run out of the Netherlands that got moved to another one of our markets that in the market, they got move to that account change wasn't big enough to really move the needle. But in the Netherlands, there was very much big enough to move the needle, especially on a quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year kind of basis. So again, I'm not 100% sure the 2-year analysis works. I'm almost positive it doesn't work in the smaller market analysis. It may make some sense in a market that's big enough like the United States."

We've largely done that at this point. From here on out, we have constant conversations with our Board of Directors and we're going to be constantly evaluating, I'll say, our leverage positions relative to our operating performance in the backdrop of the marketplace. I don't think we have a perspective that we're going to increase leverage. I certainly don't think we're going to be increasing leverage in a dramatic way. We are very confident with the stability of our business. The operations performed extremely well even in the 2009 time frame, so I think we feel very comfortable where we're at and we'll continue to evaluate."
