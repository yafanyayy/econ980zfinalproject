Following the discussion of the company's fourth quarter 2010 results, we will open the call for questions. If you don't have a copy of today's earnings release, it is available on our website at cablevision.com. This call can also be accessed via our website.

Let me point out that on Page 5 of today's earnings release, we provided consolidated operations data and reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow, or AOCF, to operating income. Finally, I would like to point out that we have reclassified our business segments slightly to report them in a manner consistent with how we intend to operate them following the proposed spin-off of Rainbow. As a result that the News 12, our local news channel and the net expense of RASCO, our advertising sales company, are no longer reflected in the Rainbow's results and are now classified as Other. Also, Newsday is now included with our local media assets in Other. 
I will now turn the call over to Cablevision's President and CEO, Jim Dolan."

Cablevision accomplished a great deal in 2010. We completed the spin-off of Madison Square Garden, increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, announced and completed the Bresnan acquisition, initiated the stock repurchase program and finalize a number of financing transactions that significantly improved our debt maturity profile. And we accomplished all this while continuing to execute well operationally. 
For the fourth quarter, continuing growth of our Cable and Rainbow businesses led to 6% increase in consolidated revenue while AOCF grew 2%. These results include the addition of the newly acquired Bresnan properties beginning last December 14. 
For the full year, Cablevision's consolidated revenue increased 6% to $7.2 billion and AOCF grew 6% to $2.6 billion. Cablevision generated more than $855 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, a 13% improvement over 2009. The company have also continued to experience positive momentum in the advertising market. In fact, both Cable and Rainbow delivered double-digit increases in advertising revenue for all four quarters of 2010. We are pleased with our solid performance this past year. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we will remain focused on returning value to our shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. In keeping with that plan, Cablevision's Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million increase in the stock repurchase program, bringing our total program to $1 billion. The Board has also approved the $0.0125 per share dividend payable in March. 
In addition, the company continues to move forward with the spin-off of the Rainbow businesses. Rainbow has an impressive portfolio of programming assets as well as an excellent management team. While there is still a lot of accomplishments before the spin could be completed, I have no doubt that there is a wonderful future ahead for Rainbow. 
I am also extremely optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cable as we remain committed to providing even better products and services to our customers now and in the future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge, who will address our Telecom businesses."

We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010, the financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 h",972,"Thank you, Jim and good morning. We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010, the financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 high-speed data customers and 9,200 voice customers in historic Cablevision market. Basic fibers declined by 1% almost all of which is attributable to our decision to contest the retransmission consent demand. While the SEC has begun to visit this issue in a preceding, we have finished multiyear agreements with all the major station groups in our service areas. 
With the acquisition of Bresnan, we have added 306,000 basic video customers, 205,000 digital customers, 239,000 data customers and 131,000 voice customers. The Bresnan footprint has approximately 650,000 passed. As I said, the Bresnan acquisition closed on December 14 and we're beginning to implement tactics which have been successful at Cablevision, including adding high-definition programming, offering a triple play, increasing the speeds of the high-speed data Internet service and providing inexpensive voice service. We are excited about our prospects. 
Year-over-year, telecom revenue growth without Bresnan was 5.2% while AOCF growth was 6%. AOCF for the quarter was affected by retransmission marketing costs and with costs associated with the termination of the agreement Bresnan had with a third-party voice provisioning company. We have merged Cablevision voice operation with those of Bresnan and in the process decreased the costs associated with providing voice services for these properties meaningfully. 
Advertising revenue continued its strong performance with 23% growth versus last year's fourth quarter x Bresnan. Advance advertising applications are making a sizable contribution. Even more importantly, these platforms helped to contribute the growth in traditional advertising sales. 
Optimum business saw steady growth throughout 2010. We are now capable of serving more than 650,000 small and medium businesses, and we provide at least one level of service to over 25% of this universe. The average residential voice customer has one line of service. The average Optimum business customer has 2.8. As a result, we have not raised prices for the Optimum business service much like our Residential business, RPS naturally will grow through the use of more service. 
Our high-speed data customers use Optimum WiFi to access the mobile Internet over 50 million times last year, a 500% increase over 2009's 8 million sessions. In addition to the nation's largest outdoor WiFi network, we've installed Optimum WiFi in over 6,000 retail locations, restaurants, coffee shops et cetera, that are customers of Optimum business purposes. All Optimum WiFi locations are listed in search of the OptimumWiFi.com. 
Total cable capital spending was a $206 million in the quarter, and for the year, $682 million. 2010 full year spending was higher than the prior year, primarily due to the upfront expenditures on RS-DVR, which will be offset in future declines in CPE. CPE capital continues to decline considering our expectations. Capital intensity or capital as a percentage of revenue for 2010 was 12.5%.  
We now enter 2011 with a number of new projects underway and ready for launch. Our new RS-DVR remote storage DVR service has been launched in New York city. This is the only DVR service we're offering in the service area and is branded as DVR Plus. The service allows our customers to record up to four shows at once and watch any show on any TV in the house at the same time. All-digital set-tops in the home can access this service, a true all-home DVR solution. And as planned, we've now stopped by with physical DVRs. Our plan is to ultimately serve our entire footprint as we complete the transition to all-digital. 
We will launch PC to TV Media Relay, now called and branded, Optimum Link, this quarter. As Internet usage continues to grow, we are providing our customers with the ability to view what is on or available to their PC on their television without the need for a new set-top box or a new TV with built-in IP connectivity. 
Downloadable security has launched our set-top boxes. For comparable capable CPE, we save almost $50 per box on all future set-top boxes we need to purchase. 
Finally, we have three separate applications for use with the Apple iPad. First, we've rolled out remote DVR scheduling, which allows customers to fully manage their home DVRs from any iPad anywhere it's connected to the Internet. We've also developed an application to use the iPad for navigation in the home only, making it a streamlined guide and remote control for all TVs in the house. And last, customers who will be able to use their iPad as another television in the home, watching Cable Television in the iPad in the home only. All three of these apps will be in service this quarter. 
In the future, we will extend these apps to Android devices. And separately, we will launch additional apps which will allow video on demands, subscription-video-on-demand, download to own and rent and TV everywhere-like services to be seen outside the home, where we've entered into rights agreements with content owners that so allow. 
At Optimum Lightpath, where we serve a larger commercial customer base, fourth quarter revenue growth was 9% while AOCF grew by 18% as compared with the full year. The Lightpath business now has over 4,400 building on net. And across this network, now generates operating margins of over 40%. Clearly, the result of a more deeply deployed ethernet offering. 
We added a subscriber chart in the earnings release, it integrates Lightpath large customers and cable companies small business and residential customers and shows the total voice lines we are now selling in our footprint. You can see that we have almost as many voice lines. 
Let me now turn the call over to Joshua Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In addition, when we refer to the national networks, we now include the results of Sundance Channel. So that lineup is comprised of AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel.  So with that, I'll address Rainbow's financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased by 14% to $298 million while AOCF for the quarter was up 24% to $101 million as compared to the prior year. The revenue growth for the quarter versus the prior year came primarily from the national networks, including the 21% increase in add revenue and a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. 
While most of this advertising revenue growth was generated by AMC and WE tv, IFC sponsor for sales also contributed to the incremental add revenue in the quarter. The quarterly revenue growth of AMC was driven by double-digit increases in both CPMs and units sold, while WE tv also experienced high single-digit increases in CPMs and add units sold for the quarter. 
Rainbow's AOCF increase of 24% was principally a result of these high revenues, offset somewhat by the planned increase in original programming and associated market costs. 
Turning to the full year results. Total revenue increased by 11% to approximately $1.1 billion while AOCF increased 10% to $403 million as compared to the prior year. For the year, the national networks had a 17% increase in add revenue, a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. AMC and WE tv were responsible for the lion share of the advertising revenue growth. 
Similar to the fourth quarter results, AMC and WE tv delivered increases in units sold and CPMs. For the full year, Rainbow's AOCF increased by 10%, principally the result of these higher revenues partially offset by the planned increases in programming costs, and to a lesser extent, to increase marketing costs. 
As we look back on 2010, we see the results of our multiyear focus on original programming. The national networks combined deliver double-digit growth in add revenue in all four quarters of 2010. WE tv had its best year ever in sales prime delivery among the key demographics that we target, women 18 to 49. AMC's new series called, The Walking Dead premiered as the number one drama series in basic cable history among target adults 18 to 49. Season 1 averaged the household rating of 3.5 with 5.2 million total viewers across each of the six episodes. The series returns in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Using original programming as the backbone of our schedule, we expanded our global distribution. AMC and IFC now have a presence in Canada that's substantial. And our other national networks are distributed in Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, France, Belgium and other countries in Europe. Continuing a four-year run of award nominations and wins, AMC received 29 MBN and global nominations for our dramatic series, Breaking Bad, Madman, and the new series, The Walking Dead. 
Last month the Sundance  Channel won its first ever Golden Globe  Award for the miniseries called, Carlos, in the category of Best Movie or Miniseries. For 2011, we will be our original programming strategy with new series on AMC, including something called, The Killing, a drama in April. And Hell On Wheels, a western, coming later this year. 
IFC premiered two original series a few weeks ago, one called, Portlandia, and the other, the Unnew News Network. Both shows have outperformed IFC's primetime average by a factor of two. 
Our commitment to creating strong original programming is at the core of our strategy for the future. I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will provide a official overview of the company."

With respect to leverage and liquidity, the company's consolidated cash position at year end was $394 million and net debt was $12.1 billion. At December 31, $659 million of the CSC Holdings, $1.4 billion of our revolving credit facility was undrawn. As of December 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.2x, excluding the effect of the Bresnan acquisition, and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.6x. 
Rainbow National Services had approximately $1.1 billion of debt and $530 million undrawn on its revolving credit facilities at December 31, and the ratio under the RNS bond leverage as of December 31 was 2.6x. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the Bresnan properties on December 14. 
The Bresnan acquisition is structured as a newly formed, unrestricted subsidiary of Cablevision. The transaction was valued at $1.365 billion, subject to certain adjustments and was financed through an equity contribution of approximately $400 million and non-recourse debt of approximately $1 billion. The early forms of subsidiaries capital structure consists of a $75 million revolving credit facility, a $765 million term loan facility priced at LIBOR plus 300 with a LIBOR floor at 150 and $250 million of 8% senior notes due 2018. 
Regarding the Rainbow spend and the distribution to Cablevision, we continue to make progress and are hopeful that the transaction will take place by the end of the second quarter. There is still a number of important steps to be completed, including receipt of the IRS ruling, the filing and effectiveness of Form 10 and the completion of the proposed financing. We anticipate filing the initial Form 10 during March. 
Our intent is to refinance the existing RNS debt of $1.1 billion and obtain additional financing of approximately $1.25 billion, which will be used to reduce existing borrowings at the CSC Holdings. As Jim mentioned, our Board has increased our repurchase authorization by $500 million for a total authorization of $1 billion. 
In reference to our share repurchase program, we purchased 4.8 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $33.40 during the fourth quarter. Through February 15, we have repurchased 15.6 million shares for a total of $480.5 million or $30.89 per share under the initial $500 million authorization. This recent case of repurchases has been greater than in past quarters and we will continue to be opportunistic in our gross to share repurchase, but you should not necessarily extrapolate recent activity into future quarters. 
In total, we returned $457 million to shareholders in 2010 through a combination of $141 million of dividends and the share repurchase. 
Our intention for 2011 is to stay at the course, maintaining a balance approach to the utilization of our free cash flow and leverage capacity. We intend to continue our repurchase program and would like to find more attractive acquisitions as then although so far, such opportunities have proven to be few and far between. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to ask that we keep the focus of your questions on the result of the businesses. We understand that you maybe curious about some of the information which will be contained in the Form 10 for the Rainbow spend but let's wait for the filing before we address of those specific types of questions. Operator, if we can now open the call for questions?"

The plant have been operated. I think that we saw marketing opportunities. And really the brand, our management team to bear what we saw as essentially underpenetrated assets, that's the operating side and then I'll give you the financial side. And second, Tom might want to add something on the operating side. On the financial side, the non-recourse debt certainly was available to us at roughly, let's call it 6x AOCF. I think in today's market, those types of conditions still exist. One unique attribute of the transaction is that we were able to get an asset step up, which provides us with tax yield going forward. And as we look at that tax yield, we felt that it both reduced the effect of purchase price for us and reduced in effect the amount of equity that we were ultimately committing to the transaction. So we have a little bit of a perfect storm in terms of very attractive financing markets, attractive properties and attractive tax attributes, which made Bresnan in particular, we think a very special transaction. The properties that we see from time to time in the marketplace really just haven't come to that level of attractiveness, but we continue to look. And we are hopeful we'll see something that matches the quality at some point in the future. Tom, I don't know if you want to add anything?"

Well, on the RS-DVR, as we said previously, it allows us to take our existing set-top boxes and essentially by downloading software to already deployed boxes turn them into a DVR. So in a house today, which we typically have less than two DVRs per home, significantly less than two DVRs per home, we can tear all of the set-top boxes in the home into a DVR through this technology. We can buy storage at a lower unit cost per gigabit stored, essentially than we can through distributed products like physical DVRs. And we have a better business model in terms of upgrades. We can upgrade subscribers electronically without doing a physical trip. So it has a significant impact not only on capital but ultimately on operating cost for the business. With regard to the retrans, it had an impact in the fourth quarter that was significant. As you know, we were growing subs in the first and second quarter, although the economy  was still impacting the business in household formation and that really hasn't changed. Third quarter, which is our seasonally weakest quarter. We did lose video customers.

You see various programmers talking about TV Everywhere and I use the word TV Everywhere-like services. Companies may want as part of their philosophy, serving more customers, programming companies may want to have programming distributed both on cable and the Internet when they have a customer relationship with the distributor like Cablevision. And we have the technical capability of doing that. Our applications that we are currently deploying don't do that. When you think about VOD, a movie company, we certainly want to be able to monetize video-on-demand transactionally in the home and out of the home. And so there's an opportunity to make money outside the home and to charge for it. There are other programming models that will work outside the home as well for programmers. And I think there are a series of opportunities there that we need to explore mutually with programmers and create new value propositions. So you can look at it as a value-add product, which is what TV Everywhere is, make sure your customer has the content that they purchased from you everywhere they need it or want it where or you can look at as an add-on service that creates additional buying opportunities and I think both of those model work."

Interestingly, when you think about an iPad app, it is wireless in the house. 70% of our customers have wireless WiFi installed in their house today. And we as I said earlier in my comments, we are the largest provider of outdoor WiFi of any distributor in the country. So customers have lots of devices both within the home and out of the home, they can use WiFi. The capability of being higher capacity in terms of speed than the 4G networks currently being deployed. And as you know, with the AT&T's experience, the existing cellular networks have a hard time managing data on the device the way customers want to use it. And WiFi is in adjunct to that and allows our relationship with the customer to improve their wireless service. As we put our products in IP, if you think about television on an Apple device are iPad or any other Android device in the home, the device is acting as a television. It's acting as a set-top box simultaneously. New TV is being sold at IP inputs into them. And so because we've now put our whole product in IP for in-home distribution and we are capable of uploading it out of the home too, technically, we have the ability to serve TVs without set-top boxes. So to the extent that the processing power in TV is capable of taking our signal and acting as a set-top box, we'll probably develop that application with television vendors, like you saw demoed at CES. And I think it's an opportunity further to get out of the hardware purchasing business at the CPE level. I think we'll be buying CPE for years to come but the trends are toward the customer having that integrated into the devices."

And we are using it essentially, it's the product we go to market with in the service areas where we rolled it out. The interesting thing about the technology is it does allow us to think about pricing differently going forward. We haven't done that yet. We are still in the rollout phase but we could do free previews of the DVR. We could do a very limited storage by programming, includes buy programs, and include that as part of another package. We could expand the storage capability and sell that as an incremental price opportunity for us and for customers. And so there are a variety of ways of looking at the DVR that is currently in the market and breaking that into various components and selling it even for less or for more depending on how you put it together. So we are excited about the opportunities and the flexibility the RS-DVR model gives us. For instance, if we want to double the capacity of every DVR in the system and we can do that would just by buying the storage essentially. The second part of your question though talks about how much storage do we actually need? We have not entered into single copy contracts with programmers, but it is an opportunity for us and for programmers to use the DVR technology in a way that would make it more efficient for us, essentially an opportunity for the programmer, either from an advertising perspective or from a how their program is featured perspective.

Following the discussion of the company's fourth quarter 2010 results, we will open the call for questions. If you don't have a copy of today's earnings release, it is available on our website at cablevision.com. This call can also be accessed via our website.

This discussion of Cablevision's results may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Let me point out that on Page 5 of today's earnings release, we provided consolidated operations data and a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow or AOCF to operating income. Finally, I would like to point out that we have reclassified our business segments slightly to report them in a manner consistent with how we intend to operate them following the proposed spin-off of Rainbow. As a result that the neutral results of News 12, our local news channel, and the net expenses of RASCO, our advertising sales company, are no longer reflected in Rainbow's results and are now classified as Other. Also, Newsday is now included with our other local media assets in Other. 
I will now turn the call over to Cablevision's President and CEO, Jim Dolan."

Cablevision accomplished a great deal in 2010. We completed the spin-off of Madison Square Garden, increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, announced and completed the Bresnan acquisition, initiated the stock repurchase program and finalized a number of financing transactions that significantly improved our debt maturity profile. And we accomplished all this while continuing to execute well operationally. 
For the fourth quarter, continuing growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses led to 6% increase in consolidated revenue, while AOCF grew 2%. These results include the addition of the newly acquired Bresnan properties beginning last December 14. 
For the full year, Cablevision's consolidated revenue increased 6% to $7.2 billion, and AOCF grew 6% to $2.6 billion. Cablevision generated more than $855 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, a 13% improvement over 2009. The company also continued to experience positive momentum in the advertising market. In fact, both Cable and Rainbow delivered double-digit increases in advertising revenue for all four quarters of 2010. We are pleased with our solid performance this past year. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we will remain focused on returning value to shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. In keeping with that plan, Cablevision's Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million increase in the stock repurchase program, bringing our total program to $1 billion. The Board has also approved the $0.0125 per share dividend payable in March. 
In addition, the company continues to move forward with the spin-off of the Rainbow businesses. Rainbow has an impressive portfolio of programming assets as well as an excellent management team. While there is still a lot to accomplish before the spin could be completed, I have no doubt that there is a wonderful future ahead for Rainbow. 
I am also extremely optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cable as we remain committed to providing even better products and services to our customers now and in the future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge, who will address our Telecom businesses."

We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010. The financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 h",977,"Thank you, Jim and good morning. We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010. The financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 high-speed data customers and 9,200 voice customers in historic Cablevision market. Basic fibers declined by 1%, almost all of which is attributable to our decision to contest the retransmission consent demand. While the SEC has begun to visit this issue in a preceding, we have finished multiyear agreements with all the major station groups in our service areas. 
With the acquisition of Bresnan, we have added 306,000 basic video customers, 205,000 digital customers, 239,000 data customers and 131,000 voice customers. The Bresnan footprint has approximately 650,000 passing. As I said, the Bresnan acquisition closed on December 14, and we're beginning to implement tactics, which have been successful at Cablevision, including adding high-definition programming, offering the triple play, increasing the speeds of the high-speed data Internet service and providing inexpensive voice service. We're excited about our prospects. 
Year-over-year, Telecom revenue growth without Bresnan was 5.2%, while AOCF growth was 6%. AOCF for the quarter was affected by retransmission marketing costs and with costs associated with the termination of the agreement Bresnan had with a third-party voice provisioning company. We have merged Cablevision voice operation with those of Bresnan, and in the process decreased the costs associated with providing voice services for these properties meaningfully. 
Advertising revenue continued its strong performance with 23% growth versus last year's fourth quarter x Bresnan. Advanced advertising applications are making a sizable contribution. Even more importantly, these platforms helped to contribute the growth in traditional advertising sales. 
Optimum business saw a steady growth throughout 2010. We're now capable of serving more than 650,000 small and medium businesses, and we provide at least one level of service to over 25% of this universe. The average residential voice customer has one line of service. The average Optimum business customer has 2.8. As a result, we have not raised prices for the Optimum business service much like our Residential business. RPS naturally will grow through the use of more services. 
Our high-speed data customers used Optimum WiFi to access the mobile Internet over 50 million times last year, a 500% increase over 2009's 8 million sessions. In addition to the nation's largest outdoor WiFi network, we've installed Optimum WiFi in over 6,000 retail locations, restaurants, coffee shops, et cetera, that are customers of Optimum business purposes. All Optimum WiFi locations are listed in search of it on optimumwifi.com. 
Total Cable capital spending was $206 million in the quarter, and for the year, $682 million. 2010 full year spending was higher than the prior year primarily due to the upfront expenditures on RS-DVR, which will be offset in future declines in CPE. CPE capital continues to decline consistent with our expectations. Capital intensity or capital as a percentage of revenue for 2010 was 12.5%.  
We now enter 2011 with a number of new projects underway and ready for launch. Our new RS-DVR remote storage DVR service has been launched in New York city. This is the only DVR service we're offering in the service area and is branded as DVR Plus. The service allows our customers to record up to four shows at once and watch any show on any TV in the house at the same time. All-digital set-tops in the home can access this service, a true all-home DVR solution. And as planned, we'd now stop by in physical DVRs. Our plan is to ultimately serve our entire footprint as we complete the transition to all-digital. 
We will launch PC to TV Media Relay, now called and branded Optimum Link this quarter. As Internet usage continues to grow, we're providing our customers with the ability to view what is on or available to their PC on their television without the need for a new set-top box or a new TV with built-in IP connectivity. Downloadable security has successfully launched our set-top boxes. For comparable capable CPE, we save almost $50 per box on all future set-top boxes we need to purchase. 
Finally, we have three separate applications for use with the Apple iPad. First, we've rolled out remote DVR scheduling, which allows customers to fully manage their home DVRs from any iPad anywhere it's connected to the Internet. We've also developed an application to use the iPad for navigation in the home only, making it a streamlined guide and remote control for all TVs in the house. And last, customers who will be able to use their iPad as another television in the home, watching Cable Television in the iPad in the home only. All three of these apps will be in service this quarter. 
In the future, we will extend these apps to Android devices. And separately, we will launch additional apps which will allow video on demand, subscription video on demand, download to own and rent and TV everywhere-like services to be seen outside the home, where we've entered into rights agreements with content owners that so allow. 
At Optimum Lightpath, where we serve a larger commercial customer base, fourth quarter revenue growth was 9%, while AOCF grew by 18% as compared with the full year. The Lightpath business now has over 4,400 buildings on net, and across this network, now generates operating margins of over 40%, clearly the result of a more deeply deployed ethernet offering. 
We added a subscriber chart in the earnings release, which integrates Lightpath large customers and cable company's small business and residential customers and shows the total voice lines we are now selling in our footprint. You can see that we have almost as many voice lines. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In ad",660,"Thank you, Tom. As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In addition, when we refer to the national networks, we now include the results of Sundance Channel. So that lineup is now comprised of AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel. So with that, I'll address Rainbow's financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased by 14% to $298 million, while AOCF for the quarter was up 24% to $101 million as compared to the prior year. The revenue growth for the quarter versus the prior year came primarily from the national networks, including the 21% increase in ad revenue and a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. 
While most of this advertising revenue growth was generated by AMC and WE tv, IFC sponsor for sales also contributed to the incremental ad revenue in the quarter. The quarterly revenue growth at AMC was driven by double-digit increases in both CPMs and units sold, while WE tv also experienced high single-digit increases in CPMs and ad units sold for the quarter. Rainbow's AOCF increase of 24% was principally a result of these high revenues, offset somewhat by the planned increase in original programming and associated market costs. 
Turning to the full year results. Total revenue increased by 11% to approximately $1.1 billion, while AOCF increased 10% to $403 million as compared to the prior year. For the year, the national networks had a 17% increase in ad revenue, a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. AMC and WE tv were responsible for the lion share of the advertising revenue growth. 
Similar to the fourth quarter results, AMC and WE tv delivered increases in units sold and CPMs. For the full year, Rainbow's AOCF increased by 10%, principally a result of these higher revenues, partially offset by the planned increases in programming costs, and to a lesser extent, to increase marketing costs. 
As we look back on 2010, we see the results of our multiyear focus on original programming. The national networks combined delivered double-digit growth in the ad revenue in all four quarters of 2010. WE tv had its best year ever in sales prime delivery among the key demographics that we target, women 18 to 49. AMC's new series called, The Walking Dead, premiered as the number one drama series in basic cable history among target adults 18 to 49. Season 1 averaged the household rating of 3.5 with 5.2 million total viewers across each of the six episodes. The series returns in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Using original programming as the backbone of our schedule, we expanded our global distribution. AMC and IFC now have a presence in Canada that's substantial, and our other national networks are distributed in Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, France, Belgium and other countries in Europe. Continuing a four-year run of award nominations and wins, AMC received 29 Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for our dramatic series, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and the new series, The Walking Dead. 
Last month, the Sundance Channel won its first ever Golden Globe Award for the miniseries called, Carlos, in the category of Best Movie or Miniseries. For 2011, we will continue our original programming strategy with new series on AMC, including something called, The Killing, a police drama premiering in April and Hell on Wheels, a western, coming later this year. 
IFC premiered two original series a few weeks ago, one called, Portlandia, and the other, the Onion News Network. Both shows have outperformed IFC's prime time average by a factor of two. Our commitment to creating strong original programming is at the core of our strategy for the future. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will provide a financial overview of the company."

With respect to leverage and liquidity, the company's consolidated cash position at year end was $394 million and net debt was $12.1 billion. At December 31, $659 million of the CSC Holdings, $1.4 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn. As of December 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.2x, excluding the effect of the Bresnan acquisition, and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.6x. 
Rainbow National Services had approximately $1.1 billion of debt and $530 million undrawn on its revolving credit facilities at December 31, and the ratio under the RNS bond leverage as of December 31 was 2.6x. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the Bresnan properties on December 14. 
The Bresnan acquisition is structured as a newly formed, unrestricted subsidiary of Cablevision. The transaction was valued at $1.365 billion, subject to certain adjustments, and was financed through an equity contribution of approximately $400 million and non-recourse debt of approximately $1 billion. The newly formed subsidiaries capital structure consists of a $75 million revolving credit facility, a $765 million term loan facility priced at LIBOR plus 300 with a LIBOR floor at 150 and $250 million of 8% senior notes due 2018. 
Regarding the Rainbow spend and the distribution to Cablevision, we continue to make progress and are hopeful that the transaction will take place by the end of the second quarter. There is still a number of important steps to be completed, including receipt of the IRS ruling, the filing and effectiveness of the Form 10 and completion of the proposed financing. We anticipate filing the initial Form 10 during March. 
Our intent is to refinance the existing RNS debt of $1.1 billion and obtain additional financing of approximately $1.25 billion, which will be used to reduce existing borrowings at CSC Holdings. As Jim mentioned, our Board has increased our repurchase authorization by $500 million for a total authorization of $1 billion. 
In reference to our share repurchase program, we purchased 4.8 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $33.40 during the fourth quarter. Through February 15, we have repurchased 15.6 million shares for a total of $480.5 million or $3.89 per share under the initial $500 million authorization. This recent case of repurchases has been greater than in past quarters, and we will continue to be opportunistic in our growth to share repurchase, but you should not necessarily extrapolate recent activity into future quarters. 
In total, we returned $457 million to shareholders in 2010 through a combination of $141 million of dividends and the share repurchase. Our intention for 2011 is to stay at the course, maintaining a balanced approach to the utilization of our free cash flow and leverage capacity. We intend to continue our repurchase program and would like to find more attractive acquisitions in the present, although so far such opportunities have proven to be few and far between. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to ask that we keep the focus of your questions on the result of the businesses. We understand that you maybe curious about some of the information, which will be contained in the Form 10 for the Rainbow spend, but let's wait for the filing before we address those specific types of questions. 
Operator, if we can now open the call for questions?"

Can you just give us a sense of what it was about the Bresnan properties that struck you sort of unique in the marketplace relative to what you're seeing now?

The plant had been operated. I think that we saw marketing opportunities. And really, they bring our management team to bear on what we saw as essentially underpenetrated assets. That's the operating side. And then I'll peg you with the financial side in a second, and Tom may want to add something to the operating side. On the financial side, the non-recourse debt certainly was available to us at roughly, let's call it, 6x AOCF. I think in today's market, that those types of conditions still exist. One unique attribute of the transaction is that we were able to get an asset step up, which provides us with tax shield going forward. And as we looked at that tax shield, we felt that it both reduced the effect of purchase price to us and it reduced, in effect, the amount of equity that we were ultimately committing to the transaction. So we had a little bit of a perfect storm in terms of very attractive financing markets, attractive properties and attractive tax attributes, which made Bresnan, in particular, we think a very special transaction. The properties that we see from time to time in the marketplace really just haven't come up to that level of attractiveness, but we continue to look. And we're hopeful we'll see something that matches that quality at some point in the future. Tom, I don't know if you wanted to add anything?"

Well, on the RS-DVR, as we've said previously, it allows us to take our existing set-top boxes and essentially by downloading software to the already deployed boxes turn them into a DVR. So in a house today, which we typically have less than two DVRs per home, significantly less than two DVRs per home, we can tear in all of the set-top boxes in the home into a DVR through this technology. We can buy storage at a lower unit cost per gigabit stored centrally than we can through distributed products like physical DVRs. And we have a better business model in terms of upgrades. We can upgrade subscribers electronically without doing a physical trip. So it has a significant impact, not only on capital, but ultimately on operating cost for the business. With regard to the retrans, it had an impact in the fourth quarter that was significant. As you know, we were growing subs in the first and second quarter, although the economy was still impacting the business in household formation and that really hasn't changed. Third quarter, which is our seasonally weakest quarter, we did lose video customers. In the fourth quarter, we think that almost all of the either decreased sales or disconnects, which are about 50/50, results from the retrans bite.

You see various programmers talking about TV Everywhere, and I used the word TV Everywhere-like services. Companies may want, as part of their philosophy, serving more customers, programming companies may want to have programming distributed both on cable and the Internet when they have a customer relationship with a distributor like Cablevision. And we have the technical capability of doing that. Our applications that we're currently deploying don't do that. When you think about VOD, a movie company, you'd certainly want to be able to monetize video-on-demand transactionally in the home and out of the home. And so there's an opportunity to make money outside the home and to charge for it. There are other programming models that will work outside the home as well for programmers, and I think there are a series of opportunities there that we need to explore mutually with programmers and create new value propositions. So you can look at it as a value-add product, which is what TV Everywhere is. Make sure your customer has the content that they have purchased from you everywhere they need it or want it, or you can look at it as an adds-on service that creates additional buying opportunities. And I think both of those model will work."

Interestingly, when you think about an iPad app, it is wireless in the house. 70% of our customers have wireless WiFi installed in their house today. And as I said earlier in my comments, we're the largest provider of outdoor WiFi of any distributor in the country. So customers have lots of devices both in the home and out of home that can use WiFi. WiFi has the capability of being higher capacity in terms of speed than the 4G networks currently being deployed. And as you know, with the AT&T's experience, the existing cellular networks have a hard time managing data on the devices the way customers want to use, it. And WiFi is an adjunct to that and allows our relationship with the customer to improve their wireless service. As we put our products in IP, if you think about television on an Apple device or an iPad or any other Android device in the home, the device is acting as a television. It's acting as a set-top box simultaneously. New TVs being sold have IP inputs into them. And so because we've now put our whole product in IP for in-home distribution and we're capable of putting it out of the home too technically, we have the ability to serve TVs without set-top boxes. So to the extent the processing power in TV is capable of taking our signal and acting as a set-top box, we'll probably develop that application with television vendors, like you saw demoed at CES. And I think it's an opportunity further to get out of the hardware purchasing business at the CPE level. I think we'll be buying CPE for years to come, but the trends are toward the customer having that integrated into their devices."

Essentially, it's the product we go to market with in the service areas where we've rolled it out. The interesting thing about the technology is it does allow us to think about pricing differently going forward. We haven't done that yet. We're still in the rollout phase, but we could do free previews of DVR. We could do a very limited storage by programming, include buy programs and include that as part of another package. We could expand the storage capability and sell that as an incremental price opportunity for us and for customers. And so there are a variety of ways of looking at the DVR that is currently in the market and breaking that into various components and selling it even for less or for more depending on how you put it together. So we're excited about the opportunities and the flexibility the RS-DVR model gives us. For instance, if we want to double the capacity of every DVR in the system, we can do that would just by buying the storage essentially. The second part of your question though talks about how much storage do we actually need. We have not entered into single copy contracts with programmers, but it is an opportunity for us and for programmers to use the DVR technology in a way that would make it more efficient for us, essentially an opportunity for the programmer either from an advertising perspective or from a how their programming is featured perspective. And so there's more to come on the whole RS-DVR infrastructure in terms of the opportunities it creates for us. But it gives us a lot of flexibility.

Joining us this morning are members of the Cablevision Executive Team, including Jim Dolan, President and CEO; Tom Rutledge, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Huseby, Chief Financial Officer; Josh Sapan, President and CEO of Rainbow Media; John Bickham, President of Cable and Communications; and Gregg Seibert, Executive Vice President. 
Following the discussion of the company's fourth quarter 2010 results, we will open the call for questions. If you don't have a copy of today's earnings release, it is available on our website at cablevision.com. This call can also be accessed via our website. 
Please take note of the following. This discussion of Cablevision's results may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ.

The company disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements that may be discussed during this call. 
Let me point out that on Page 5 of today's earnings release, we provided consolidated operations data and a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow or AOCF to operating income. Finally, I would like to point out that we have reclassified our business segments slightly to report them in a manner consistent with how we intend to operate them following the proposed spin-off of Rainbow. As a result that the neutral results of News 12, our local news channel, and the net expenses of RASCO, our advertising sales company, are no longer reflected in Rainbow's results and are now classified as Other. Also, Newsday is now included with our other local media assets in Other. 
I will now turn the call over to Cablevision's President and CEO, Jim Dolan."

Cablevision accomplished a great deal in 2010. We completed the spin-off of Madison Square Garden, increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, announced and completed the Bresnan acquisition, initiated the stock repurchase program and finalized a number of financing transactions that significantly improved our debt maturity profile. And we accomplished all this while continuing to execute well operationally. 
For the fourth quarter, continuing growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses led to 6% increase in consolidated revenue, while AOCF grew 2%. These results include the addition of the newly acquired Bresnan properties beginning last December 14. 
For the full year, Cablevision's consolidated revenue increased 6% to $7.2 billion, and AOCF grew 6% to $2.6 billion. Cablevision generated more than $855 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, a 13% improvement over 2009. The company also continued to experience positive momentum in the advertising market. In fact, both Cable and Rainbow delivered double-digit increases in advertising revenue for all four quarters of 2010. We are pleased with our solid performance this past year. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we will remain focused on returning value to shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. In keeping with that plan, Cablevision's Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million increase in the stock repurchase program, bringing our total program to $1 billion. The Board has also approved the $0.0125 per share dividend payable in March. 
In addition, the company continues to move forward with the spin-off of the Rainbow businesses. Rainbow has an impressive portfolio of programming assets as well as an excellent management team. While there is still a lot to accomplish before the spin could be completed, I have no doubt that there is a wonderful future ahead for Rainbow. 
I am also extremely optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cable as we remain committed to providing even better products and services to our customers now and in the future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge, who will address our Telecom businesses."

We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010. The financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 h",977,"Thank you, Jim and good morning. We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010. The financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 high-speed data customers and 9,200 voice customers in historic Cablevision market. Basic fibers declined by 1%, almost all of which is attributable to our decision to contest the retransmission consent demand. While the SEC has begun to visit this issue in a preceding, we have finished multiyear agreements with all the major station groups in our service areas. 
With the acquisition of Bresnan, we have added 306,000 basic video customers, 205,000 digital customers, 239,000 data customers and 131,000 voice customers. The Bresnan footprint has approximately 650,000 passing. As I said, the Bresnan acquisition closed on December 14, and we're beginning to implement tactics, which have been successful at Cablevision, including adding high-definition programming, offering the triple play, increasing the speeds of the high-speed data Internet service and providing inexpensive voice service. We're excited about our prospects. 
Year-over-year, Telecom revenue growth without Bresnan was 5.2%, while AOCF growth was 6%. AOCF for the quarter was affected by retransmission marketing costs and with costs associated with the termination of the agreement Bresnan had with a third-party voice provisioning company. We have merged Cablevision voice operation with those of Bresnan, and in the process decreased the costs associated with providing voice services for these properties meaningfully. 
Advertising revenue continued its strong performance with 23% growth versus last year's fourth quarter x Bresnan. Advanced advertising applications are making a sizable contribution. Even more importantly, these platforms helped to contribute the growth in traditional advertising sales. 
Optimum business saw a steady growth throughout 2010. We're now capable of serving more than 650,000 small and medium businesses, and we provide at least one level of service to over 25% of this universe. The average residential voice customer has one line of service. The average Optimum business customer has 2.8. As a result, we have not raised prices for the Optimum business service much like our Residential business. RPS naturally will grow through the use of more services. 
Our high-speed data customers used Optimum WiFi to access the mobile Internet over 50 million times last year, a 500% increase over 2009's 8 million sessions. In addition to the nation's largest outdoor WiFi network, we've installed Optimum WiFi in over 6,000 retail locations, restaurants, coffee shops, et cetera, that are customers of Optimum business purposes. All Optimum WiFi locations are listed in search of it on optimumwifi.com. 
Total Cable capital spending was $206 million in the quarter, and for the year, $682 million. 2010 full year spending was higher than the prior year primarily due to the upfront expenditures on RS-DVR, which will be offset in future declines in CPE. CPE capital continues to decline consistent with our expectations. Capital intensity or capital as a percentage of revenue for 2010 was 12.5%.  
We now enter 2011 with a number of new projects underway and ready for launch. Our new RS-DVR remote storage DVR service has been launched in New York city. This is the only DVR service we're offering in the service area and is branded as DVR Plus. The service allows our customers to record up to four shows at once and watch any show on any TV in the house at the same time. All-digital set-tops in the home can access this service, a true all-home DVR solution. And as planned, we'd now stop by in physical DVRs. Our plan is to ultimately serve our entire footprint as we complete the transition to all-digital. 
We will launch PC to TV Media Relay, now called and branded Optimum Link this quarter. As Internet usage continues to grow, we're providing our customers with the ability to view what is on or available to their PC on their television without the need for a new set-top box or a new TV with built-in IP connectivity. Downloadable security has successfully launched our set-top boxes. For comparable capable CPE, we save almost $50 per box on all future set-top boxes we need to purchase. 
Finally, we have three separate applications for use with the Apple iPad. First, we've rolled out remote DVR scheduling, which allows customers to fully manage their home DVRs from any iPad anywhere it's connected to the Internet. We've also developed an application to use the iPad for navigation in the home only, making it a streamlined guide and remote control for all TVs in the house. And last, customers who will be able to use their iPad as another television in the home, watching Cable Television in the iPad in the home only. All three of these apps will be in service this quarter. 
In the future, we will extend these apps to Android devices. And separately, we will launch additional apps which will allow video on demand, subscription video on demand, download to own and rent and TV everywhere-like services to be seen outside the home, where we've entered into rights agreements with content owners that so allow. 
At Optimum Lightpath, where we serve a larger commercial customer base, fourth quarter revenue growth was 9%, while AOCF grew by 18% as compared with the full year. The Lightpath business now has over 4,400 buildings on net, and across this network, now generates operating margins of over 40%, clearly the result of a more deeply deployed ethernet offering. 
We added a subscriber chart in the earnings release, which integrates Lightpath large customers and cable company's small business and residential customers and shows the total voice lines we are now selling in our footprint. You can see that we have almost as many voice lines. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In ad",660,"Thank you, Tom. As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In addition, when we refer to the national networks, we now include the results of Sundance Channel. So that lineup is now comprised of AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel. So with that, I'll address Rainbow's financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased by 14% to $298 million, while AOCF for the quarter was up 24% to $101 million as compared to the prior year. The revenue growth for the quarter versus the prior year came primarily from the national networks, including the 21% increase in ad revenue and a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. 
While most of this advertising revenue growth was generated by AMC and WE tv, IFC sponsor for sales also contributed to the incremental ad revenue in the quarter. The quarterly revenue growth at AMC was driven by double-digit increases in both CPMs and units sold, while WE tv also experienced high single-digit increases in CPMs and ad units sold for the quarter. Rainbow's AOCF increase of 24% was principally a result of these high revenues, offset somewhat by the planned increase in original programming and associated market costs. 
Turning to the full year results. Total revenue increased by 11% to approximately $1.1 billion, while AOCF increased 10% to $403 million as compared to the prior year. For the year, the national networks had a 17% increase in ad revenue, a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. AMC and WE tv were responsible for the lion share of the advertising revenue growth. 
Similar to the fourth quarter results, AMC and WE tv delivered increases in units sold and CPMs. For the full year, Rainbow's AOCF increased by 10%, principally a result of these higher revenues, partially offset by the planned increases in programming costs, and to a lesser extent, to increase marketing costs. 
As we look back on 2010, we see the results of our multiyear focus on original programming. The national networks combined delivered double-digit growth in the ad revenue in all four quarters of 2010. WE tv had its best year ever in sales prime delivery among the key demographics that we target, women 18 to 49. AMC's new series called, The Walking Dead, premiered as the number one drama series in basic cable history among target adults 18 to 49. Season 1 averaged the household rating of 3.5 with 5.2 million total viewers across each of the six episodes. The series returns in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Using original programming as the backbone of our schedule, we expanded our global distribution. AMC and IFC now have a presence in Canada that's substantial, and our other national networks are distributed in Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, France, Belgium and other countries in Europe. Continuing a four-year run of award nominations and wins, AMC received 29 Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for our dramatic series, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and the new series, The Walking Dead. 
Last month, the Sundance Channel won its first ever Golden Globe Award for the miniseries called, Carlos, in the category of Best Movie or Miniseries. For 2011, we will continue our original programming strategy with new series on AMC, including something called, The Killing, a police drama premiering in April and Hell on Wheels, a western, coming later this year. 
IFC premiered two original series a few weeks ago, one called, Portlandia, and the other, the Onion News Network. Both shows have outperformed IFC's prime time average by a factor of two. Our commitment to creating strong original programming is at the core of our strategy for the future. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will provide a financial overview of the company."

With respect to leverage and liquidity, the company's consolidated cash position at year end was $394 million and net debt was $12.1 billion. At December 31, $659 million of the CSC Holdings, $1.4 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn. As of December 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.2x, excluding the effect of the Bresnan acquisition, and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.6x. 
Rainbow National Services had approximately $1.1 billion of debt and $530 million undrawn on its revolving credit facilities at December 31, and the ratio under the RNS bond leverage as of December 31 was 2.6x. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the Bresnan properties on December 14. 
The Bresnan acquisition is structured as a newly formed, unrestricted subsidiary of Cablevision. The transaction was valued at $1.365 billion, subject to certain adjustments, and was financed through an equity contribution of approximately $400 million and non-recourse debt of approximately $1 billion. The newly formed subsidiaries capital structure consists of a $75 million revolving credit facility, a $765 million term loan facility priced at LIBOR plus 300 with a LIBOR floor at 150 and $250 million of 8% senior notes due 2018. 
Regarding the Rainbow spend and the distribution to Cablevision, we continue to make progress and are hopeful that the transaction will take place by the end of the second quarter. There is still a number of important steps to be completed, including receipt of the IRS ruling, the filing and effectiveness of the Form 10 and completion of the proposed financing. We anticipate filing the initial Form 10 during March. 
Our intent is to refinance the existing RNS debt of $1.1 billion and obtain additional financing of approximately $1.25 billion, which will be used to reduce existing borrowings at CSC Holdings. As Jim mentioned, our Board has increased our repurchase authorization by $500 million for a total authorization of $1 billion. 
In reference to our share repurchase program, we purchased 4.8 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $33.40 during the fourth quarter. Through February 15, we have repurchased 15.6 million shares for a total of $480.5 million or $3.89 per share under the initial $500 million authorization. This recent case of repurchases has been greater than in past quarters, and we will continue to be opportunistic in our growth to share repurchase, but you should not necessarily extrapolate recent activity into future quarters. 
In total, we returned $457 million to shareholders in 2010 through a combination of $141 million of dividends and the share repurchase. Our intention for 2011 is to stay at the course, maintaining a balanced approach to the utilization of our free cash flow and leverage capacity. We intend to continue our repurchase program and would like to find more attractive acquisitions in the present, although so far such opportunities have proven to be few and far between. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to ask that we keep the focus of your questions on the result of the businesses. We understand that you maybe curious about some of the information, which will be contained in the Form 10 for the Rainbow spend, but let's wait for the filing before we address those specific types of questions. 
Operator, if we can now open the call for questions?"

Can you just give us a sense of what it was about the Bresnan properties that struck you sort of unique in the marketplace relative to what you're seeing now?

The plant had been operated. I think that we saw marketing opportunities. And really, they bring our management team to bear on what we saw as essentially underpenetrated assets. That's the operating side. And then I'll peg you with the financial side in a second, and Tom may want to add something to the operating side. On the financial side, the non-recourse debt certainly was available to us at roughly, let's call it, 6x AOCF. I think in today's market, that those types of conditions still exist. One unique attribute of the transaction is that we were able to get an asset step up, which provides us with tax shield going forward. And as we looked at that tax shield, we felt that it both reduced the effect of purchase price to us and it reduced, in effect, the amount of equity that we were ultimately committing to the transaction. So we had a little bit of a perfect storm in terms of very attractive financing markets, attractive properties and attractive tax attributes, which made Bresnan, in particular, we think a very special transaction. The properties that we see from time to time in the marketplace really just haven't come up to that level of attractiveness, but we continue to look. And we're hopeful we'll see something that matches that quality at some point in the future. Tom, I don't know if you wanted to add anything?"

Well, on the RS-DVR, as we've said previously, it allows us to take our existing set-top boxes and essentially by downloading software to the already deployed boxes turn them into a DVR. So in a house today, which we typically have less than two DVRs per home, significantly less than two DVRs per home, we can tear in all of the set-top boxes in the home into a DVR through this technology. We can buy storage at a lower unit cost per gigabit stored centrally than we can through distributed products like physical DVRs. And we have a better business model in terms of upgrades. We can upgrade subscribers electronically without doing a physical trip. So it has a significant impact, not only on capital, but ultimately on operating cost for the business. With regard to the retrans, it had an impact in the fourth quarter that was significant. As you know, we were growing subs in the first and second quarter, although the economy was still impacting the business in household formation and that really hasn't changed. Third quarter, which is our seasonally weakest quarter, we did lose video customers. In the fourth quarter, we think that almost all of the either decreased sales or disconnects, which are about 50/50, results from the retrans bite.

You see various programmers talking about TV Everywhere, and I used the word TV Everywhere-like services. Companies may want, as part of their philosophy, serving more customers, programming companies may want to have programming distributed both on cable and the Internet when they have a customer relationship with a distributor like Cablevision. And we have the technical capability of doing that. Our applications that we're currently deploying don't do that. When you think about VOD, a movie company, you'd certainly want to be able to monetize video-on-demand transactionally in the home and out of the home. And so there's an opportunity to make money outside the home and to charge for it. There are other programming models that will work outside the home as well for programmers, and I think there are a series of opportunities there that we need to explore mutually with programmers and create new value propositions. So you can look at it as a value-add product, which is what TV Everywhere is. Make sure your customer has the content that they have purchased from you everywhere they need it or want it, or you can look at it as an adds-on service that creates additional buying opportunities. And I think both of those model will work."

Interestingly, when you think about an iPad app, it is wireless in the house. 70% of our customers have wireless WiFi installed in their house today. And as I said earlier in my comments, we're the largest provider of outdoor WiFi of any distributor in the country. So customers have lots of devices both in the home and out of home that can use WiFi. WiFi has the capability of being higher capacity in terms of speed than the 4G networks currently being deployed. And as you know, with the AT&T's experience, the existing cellular networks have a hard time managing data on the devices the way customers want to use, it. And WiFi is an adjunct to that and allows our relationship with the customer to improve their wireless service. As we put our products in IP, if you think about television on an Apple device or an iPad or any other Android device in the home, the device is acting as a television. It's acting as a set-top box simultaneously. New TVs being sold have IP inputs into them. And so because we've now put our whole product in IP for in-home distribution and we're capable of putting it out of the home too technically, we have the ability to serve TVs without set-top boxes. So to the extent the processing power in TV is capable of taking our signal and acting as a set-top box, we'll probably develop that application with television vendors, like you saw demoed at CES. And I think it's an opportunity further to get out of the hardware purchasing business at the CPE level. I think we'll be buying CPE for years to come, but the trends are toward the customer having that integrated into their devices."

Essentially, it's the product we go to market with in the service areas where we've rolled it out. The interesting thing about the technology is it does allow us to think about pricing differently going forward. We haven't done that yet. We're still in the rollout phase, but we could do free previews of DVR. We could do a very limited storage by programming, include buy programs and include that as part of another package. We could expand the storage capability and sell that as an incremental price opportunity for us and for customers. And so there are a variety of ways of looking at the DVR that is currently in the market and breaking that into various components and selling it even for less or for more depending on how you put it together. So we're excited about the opportunities and the flexibility the RS-DVR model gives us. For instance, if we want to double the capacity of every DVR in the system, we can do that would just by buying the storage essentially. The second part of your question though talks about how much storage do we actually need. We have not entered into single copy contracts with programmers, but it is an opportunity for us and for programmers to use the DVR technology in a way that would make it more efficient for us, essentially an opportunity for the programmer either from an advertising perspective or from a how their programming is featured perspective. And so there's more to come on the whole RS-DVR infrastructure in terms of the opportunities it creates for us. But it gives us a lot of flexibility.

Joining us this morning are members of the Cablevision Executive Team, including Jim Dolan, President and CEO; Tom Rutledge, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Huseby, Chief Financial Officer; Josh Sapan, President and CEO of Rainbow Media; John Bickham, President of Cable and Communications; and Gregg Seibert, Executive Vice President. 
Following the discussion of the company's fourth quarter 2010 results, we will open the call for questions. If you don't have a copy of today's earnings release, it is available on our website at cablevision.com. This call can also be accessed via our website.

This discussion of Cablevision's results may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ.

Let me point out that on Page 5 of today's earnings release, we provided consolidated operations data and a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow or AOCF to operating income. Finally, I would like to point out that we have reclassified our business segments slightly to report them in a manner consistent with how we intend to operate them, following the proposed spin-off of Rainbow. As a result, the financial results of News 12, our local news channel, and the net expenses of RASCO, our advertising sales company, are no longer reflected in Rainbow's results and are now classified as Other. Also, Newsday is now included with our other local media assets in Other. 
I will now turn the call over to Cablevision's President and CEO, Jim Dolan."

Well, Cablevision accomplished a great deal in 2010. We completed the spin-off of Madison Square Garden, increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, announced and completed the Bresnan acquisition, initiated a stock repurchase program and finalized a number of financing transactions that significantly improved our debt maturity profile. And we accomplished all this while continuing to execute well operationally. 
For the fourth quarter, continuing growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses led to 6% increase in consolidated revenue, while AOCF grew 2%. These results include the addition of the newly acquired Bresnan properties beginning last December 14. 
For the full year, Cablevision's consolidated revenue increased 6% to $7.2 billion, and AOCF grew 6% to $2.6 billion. Cablevision generated more than $855 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, a 13% improvement over 2009. The company also continued to experience positive momentum in the advertising market. In fact, both Cable and Rainbow delivered double-digit increases in advertising revenue for all four quarters of 2010. We are pleased with our solid performance this past year. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we will remain focused on returning value to shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. In keeping with that plan, Cablevision's Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million increase in the stock repurchase program, bringing our total program to $1 billion. The Board has also approved the $0.0125 per share dividend payable in March. 
In addition, the company continues to move forward with the spin-off of the Rainbow businesses. Rainbow has an impressive portfolio of programming assets as well as an excellent management team. While there is still a lot to accomplish before the spin could be completed, I have no doubt that there is a wonderful future ahead for Rainbow. 
I am also extremely optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cable as we remain committed to providing even better products and services to our customers now and in the future. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge, who will address our Telecom businesses."

We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010. The financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 h",980,"Thank you, Jim and good morning. We completed the acquisition of the Bresnan properties in mid-December of 2010. The financial results include those of Bresnan for that brief period of time at the end of December. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 5,500 high-speed data customers and 9,200 voice customers, an historic Cablevision market. Basic fibers declined by 1%, almost all of which is attributable to our decision to contest the retransmission consent demand. While the SEC has begun to visit this issue in a preceding, we have finished multiyear agreements with all the major station groups in our service areas. 
With the acquisition of Bresnan, we have added 306,000 basic video customers, 205,000 digital customers, 239,000 data customers and 131,000 voice customers. The Bresnan footprint has approximately 650,000 passing. As I said, the Bresnan acquisition closed on December 14, and we're beginning to implement tactics, which have been successful at Cablevision, including adding high-definition programming, offering the triple play, increasing the speeds of the high-speed data Internet service and providing inexpensive voice service. We're excited about our prospects. 
Year-over-year, Telecom revenue growth without Bresnan was 5.2%, while AOCF growth was 6%. AOCF for the quarter was affected by retransmission marketing costs and with costs associated with the termination of the agreement Bresnan had with a third-party voice provisioning company. We have merged Cablevision voice operation with those of Bresnan, and in the process decreased the costs associated with providing voice services for these properties meaningfully. 
Advertising revenue continued its strong performance with 23% growth versus last year's fourth quarter x Bresnan. Advanced advertising applications are making a sizable contribution. Even more importantly, these platforms helped to contribute the growth in traditional advertising sales. 
Optimum business saw steady growth throughout 2010. We're now capable of serving more than 650,000 small and medium businesses, and we provide at least one level of service to over 25% of this universe. The average residential voice customer has one line of service. The average Optimum business customer has 2.8%. As a result, we have not raised prices for the Optimum business service much like our Residential business. RPS naturally will grow through the use of more services.
Our high-speed data customers used Optimum WiFi to access the mobile Internet over 50 million times last year, a 500% increase over 2009's 8 million sessions. In addition to the nation's largest outdoor WiFi network, we've installed Optimum WiFi in over 6,000 retail locations, restaurants, coffee shops, et cetera, that are customers of Optimum business purposes. All Optimum WiFi locations are listed in search of it on optimumwifi.com. 
Total Cable capital spending was $206 million in the quarter, and for the year, $682 million. 2010 full year spending was higher than the prior year, primarily due to the upfront expenditures on RS-DVR, which will be offset in future declines in CPE. CPE capital continues to decline consistent with our expectations. Capital intensity or capital as a percentage of revenue for 2010 was 12.5%.  
We now enter 2011 with a number of new projects underway and ready for launch. Our new RS-DVR remote storage DVR service has been launched in New York City. This is the only DVR service we're offering in the service area and is branded as DVR Plus. This service allows our customers to record up to four shows at once, and watch any show on any TV in the house at the same time. All-digital set-tops in the home can access this service, a true all-home DVR solution. And as planned, we'd now stopped buying physical DVRs. Our plan is to ultimately serve our entire footprint as we complete the transition to all-digital. 
We will launch PC to TV Media Relay, now called and branded Optimum Link this quarter. As Internet usage continues to grow, we're providing our customers with the ability to view what is on or available to their PC on their television without the need for a new set-top box or a new TV with built-in IP connectivity. Downloadable security has successfully launched our new set-top boxes. For comparable capable CPE, we save almost $50 per box on all future set-top boxes we need to purchase. 
Finally, we have three separate applications for use with the Apple iPad. First, we've rolled out remote DVR scheduling, which allows customers to fully manage their home DVRs from any iPad anywhere it's connected to the Internet. We've also developed an application to use the iPad for navigation in the home only, making it a streamlined guide and remote control for all TVs in the house. And last, customers will be able to use their iPad as another television in the home, watching Cable Television in the iPad in the home only. All three of these apps will be in service this quarter. 
In the future, we will extend these apps to Android devices. And separately, we will launch additional apps which will allow video on demand, subscription video on demand, download to own and rent and TV everywhere-like services to be seen outside the home, where we've entered into rights agreements with content owners that so allow. 
At Optimum Lightpath, where we serve a larger commercial customer base, fourth quarter revenue growth was 9%, while AOCF grew by 18% as compared with the full year. The Lightpath business now has over 4,400 buildings on net, and across this network, it now generates operating margins of over 40%, clearly the result of a more deeply deployed Ethernet offering.
We added a subscriber chart in the earnings release, which integrates Lightpath large customers and cable company's small business and residential customers and shows the total voice lines we are now selling in our footprint. You can see that we have almost as many voice lines as you have [indiscernible].
I would now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In ad",660,"Thank you, Tom. As Pat mentioned, we have amended the segment reporting on Rainbow this quarter. And as a result, the News 12 operations and the Cable portion of Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation are now excluded from Rainbow's reported results. In addition, when we refer to the national networks, we now include the results of Sundance Channel. So that lineup is now comprised of AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel. So with that, I'll address Rainbow's financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased by 14% to $298 million, while AOCF for the quarter was up 24% to $101 million as compared to the prior year. The revenue growth for the quarter versus the prior year came primarily from the national networks, including the 21% increase in ad revenue and a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. 
While most of this advertising revenue growth was generated by AMC and WE tv, IFC sponsor for sales also contributed to the incremental ad revenue in the quarter. The quarterly revenue growth at AMC was driven by double-digit increases in both CPMs and units sold, while WE tv also experienced high single-digit increases in CPMs and ad units sold for the quarter. Rainbow's AOCF increase of 24% was principally a result of these higher revenues, offset somewhat by the planned increase in original programming and associated market costs. 
Turning to the full year results. Total revenue increased by 11% to approximately $1.1 billion, while AOCF increased 10% to $403 million as compared to the prior year. For the year, the national networks had a 17% increase in ad revenue, a 6% increase in affiliate revenue. AMC and WE tv were responsible for the lion share of the advertising revenue growth. 
Similar to the fourth quarter results, AMC and WE tv delivered increases in units sold and CPMs. For the full year, Rainbow's AOCF increased by 10%, principally a result of these higher revenues, partially offset by the planned increases in programming costs, and to a lesser extent, to increased marketing costs. 
As we look back on 2010, we see the results of our multiyear focus on original programming. The national networks combined delivered double-digit growth in the ad revenue in all four quarters of 2010. WE tv had its best year ever in sales prime delivery among the key demographics that we target, women 18 to 49. AMCs new series called, The Walking Dead, premiered as the number one drama series in basic cable history among target adults 18 to 49. Season 1 averaged the household rating of 3.5 with 5.2 million total viewers across each of the six episodes. The series returns in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Using original programming as the backbone of our schedule, we expanded our global distribution. AMC and IFC now have a presence in Canada that's substantial, and our other national networks are distributed in Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, France, Belgium and other countries in Europe. Continuing a four-year run of award nominations and wins, AMC received 29 Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for our dramatic series, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and the new series, The Walking Dead. 
Last month, the Sundance Channel won its first ever Golden Globe Award for the miniseries called, Carlos, in the category of Best Movie or Miniseries. For 2011, we will continue our original programming strategy with new series on AMC, including something called, The Killing, a police drama premiering in April, and Hell on Wheels, a western, coming later this year.
IFC premiered two original series a few weeks ago, one called, Portlandia, and the other, the Onion News Network. Both shows have outperformed IFCs prime time average by a factor of two. Our commitment to creating strong original programming is at the core of our strategy for the future.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will provide a financial overview of the company."

With respect to leverage and liquidity, the company's consolidated cash position at year end was $394 million and net debt was $12.1 billion. At December 31, $659 million of the CSC Holdings, $1.4 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn. As of December 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.2x, excluding the effect of the Bresnan acquisition, and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.6x. 
Rainbow National Services had approximately $1.1 billion of debt, and $530 million undrawn on its revolving credit facilities at December 31, and the ratio under the RNS bond leverage as of December 31 was 2.6x. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the Bresnan properties on December 14. 
The Bresnan acquisition is structured as a newly formed, unrestricted subsidiary of Cablevision. The transaction was valued at $1.365 billion, subject to certain adjustments, and was financed through an equity contribution of approximately $400 million and non-recourse debt of approximately $1 billion. The newly formed subsidiaries capital structure consists of a $75 million revolving credit facility, a $765 million term loan facility priced at LIBOR plus 300 with a LIBOR floor at 150 and $250 million of 8% senior notes due 2018. 
Regarding the Rainbow spend and the distribution to Cablevision, we continue to make progress and are hopeful that the transaction will take place by the end of the second quarter. There is still a number of important steps to be completed, including receipt of the IRS ruling, the filing and effectiveness of the Form 10 and completion of the proposed financing. We anticipate filing the initial Form 10 during March. 
Our intent is to refinance the existing RNS debt of $1.1 billion and obtain additional financing of approximately $1.25 billion, which will be used to reduce existing borrowings at CSC Holdings. As Jim mentioned, our Board has increased our repurchase authorization by $500 million for a total authorization of $1 billion. 
In reference to our share repurchase program, we purchased 4.8 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $33.40 during the fourth quarter. Through February 15, we have repurchased 15.6 million shares for a total of $480.5 million or $3.89 per share under the initial $500 million authorization. This recent case of repurchases has been greater than in past quarters, and we will continue to be opportunistic in our growth to share repurchase, but you should not necessarily extrapolate recent activity into future quarters. 
In total, we returned $457 million to shareholders in 2010 through a combination of $141 million of dividends and the share repurchase. Our intention for 2011 is to stay the course, maintaining a balanced approach to the utilization of our free cash flow and leverage capacity. We intend to continue our repurchase program and would like to find more attractive acquisitions in the present, although so far such opportunities have proven to be few and far between. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to ask that we keep the focus of your questions on the result of the businesses. We understand that you maybe curious about some of the information, which will be contained in the Form 10 for the Rainbow spend, but let's wait for the filing before we address those specific types of questions. 
Operator, if we can now open the call for questions?"

The plant had been operated. I think that we saw marketing opportunities. And really, they bring our management team to bear on what we saw as essentially underpenetrated assets. That's the operating side. And then I'll peg you with the financial side in a second, and Tom may want to add something to the operating side. On the financial side, the non-recourse debt certainly was available to us at roughly, let's call it, 6x AOCF. I think in today's market, that those types of conditions still exist. One unique attribute of the transaction is that we were able to get an asset step up, which provides us with tax shield going forward. And as we looked at that tax shield, we felt that it both reduced the effect of purchase price to us and it reduced, in effect, the amount of equity that we were ultimately committing to the transaction. So we had a little bit of a perfect storm in terms of very attractive financing markets, attractive properties and attractive tax attributes, which made Bresnan, in particular, we think a very special transaction. The properties that we see from time to time in the marketplace really just haven't come up to that level of attractiveness, but we continue to look. And we're hopeful we'll see something that matches that quality at some point in the future. Tom, I don't know if you wanted to add anything?"

Well, on the RS-DVR, as we've said previously, it allows us to take our existing set-top boxes and essentially by downloading software to the already deployed boxes turn them into a DVR. So in a house today, which we typically have less than two DVRs per home, significantly less than two DVRs per home, we can tear in all of the set-top boxes in the home into a DVR through this technology. We can buy storage at a lower unit cost per gigabit stored centrally than we can through distributed products like physical DVRs and we have a better business model in terms of doing upgrades. We can upgrade subscribers electronically without doing a physical trip. So it has a significant impact, not only on capital, but ultimately on operating costs for the business. With regard to the retrans, it had an impact in the fourth quarter that was significant. As you know, we were growing subs in the first and second quarter, although the economy was still impacting the business in household formation and that really hasn't changed. Third quarter, which is our seasonally weakest quarter, we did lose video customers.

You see various programmers talking about TV Everywhere, and I used the word TV Everywhere-like services. Companies may want, as part of their philosophy, serving more customers, programming companies may want to have programming distributed both on cable and the Internet when they have a customer relationship with a distributor like Cablevision. And we have the technical capability of doing that. Our applications that we're currently deploying don't do that. When you think about VOD, a movie company, you'd certainly want to be able to monetize video-on-demand transactionally in the home and out of the home. And so there's an opportunity to make money outside the home and to charge for it. There are other programming models that will work outside the home as well for programmers, and I think there are a series of opportunities there that we need to explore mutually with programmers and create new value propositions. So you can look at it as a value-add product, which is what TV Everywhere is. Make sure your customer has the content that they’ve purchased from you everywhere they need it or want it, or you can look at it as an adds-on service that creates additional buying opportunities. And I think both of those models will work."

Interestingly, when you think about an iPad app, it is wireless in the house. 70% of our customers have wireless WiFi installed in their house today. And as I said earlier in my comments, we're the largest provider of outdoor WiFi of any distributor in the country. So customers have lots of devices both in the home and out of home that can use WiFi. WiFi has the capability of being higher capacity in terms of speed than the 4G networks currently being deployed. And as you know, with the AT&T's experience, the existing cellular networks have a hard time managing data on the devices the way customers want to use it. And WiFi is an adjunct to that and allows our relationship with the customer to improve their wireless service. As we put our products in IP, if you think about television on an Apple device or an iPad or any Android device in the home, the device is acting as a television. It's acting as a set-top box simultaneously. New TVs being sold have IP inputs into them. And so because we've now put our whole product in IP for in-home distribution and we're capable of putting it out of the home too technically, we have the ability to serve TVs without set-top boxes. So to the extent the processing power in TV is capable of taking our signal and acting as a set-top box, we'll probably develop that application with television vendors, like you saw demoed at CES. And I think it's an opportunity further to get out of the hardware purchasing business at the CPE level. I think we'll be buying CPE for years to come, but the trends are toward the customer having that integrated into their devices."

Essentially, it's the product we go to market with in the service areas where we've rolled it out. The interesting thing about the technology is it does allow us to think about pricing differently going forward. We haven't done that yet. We're still in the rollout phase, but we could do free previews of DVR. We could do a very limited storage by programming, include buy programs and include that as part of another package. We could expand the storage capability and sell that as an incremental price opportunity for us and for customers. And so there are a variety of ways of looking at the DVR that is currently in the market and breaking that into various components and selling it even for less or for more depending on how you put it together. So we're excited about the opportunities and the flexibility the RS-DVR model gives us. For instance, if we want to double the capacity of every DVR in the system, we can do that would just by buying the storage essentially. The second part of your question though talks about how much storage do we actually need. We have not entered into single copy contracts with programmers, but it is an opportunity for us and for programmers to use the DVR technology in a way that would make it more efficient for us, essentially an opportunity for the programmer either from an advertising perspective or how their programming is featured perspective. And so there's more to come on the whole RS-DVR infrastructure in terms of the opportunities it creates for us. But it gives us a lot of flexibility.

The company reported a 10% increase in revenue driven by steady growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses. Meanwhile, AOCF grew 8%. These first quarter results were impacted by the addition of Bresnan, as well as transaction costs associated with the Rainbow spin off. Without these items, revenue growth would've been 3% while AOCF growth would have been 4%. 
Our plans to spinoff Rainbow are moving forward nicely. In March, we received the favorable letter ruling from the IRS and plan and preparation to continue according to our schedule. The company also continues to make progress on other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. In a few minutes, Tom will talk more about the initial steps we're taking to incorporate our operational practices into the properties. While it's still early, they are off to a solid start and we're looking forward to the prospects from this acquisition. 
the operating performance of our core business now includes Bresnan, combined with our declining capital spending has resulted in a very strong free cash flow. For the first 3 months of 2011, Cablevision generated more than $290 million in free cash flow, a 22% increase over the prior year. Even without the contribution from the Bresnan properties, free cash flow would have increased 13%. 
The company remained active in buy buying back stock in the first quarter. In addition, after increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.125 last May, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved another increase to $0.15 per quarter. This increase demonstrates our continued confidence in the company's consistent operating performance and stronger balance sheet. 
We are very placed with our performance during the first 3 months of this year. We work hard to ensure that Cablevision's growth continues. Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

The Telecom business delivered a solid quarter with revenue growth of 50% and AOCF growth of 10% when compared to last year's first quarter. Without the impact of the Bresnan properties, revenue growth was 3% and AOCF growth, 4%. Cablevision gained 6,000 customers in the quarter. customers increased by 32,000, voice lines by 40,000 and video declined by 8,000. The Bresnan component of those gains, 6,000 subscribers, 10,000 data customers, 6,000 voice lines and 1,000 video customers. 
For the Cablevision core properties average revenue per subscriber was $152.27, reflecting a sequential increase of $1.59. With the inclusion of the Bresnan properties, our total RPS for the first quarter was $149.75. While we've owned Bresnan properties for just over 4 months, we are beginning to make significant progress in incorporating our operating tactics in these systems. 
As of May 12, Optimum branded services will be sold throughout the former Bresnan footprint and the Bresnan brand will be retired. We've restructured our field and sales forces and practices consistent with the core operation. We will complete a transport ring at year end, which 85% of our western customers will be connected to. We will run these geographically separate locations as one large cable system. 
We're aggressively offering our fully featured voice prior to capitalize on the currently low phone penetration in these properties, as well as on high-speed products offered by our competition, the high-priced products offered by our competition. We are increasing the speeds of the high-speed data service to our current Optimum Online and Optimum boost speeds. We're taking a number of high-definition channels to over 100 and we're aggressively promoting the triple play. As these initiatives are being rolled out in the west, Cablevision continues to enhance its products and services in the. 
On May 1, we announced the introduction of the ultimate triple play for $100 per month. For the first year, customers will receive the original triple play products with enhancements. These include Boost Plus, our new high-speed service at 50 megabits downstream, 8 megabits upstream; new in-home Wi-Fi router; and Optimum Link, our new PC to TV relay service. This package will be attractive for many reasons: price, the super high-speed data service with a router and the capability of our customers to deal with what is on their PC screens on all their televisions acting as monitors. 
Our RS-DVR service, DVR Plus, has now been rolled out to Connecticut. Customer base in the near future will be launched in Brooklyn. Our new iPad app, where customers can view their full Cable Television service on their iPad acting as an in-home television, has been well received. Our interactive advanced advertising products continue to be enhanced. In April, we had 84 different interactive campaigns providing advertisers with a wide variety of ways to reach the customers. 
Cable capital spending totaled $107 million in the first quarter. As a percentage of cable revenue, capital spending was 7.2% for the first quarter. We said in the past that our expectation was to begin seen declines in capital spending and capital intensity as we stop purchasing physical DVRs and purchased fewer and less expensive digital set-top. First quarter is typically our lightest spending quarter. Nonetheless, 2011 full year capital spending even with the Bresnan initiative, expected to be below that of 2010, which do not include Bresnan. 
Turning to LightPath. LightPath has had a great quarter with revenue growth of 13% and AOCF growth of 26%. LightPath fiber network is now connected to almost 4,600. Revenue derived from ethernet services in the first quarter grew by 28% versus the prior year. And for the 13th consecutive year, LightPath has been commended for excellent service by the New York State Public Service Commission. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results"

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represents a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior year's first quarter.

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represents a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior year's first quarter. Operating expenses increased 11% or $17 million and AOCF improved 8% or $8 million versus prior year to $100 million. The vast majority of the revenue growth came from our national networks, primarily driven by the strong performance of our original programming, this was our second consecutive quarter of double-digit add revenue growth. 
Add revenue for our national networks was up 15% in the quarter compared with the prior year period as we saw ratings increases for both AMC and WE tv during the quarter, particularly in prime time. IFC, which is know an ad supported network contributed to that growth as well. And our national networks affiliate revenue grew by 4% in the quarter versus last year, a combination of increased license fees and increased subscribers. 
Operating expenses in the quarter for the national networks grew up by roughly 11% or $14 million, largely due to increased marketing and promotion of original series on IFC and WE tv to a lesser extent, increased programming costs at AMC. Despite this increase of operating expenses, the national networks' adjusted operating cash flow increased 6% or $6 million to $106 million versus the prior year period. As we continue to introduce new original series at each of our networks over the coming year, we'll continue to incur additional programming and marketing costs to support those shows. 
At AMC, The Killing, our latest dramatic original series, premiered Sunday, April 3, with 2.7 million viewers tuning in to the 2-hour debut. This was AMC's second highest rated original series ever with the exception of last fall's breakout hit, called The Walking Dead. 
Later this year, the network will premiere season 4 of our series, Breaking Bad. And even 2 of the Walking Dead and our new original series called, Hell on Wheels, which tells the story of the building of a transcontinental railroad. And we're pleased to have noted 2 series of Mad Men locked in with season 5 set to air in early 2012. 
In other programming businesses, which primarily include our international distribution and IFC Entertainment, our phone distribution business, revenue grew by 28% or $5 million to $25 million and AOCF improved by 19% or $2 million to an AOCF loss of $7 million. Contributing to the AOCF loss were ongoing boom HD litigated expenses pertaining to additional lawsuit. We're pleased with the results for the quarter. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will briefly cover the company's overall financials."

At the end of the first quarter the Company's consolidated cash position was $610 million. Net debt was $12.1 billion. As of March 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.6x. The CSC Holdings Group, Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.8x. But subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid CSC Holdings 7 5/8 senior notes in the amount of $326 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolver. Following that repayment, the outstanding balance on our revolver was up $1 billion. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.1 billion of debt and $580 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its unleveraged was 2.4x as of March 31. We continue to make good progress on the upcoming spinoff of Rainbow or AMC Networks Inc. We recently received an IRS Private Letter Ruling confirming the spin-off of Cablevision and the Cablevision shareholders. In addition, we are in the midst of a Form-10 review process with the SEC and we've reached an agreement with NASDAQ to service the listing exchange for AMC. 
We continue to have discussions with our lenders regarding the financing of the transaction and currently anticipate that AMC's financing structure will consist of a $500 million revolving credit facility, $1 billion in the third loan A facility, $675 million in the term loan B facility and $750 million in unsecured notes. Proceeds from this financing will be used to refinance existing RNS debt, approximately $1.1 billion and to fund a $1.25 billion distribution to either Cablevision or CSC Holdings to repay debt, including the drawn portion of our revolver. 
As part of the Rainbow refinancing, on April 13, RNS issued a notice of redemption to holders of $300 million of 8 7/5 % senior notes due 2012. RNS plans to use cash on hand and availability under its revolver to fund this redemption on May 13. As Jim mentioned, we continue to be on track from a timing perspective and anticipate a midyear closing for the spin. 
Turning to the company's share repurchase program, in the first quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $35.10 for a total of $234 million. From inception of the program through the end of April, we've repurchased $616 million of CVC stock at an average price of $31.74. We have $384 million of repurchase authorization remaining. 
Finally, as Jim mentioned, our quarterly dividend has been increased for the second consecutive year. The dividend increase from $0.125 to $0.15 per share per quarter will represent a meaningful increase in the yield on Cablevision stock, which of course, will be even greater after the spin off of Rainbow. Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

But I will take the opportunity to repeat the fact that we are committed and we have a balanced strategic of creating shareholder value. And I think that's pretty evident in what we've accomplished over the past 10 or 11 months. We've not only completed the Bresnan acquisitions but we've also repurchased over $600 million worth of stock entity announced that we've increased the dividend. I think that our leverage targets are going to remain in the range that we've discussed before, which is 4 to 5x, obviously heading in a more toward the 4.5 to 6, range which is kind of the sustainable upper end of that range but we do need flexibility to go higher than that. And we are going to continue to look at acquisition opportunities. Our primary focus in evaluating these have opportunities and I'll use Bresnan as an example is we undertook a rigorous analysis of the company and we look at the operating returns we thought we could generate from that business and the financial structure of the transaction. And at the conclusion of that analysis, we determined that the Bresnan acquisition was going to produce higher returns for our shareholders an alternative uses of capital. Now I want to add that we've looked at other opportunities since Bresnan and we haven't reached that same conclusion for some of the other properties that we've looked at. So I think going forward, that's the type of a pretty intense acquisition analysis that you should expect from us as we look at opportunities there.

As you know and last quarter, The Walking Dead in this quarter and The Killing, our growth through that period of time has been strong. So those shows have been working for us in combination with what is substantially still across the number of hours today of the movie service. So the economic productivity of it is already in evidence over the past 4 years performance. It continues to get stronger as we add more volume and success today in our original. We think we have an opportunity to advertisers and we are seeing higher CPMs so we think that trend will continue and get better, but it's already in effect."

And that is a significant factor in our growth prospects for video. The first part of your question, the iPad application that we currently have deployed turns your iPad into a television in the home and it becomes an additional outlet that has the full cable TV service on it. And that is consistent with our existing in home Cable Television price that we've negotiated with everyone. To put it on a Wi-Fi network, which we could do technically with these would require new license agreements. Some of the programmers that we're dealing with have been given us TV Everywhere-type rates and go rights, which are Internet rates. And we are taking advantage of those rights and creating additional products outside the home. With regard to the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi network is an Internet service but it's controlled by us and it's for the benefit of our customers. So it actually creates another space for us to exploit and create value for our customers should we choose to. We have not sought those rights today or at least deployed them. The downloadable security question, of how do we handle existing cable card slots, we still have a problem with the cable card in that it's a one-way service. And so to build a 2-way interactive service, which makes our full product functional, a set-top box is required. However, there's a whole new generation of televisions being developed, which are like the iPad in terms of their capabilities but bigger in the sense that they have a lot of processing power that they would hang on a wall. Those TVs if you think about the iPad, the iPad is actually a TV with a set-top box built into it with software. Televisions being deployed on walls, like Samsung's new smart TVs, are actually capable of having a virtual set-top box built into them in the same way that an iPad is. So capital intensity will go down as a result of that kind of deployment once you get your network architected like we are, which is a network capable of serving every kind of device in the home."

We have to date been able to on the nonfiction side, which is more for WE tv and IFC take ownership positions that are more complete. It's a lower price tag to do reality TV or nonfiction, so it's less risky. And so more of the content on that site is owned. But AMC, we're dealing with higher price tags for scripted that you're quite right that we have one series, where we have a significant near-complete ownership position and that's The Walking Dead. We did that because we thought that the nature of the material, which is typically referred to as genre or was less risky than some of the other material that we've traded in and it was a good bet. And it seems to be born out because it was successful and the benefits that I described a moment ago. As we go forward, we would just evaluate each proposition and determine whether the risk profile of the series or show seems to make sense and whether the economics makes sense.

The company reported a 10% increase in revenue, driven by steady growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses. Meanwhile, AOCF grew 8%. These first quarter results were impacted by the addition of Bresnan, as well as transaction costs associated with the Rainbow spin-off. Without these items, revenue growth would've been 3%, while AOCF growth would have been 4%. 
Our plans to spin off Rainbow are moving forward nicely. In March, we received the favorable letter of ruling -- a favorable letter ruling from the IRS, and planning and preparation continue according to our schedule. The company also continues to make progress on its other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. In a few minutes, Tom will talk more about the initial steps we are taking to incorporate our operational practices into the Bresnan properties. While it is still early, they are off to a solid start, and we're looking forward to the prospects from this acquisition. 
The operating performance of our core business, which now includes Bresnan, combined with our declining capital spending, has resulted in a very strong free cash flow. For the first 3 months of 2011, Cablevision generated more than $290 million in free cash flow, a 22% increase over the prior year. Even without the contribution from the Bresnan properties, free cash flow would have increased 13%. 
The company remained active in buying back stock in the first quarter. In addition, after increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.125 last May, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved another increase to $0.15 per quarter. This increase demonstrates our continued confidence in the company's consistent operating performance and stronger balance sheet. 
We are very pleased with our performance during the first 3 months of this year. We will work hard to ensure that Cablevision's growth continues. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

The Telecom business delivered a solid quarter, with revenue growth of 10.9% and AOCF growth of 10% when compared to last year's first quarter. Without the impact of the Bresnan properties, revenue growth was 3% and AOCF growth 4%. 
Cablevision gained 6,000 customers in the quarter. Data customers increased by 32,000, voice lines by 40,000 and video declined by 8,000. The Bresnan component of those gains: 6,000 subscribers, 10,000 data customers, 6,000 voice lines and 1,000 video customers. 
For the Cablevision core properties, average revenue per subscriber was $152.27, reflecting a sequential increase of $1.59. With the inclusion of the Bresnan properties, our total RPS for the first quarter was $149.75. While we've owned Bresnan properties for just over 4 months, we are beginning to make significant progress in incorporating our operating tactics in these systems. 
As of May 12, Optimum-branded services will be sold throughout the former Bresnan footprint, and the Bresnan brand will be retired. We've restructured our field and sales forces and practices consistent with the core operation. We will complete a transport ring by year end, which 85% of our western customers will be connected to. We will run these geographically separate locations as one large cable system. 
We are aggressively offering our fully featured voice product to capitalize on the currently low phone penetration in these properties, as well as on high-speed products offered by our competition -- the high-priced products offered by our competition. We are increasing the speeds of the high-speed data service to our current Optimum Online and Optimum boost speeds. We're taking a number of high-definition channels to over 100, and we're aggressively promoting the Triple Play. As these initiatives are being rolled out in the west, Cablevision continues to enhance its products and services in the New York area footprint. 
On May 1, we announced the introduction of the ultimate Triple Play for $100 per month. For the first year, customers will receive the original Triple Play products with enhancements. These include Boost Plus, our new high-speed service at 50 megabits downstream and 8 megabits upstream; new in-home Wi-Fi router; and Optimum Link, our new PC to TV relay service. This package will be attractive for many reasons: Price, the super high-speed data service with a router and the capability of our customers to view what is on their PC screens on all their televisions acting as monitors. 
Our RS-DVR service, DVR Plus, has now been rolled out to Connecticut customer base, and in the near future will be launched in Brooklyn. Our new iPad app, where customers can view their full cable television service on their iPad acting as an in-home television, has been well received. Our interactive advanced advertising products continue to be enhanced. In April, we had 84 different interactive campaigns, providing advertisers with a wide variety of ways to reach the customers. 
Cable capital spending totaled $107 million in the first quarter. As a percentage of cable revenue, capital spending was 7.2% for the first quarter. We said in the past that our expectation was to begin seeing declines in capital spending and capital intensity as we've stopped purchasing physical DVRs and purchased fewer and less expensive digital set-top. First quarter is typically our lightest spending quarter. Nonetheless, 2011 full year capital spending, even with the Bresnan initiative, expected to be below that of 2010, which did not include Bresnan. 
Turning to Lightpath. Lightpath has had a great quarter, with revenue growth of 13% and AOCF growth of 26%. Lightpath fiber network is now connected to almost 4,600 [indiscernible]. Revenue derived from ethernet services in the first quarter grew by 28% versus the prior year, and for the 13th consecutive year, Lightpath has been commended for excellent service by the New York State Public Service Commission. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represented a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior-year's first quarter.

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represented a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior-year's first quarter. Operating expenses increased 11% or $17 million and AOCF improved 8% or $8 million versus prior year to $100 million. The vast majority of the revenue growth came from our national networks. Primarily driven by the strong performance of our original programming, this was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ad revenue growth. 
Ad revenue for our national networks was up 15% in the quarter compared with the prior-year period, as we saw ratings increases for both AMC and WE tv during the quarter, particularly in prime time. IFC, which is now an ad-supported network, contributed to that growth as well. And our national networks affiliate revenue grew by 4% in the quarter versus last year, a combination of increased license fees and increased subscribers. 
Operating expenses in the quarter for the national networks were up by roughly 11% or $14 million, largely due to increased marketing and promotion of original series on IFC and WE tv, and to a lesser extent, increased programming costs at AMC. Despite this increase in operating expenses, the national networks' adjusted operating cash flow increased 6% or $6 million to $106 million versus the prior-year period. As we continue to introduce new original series at each of our networks over the coming year, we'll continue to incur additional programming and marketing costs to support those shows. 
At AMC, The Killing, our latest dramatic original series, premiered Sunday, April 3, with 2.7 million viewers tuning in for the 2-hour debut. This was AMC's second highest-rated original series premiere ever with the exception of last fall's breakout hit called The Walking Dead. 
Later this year, the network will premiere season 4 of our series, Breaking Bad; season 2 of the Walking Dead; and our new original series called Hell on Wheels, which tells a story of the building of the transcontinental railroad. And we're pleased to have another 2 series of Mad Men locked in with season 5 set to air in early 2012. 
In Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily include our international distribution and IFC Entertainment, our film distribution business, revenue grew by 28% or $5 million to $25 million, and AOCF improved by 19% or $2 million to an AOCF loss of $7 million. Contributing to the AOCF loss were ongoing VOOM HD-related litigated expenses pertaining to this lawsuit. We are pleased with the results for the quarter. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will briefly cover the company's overall financials."

At the end of the first quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $610 million. Net debt was $12.1 billion. As of March 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.6x. The CSC Holdings Group and Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid CSC Holdings 7 5/8 senior notes in the amount of $326 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolver. Following that repayment, the outstanding balance on our revolver was $1 billion. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.1 billion of debt and $580 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage desk [ph] was 2.4x as of March 31. 
We continue to make good progress on the upcoming spin-off of Rainbow or AMC Networks Inc. We recently received an IRS Private Letter Ruling confirming the spin-off of the tax-free Cablevision and the Cablevision shareholders. In addition, we are in the midst of a Form-10 review process with the SEC, and we've reached an agreement with NASDAQ to service the listing exchange for AMC. 
We continue to have discussions with our lenders regarding the financing of the transaction and currently anticipate that AMC's financing structure will consist of a $500 million revolving credit facility, $1 billion in the term loan A facility, $675 million in the term loan B facility and $750 million in unsecured notes. Proceeds from this financing will be used to refinance existing RNS debt, approximately $1.1 billion, and to fund a $1.25 billion distribution to either Cablevision or CSC Holdings to repay debt, including the drawn portion of our revolver. 
As part of the Rainbow refinancing, on April 13, RNS issued a notice of redemption to holders of $300 million of its 8 7/5% senior notes due 2012. RNS plans to use cash on hand and availability under its revolver to fund this redemption on May 13. As Jim mentioned, we continue to be on track from a timing perspective and anticipate a midyear closing for the spin. 
Turning to the company's share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $35.10 for a total of $234 million. From inception of the program through the end of April, we've repurchased $616 million of CVC stock at an average price of $31.74. We have $384 million of repurchase authorization remaining. 
Finally, as Jim mentioned, our quarterly dividend has been increased for the second consecutive year. The dividend increase from $0.125 to $0.15 per share per quarter will represent a meaningful increase in the yield on Cablevision stock, which of course, will be even greater after the spin-off of Rainbow.

We've not only completed the Bresnan acquisition, but we've also repurchased over $600 million worth of stock and today announced that we've increased the dividend. I think that our leverage targets are going to remain in the range that we've discussed before, which is 4 to 5x, obviously, aiming more toward the 4.5, 4.6, range is kind of the sustainable upper end of that range, but I do need flexibility to go higher than that. And we are going to continue to look at acquisition opportunities. Our primary focus in evaluating these type of opportunities, and I'll use Bresnan as an example, is we undertook a rigorous analysis of the company and we look at the operating returns that we thought we could generate from that business and the financial structure of the transaction. And at the conclusion of that analysis, we determined that the Bresnan acquisition was going to produce higher returns for our shareholders and alternative uses of capital. Now I want to add that we've looked at other opportunities since Bresnan, and we haven't reached that same conclusion for some of the other properties that we've looked at. So I think going forward, that's the type of pretty intense acquisition analysis that you should expect from us as we look at opportunities there. And again, we intend to keep the leverage within the range we have discussed before, and we intend to continue our repurchase program."

And that is a significant factor in our growth prospects for video. The first part of your question, the iPad application that we currently have deployed turns your iPad into a television in the home, and it becomes an additional outlet that has the full cable TV service on it. And that is consistent with our existing in-home cable television rights that we've negotiated with everyone. To put it on a Wi-Fi network, which we could do technically with ease would require new license agreements. Some of the programmers that we're dealing with have given us TV Everywhere-type rights and go rights, which are Internet rights. And we are taking advantage of those rights and creating additional products for outside the home. With regard to the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi network is an Internet service, but it's controlled by us and it's for the benefit of our customers. So it actually creates another space for us to exploit and create value for our customers should we choose to. We have not sought those rights today or at least deployed them. The downloadable security question of how do we handle existing cable card slots, we still have a problem with the cable card in that it's a one-way service. And so to build a 2-way interactive service, which makes our full product functional, a set-top box is required. However, there's a whole new generation of televisions being developed, which are like the iPad in terms of their capabilities but bigger in the sense that they have a lot of processing power but they would hang on a wall. Those TVs if you think about the iPad, the iPad is actually a TV with a set-top box built into it with software. Televisions being deployed on walls, like Samsung's new smart TVs, are actually capable of having a virtual set-top box built into them in the same way that an iPad is. And so capital intensity will go down as a result of that kind of deployment once you get your network architected like we are, which is a network capable of serving every kind of device in the home."

We do think related From-10 that the more we can own content and control content, the better off we are if we can do it economically. It gives us the ability if we have a greater ownership position, and it actually is a spectrum question, it's not binary, you don't either own or license it, there are sort of steps in between, but if we can own increasingly in increments, then we get the benefit of being able to put it on different platforms, being the beneficiary of its exploitation and subsequent ancillary markets, being able to distribute it internationally. We have to date been able to on the nonfiction side, which is more for WE tv and IFC, take ownership positions that are more complete. It's a lower price tag to do reality TV or nonfiction, so it's less risky. And so more of the content on that site is owned. On AMC, where we're dealing with higher price tags for scripted, you're quite right that we have one series where we have a significant near-complete ownership position, and that's The Walking Dead. We did that because we thought that the nature of the material, which is typically referred to as genre, horror was less risky than some of the other material that we've traded in, and it was a good bet. And it seems to be borne out because it was successful, and we will get the benefits that I described a moment ago. As we go forward, we would just evaluate each proposition and determine whether the risk profile of a series or a show seems to make sense and whether the economics makes sense. So I don't think you'll see anyone particular pattern emerging, it will be opportunistic and it will be case-by-case, where we can own more. If we think it's sensible, we will."

So that will produce incremental revenue per customer going forward and creates an upgrade opportunity to our existing subscriber base to increase revenue per sub as well. We took a very light rate increase this year as we came into the year. Because of the situation that we had in the fourth quarter, we thought that in the long run we'd be wiser to have a moderate rate increase this year, so we had that as well. And we sort of complemented or offset that to some extent going forward with our new revenue drivers as a result of the Boost Plus strategy."

The company reported a 10% increase in revenue, driven by steady growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses. Meanwhile, AOCF grew 8%. These first quarter results were impacted by the addition of Bresnan, as well as transaction costs associated with the Rainbow spin-off. Without these items, revenue growth would've been 3%, while AOCF growth would have been 4%. 
Our plans to spin off Rainbow are moving forward nicely. In March, we received the favorable letter of ruling -- a favorable letter ruling from the IRS, and planning and preparation continue according to our schedule. The company also continues to make progress on its other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. In a few minutes, Tom will talk more about the initial steps we are taking to incorporate our operational practices into the Bresnan properties. While it is still early, they are off to a solid start, and we're looking forward to the prospects from this acquisition. 
The operating performance of our core business, which now includes Bresnan, combined with our declining capital spending, has resulted in a very strong free cash flow. For the first 3 months of 2011, Cablevision generated more than $290 million in free cash flow, a 22% increase over the prior year. Even without the contribution from the Bresnan properties, free cash flow would have increased 13%. 
The company remained active in buying back stock in the first quarter. In addition, after increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.125 last May, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved another increase to $0.15 per quarter. This increase demonstrates our continued confidence in the company's consistent operating performance and stronger balance sheet. 
We are very pleased with our performance during the first 3 months of this year. We will work hard to ensure that Cablevision's growth continues. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

The Telecom business delivered a solid quarter, with revenue growth of 10.9% and AOCF growth of 10% when compared to last year's first quarter. Without the impact of the Bresnan properties, revenue growth was 3% and AOCF growth 4%. 
Cablevision gained 6,000 customers in the quarter. Data customers increased by 32,000, voice lines by 40,000 and video declined by 8,000. The Bresnan component of those gains: 6,000 subscribers, 10,000 data customers, 6,000 voice lines and 1,000 video customers. 
For the Cablevision core properties, average revenue per subscriber was $152.27, reflecting a sequential increase of $1.59. With the inclusion of the Bresnan properties, our total RPS for the first quarter was $149.75. While we've owned Bresnan properties for just over 4 months, we are beginning to make significant progress in incorporating our operating tactics in these systems. 
As of May 12, Optimum-branded services will be sold throughout the former Bresnan footprint, and the Bresnan brand will be retired. We've restructured our field and sales forces and practices consistent with the core operation. We will complete a transport ring by year end, which 85% of our western customers will be connected to. We will run these geographically separate locations as one large cable system. 
We are aggressively offering our fully featured voice product to capitalize on the currently low phone penetration in these properties, as well as on high-speed products offered by our competition -- the high-priced products offered by our competition. We are increasing the speeds of the high-speed data service to our current Optimum Online and Optimum boost speeds. We're taking the number of high-definition channels to over 100, and we're aggressively promoting the Triple Play. As these initiatives are being rolled out in the west, Cablevision continues to enhance its products and services in the New York area footprint. 
On May 1, we announced the introduction of the ultimate Triple Play for $100 per month. For the first year, customers will receive the original Triple Play products with enhancements. These include Boost Plus, our new high-speed service at 50 megabits downstream and 8 megabits upstream; new in-home Wi-Fi router; and Optimum Link, our new PC to TV relay service. This package will be attractive for many reasons: Price, the super high-speed data service with a router and the capability of our customers to view what is on their PC screens on all their televisions acting as monitors. 
Our RS-DVR service, DVR Plus, has now been rolled out to Connecticut customer base, and in the near future will be launched in Brooklyn. Our new iPad app, where customers can view their full cable television service on their iPad acting as an in-home television, has been well received. Our interactive advanced advertising products continue to be enhanced. In April, we had 84 different interactive campaigns, providing advertisers with a wide variety of ways to reach the customers. 
Cable capital spending totaled $107 million in the first quarter. As a percentage of cable revenue, capital spending was 7.2% for the first quarter. We said in the past that our expectation was to begin seeing declines in capital spending and capital intensity as we've stopped purchasing physical DVRs and purchased fewer and less expensive digital set-top. First quarter is typically our lightest spending quarter. Nonetheless, 2011 full year capital spending, even with the Bresnan initiative, expected to be below that of 2010, which did not include Bresnan. 
Turning to Lightpath. Lightpath has had a great quarter, with revenue growth of 13% and AOCF growth of 26%. Lightpath fiber network is now connected to almost 4,600 [indiscernible]. Revenue derived from ethernet services in the first quarter grew by 28% versus the prior year, and for the 13th consecutive year, Lightpath has been commended for excellent service by the New York State Public Service Commission. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represented a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior-year's first quarter.

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represented a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior-year's first quarter. Operating expenses increased 11% or $17 million and AOCF improved 8% or $8 million versus prior year to $100 million. The vast majority of the revenue growth came from our national networks. Primarily driven by the strong performance of our original programming, this was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ad revenue growth. 
Ad revenue for our national networks was up 15% in the quarter compared with the prior-year period, as we saw ratings increases for both AMC and WE tv during the quarter, particularly in prime time. IFC, which is now an ad-supported network, contributed to that growth as well. And our national networks affiliate revenue grew by 4% in the quarter versus last year, a combination of increased license fees and increased subscribers. 
Operating expenses in the quarter for the national networks were up by roughly 11% or $14 million, largely due to increased marketing and promotion of original series on IFC and WE tv, and to a lesser extent, increased programming costs at AMC. Despite this increase in operating expenses, the national networks' adjusted operating cash flow increased 6% or $6 million to $106 million versus the prior-year period. As we continue to introduce new original series at each of our networks over the coming year, we'll continue to incur additional programming and marketing costs to support those shows. 
At AMC, The Killing, our latest dramatic original series, premiered Sunday, April 3, with 2.7 million viewers tuning in for the 2-hour debut. This was AMC's second highest-rated original series premiere ever with the exception of last fall's breakout hit called The Walking Dead. 
Later this year, the network will premiere season 4 of our series, Breaking Bad; season 2 of the Walking Dead; and our new original series called Hell on Wheels, which tells a story of the building of the transcontinental railroad. And we're pleased to have another 2 series of Mad Men locked in with season 5 set to air in early 2012. 
In Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily include our international distribution and IFC Entertainment, our film distribution business, revenue grew by 28% or $5 million to $25 million, and AOCF improved by 19% or $2 million to an AOCF loss of $7 million. Contributing to the AOCF loss were ongoing VOOM HD-related litigated expenses pertaining to this lawsuit. We are pleased with the results for the quarter.

At the end of the first quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $610 million. Net debt was $12.1 billion. As of March 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.6x. The CSC Holdings Group and Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid CSC Holdings 7 5/8 senior notes in the amount of $326 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolver. Following that repayment, the outstanding balance on our revolver was $1 billion. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.1 billion of debt and $580 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage desk [ph] was 2.4x as of March 31. 
We continue to make good progress on the upcoming spin-off of Rainbow or AMC Networks Inc. We recently received an IRS Private Letter Ruling confirming the spin-off of the tax-free Cablevision and the Cablevision shareholders. In addition, we are in the midst of a Form-10 review process with the SEC, and we've reached an agreement with NASDAQ to service the listing exchange for AMC. 
We continue to have discussions with our lenders regarding the financing of the transaction and currently anticipate that AMC's financing structure will consist of a $500 million revolving credit facility, $1 billion in the term loan A facility, $675 million in the term loan B facility and $750 million in unsecured notes. Proceeds from this financing will be used to refinance existing RNS debt, approximately $1.1 billion, and to fund a $1.25 billion distribution to either Cablevision or CSC Holdings to repay debt, including the drawn portion of our revolver. 
As part of the Rainbow refinancing, on April 13, RNS issued a notice of redemption to holders of $300 million of its 8.75% senior notes due 2012. RNS plans to use cash on hand and availability under its revolver to fund this redemption on May 13. As Jim mentioned, we continue to be on track from a timing perspective and anticipate a midyear closing for the spin. 
Turning to the company's share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $35.10 for a total of $234 million. From inception of the program through the end of April, we've repurchased $616 million of CVC stock at an average price of $31.74. We have $384 million of repurchase authorization remaining. 
Finally, as Jim mentioned, our quarterly dividend has been increased for the second consecutive year. The dividend increase from $0.125 to $0.15 per share per quarter will represent a meaningful increase in the yield on Cablevision stock, which of course, will be even greater after the spin-off of Rainbow.

Well, I actually think you used the word ""insight"" in your question, so I figured that acquisitions were what was primarily on your mind. And I think, as you know, we're not going to comment on speculation regarding any specific potential acquisition. But I will take the opportunity to repeat the fact that we are committed to a balanced strategy for creating shareholder value. And I think that's pretty evident in what we've accomplished over the past 10 or 11 months. We've not only completed the Bresnan acquisition, but we've also repurchased over $600 million worth of stock and today announced that we've increased the dividend. I think that our leverage targets are going to remain in the range that we've discussed before, which is 4 to 5x, obviously, aiming more toward the 4.5, 4.6, range is kind of the sustainable upper end of that range, but I do need flexibility to go higher than that. And we are going to continue to look at acquisition opportunities. Our primary focus in evaluating these type of opportunities, and I'll use Bresnan as an example, is we undertook a rigorous analysis of the company and we look at the operating returns that we thought we could generate from that business and the financial structure of the transaction. And at the conclusion of that analysis, we determined that the Bresnan acquisition was going to produce higher returns for our shareholders and alternative uses of capital. Now I want to add that we've looked at other opportunities since Bresnan, and we haven't reached that same conclusion for some of the other properties that we've looked at. So I think going forward, that's the type of pretty intense acquisition analysis that you should expect from us as we look at opportunities there. And again, we intend to keep the leverage within the range we have discussed before, and we intend to continue our repurchase program."

And that is a significant factor in our growth prospects for video. The first part of your question, the iPad application that we currently have deployed turns your iPad into a television in the home, and it becomes an additional outlet that has the full cable TV service on it. And that is consistent with our existing in-home cable television rights that we've negotiated with everyone. To put it on a Wi-Fi network, which we could do technically with ease would require new license agreements. Some of the programmers that we're dealing with have given us TV Everywhere-type rights and go rights, which are Internet rights. And we are taking advantage of those rights and creating additional products for outside the home. With regard to the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi network is an Internet service, but it's controlled by us and it's for the benefit of our customers. So it actually creates another space for us to exploit and create value for our customers should we choose to. We have not sought those rights today or at least deployed them. The downloadable security question of how do we handle existing cable card slots, we still have a problem with the cable card in that it's a one-way service. And so to build a 2-way interactive service, which makes our full product functional, a set-top box is required. However, there's a whole new generation of televisions being developed, which are like the iPad in terms of their capabilities but bigger in the sense that they have a lot of processing power but they would hang on a wall. Those TVs if you think about the iPad, the iPad is actually a TV with a set-top box built into it with software. Televisions being deployed on walls, like Samsung's new smart TVs, are actually capable of having a virtual set-top box built into them in the same way that an iPad is. And so capital intensity will go down as a result of that kind of deployment once you get your network architected like we are, which is a network capable of serving every kind of device in the home."

And how do you see kind of upside to margins later in the year playing out as Bresnan becomes more fully integrated?"

And then for Tom, I was wondering if there's anything you'd point out that would lead to revenue growth accelerating from cable.

It gives us the ability if we have a greater ownership position, and it actually is a spectrum question, it's not binary, you don't either own or license it, there are sort of steps in between, but if we can own increasingly in increments, then we get the benefit of being able to put it on different platforms, being the beneficiary of its exploitation and subsequent ancillary markets, being able to distribute it internationally. We have to date been able to on the nonfiction side, which is more for WE tv and IFC, take ownership positions that are more complete. It's a lower price tag to do reality TV or nonfiction, so it's less risky. And so more of the content on that site is owned. On AMC, where we're dealing with higher price tags for scripted, you're quite right that we have one series where we have a significant near-complete ownership position, and that's The Walking Dead. We did that because we thought that the nature of the material, which is typically referred to as genre, horror, was less risky than some of the other material that we've traded in, and it was a good bet. And it seems to be borne out because it was successful, and we will get the benefits that I described a moment ago. As we go forward, we would just evaluate each proposition and determine whether the risk profile of a series or a show seems to make sense and whether the economics makes sense. So I don't think you'll see any one particular pattern emerging, it will be opportunistic and it will be case-by-case.  Where we can own more, if we think it's sensible, we will."

Because of the situation that we had in the fourth quarter, we thought that in the long run we'd be wiser to have a more moderate rate increase this year, so we had that as well.

The company reported a 10% increase in revenue, driven by steady growth at our Cable and Rainbow businesses. Meanwhile, AOCF grew 8%. These first quarter results were impacted by the addition of Bresnan, as well as transaction costs associated with the Rainbow spin-off. Without these items, revenue growth would've been 3%, while AOCF growth would have been 4%. 
Our plans to spin off Rainbow are moving forward nicely. In March, we received the favorable letter of ruling -- a favorable letter ruling from the IRS, and planning and preparation continue according to our schedule. The company also continues to make progress on its other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. In a few minutes, Tom will talk more about the initial steps we are taking to incorporate our operational practices into the Bresnan properties. While it is still early, they are off to a solid start, and we're looking forward to the prospects from this acquisition. 
The operating performance of our core business, which now includes Bresnan, combined with our declining capital spending, has resulted in a very strong free cash flow. For the first 3 months of 2011, Cablevision generated more than $290 million in free cash flow, a 22% increase over the prior year. Even without the contribution from the Bresnan properties, free cash flow would have increased 13%. 
The company remained active in buying back stock in the first quarter. In addition, after increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.125 last May, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved another increase to $0.15 per quarter. This increase demonstrates our continued confidence in the company's consistent operating performance and stronger balance sheet. 
We are very pleased with our performance during the first 3 months of this year. We will work hard to ensure that Cablevision's growth continues. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

The Telecom business delivered a solid quarter, with revenue growth of 10.9% and AOCF growth of 10% when compared to last year's first quarter. Without the impact of the Bresnan properties, revenue growth was 3% and AOCF growth 4%. 
Cablevision gained 6,000 customers in the quarter. Data customers increased by 32,000, voice lines by 40,000 and video declined by 8,000. The Bresnan component of those gains: 6,000 subscribers, 10,000 data customers, 6,000 voice lines and 1,000 video customers. 
For the Cablevision core properties, average revenue per subscriber was $152.27, reflecting a sequential increase of $1.59. With the inclusion of the Bresnan properties, our total RPS for the first quarter was $149.75. While we've owned Bresnan properties for just over 4 months, we are beginning to make significant progress in incorporating our operating tactics in these systems. 
As of May 12, Optimum-branded services will be sold throughout the former Bresnan footprint, and the Bresnan brand will be retired. We've restructured our field and sales forces and practices consistent with the core operation. We will complete a transport ring by year end, which 85% of our western customers will be connected to. We will run these geographically separate locations as one large cable system. 
We are aggressively offering our fully featured voice product to capitalize on the currently low phone penetration in these properties, as well as on high-speed products offered by our competition -- the high-priced products offered by our competition. We are increasing the speeds of the high-speed data service to our current Optimum Online and Optimum boost speeds. We're taking the number of high-definition channels to over 100, and we're aggressively promoting the Triple Play. As these initiatives are being rolled out in the west, Cablevision continues to enhance its products and services in the New York area footprint. 
On May 1, we announced the introduction of the ultimate Triple Play for $100 per month. For the first year, customers will receive the original Triple Play products with enhancements. These include Boost Plus, our new high-speed service at 50 megabits downstream and 8 megabits upstream; new in-home Wi-Fi router; and Optimum Link, our new PC to TV relay service. This package will be attractive for many reasons: Price, the super high-speed data service with a router and the capability of our customers to view what is on their PC screens on all their televisions acting as monitors. 
Our RS-DVR service, DVR Plus, has now been rolled out to Connecticut customer base, and in the near future will be launched in Brooklyn. Our new iPad app, where customers can view their full cable television service on their iPad acting as an in-home television, has been well received. Our interactive advanced advertising products continue to be enhanced. In April, we had 84 different interactive campaigns, providing advertisers with a wide variety of ways to reach the customers. 
Cable capital spending totaled $107 million in the first quarter. As a percentage of cable revenue, capital spending was 7.2% for the first quarter. We said in the past that our expectation was to begin seeing declines in capital spending and capital intensity as we've stopped purchasing physical DVRs and purchased fewer and less expensive digital set-top. First quarter is typically our lightest spending quarter. Nonetheless, 2011 full year capital spending, even with the Bresnan initiative, expected to be below that of 2010, which did not include Bresnan. 
Turning to Lightpath. Lightpath has had a great quarter, with revenue growth of 13% and AOCF growth of 26%. Lightpath fiber network is now connected to almost 4,600 [indiscernible]. Revenue derived from ethernet services in the first quarter grew by 28% versus the prior year, and for the 13th consecutive year, Lightpath has been commended for excellent service by the New York State Public Service Commission.

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represented a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior-year's first quarter.

Rainbow's first quarter revenue of $273 million represented a 10% or $25 million increase over the prior-year's first quarter. Operating expenses increased 11% or $17 million and AOCF improved 8% or $8 million versus prior year to $100 million. The vast majority of the revenue growth came from our national networks. Primarily driven by the strong performance of our original programming, this was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ad revenue growth. 
Ad revenue for our national networks was up 15% in the quarter compared with the prior-year period, as we saw ratings increases for both AMC and WE tv during the quarter, particularly in prime time. IFC, which is now an ad-supported network, contributed to that growth as well. And our national networks affiliate revenue grew by 4% in the quarter versus last year, a combination of increased license fees and increased subscribers. 
Operating expenses in the quarter for the national networks were up by roughly 11% or $14 million, largely due to increased marketing and promotion of original series on IFC and WE tv, and to a lesser extent, increased programming costs at AMC. Despite this increase in operating expenses, the national networks' adjusted operating cash flow increased 6% or $6 million to $106 million versus the prior-year period. As we continue to introduce new original series at each of our networks over the coming year, we'll continue to incur additional programming and marketing costs to support those shows. 
At AMC, The Killing, our latest dramatic original series, premiered Sunday, April 3, with 2.7 million viewers tuning in for the 2-hour debut. This was AMC's second highest-rated original series premiere ever with the exception of last fall's breakout hit called The Walking Dead. 
Later this year, the network will premiere season 4 of our series, Breaking Bad; season 2 of the Walking Dead; and our new original series called Hell on Wheels, which tells a story of the building of the transcontinental railroad. And we're pleased to have another 2 series of Mad Men locked in with season 5 set to air in early 2012. 
In Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily include our international distribution and IFC Entertainment, our film distribution business, revenue grew by 28% or $5 million to $25 million, and AOCF improved by 19% or $2 million to an AOCF loss of $7 million. Contributing to the AOCF loss were ongoing VOOM HD-related litigated expenses pertaining to this lawsuit. We are pleased with the results for the quarter.

At the end of the first quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $610 million. Net debt was $12.1 billion. As of March 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.6x. The CSC Holdings Group and Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid CSC Holdings 7 5/8 senior notes in the amount of $326 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolver. Following that repayment, the outstanding balance on our revolver was $1 billion. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.1 billion of debt and $580 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage desk [ph] was 2.4x as of March 31. 
We continue to make good progress on the upcoming spin-off of Rainbow or AMC Networks Inc. We recently received an IRS Private Letter Ruling confirming the spin-off of the tax-free Cablevision and the Cablevision shareholders. In addition, we are in the midst of a Form-10 review process with the SEC, and we've reached an agreement with NASDAQ to service the listing exchange for AMC. 
We continue to have discussions with our lenders regarding the financing of the transaction and currently anticipate that AMC's financing structure will consist of a $500 million revolving credit facility, $1 billion in the term loan A facility, $675 million in the term loan B facility and $750 million in unsecured notes. Proceeds from this financing will be used to refinance existing RNS debt, approximately $1.1 billion, and to fund a $1.25 billion distribution to either Cablevision or CSC Holdings to repay debt, including the drawn portion of our revolver. 
As part of the Rainbow refinancing, on April 13, RNS issued a notice of redemption to holders of $300 million of its 8 3/4% senior notes due 2012. RNS plans to use cash on hand and availability under its revolver to fund this redemption on May 13. As Jim mentioned, we continue to be on track from a timing perspective and anticipate a midyear closing for the spin. 
Turning to the company's share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of Cablevision stock at an average price of $35.10 for a total of $234 million. From inception of the program through the end of April, we've repurchased $616 million of CVC stock at an average price of $31.74. We have $384 million of repurchase authorization remaining. 
Finally, as Jim mentioned, our quarterly dividend has been increased for the second consecutive year. The dividend increase from $0.125 to $0.15 per share per quarter will represent a meaningful increase in the yield on Cablevision stock, which of course, will be even greater after the spin-off of Rainbow.

And I think, as you know, we're not going to comment on speculation regarding any specific potential acquisition. But I will take the opportunity to repeat the fact that we are committed to a balanced strategy for creating shareholder value. And I think that's pretty evident in what we've accomplished over the past 10 or 11 months. We've not only completed the Bresnan acquisition, but we've also repurchased over $600 million worth of stock and today announced that we've increased the dividend. I think that our leverage targets are going to remain in the range that we've discussed before, which is 4 to 5x, obviously, aiming more toward the 4.5, 4.6, range is kind of the sustainable upper end of that range, but I do need flexibility to go higher than that. And we are going to continue to look at acquisition opportunities. Our primary focus in evaluating these type of opportunities, and I'll use Bresnan as an example, is we undertook a rigorous analysis of the company and we look at the operating returns that we thought we could generate from that business and the financial structure of the transaction. And at the conclusion of that analysis, we determined that the Bresnan acquisition was going to produce higher returns for our shareholders and alternative uses of capital. Now I want to add that we've looked at other opportunities since Bresnan, and we haven't reached that same conclusion for some of the other properties that we've looked at. So I think going forward, that's the type of pretty intense acquisition analysis that you should expect from us as we look at opportunities there. And again, we intend to keep the leverage within the range we have discussed before, and we intend to continue our repurchase program."

And that is a significant factor in our growth prospects for video. The first part of your question, the iPad application that we currently have deployed turns your iPad into a television in the home, and it becomes an additional outlet that has the full cable TV service on it. And that is consistent with our existing in-home cable television rights that we've negotiated with everyone. To put it on a Wi-Fi network, which we could do technically with ease would require new license agreements. Some of the programmers that we're dealing with have given us TV Everywhere-type rights and go rights, which are Internet rights. And we are taking advantage of those rights and creating additional products for outside the home. With regard to the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi network is an Internet service, but it's controlled by us and it's for the benefit of our customers. So it actually creates another space for us to exploit and create value for our customers should we choose to. We have not sought those rights today or at least deployed them. The downloadable security question of how do we handle existing cable card slots, we still have a problem with the cable card in that it's a one-way service. And so to build a 2-way interactive service, which makes our full product functional, a set-top box is required. However, there's a whole new generation of televisions being developed, which are like the iPad in terms of their capabilities but bigger in the sense that they have a lot of processing power but they would hang on a wall. Those TVs if you think about the iPad, the iPad is actually a TV with a set-top box built into it with software. Televisions being deployed on walls, like Samsung's new smart TVs, are actually capable of having a virtual set-top box built into them in the same way that an iPad is. And so capital intensity will go down as a result of that kind of deployment once you get your network architected like we are, which is a network capable of serving every kind of device in the home."

It gives us the ability if we have a greater ownership position, and it actually is a spectrum question, it's not binary, you don't either own or license it, there are sort of steps in between, but if we can own increasingly in increments, then we get the benefit of being able to put it on different platforms, being the beneficiary of its exploitation and subsequent ancillary markets, being able to distribute it internationally. We have to date been able to on the nonfiction side, which is more for WE tv and IFC, take ownership positions that are more complete. It's a lower price tag to do reality TV or nonfiction, so it's less risky. And so more of the content on that site is owned. On AMC, where we're dealing with higher price tags for scripted, you're quite right that we have one series where we have a significant near-complete ownership position, and that's The Walking Dead. We did that because we thought that the nature of the material, which is typically referred to as genre, horror, was less risky than some of the other material that we've traded in, and it was a good bet. And it seems to be borne out because it was successful, and we will get the benefits that I described a moment ago. As we go forward, we would just evaluate each proposition and determine whether the risk profile of a series or a show seems to make sense and whether the economics makes sense. So I don't think you'll see any one particular pattern emerging, it will be opportunistic and it will be case-by-case.  Where we can own more, if we think it's sensible, we will."

For the second quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 9% to $1.69 billion and AOCF increased 2.3% to $574 million. These results reflect the addition of Bresnan as well as a one-time favorable program cost adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. Without these items, revenue growth would have been 1.5% and AOCF growth would have been essentially flat for the quarter. These results also exclude AMC Networks, which was successfully spun off in June. 
For the first six months of 2011, Cablevision generated $354 million of free cash flow, a 31% increase over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Even without the contribution from Bresnan, free cash flow would have increased by 21%. The company repurchased more than 4 million shares in the second quarter. In addition, the Board of Directors has once again approved a $0.15 dividend payable in September. With the successful completion of our second spin off in 2 years, I am optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cablevision. 
While weakened economy and the competitive pressures impact our subscriber metrics this quarter, I'm confident that our superior architecture and network combined with our new product innovations will ensure that we continue to deliver better products and greater value for our customers. We have always been focused on a strategy that includes capitalizing on our investments in our Cable business and exceeding our customer's expectations on every level. And as Cablevision CEO, I can assure you that the focus has never been stronger than it is now. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge"

Telecommunications revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 9.8% over the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bresnan properties, total revenue growth was 1.7% year-over-year. 
In the second quarter, our total company results included an increase of 5,000 high-speed data customers, 27,000 new voice lines and a video loss of 23,000. In the Eastern Cablevision operations, average revenue per sub, or RPS, was $154.86, up 1.7% sequentially and up 3.8% over the prior year period. Our rate increase at the end of last year was smaller than normal due to the earlier retransmission issue yet RPS has grown steadily. And we are exceeding the marketplace with a higher price package to our new ultimate Triple Play priced $10 higher than Triple Play. Introduced in May the Ultimate Triple Play already represents over 50% of our new acquisition Triple Play customers. These customers are voluntarily agreed to higher rates in response to the enhanced services offered in the Ultimate Triple Play package. 
In the Eastern Cablevision footprint, our telco competition remains active and the economy has seen little improvement. While the second quarter is traditionally a stronger growth quarter for us, these 2 factors made our growth more challenging. And this trend has continued into the third quarter. 
However, our optimum business service has grown steadily. Optimum Lightpath revenue was $77 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 9% versus the prior year period. Lightpath now provides service to over 4,700 buildings, an increase of 17% over the prior year.  
Second quarter AOCF for Telecommunications segment was $625 million, representing an increase of 1.8% over the prior year. And last year's second quarter for the Cable company there was a nonrecurring favorable adjustment of $23 million. Excluding that impact as well as the Bresnan impact, AOCF would've been flat year-over-year. 
Operating expenses at Cable remained in check in the quarter, increasing only 2.8% on a pro forma basis. Optimum Lightpath AOCF grew by 17% in the quarter to $32.7 million. Margins continue to rise at Lightpath and in the second quarter, Lightpath AOCF margin was 42.4%. 
Bresnan properties now branded, Optimum, have been under our ownership for about 6 months. Already these properties have a Triple Play selling rate of roughly 50% compared with 20% at the time of our acquisition. 
Total Cable advertising revenue increased 22% over the prior year period without the inclusion of the Bresnan properties was up 13% on a same-store basis. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit add sales growth. While traditional add sales are strong, we are complementing this revenue through the use of our advanced advertising products. 
As an example, Optimum Select, which is available across the entire core footprint launched the new RFI product in the second quarter where advertisers can now fulfill customer requests for coupons for, et cetera through e-mail response. E-mail is attractive not only to our customers but it's very important to advertisers who can save on posters and shipping costs and still reach customers on a timely basis. We've now implemented hundreds of RFI campaigns for various advertisers, which generate more highly qualified leads. Additionally, we'd run a large volume of 30-second, adds that lead to advertisers long-form content in 10 to 20 minutes of engagement by our subscribers. Each of these are examples of how we continue to enhance our advanced advertising offerings, which in turn drive incremental advertising revenue for us. 
Overall, in order to continue to drive growth and to compete aggressively, we're keenly focused on adding more and more value to the products and services our customers enjoy today. We're doing this  through enhancement of existing products and services as well as through the addition of new and unique products. 
Recently, we rolled out Network DVR Plus in New York City and Connecticut and plan to launch it in Nassau County this fall and County early next year. This is a much more than the whole house DVR solution. Our service will, our customers to choose how much storage they would like and take advantage of multiple simultaneous playbacks. We've launched the iPad app where customers can view essentially all of our channels within streamline navigation on an iPad. Earlier today, we've launched the same application for iPhones and iPod Touches and at the same time added a remote control capability for all these devices on all TVs in the home. We're currently drilling in front of 50,000 customers, our enhanced set-top user interface, which includes more sophisticated search products, one of which is Movie Explorer, our own recognition engine, allowing s to dramatically increase the number of movie titles we can offer on Video-on-Demand. We've increased WiFi speeds to 50 megabits downstream and 4 megabits upstream. And we've introduced, as I said earlier, the Ultimate Triple Play, which includes the new faster, higher speeds service plus and a wireless router. And coming soon, we are planning to reduce the same functionality, which we have deployed on the iPad and Apple products on Androids, smartphones and tablets as well as PCs and Macs. All of these devices will be serviced by our integrated whole house products leading us the clear competitive leader in the telecommunications marketplace. 
As a result of these ongoing new product efforts, Cable capital spending in the quarter increased appreciably from the previous quarter as we invested in Boost Plus, iPad app development and RS-DVR. 
Total Cable capital for the quarter was $175 million or 11.6% of Cable revenue. On a year-to-date basis, total Cable capital spending was $282 million or 9.4% of revenue. If you look at the Eastern Cablevision operations on a standalone basis, capital efficiency for the first half of 2011 was 9.0% compared with the prior year period, capital efficiency of 10.8%. I'd now like to turn this call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial review."
25933,138912616,154932,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom.

As I'm sure you're all aware, we successfully completed the spinoff of AMC Networks on June 30. On the date of the distribution, we effectively provided our shareholders with a $9 per share tax-free dividend. As it was demonstrated providing strong shareholder returns is fundamental for the company strategy. 
Now that we've completed the spin, I thought I'd take a moment to mention that the results of AMC Networks, including costs associated with the spends is legal and professional fees are now reported as discontinued operations. Also reflected in discontinued operations are the management fees, which have previously been charged by Cablevision to AMC Networks. I should caution that AMC's results of operations reported on a standalone basis will differ from the results presented in the Cablevision earnings release and 10-Q with certain reclassifications and adjustments made for the purposes of Discontinued Operations reporting. 
Turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the company's consolidated cash position is $357 million. Net debt was $9.9 billion and on June 30, we have $1.35 billion undrawn under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. The drawn portion is primarily backstops for letters of credit. 
As of June 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio is 4.4x and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.1x. In April, the CSC Holdings repaid in full it's maturing $326 million, 7 5/8% senior notes and with revolver borrowings and cash on hand. And as a reminder, we utilized our revolver to execute our share repurchases in the first half of this year. As a result of the spin off and refinancing of AMC Networks, AMC distributed to Cablevision $1.25 billion, all of which was used to pay down borrower under the CSC Holdings revolver. 
At June 30, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage for the quarter was 7.2x. There were number of expenses incurred in the first half, including the wind down of our contract with a third-party voice provisioning company, the ramp up of our sales and marketing efforts and the Optimum rebranding, which impacted AOCF. We expect the Bresnan operating margins and leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters and I remain excited about Bresnan's prospects. 
Turning to Cablevision share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $143.9 million. From inception of the program from the end of June, we have repurchased 21.7 million shares totaling $695 million. We have $305 million of repurchase authorization available under our existing program and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchases. Since the beginning of the repurchase program in June of 2010, our total outstanding class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $231 million shrinking the total class A share base by approximately 8%. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million. It compares with the pro forma first quarter free cash flow of $232 million. This quarterly variance was driven largely by increased capital spending of $83 million in the quarter as we invested in new product initiatives. Free cash flow per share for the first 6 months of 2011 was $1.23, a 38% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow of $0.89 per share in the prior year period. 
I also want to take an opportunity to update our investors on our NOL position. At June 30, the NOL of Cablevision was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter amount of $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting the amount of the NOL with AMC and the spin off. We've taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011 and intend to do so again and although and this is given us about 14 or 15 months of additional NOL cover. We currently estimate that we will not fully use the NOL until sometime in 2013. Finally, diluted earnings per share was $0.31 for the quarter, up from $0.20 in the prior year period. Excluding income from discontinued operations, EPS was $0.24 in the second quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year period. Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

But I'm still very optimistic about the business itself and its growth prospects in the  long term. We continue to have a big opportunity to grow that business universe and the actual opportunity are maybe bigger in terms of penetration opportunity than there actually is in the Video business and in the Residential Voice business because almost all businesses I think will continue to have a wireline voice product to a foreseeable future. So there is a still a tremendous opportunity in the Small Business marketplace, there's still a big opportunity where Lightpath competes to grow those businesses. There's big opportunity to grow the Advertising business going forward and to take more share out of the market. I think you continue to see a shift out of traditional media. Television continues to work quite well and continues to attract dollars. And the interactive platform we've built, I think it allow us to actually not just maintain our share this business but shift the share in the future. And I still think in the long run, the Residential business is an opportunity for us with our superior products, continue to grow penetration. We are at very high penetrations in our marketplace. There's very little housing growth going on right now and there's actually a high vacancy rate. All of that hurts the Residential business at the moment, but for the long run, I expect that we will have a more normal economy in the future and that residential growth will take advantage of that."

Ultimately, it's a question of creating value for your customers that sometimes gives you pricing power and your overall mix. And sometimes, there are opportunities to sell your way into the marketplace with new products to drive incremental ARPU each transaction. And we choose different methodologies to drive value. And the point I was trying to make a little earlier in my presentation that sequentially, our RPS has grown pretty nicely. And that's a result of selling in any transactional product at a high penetration rate. On the other hand, WiFi, we don't charge for. And the reason we don't is we think we need to build value overtime by creating utilization of that product. It's not a product that has immediate economic observable value to a customer until they utilize product. So as that becomes more utilized because there's pricing power on our overall subscriber relationship, so we think there is a way to monetize Network DVR and not only an opportunity for monetization because it offers new services and new functionality that aren't offered by traditional DVR. But it's a less expensive capital project as well in the subscriber basis, which either gives us the opportunity to charge the same rates as our competitors at lower costs. And in terms of product differentiation, you can argue it gives us a higher revenue per subscriber opportunity as well. So it depends on the product, how it's rolled out and how it's perceived in the mind of the consumer when this initially launched."

I think as anybody on this call knows, we've been associated with every potential acquisition in the cable industry over the last 9 months. I've seen research reports before having us buying 3 or 4 different targets and I think the reality is it very much what we stated from the time that we've made of the Bresnan acquisition. We start with an operating plan. We determine what we think we can do with the asset. We look at the returns from those types of acquisitions and we compare them to opportunities such as repurchasing our own stock. And I think again, Bresnan for us was almost a unique situation. It have a combination of an operating attributes and financial attributes, which made it especially attractive. And we will continue to believe looking at acquisition opportunities going forward but I don't see anything on the immediate horizon in that regard. And I'd also point out that given the disruption in the markets at this point in time, it will be very difficult to allow a ring fence transaction today and use nonrecourse debt to deal with the high yield markets locked up, quite a bit over the last few months. And part of the issue with the auction process as we see it is that we're oftentimes asked to make a financial commitment as in the case of Bresnan, 6 months before actually doing the financing. And I think in today's market, there's a tremendous amount of markets risk in the flex terms on any type of a commitment from our friends in the banking community would be dramatically wider. And so I think that the ability to finance on a ring fence basis at this point in time is quite reduced.

I'm not sure that from an accounting standpoint, KPMG would be saying it's one-time but we know we're not going to be paying a going forward as we are now provisioning our own calls out of there. So that is something that depressed margins more than we anticipated that's going away. And we expect the margins to broaden out to the type of numbers that we were looking at moving forward.

It was accurate. Our product, which as I said earlier has 75% share has been consistently recognized by JD Powers and PC Magazine there from the consumer perspective as the best product data product in the country. And it still is, notwithstanding the way that the FCC measured the product. And while the FCC test is accurate at some level, it doesn't -- it's misinterpreted in terms of its implications to customers. One thing about it is that it's a reference to advertised speed at peak times. So a DSL service at 750 kilobits that is operating at 750 kilobits looks better on that chart than our service. And as I said earlier, 50% of our new Triple Play customers are selling into our DOCSIS 3 platform, 50-megabit service, we continue to drive the Data business. We continue to drive data ARPU in the business and we continue to have a superior product to our competitors in the Data business in the actual utilization and perception of the customer. In terms of fending off Verizon or anyone else for that matter, there are still more satellite customers on our footprint than there are in Verizon by the way and that number is steadily coming down. We think we can take it down faster with additional offer and selling strategies. And we don't have anything new or unusual to announce other than that we did announce today that we've launched the iPad app on iTouches and iPhones which will bring to about 1 million people, 1 million homes in our marketplace the functionality of being able to watch live TV in the home on these devices. And also the fact is the new remote control device every TV in the house, even more interesting to operate as a new navigation device to have a really easy way to see what's on and to goes through your search engines, to go through lots of information and pick the kind of content that you want to watch that makes the product more competitive with over-the-top providers like Netflix. It makes us more competitive with any of the over-the-top providers and it makes us  superior to all of our wireline and satellite competitors.

And we see our converter strategy using downloadable security, our network DVR strategy and our ability to serve IP devices without converters at all as a continuation of a network architecture that we've been designing for a long time that allows us to serve more and more customers with less and less capital.

For the second quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 9% to $1.69 billion and AOCF increased 2.3% to $574 million. These results reflect the addition of Bresnan, as well as a onetime favorable programming cost adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. Without these items, revenue growth would have been 1.5% and AOCF growth would have been essentially flat for the quarter. These results also exclude AMC Networks, which was successfully spun off in June. 
For the first six months of 2011, Cablevision generated $354 million of free cash flow, a 31% increase over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Even without the contribution from Bresnan, free cash flow would have increased by 21%. The company repurchased more than 4 million shares in the second quarter. In addition, the Board of Directors has once again approved a $0.15 per share dividend payable in September. With the successful completion of our second spin off in 2 years, I'm optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cablevision. 
While weakened economy and the competitive pressures impacted our subscriber metrics this quarter, I'm confident that our superior architecture and network combined with our new product innovations will ensure that we continue to deliver better products and greater value for our customers. We have always been focused on a strategy that includes capitalizing on our investments in our cable business and exceeding our customer's expectations on every level. And as Cablevision's CEO, I can assure you that the focus has never been stronger than it is now.

Telecommunications revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 9.8% over the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bresnan properties, total revenue growth was 1.7% year-over-year. 
In the second quarter, our total company results included an increase of 5,000 high-speed data customers, 27,000 new voice lines and a video loss of 23,000. In the Eastern Cablevision operations, average revenue per sub or RPS was $154.86, up 1.7% sequentially, and up 3.8% over the prior year period. Our rate increase at the end of last year was smaller than normal due to the earlier retransmission issue, yet RPS has grown steadily. And we're exceeding the marketplace with a higher price package to our new ultimate Triple Play priced $10 higher than the standard Triple Play. Introduced in May, the Ultimate Triple Play already represents over 50% of our new acquisition Triple Play customers. These customers have voluntarily agreed to higher rates in response to the enhanced services offered in the Ultimate Triple Play package. 
In the Eastern Cablevision footprint, our telco competition remains active and the economy has seen little improvement. While the second quarter is traditionally a stronger growth quarter for us, these 2 factors made our growth more challenging. And this trend has continued into the third quarter.
However, our Optimum Business service is growing steadily. Optimum Lightpath revenue was $77 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 9% versus the prior year period. Lightpath now provides service to over 4,700 buildings, an increase of 17% over the prior year.  
Second quarter AOCF for Telecommunications segment was $625 million, representing an increase of 1.8% over the prior year. In last year's second quarter for the Cable company, there was a non-recurring favorable adjustment of $23 million. Excluding that impact as well as the Bresnan impact, AOCF would've been flat year-over-year. 
Operating expenses at Cable remained in check in the quarter, increasing only 2.8% on a pro forma basis. Optimum Lightpath AOCF grew by 17% in the quarter to $32.7 million. Margins continue to rise at Lightpath and in the second quarter, Lightpath AOCF margin was 42.4%. 
Bresnan properties, now branded Optimum, have been under our ownership for about 6 months. Already, these properties have a Triple Play sell-in rate of roughly 50% compared with 20% at the time of our acquisition. 
Total Cable advertising revenue increased 22% over the prior year period, without the inclusion of the Bresnan properties was up 13% on a same-store basis. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit add sales growth. While traditional add sales are strong, we are complementing this revenue through our -- the use of our advanced advertising product. 
As an example, Optimum Select, which is available across the entire core footprint launched the new RFI product in the second quarter where advertisers can now fulfill customer requests for coupons, brochures, et cetera, through e-mail response. E-mail is attractive not only to our customers, but it's very important to advertisers who can save on postage and shipping costs and yet still reach their customers on a timely basis. We've now implemented hundreds of RFI campaigns for various advertisers, which generate more highly qualified leads. Additionally, we'd run a large volume of 30-second telescoped ads that lead to advertisers long-form content in 10 to 20 minutes of engagement by our subscribers. Each of these are examples of how we continue to enhance our advanced advertising offerings, which in turn drive incremental advertising revenue for us. 
Overall, in order to continue to drive growth and to compete aggressively, we're keenly focused on adding more and more value to the products and services our customers enjoy today. We're doing this through enhancement of existing products and services as well as through the addition of new and unique products. 
Most recently, we've rolled out Network DVR Plus in New York City and Connecticut and plan to launch it in Nassau County this fall and Suffolk County early next year. This is much more than a whole house DVR solution. Our service will eventually allow our customers to choose how much storage they would like and take advantage of multiple simultaneous playbacks. We've launched the iPad app, where customers can view essentially all of our channels within streamline navigation on an iPad. Earlier today, we've launched the same application for iPhones and iPod Touches and at the same time, added a remote control capability for all these devices on all TVs in the home. We're currently trialing in front of 50,000 customers, our enhanced set-top user interface, which includes more sophisticated search products. One of which is Movie Explorer, our own recognition engine, allowing us to dramatically increase the number of movie titles we can offer on Video-on-Demand. We've increased WiFi speeds to 50 megabits downstream and 4 megabits upstream. And we've introduced, as I said earlier, the Ultimate Triple Play, which includes a new faster higher speeds service plus and a wireless router. And coming soon, we're planning to introduce the same functionality, which we have deployed on the iPad and Apple products on Androids, smartphones and tablets as well as PCs and Macs. All of these devices will be serviced by our integrated whole house products leaving us the clear competitive leader in the local telecommunications marketplace. 
As a result of these ongoing new product efforts, Cable capital spending in the quarter increased appreciably from the previous quarter as we invested in Boost Plus, iPad app development and RS-DVR. Total Cable capital for the quarter was $175 million or 11.6% of Cable revenue. On a year-to-date basis, total Cable capital spending was $282 million or 9.4% of revenue. If you look at the Eastern Cablevision operations on a standalone basis, capital efficiency for the first half of 2011 was 9.0% compared with the prior year period, capital efficiency of 10.8%. 
I'd now like to turn this call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial preview."

As I'm sure you're all aware, we successfully completed the spin-off of AMC Networks on June 30. On the date of the distribution, we effectively provided our shareholders with a $9 per share tax-free dividend. I think we've demonstrated that providing strong shareholder returns is fundamental to the company strategy. 
Now that we've completed the spend, I thought I'd take a moment and mention that the results of AMC Networks, including costs associated with the spends as legal and professional fees are now reported as discontinued operations. Also reflected in discontinued operations are the management fees, which have previously been charged by Cablevision to AMC Networks. I should caution that AMC Networks' results of operations, when reported on a standalone basis, will differ from the results presented in the Cablevision earnings release and 10-Q due to certain reclassifications and adjustments made for the purposes of discontinued operations reporting. 
Turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $357 million. Net debt was $9.9 billion and on June 30, we have $1.35 billion undrawn under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. The drawn portion is primarily backstops for letters of credit. 
As of June 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio is 4.4x and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.1x. In April, CSC Holdings repaid in full its maturing $326 million, 7 5/8% senior notes and with revolver borrowings and cash on hand. And as a reminder, we utilized our revolver to execute our share repurchases in the first half of this year. As a result of the spin off and refinancing of AMC Networks, AMC distributed to Cablevision $1.25 billion, all of which was used to pay down borrowings under the CSC Holdings of revolver. 
At June 30, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage for the quarter was 7.2x. There were a number of expenses incurred in the first half, including the wind down of our contract with a third-party voice provisioning company, the ramp up of our sales and marketing efforts and the Optimum rebranding, which impacted AOCF. We expect the Bresnan operating margins and leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters and remain excited about Bresnan's prospects. 
Turning to Cablevision share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $143.9 million. From inception of the program for the end of June, we have repurchased 21.7 million shares totaling $695 million. We have $305 million of repurchase authorization available under our existing program and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchases. Since the beginning of the repurchase program in June of 2010, our total outstanding class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $231 million shrinking the total class A share base by approximately 8%. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million and compares with the pro forma first quarter free cash flow of $232 million. This quarterly variance was driven largely by increased capital spending of $83 million in the quarter as we invested in new product initiatives. Free cash flow per share for the first 6 months of 2011 was $1.23, a 38% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow of 89% -- $0.89 per share in the prior year period. 
I also want to take an opportunity to update our investors on our NOL position. At June 30, the NOL at Cablevision was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter amount of $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting the amount of the NOL with AMC and the spin off. We've taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012. And this has given us about 14 or 15 months of additional NOL cover. We currently estimate that we will not fully use the NOL until sometime in 2013. Finally, diluted earnings per share was $0.31 for the quarter, up from $0.20 in the prior year period. Excluding income from discontinued operations, EPS was $0.24 in the second quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year period. 
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

But I'm still very optimistic about the business itself and its growth prospects in the long term. We continue to have a big opportunity to grow the business universe. And the actual opportunity there maybe bigger in terms of penetration opportunity than there actually is in the video business and in the residential voice business because almost all businesses I think will continue to have a wireline voice product for the foreseeable future. So there's still a tremendous opportunity in the Small Business marketplace. There's still a big opportunity where Lightpath competes to grow those businesses. There's a big opportunity to grow the advertising business going forward. And to take more share out of the market, I think you continue to see a shift out of traditional media. Television continues to work quite well and continues to attract dollars. And the interactive platform we've built, I think can allow us to actually not just maintain our share of that business but to shift the share in the future. And I still think in the long run, the residential business is an opportunity for us with our superior products, continue to grow penetration. We are at very high penetrations in our marketplace. There's very little housing growth going on right now and there's actually a high vacancy rate. All of that hurts the residential business at the moment. But for the long run, I expect that we will have a more normal economy in the future and that residential growth will take advantage of that."

Ultimately, it's a question of creating value for your customers that sometimes gives you pricing power and your overall mix. And sometimes, there are opportunities to sell your way into the marketplace with new products that drive incremental ARPU on each transaction. And we choose different methodologies to drive value in. But the point I was trying to make earlier in my presentation was that sequentially, our RPS is  growing pretty nicely. And that's as a result of selling in a transactional product at a high penetration rate. On the other hand, WiFi, we don't charge for. And the reason we don't is we think we need to build value overtime by creating utilization of that product. It's not a product that has immediate economic observable value to a customer until they utilize the product. So as that becomes more utilized because there's pricing power on our overall subscriber relationship. So we think there is a way to monetize Network DVR and not only an opportunity for monetization because it offers new services and new functionality that aren't offered by traditional DVR. But it's a less expensive capital project as well on a per subscriber basis, which either gives us the opportunity to charge the same rates as our competitors at lower costs. And in terms of product differentiation, you can argue it gives us a higher revenue per subscriber opportunity as well. So depends on the product, how it gets rolled out and how it's perceived in the mind of a consumer when it's initially launched."

The high-yield markets locked up quite a bit over the last few months. And part of the issue with the auction process as we see it is that we're oftentimes asked to make a financial commitment. As in the case of Bresnan, 6 months before actually doing the financing. And I think in today's market, there's a tremendous amount of market risk, the flex terms on any type of a commitment from our friends in the banking community would be dramatically wider. And so I think that the ability to finance on a ring fence basis at this point in time is quite reduced. So we'll see where the acquisition market goes. But at this point in time as both Jim and Tom have pointed out, we're focused on our core operations in Bresnan."

It was accurate. Our product, which as I said earlier has 75% share has been consistently recognized by JD Powers and PC Magazine from a consumer perspective as the best product, data product in the country. And it still is, notwithstanding the way that the FCC measured the product. And while the FCC test is accurate at some level, it doesn't -- it's misinterpreted in terms of its implications to customers. One thing about it is that it's a reference to advertised speed at peak times. So a DSL service at 750 kilobits that is operating at 750 kilobits looks better on that chart than our service. And as I said earlier, 50% of our new Triple Play customers are selling into our DOCSIS 3 platform, 50-megabit service. We continue to drive the data business. We continue to drive data ARPU in the business, and we continue to have a superior product to our competitors in the data business in the actual utilization and perception of the customer. In terms of fending off Verizon or anyone else for that matter, there's still more satellite customers on our footprint than are in Verizon by the way and that number is steadily coming down. We think we can take it down faster with additional offer and selling strategies. And we don't have anything new or unusual to announce other than that we did announce today that we've launched the iPad app on iTouches and iPhones which will bring to about a million people, a million homes in our marketplace the functionality of being able to watch live TV in the home on these devices. And also to act as a new remote control device on every TV in the house, even more interesting to operate as a new navigation device to have a real easy way to see what's on and to go through your search engines, to go through lots of information and pick the kind of content that you want to watch that makes our VOD product more competitive with over-the-top providers like Netflix.

For the second quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 9% to $1.69 billion and AOCF increased 2.3% to $574 million. These results reflect the addition of Bresnan, as well as a onetime favorable programming cost adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. Without these items, revenue growth would have been 1.5% and AOCF growth would have been essentially flat for the quarter. These results also exclude AMC Networks, which was successfully spun off in June. 
For the first six months of 2011, Cablevision generated $354 million of free cash flow, a 31% increase over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Even without the contribution from Bresnan, free cash flow would have increased by 21%. The company repurchased more than 4 million shares in the second quarter. In addition, the Board of Directors has once again approved a $0.15 per share dividend payable in September. With the successful completion of our second spinoff in 2 years, I'm optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cablevision. 
While weakened economy and the competitive pressures impacted our subscriber metrics this quarter, I'm confident that our superior architecture and network combined with our new product innovations will ensure that we continue to deliver better products and greater value for our customers. We have always been focused on a strategy that includes capitalizing on our investments in our cable business and exceeding our customer's expectations on every level.

Telecommunications revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 9.8% over the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bresnan properties, total revenue growth was 1.7% year-over-year. 
In the second quarter, our total company results included an increase of 5,000 high-speed data customers, 27,000 new voice lines and a video loss of 23,000. In the Eastern Cablevision operations, average revenue per sub, or RPS, was $154.86, up 1.7% sequentially, and up 3.8% over the prior year period. Our rate increase at the end of last year was smaller than normal due to the earlier retransmission issue, yet RPS has grown steadily. And we're exceeding the marketplace with a higher price package to our new ultimate Triple Play priced $10 higher than our standard Triple Play. Introduced in May, the Ultimate Triple Play already represents over 50% of our new acquisition Triple Play customers. These customers are voluntarily agreeing to higher rates in response to the enhanced services offered in the Ultimate Triple Play package. 
In the Eastern Cablevision footprint, our telco competition remains active and the economy has seen little improvement. While the second quarter is traditionally a stronger growth quarter for us, these 2 factors made our growth more challenging. And this trend has continued into the third quarter.
However, our Optimum Business service is growing steadily. Optimum Lightpath revenue was $77 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 9% versus the prior year period. Lightpath now provides service to over 4,700 buildings, an increase of 17% over the prior year.  
Second quarter AOCF for Telecommunications segment was $625 million, representing an increase of 1.8% over the prior year. In last year's second quarter for the Cable company, there was a non-recurring favorable adjustment of $23 million. Excluding that impact as well as the Bresnan impact, AOCF would've been flat year-over-year. 
Operating expenses at Cable remained in check in the quarter, increasing only 2.8% on a pro forma basis. Optimum Lightpath AOCF grew by 17% in the quarter to $32.7 million. Margins continue to rise at Lightpath and in the second quarter, Lightpath AOCF margin was 42.4%. 
Bresnan properties, now branded Optimum, have been under our ownership for about 6 months. Already, these properties have a Triple Play sell-in rate of roughly 50% compared with 20% at the time of our acquisition. 
Total Cable advertising revenue increased 22% over the prior year period, without the inclusion of the Bresnan properties was up 13% on a same-store basis. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ad sales growth. While traditional ad sales are strong, we are complementing this revenue through our -- the use of our advanced advertising product. 
As an example, Optimum Select, which is available across the entire core footprint launched the new RFI product in the second quarter where advertisers can now fulfill customer requests for coupons, brochures, et cetera, through e-mail response. E-mail is attractive not only to our customers, but it's very important to advertisers who can save on postage and shipping costs and yet still reach their customers on a timely basis. We've now implemented hundreds of RFI campaigns for various advertisers, which generate more highly qualified leads. Additionally, we'd run a large volume of 30-second telescoped ads that lead to advertiser long-form content in 10 to 20 minutes of engagement by our subscribers. Each of these are examples of how we continue to enhance our advanced advertising offerings, which in turn drives incremental advertising revenue for us. 
Overall, in order to continue to drive growth and to compete aggressively, we're keenly focused on adding more and more value to the products and services our customers enjoy today. We're doing this through enhancement of existing products and services as well as through the addition of new and unique products. 
Most recently, we've rolled out Network DVR Plus in New York City and Connecticut and plan to launch it in Nassau County this fall and Suffolk County early next year. This is much more than a whole house DVR solution. Our service will eventually allow our customers to choose how much storage they would like and take advantage of multiple simultaneous playbacks. We've launched the iPad app, where customers can view essentially all of our channels within streamline navigation on an iPad. Earlier today, we've launched the same application for iPhones and iPod Touches and at the same time, added remote control capability for all these devices on all TVs in the home. We're currently trialing in front of 50,000 customers, our enhanced set-top user interface, which includes more sophisticated search products. One of which is Movie Explorer, our own recommendation engine, allowing us to dramatically increase the number of movie titles we can offer on Video-on-Demand. We've increased WiFi speeds to 50 megabits downstream and 4 megabits upstream. And we've introduced, as I said earlier, the Ultimate Triple Play, which includes a new faster, higher-speeds service plus and a wireless router. And coming soon, we're planning to introduce the same functionality, which we have deployed on the iPad and the other Apple products on Android smartphones and tablets as well as PCs and Macs. All of these devices will be serviced by our integrated whole house products leaving us the clear competitive leader in the local telecommunications marketplace. 
As a result of these ongoing new product efforts, Cable capital spending in the quarter increased appreciably from the previous quarter as we invested in Boost Plus, iPad app development and RS-DVR. Total Cable capital for the quarter was $175 million or 11.6% of Cable revenue. On a year-to-date basis, total Cable capital spending was $282 million or 9.4% of revenue. If you look at the Eastern Cablevision operations on a standalone basis, capital efficiency for the first half of 2011 was 9.0% compared with the prior year period, capital efficiency of 10.8%. 
I'd now like to turn this call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial preview."
25933,138912616,155200,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom.

As I'm sure you're all aware, we successfully completed the spin off of AMC Networks on June 30. On the date of the distribution, we effectively provided our shareholders with a $9 per share tax-free dividend. I think we've demonstrated that providing strong shareholder returns is fundamental to the company's strategy. 
Now that we've completed the spend, I thought I'd take a moment and mention that the results of AMC Networks, including costs associated with the spends as legal and professional fees are now reported as discontinued operations. Also reflected in discontinued operations are the management fees, which have previously been charged by Cablevision to AMC Networks. I should caution that AMC Networks' results of operations, when reported on a standalone basis, will differ from the results presented in the Cablevision earnings release and 10-Q due to certain reclassifications and adjustments made for the purposes of discontinued operations reporting. 
Turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $357 million. Net debt was $9.9 billion and on June 30, we have $1.35 billion undrawn under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. The drawn portion is primarily backstops for letters of credit. 
As of June 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.4x and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.1x. In April, CSC Holdings repaid in full its maturing $326 million, 7 5/8% senior notes and with revolver borrowings and cash on hand. And as a reminder, we utilized our revolver to execute our share repurchases in the first half of this year. As a result of the spin off and refinancing of AMC Networks, AMC distributed to Cablevision $1.25 billion, all of which was used to pay down borrowings under the CSC Holdings of revolver. 
At June 30, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage for the quarter was 7.2x. There were a number of expenses incurred in the first half, including the wind down of our contract with a third-party voice provisioning company, the ramp up of our sales and marketing efforts and the Optimum rebranding, which impacted AOCF. We expect the Bresnan operating margins and leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters and remain excited about Bresnan's prospects. 
Turning to Cablevision share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $143.9 million. From inception of the program through the end of June, we have repurchased 21.7 million shares totaling $695 million. We have $305 million of repurchase authorization available under our existing program and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchases. Since the beginning of the repurchase program in June of 2010, our total outstanding class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $231 million shrinking the total class A share base by approximately 8%. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million and compares with the pro forma first quarter free cash flow of $232 million. This quarterly variance was driven largely by increased capital spending of $83 million in the quarter as we invested in new product initiatives. Free cash flow per share for the first 6 months of 2011 was $1.23, a 38% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow of 89% -- $0.89 per share in the prior year period. 
I also want to take an opportunity to update our investors on our NOL position. At June 30, the NOL at Cablevision was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter amount of $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting the amount of the NOL that went with AMC in the spin off. We've taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012. And this has given us about 14 or 15 months of additional NOL cover. We currently estimate that we will not fully use the NOL until sometime in 2013. Finally, diluted earnings per share was $0.31 for the quarter, up from $0.20 in the prior year period. Excluding income from discontinued operations, EPS was $0.24 in the second quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year period. 
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

And the actual opportunity there maybe bigger in terms of penetration opportunity than there actually is in the video business and in the residential voice business because almost all businesses I think will continue to have a wireline voice product for the foreseeable future. So there's still a tremendous opportunity in the Small Business marketplace. There's still a big opportunity where Lightpath competes to grow those businesses. There's a big opportunity to grow the advertising business going forward. And to take more share out of the market, I think you continue to see a shift out of traditional media. Television continues to work quite well and continues to attract dollars. And the interactive platform we've built, I think can allow us to actually not just maintain our share of that business but to shift the share in the future. And I still think in the long run, the residential business is an opportunity for us with our superior products, continue to grow penetration. We are at very high penetrations in our marketplace. There's very little housing growth going on right now and there's actually a high vacancy rate. All of that hurts the residential business at the moment.

Ultimately, it's a question of creating value for your customers that sometimes gives you pricing power on your overall mix. And sometimes there are opportunities to sell your way into the marketplace with new products that drive incremental ARPU on each transaction. And we choose different methodologies to drive value in. But the point I was trying to make earlier in my presentation was that sequentially, our RPS is  growing pretty nicely. And that's as a result of selling in a transactional product at a high penetration rate. On the other hand, WiFi, we don't charge for. And the reason we don't is we think we need to build value over time by creating utilization of that product. It's not a product that has immediate economic observable value to a customer until they utilize the product. So as that becomes more utilized because there's pricing power on our overall subscriber relationship. So we think there is a way to monetize Network DVR and not only an opportunity for monetization because it offers new services and new functionality that aren't offered by traditional DVR. But it's a less expensive capital project as well on a per subscriber basis, which either gives us the opportunity to charge the same rates as our competitors and have lower costs. And in terms of product differentiation, you can argue it gives us a higher revenue per subscriber opportunity as well. So depends on the product, how it gets rolled out and how it's perceived in the mind of a consumer when it's initially launched."

I think that as everybody on this call knows, we've been associated with every potential acquisition in the cable industry over the last 9 months. So I've seen the research reports that have us buying 3 or 4 different targets. And I think the reality is very much what we've stated from the time that we made the Bresnan acquisition. We start with an operating plan. We determine what we think that we can do with the asset. We look at the returns from those type of acquisitions and we compare them to opportunities such as repurchasing our own stock. And I think again, Bresnan for us was a almost unique situation. It have a combination of operating attributes and financial attributes, which made it especially attractive. And we will continue, I believe, to look at acquisition opportunities going forward but I don't see anything on the immediate horizon in that regard. And I'd also point out that given the disruption in the markets at this point in time, it would be very difficult to allow a ring fence transaction today and use non-recourse debt to do it. The high-yield markets locked up quite a bit over the last few months. And part of the issue with the auction process as we see it is that we're oftentimes asked to make a financial commitment. As in the case of Bresnan, 6 months before actually doing the financing. And I think in today's market, there's a tremendous amount of market risk, the flex terms on any type of a commitment from our friends in the banking community would be dramatically wider. And so I think that the ability to finance on a ring fence basis at this point in time is quite reduced. So we'll see where the acquisition market goes. But at this point in time as both Jim and Tom have pointed out, we're focused on our core operations and Bresnan."

Our product, which as I said earlier has 75% share has been consistently recognized by JD Powers and PC Magazine from a consumer perspective as the best product, data product in the country. And it still is, notwithstanding the way that the FCC measured the product. And while the FCC test is accurate at some level, it doesn't -- it's misinterpreted in terms of its implications to customers. One thing about it is that it's a reference to advertised speed at peak times. So a DSL service at 750 kilobits that is operating at 750 kilobits looks better on that chart than our service. And as I said earlier, 50% of our new Triple Play customers are selling into our DOCSIS 3 platform, 50-megabit service. We continue to drive the data business. We continue to drive data ARPU in the business, and we continue to have a superior product to our competitors in the data business in the actual utilization and perception of the customer. In terms of fending off Verizon or anyone else for that matter, there's still more satellite customers in our footprint than are in Verizon, by the way, and that number is steadily coming down. We think we can take it down faster with additional offer and selling strategies. And we don't have anything new or unusual to announce other than that we did announce today that we've launched the iPad app on iTouches and iPhones, which will bring to about a million people, a million homes in our marketplace the functionality of being able to watch live TV in the home on these devices. And also to act as a new remote control device on every TV in the house, even more interesting to operate as a new navigation device to have a real easy way to see what's on and to go through -- use search engines to go through lots of information and pick the kind of content that you want to watch that makes our VOD product more competitive with over-the-top providers like Netflix.

For the second quarter, Cablevision’s consolidated revenue grew 9% to $1.69 billion and AOCF increased 2.3% to $574 million. These results reflect the addition of Bresnan as well as a one-time favorable programming cost adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. Without these items, revenue growth would have been 1.5% and AOCF growth would have been essentially flat for the quarter. These results also exclude AMC Networks, which was successfully spun-off in June.
For the first six months of 2011, Cablevision generated $354 million in free cash flow, a 31% increase over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Even without the contribution from Bresnan, free cash flow would have increased by 21%.
The company repurchased more than 4 million shares in the second quarter. In addition, the Board of Directors has once again approved a $0.15 per share dividend payable in September.
With the successful completion of our second spin-off in two years, I’m optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cablevision. While a weakened economy and competitive pressures impacted our subscriber metrics this quarter, I’m confident that our superior architecture and network combined with our new product innovations will ensure that we continue to deliver better products and greater value for our customers.
We’ve always been focused on a strategy that includes capitalizing on our investments in our cable business and exceeding our customers’ expectations on every level. And as Cablevision’s CEO, I can assure you that the focus has never been stronger than it is now.

In the Eastern Cablevision operations, average revenue per sub or RPS was $154.86, up 1.7% sequentially and up 3.8% over the prior-year period. Our rate increase at the end of last year was smaller than normal due to the earlier retransmission issue. Yet RPS has grown steadily, and we are seeding the marketplace with a higher-priced package through our new Ultimate Triple Play, which is priced $10 higher than our standard Triple Play.
Introduced in May, the Ultimate Triple Play already represents over 50% of our new acquisition Triple Play customers. These customers are voluntarily agreeing to higher rates in response to the enhanced services offered in the Ultimate Triple Play package.
In the Eastern Cablevision footprint, our Telecom competition remains active and the economy has seen little improvement. While the second quarter is traditionally a stronger growth quarter for us, these two factors made our growth more challenging, and this trend has continued into the third quarter.
However, our Optimum business service has grown steadily. Optimum Lightpath revenue was $77 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 9% versus the prior year period. Lightpath now provides service to over 4,700 buildings, an increase of 17% over the prior year.
Second quarter AOCF for telecommunications segment was $625 million, representing an increase of 1.8% over the prior year. In last year’s second-quarter for the cable company, there was a non-recurring favorable adjustment of $23 million. Excluding that impact as well as the Bresnan impact, AOCF would have been flat year over year. Operating expenses of cable remained in check in the quarter, increasing only 2.8% on a pro forma basis.
Optimum Lightpath AOCF grew by 17% in the quarter to $32.7 million. Margins continued to rise at Lightpath, and in the second quarter, Lightpath’s AOCF margin was 42.4%.
The Bresnan properties now branded Optimum have been under our ownership for about six months. Already these properties have a triple play sell-in rate of roughly 50% compared with 20% at the time of acquisition.
Total cable advertising revenue increased 22% over the prior year period. Without the inclusion of the Bresnan properties, it was up 13% on a same-store basis. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ad sales growth.
While traditional ad sales are strong, we are complementing this revenue through the use of our advanced advertising products. As an example, Optimum Select, which is available across the entire core footprint, launched a new RFI product in the second quarter where advertisers can now fulfill customer request for coupons, brochures, et cetera, through email response. Email is attractive not only to our customers, but it’s very important to advertisers who can save on postage and shipping costs and yet still reach their customers on a timely basis.
We’ve now implemented hundreds of RFI campaigns for various advertisers, which generate more highly qualified leads. Additionally, we have run a large volume of 30-second telescope ad that lead to advertiser long-form content and 10 to 20 minutes of engagement by our subscribers. Each of these are examples of how we continue to enhance our advanced advertising offerings, which in turn drives incremental advertising revenue for us.
Overall, in order to continue to drive growth and to compete aggressively, we’re keenly focused on adding more and more value to the products and services our customers enjoy today. We’re doing this through enhancement of existing products and services as well as through the addition of new and unique products.
Most recently, we’ve rolled out network DVR Plus in New York City and Connecticut, and plan to launch it in Nassau County this fall and Suffolk County early next year. This is much more than a whole house DVR solution. Our service will eventually allow customers to chose how much storage they would like and take advantage of multiple simultaneous playbacks.
We’ve launched the iPad app, where our customers can view essentially all of our channels with intuitive, streamlined navigation on an iPad. Earlier today, we’ve launched the same application for iPhones and iPod touches, and at the same, added remote control capability for all these devices on all TVs in the home.
We are currently trialing in front of 50,000 customers our enhanced set-top user interface, which includes more sophisticated search products, one of which is Movie Explorer, our own recommendation engine, allowing us to dramatically increase the number of movie titles we can offer on video-on-demand.
We’ve increased Wi-Fi speeds to 15 megabits downstream and 4 megabits upstream. And we’ve introduced, as I said earlier, the Ultimate Triple Play, which includes a new faster higher speed service, Boost Plus, and a wireless router. And coming soon, we’re planning to introduce the same functionality which we have deployed on the iPad and the other Apple products, on Androids, smart phones and tablets as well as PCs and Macs. All of these devices will be serviced by our integrated whole house products, leaving us the clear competitive leader in the local telecommunications marketplace.
As a result of these ongoing new product efforts, cable capital spending in the quarter increased appreciably from the previous quarter, as we invested in Boost Plus, iPad app development, and RS-DVR. Total cable capital for the quarter was $175 million or 11.6% of cable revenue. On a year-to-date basis, total cable capital spending was $282 million or 9.4% of revenue.
If you look at the Eastern Cablevision operations on a standalone basis, capital efficiency for the first half of 2011 was 9.0% compared with the prior year period capital efficiency of 10.8%.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Gregg Seibert for (inaudible).

As I’m sure you’re all aware, we successfully completed the spin-off of AMC Networks on June 30. On the date of the distribution, we effectively provided our shareholders with $9 per share of tax-free dividend. I think we’ve demonstrated that providing strong shareholder returns is fundamental to the company’s strategy.
Now that we’ve completed the spin, I thought I’d take a moment and mention that the results of AMC Networks including costs associated with the spins such as legal and professional fees, are now reported as discontinued operations. Also reflected in discontinued operations are the management fees which had previously been charged by Cablevision to AMC Networks.
I should caution that AMC Networks results of operations when reported on a standalone basis will differ from the results presented in the Cablevision earnings release in the 10-Q due to certain reclassifications and adjustments made for the purposes of discontinued operations reporting.
Turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the company’s consolidated cash position was $357 million, net debt was $9.9 billion, and at June 30, we had $1.35 billion undrawn under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. The drawn portion is primarily backstops for letters of credit.
As of June 30, the company’s consolidated leverage ratio was 4.4 times, and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.1 times.
In April, CSC Holdings repaid in full its maturing $326 million 7-5/8% senior notes with revolver borrowings and cash on hand. And as a reminder, we utilized our revolver to execute our share repurchases in the first half of this year. As a result of the spin off and refinancing of AMC Networks, AMC distributed to Cablevision $1.25 billion, all of which was used to pay down borrowings under the CSC Holdings revolver.
At June 30, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage for the quarter was 7.2 times. There were a number of expenses incurred in the first half, including the wind down of our contract with a third-party voice provisioning company, the ramp-up of our sales and marketing efforts, and the Optimum rebranding, which impacted AOCF. We expect the Bresnan operating margins and leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters and remain excited about Bresnan’s prospects.
Turning to Cablevision’s share repurchase program, in the second quarter we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of Cablevision stock totaling $143.9 million. From inception of the program through the end of June, we have repurchased 21.7 million shares totaling $695 million.
We have $305 million of repurchase authorization available under our existing program, and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchases. Since the beginning of the repurchase program, June of 2010, our total outstanding class A shares have decreased from 251 million to 231 million, shrinking the total class A share base by approximately 8%.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million and compares with the pro forma first-quarter free cash flow of $232 million. This quarterly variance was driven largely by increased capital spending of $83 million from the quarter as we invested in new product initiatives.
Free cash flow per share for the first six months of 2011 was a $1.23, a 38% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow of $0.89 per share in the prior year period.
I also want to take an opportunity to update our investors on our NOL position. At June 30, the NOL at Cablevision was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter amount of $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting the amount of the NOL that went with AMC in the spin-off.
We’ve taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012, and this has given us about 14 or 15 months of additional NOL cover. We currently estimate that we will not fully use the NOL until sometime in 2013.
Finally, diluted earnings share was $0.31 for the quarter, up from $0.20 in the prior year period. Excluding income from discontinued operations, EPS was $0.24 in the second quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year period.
Operator, we are now prepared to open the call for questions.

But I’m still very optimistic about the business itself and its growth prospects in the long-term.
We continue to have a big opportunity to grow the business universe, and the actual opportunity there may be bigger in terms of penetration opportunity than there actually is in the video business and in the residential voice business, because almost all businesses, I think, will continue to have a wireline voice product for the foreseeable future.
So there is still a tremendous opportunity in the small business marketplace. There’s still a big opportunity where Lightpath competes to grow those businesses. There is a big opportunity to grow the advertising business going forward and to take more share out of the market. I think you continue to see a shift out of traditional media. Television continues to work quite well and continues to attract dollars, and the interactive platform we’ve built, I think, can allow us to not only maintain our share of that business, but to shift the share in the future.
And I still think, in the long run, the residential business is an opportunity for us, with our superior products, to continue to grow penetration. We are at very high penetrations in our marketplace. There is very little housing growth going on right now, and there is actually a high vacancy rate. All of that hurts the residential business at the moment, but for the long run, I expect that we will have a more normal economy in the future, and that residential growth will take advantage of that.

Ultimately, it’s a question of creating value for your customers. That sometimes gives you pricing power on your overall mix, and sometimes there are opportunities to sell your way into the marketplace with new products that drive incremental ARPU on each transaction. And we choose different methodologies to drive value in.
But the point I was trying to make earlier in my presentation was that sequentially our RPS is growing pretty nicely. And that’s as a result of selling in a transactional product at a high penetration rate.
On the other hand, Wi-Fi we don’t charge for. And the reason we don’t is we think we need to build value over time by creating utilization of that product. It’s not a product that has an immediate economic observable value to a customer until they utilize the product. So as that becomes more utilized, it gives us pricing power on our overall subscriber relationship.
So we think there is a way to monetize network DVR, and not only an opportunity for monetization, because it offers new services and new functionality that aren’t offered by traditional DVR. But it’s in a less-expensive capital projects, as well, on a per-subscriber basis, which either gives us the opportunity to charge the same rates as our competitors and have lower cost, and in terms of product differentiation, you can argue it gives us a higher revenue per subscriber opportunity, as well.
So depends upon the product, how it gets rolled out and how it’s perceived in the mind of a consumer when it’s initially launched.

I think that as everybody on this call knows, we’ve been associated with every potential acquisition in the cable industry over the last nine months. I’ve seen research reports that have us buying three or four different targets.
And I think the reality is very much what we stated from the time that we made the Bresnan acquisition. We start with an operating plan, we determine what we think that we can do with the asset, we look at the returns from those type of acquisitions and we compare them to opportunities such as repurchasing our own stock. And I think, again, Bresnan for us was a almost unique situation. It had a combination of operating attributes and financial attributes which made it especially attractive.
And we will continue actively to look at acquisition opportunities going forward, but I don’t see anything on the immediate horizon in that regard. And I’d also point out that given the disruption in the markets at this point in time, it would be very difficult to go out and ring-fence a transaction today and use non-recourse debt to do it. The high-yield markets locked up quite a bit over the last few months.
And part of the issue with the auction process, as we see it, is that we’re often times asked to make a financial commitment, as in the case of Bresnan, six months before actually doing the financing. And I think in today’s market, there is a tremendous amount of market risk that any flex terms on any type of a commitment from our friends in the banking community would be dramatically wider. And so I think that the ability to finance on a ring-fence basis at this point in time is quite reduced.
So we’ll see where the acquisition market goes, but at this point in time, as both Jim and Tom have pointed out, we are focused on our core operations and Bresnan.

I’m not sure that from an accounting standpoint, KPMG would bless me saying it’s one-time, but we know we are not going paying it going forward, as we are now provisioning our own calls out of there.
So that was something that depressed the margins more than we anticipated, that’s going away. And we expect the margins to broaden out to the type of numbers that we were looking at moving forward. And we expect, as I’ve mentioned in my remarks, for the leverage of Bresnan to come down.

Our product, which I said earlier has 75% share, has been consistently recognized by J.D. Power and PC Magazine from a consumer perspective as the best product, data product in the country. And it still is, notwithstanding the way that the FCC measured the product.
And while the FCC test is accurate, at some level, it doesn’t - it’s misinterpreted in terms of its implications to customers. One thing about it is that it’s a reference to advertised speed at peak times. So a DSL service at 750 kilobits that is operating at 750 kilobits looks better on that chart than our service.
And as I said earlier, 50% of our new triple play customers are selling into our DOCSIS 3 platform 50-megabit service. We continue to drive the data business. We continue to drive data ARPU in the business. And we continue to have a superior product to our competitors in the data business in the actual utilization and perception of the customer.
In terms of fending off Verizon or anyone else for that matter - there’s still more satellite customers in our footprint than there are Verizon, by the way. And that number’s steadily coming down. We think we can take it down faster with additional offer and selling strategies.
And we don’t have anything new or unusual to announce, other than that we did announce today that we have launched the iPad app on iTouches and iPhones, which will bring to about 1 million people - 1 million homes in our marketplace - the functionality of being able to watch live TV in the home on these devices. And also to act as a new remote control device on every TV in the house.
What’s even more interesting, to operate as a new navigation device, to have a real easy way to see what’s on, and to go through - use search engines, go through lots of information, and pick the kind of content that you want to watch. That makes our VOD product more competitive with over-the-top providers like Netflix. It makes us more competitive with any of the over-the-top providers. Makes us superior to all of our wireline and satellite competitors.
So we’ve got new products, we’ve got ways to sell them, and we’re going to compete aggressively.

And we see our converter strategy using downloadable security, our network DVR strategy, and our ability to serve IP devices without converters at all as a continuation of a network architecture that we’ve been designing for a long time that allows us to serve more and more customers with less and less capital.

For the second quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 9% to $1.69 billion and AOCF increased 2.3% to $574 million. These results reflect the addition of Bresnan, as well as a onetime favorable programming cost adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. Without these items, revenue growth would have been 1.5% and AOCF growth would have been essentially flat for the quarter. These results also exclude AMC Networks, which was successfully spun off in June. 
For the first six months of 2011, Cablevision generated $354 million of free cash flow, a 31% increase over the prior year on a pro forma basis. Even without the contribution from Bresnan, free cash flow would have increased by 21%. The company repurchased more than 4 million shares in the second quarter. In addition, the Board of Directors has once again approved a $0.15 per share dividend payable in September. With the successful completion of our second spinoff in 2 years, I'm optimistic about what lies ahead for the new Cablevision. 
While weakened economy and the competitive pressures impacted our subscriber metrics this quarter, I'm confident that our superior architecture and network combined with our new product innovations will ensure that we continue to deliver better products and greater value for our customers. We have always been focused on a strategy that includes capitalizing on our investments in our cable business and exceeding our customer's expectations on every level. And as Cablevision's CEO, I can assure you that the focus has never been stronger than it is now. 
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."
25933,138912616,155638,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Thanks, Jim. Telecommunications revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 9.8% over the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bresnan properties, total revenue growth was 1.7% year-over-year. In th",994,"Good morning. Thanks, Jim. Telecommunications revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 9.8% over the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bresnan properties, total revenue growth was 1.7% year-over-year. 
In the second quarter, our total company results included an increase of 5,000 high-speed data customers, 27,000 new voice lines and a video loss of 23,000. In the Eastern Cablevision operations, average revenue per sub, or RPS, was $154.86, up 1.7% sequentially, and up 3.8% over the prior year period. Our rate increase at the end of last year was smaller than normal due to the earlier retransmission issue, yet RPS has grown steadily. And we're exceeding the marketplace with a higher price package to our new ultimate Triple Play priced $10 higher than our standard Triple Play. Introduced in May, the Ultimate Triple Play already represents over 50% of our new acquisition Triple Play customers. These customers are voluntarily agreeing to higher rates in response to the enhanced services offered in the Ultimate Triple Play package. 
In the Eastern Cablevision footprint, our telco competition remains active and the economy has seen little improvement. While the second quarter is traditionally a stronger growth quarter for us, these 2 factors made our growth more challenging. And this trend has continued into the third quarter.
However, our Optimum Business service is growing steadily. Optimum Lightpath revenue was $77 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 9% versus the prior year period. Lightpath now provides service to over 4,700 buildings, an increase of 17% over the prior year.  
Second quarter AOCF for Telecommunications segment was $625 million, representing an increase of 1.8% over the prior year. In last year's second quarter for the Cable company, there was a non-recurring favorable adjustment of $23 million. Excluding that impact as well as the Bresnan impact, AOCF would've been flat year-over-year. 
Operating expenses at Cable remained in check in the quarter, increasing only 2.8% on a pro forma basis. Optimum Lightpath AOCF grew by 17% in the quarter to $32.7 million. Margins continue to rise at Lightpath and in the second quarter, Lightpath AOCF margin was 42.4%. 
Bresnan properties, now branded Optimum, have been under our ownership for about 6 months. Already, these properties have a Triple Play sell-in rate of roughly 50% compared with 20% at the time of our acquisition. 
Total Cable advertising revenue increased 22% over the prior year period, without the inclusion of the Bresnan properties was up 13% on a same-store basis. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ad sales growth. While traditional ad sales are strong, we are complementing this revenue through our -- the use of our advanced advertising product. 
As an example, Optimum Select, which is available across the entire core footprint launched the new RFI product in the second quarter where advertisers can now fulfill customer requests for coupons, brochures, et cetera, through e-mail response. E-mail is attractive not only to our customers, but it's very important to advertisers who can save on postage and shipping costs and yet still reach their customers on a timely basis. We've now implemented hundreds of RFI campaigns for various advertisers, which generate more highly qualified leads. Additionally, we'd run a large volume of 30-second telescoped ads that lead to advertiser long-form content in 10 to 20 minutes of engagement by our subscribers. Each of these are examples of how we continue to enhance our advanced advertising offerings, which in turn drives incremental advertising revenue for us. 
Overall, in order to continue to drive growth and to compete aggressively, we're keenly focused on adding more and more value to the products and services our customers enjoy today. We're doing this through enhancement of existing products and services as well as through the addition of new and unique products. 
Most recently, we've rolled out Network DVR Plus in New York City and Connecticut and plan to launch it in Nassau County this fall and Suffolk County early next year. This is much more than a whole house DVR solution. Our service will eventually allow our customers to choose how much storage they would like and take advantage of multiple simultaneous playbacks. We've launched the iPad app, where customers can view essentially all of our channels within streamline navigation on an iPad. Earlier today, we've launched the same application for iPhones and iPod Touches and at the same time, added remote control capability for all these devices on all TVs in the home. We're currently trialing in front of 50,000 customers, our enhanced set-top user interface, which includes more sophisticated search products. One of which is Movie Explorer, our own recommendation engine, allowing us to dramatically increase the number of movie titles we can offer on Video-on-Demand. We've increased WiFi speeds to 50 megabits downstream and 4 megabits upstream. And we've introduced, as I said earlier, the Ultimate Triple Play, which includes a new faster, higher-speeds service plus and a wireless router. And coming soon, we're planning to introduce the same functionality, which we have deployed on the iPad and the other Apple products, on Android smartphones and tablets as well as PCs and Macs. All of these devices will be serviced by our integrated whole house products leaving us the clear competitive leader in the local telecommunications marketplace. 
As a result of these ongoing new product efforts, Cable capital spending in the quarter increased appreciably from the previous quarter as we invested in Boost Plus, iPad app development and RS-DVR. Total Cable capital for the quarter was $175 million or 11.6% of Cable revenue. On a year-to-date basis, total Cable capital spending was $282 million or 9.4% of revenue. If you look at the Eastern Cablevision operations on a standalone basis, capital efficiency for the first half of 2011 was 9.0% compared with the prior year period, capital efficiency of 10.8%. 
I'd now like to turn this call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial preview."
25933,138912616,155638,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom.

As I'm sure you're all aware, we successfully completed the spinoff of AMC Networks on June 30. On the date of the distribution, we effectively provided our shareholders with a $9 per share tax-free dividend. I think we've demonstrated that providing strong shareholder returns is fundamental to the company's strategy. 
Now that we've completed the spend, I thought I'd take a moment and mention that the results of AMC Networks, including costs associated with the spends as legal and professional fees are now reported as discontinued operations. Also reflected in discontinued operations are the management fees, which have previously been charged by Cablevision to AMC Networks. I should caution that AMC Networks' results of operations, when reported on a standalone basis, will differ from the results presented in the Cablevision earnings release and 10-Q due to certain reclassifications and adjustments made for the purposes of discontinued operations reporting. 
Turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $357 million. Net debt was $9.9 billion and on June 30, we have $1.35 billion undrawn under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. The drawn portion is primarily backstops for letters of credit. 
As of June 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.4x and the CSC Holdings Restricted Group leverage was 3.1x. In April, CSC Holdings repaid in full its maturing $326 million, 7 5/8% senior notes and with revolver borrowings and cash on hand. And as a reminder, we utilized our revolver to execute our share repurchases in the first half of this year. As a result of the spin off and refinancing of AMC Networks, AMC distributed to Cablevision $1.25 billion, all of which was used to pay down borrowings under the CSC Holdings of revolver. 
At June 30, Bresnan net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage for the quarter was 7.2x. There were a number of expenses incurred in the first half, including the wind down of our contract with a third-party voice provisioning company, the ramp up of our sales and marketing efforts and the Optimum rebranding, which impacted AOCF. We expect the Bresnan operating margins and leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters and remain excited about Bresnan's prospects. 
Turning to Cablevision share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of Cablevision stock, totaling $143.9 million. From inception of the program through the end of June, we have repurchased 21.7 million shares totaling $695 million. We have $305 million of repurchase authorization available under our existing program and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchases. Since the beginning of the repurchase program in June of 2010, our total outstanding class A shares have decreased from $251 million to $231 million shrinking the total class A share base by approximately 8%. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million and compares with the pro forma first quarter free cash flow of $232 million. This quarterly variance was driven largely by increased capital spending of $83 million in the quarter as we invested in new product initiatives. Free cash flow per share for the first 6 months of 2011 was $1.23, a 38% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow of 89% -- $0.89 per share in the prior year period. 
I also want to take an opportunity to update our investors on our NOL position. At June 30, the NOL at Cablevision was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter amount of $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting the amount of the NOL that went with AMC in the spin off. We've taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012. And this has given us about 14 or 15 months of additional NOL cover. We currently estimate that we will not fully use the NOL until sometime in 2013. Finally, diluted earnings per share was $0.31 for the quarter, up from $0.20 in the prior year period. Excluding income from discontinued operations, EPS was $0.24 in the second quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year period.

But I'm still very optimistic about the business itself and its growth prospects in the long term. We continue to have a big opportunity to grow the business universe. And the actual opportunity there may be bigger in terms of penetration opportunity than there actually is in the video business and in the residential voice business because almost all businesses I think will continue to have a wireline voice product for the foreseeable future. So there's still a tremendous opportunity in the Small Business marketplace. There's still a big opportunity where Lightpath competes to grow those businesses. There's a big opportunity to grow the advertising business going forward. And to take more share out of the market, I think you continue to see a shift out of traditional media. Television continues to work quite well and continues to attract dollars. And the interactive platform we've built, I think can allow us to actually not just maintain our share of that business but to shift the share in the future. And I still think in the long run, the residential business is an opportunity for us with our superior products, continue to grow penetration. We are at very high penetrations in our marketplace. There's very little housing growth going on right now and there's actually a high vacancy rate. All of that hurts the residential business at the moment. But for the long run, I expect that we will have a more normal economy in the future and that residential growth will take advantage of that."

Ultimately, it's a question of creating value for your customers that sometimes gives you pricing power on your overall mix. And sometimes there are opportunities to sell your way into the marketplace with new products that drive incremental ARPU on each transaction. And we choose different methodologies to drive value in. But the point I was trying to make earlier in my presentation was that sequentially, our RPS is  growing pretty nicely. And that's as a result of selling in a transactional product at a high penetration rate. On the other hand, WiFi, we don't charge for. And the reason we don't is we think we need to build value over time by creating utilization of that product. It's not a product that has immediate economic observable value to a customer until they utilize the product. So as that becomes more utilized because there's pricing power on our overall subscriber relationship. So we think there is a way to monetize Network DVR and not only an opportunity for monetization because it offers new services and new functionality that aren't offered by traditional DVR. But it's a less expensive capital project as well on a per subscriber basis, which either gives us the opportunity to charge the same rates as our competitors and have lower costs. And in terms of product differentiation, you can argue it gives us a higher revenue per subscriber opportunity as well. So depends on the product, how it gets rolled out and how it's perceived in the mind of a consumer when it's initially launched."

I think that as everybody on this call knows, we've been associated with every potential acquisition in the cable industry over the last 9 months. So I've seen the research reports that have us buying 3 or 4 different targets. And I think the reality is very much what we've stated from the time that we made the Bresnan acquisition. We start with an operating plan. We determine what we think that we can do with the asset. We look at the returns from those type of acquisitions and we compare them to opportunities such as repurchasing our own stock. And I think again, Bresnan for us was a almost unique situation. It have a combination of operating attributes and financial attributes, which made it especially attractive. And we will continue, I believe, to look at acquisition opportunities going forward but I don't see anything on the immediate horizon in that regard. And I'd also point out that given the disruption in the markets at this point in time, it would be very difficult to allow a ring fence transaction today and use non-recourse debt to do it. The high-yield markets locked up quite a bit over the last few months. And part of the issue with the auction process as we see it is that we're oftentimes asked to make a financial commitment. As in the case of Bresnan, 6 months before actually doing the financing. And I think in today's market, there's a tremendous amount of market risk, the flex terms on any type of a commitment from our friends in the banking community would be dramatically wider. And so I think that the ability to finance on a ring fence basis at this point in time is quite reduced. So we'll see where the acquisition market goes. But at this point in time as both Jim and Tom have pointed out, we're focused on our core operations and Bresnan."

In terms of fending off Verizon or anyone else for that matter, there's still more satellite customers in our footprint than are in Verizon, by the way, and that number is steadily coming down. We think we can take it down faster with additional offer and selling strategies. And we don't have anything new or unusual to announce other than that we did announce today that we've launched the iPad app on iTouches and iPhones, which will bring to about a million people, a million homes in our marketplace the functionality of being able to watch live TV in the home on these devices. And also to act as a new remote control device on every TV in the house, even more interesting to operate as a new navigation device to have a real easy way to see what's on and to go through -- use search engines to go through lots of information and pick the kind of content that you want to watch that makes our VOD product more competitive with over-the-top providers like Netflix. It makes us more competitive with any of the over-the-top providers and it makes us superior to all of our wireline and satellite competitors. So we've got new products, we've got ways to sell them and we're going to compete aggressively."

And we see our converter strategy using downloadable security, our network DVR strategy and our ability to serve IP devices without converters at all as a continuation of a network architecture that we've been designing for a long time that allows us to serve more and more customers with less and less capital.

For the third quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 8% to $1.67 billion while AOCF was essentially flat at $539 million when compared to the prior-year period. These results were impacted by Hurricane Irene, as well as the addition of the Bresnan properties. Without these 2 items, revenue growth would've been essentially flat and AOCF would've decreased 4% for the quarter. 
Cablevision generated $440 million in free cash flow from continuing operations over the last 9 months, a 5% improvement over 2010. In addition, the company repurchased more than 5 million shares in the third quarter and the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share payable in December. 
The impact of Hurricane Irene resulted in an extended loss of electricity in a significant part of our footprint in the New York metropolitan area. Cablevision met this challenge well responding to customers' needs and restoring service quickly. Tom is going to talk in more detail about the business and also highlight some positive underlying trends in our performance. These include certain improved subscriber metrics during a quarter that was historically seasonally weak in Cablevision and continued growth at Optimum Lightpath. 
Not all of our results from the quarter in the quarter our where we want them. By many measures, we have built the most successful Cable Television company in the nation and set nearly every industry benchmark for sales, customer retention, penetration and financial performance. Continuing to build upon this historical performance has become more challenging in a highly competitive environment, which is compounded by economic pressures, including a significant decline in housing activity. However, we are addressing the challenge and in many ways have been preparing for it for several years. We have taken pioneering steps to develop products and enhance our services for our customers without straining their wallets. We have sought and identified new markets that offer attractive growth opportunities to which we allocate a portion of our investable capital. Both Optimum Business and Bresnan exemplify this. And as importantly, we have aggressively addressed the financial and capital structure of Cablevision to optimize long-term shareholder returns through the refinancing of our balance sheet, the spin off of MSG and AMC and the allocation of our investable capital to our quarterly dividend, our stock buyback plan and highly strategic acquisitions.
That said, our primary focus is the continued improvement of our product offerings, the quality of our services and the provision of the most attractive price value proposition in the market for our customers.
Historically, Cablevision has confronted challenges in a constantly involving business over multiple business cycles. We are highly confident that the same spirit of service, innovation and execution will guide us as we move forward. 
We'll now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

For the third quarter, Telecom revenue grew by 9% versus the prior year quarter and AOCF was essentially flat. We suffered hurricane damage in the third quarter, which cost us $16 million.

We suffered hurricane damage in the third quarter, which cost us $16 million. Excluding both the impact of Bresnan and the hurricane, Telecom AOCF declined by 3.9% in the third quarter over the prior year. In addition to lack of housing growth, there are several other factors that have impacted the quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for the fiscal year. We had an unusual fourth quarter stoploss last year due to a programming dispute which led us to take a smaller rate increase in the plan to stabilize the customer base over the long term. And Verizon unilaterally reduced voice interconnection fees which were in the revenue line and which we are litigating. 
While the third quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter, we were aided by the launch of new services on the iPod Touch and iPhone, which were integrated into our promotions. In addition, one of our competitors had a strike which hurt their performance. Basic video, data and voice lines all had net changes which were an improvement not only of last year's third quarter, but also the second quarter of this year. 
High-speed data subs increased by 17,000 in the quarter and our voice lines grew by 38,000. Video customers declined by 19,000 in the quarter for the total company. These improvements were accomplished largely by continuing the strategies which we've been successful with in the past. We've introduced the new Triple Play package highlighted by a faster high-speed data service, Boost Plus. And we've marketed heavily throughout our operating areas to reinforce the value of our products and services. And our aggressive win back strategy continues. As of September 30, our win back total is more than 45% of customers who once tried FiOS. 
In the Bresnan properties, we saw growth in data and voice customers in the quarter and a slight decline in video subs. Digital penetration is rising as we deploy new and better digital services at the end of the third quarter, 75% of Bresnan's basics of drivers were digital. We're on track to complete a fiber ring which will interconnect roughly 85% of the Bresnan customer base by the end of this year. Once completed, we'll be able to essentially manage these geographically diverse systems as 1, which will allow us to sell a state-of-the-art Triple Play product across our footprint. 
Now let me address some of the new products and offers available in the metro Cablevision footprint. We've recently introduced an offer that includes the new iPod Touch primarily for win back situations. Selling for the Triple Play package of video, data and voice is now at 74% and roughly half of this sell-in is for our new Ultimate Triple Play which includes a new higher-priced Boost Plus servers and a wireless router. We've recently announced an agreement with Turner Networks for all of their Turner To Go content. In a month's time more than 100,000 customers have registered for this free service. 
Our customers responded extremely well to our iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone apps. We currently have 560,000 unique Apple devices using the Optimum app. And we continue to enhance our international programming with19 new international premium channels launched this year will bring the total number of international premiums to 86.
Cable capital spending for the quarter was $195 million, including the Bresnan properties. While CPE capital continues to decline, our investments in new products and services have been steady. For the quarter, capital as a percent of revenue was 13.1% and year-to-date, capital intensity was 10.7%. 
At Optimum Lifepath, business continues to ramp up with revenue growth of 6% and AOCF growth of 17% for the third quarter versus the prior-year period. At Lightpath, the stories have been consistent with the continued pursuit of market share at its core. As an example, we've made great progress in the school sector. In the past year, Lightpath has increased share in the New Jersey Public School District by 26%. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial overview."

Now let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $1.67 billion in the third quarter represented an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, almost all of which was due to the addition of Bresnan in this year's results. Total company AOCF of $539 million represented essentially flat growth compared with the prior-year period. And if you remove the impact of Bresnan properties and Hurricane Irene, AOCF would've actually decreased by 4%. 
We had a few significant items in the quarter affecting our results, including higher programming costs and higher sales and marketing as we continue to aggressively promote our products and services, while revenue growth was essentially flat. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 9 months ended September 30 was $440 million. And that compares with 2010 year-to-date free cash flow of $418 million, an increase of 5%. 
Free cash flow from the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.53 a share, an 11% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow per share of $1.38 in the prior-year period.
Now turning to leverage and liquidity, at the end of the third quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $180 million. Net debt was $10 billion. At September 30, we had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. 
In calculating our total comp deleverage per indentures, annualized the determined using a method that's called the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for items such as the $16 million impact of Hurricane Irene, thus the hurricane impact translates into a $64 million reduction and AOCF for the purpose of our debt test. As a result, at September 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.7x. Without the impact of the hurricane, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage.  The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage was 3.2x. At September 30, President's net debt was approximately $1 billion with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 7x, down from the second quarter ratio of 7.2x. We expect the Bresnan leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters as we reach a more steady state of operations and marketing.
The Cablevision NOL was $1.6 billion at September 30. We have taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011 and intend to do so again in 2012, which extends the timing for our NOL utilization.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares, totaling $93.9 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding shares. From the inception of the program through the end of September, we've repurchased 27.1 million shares, and our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from 251 million to 225 million or roughly 10%. At September 30, we had $211 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.

As I mentioned in my commentary, certainly, we had higher programming costs and I can't get in obviously into detail of the individual contracts with you can imagine which ones are flowing through this year. As a result of various retransmission, consent processes or negotiations. We had some increases in network management costs, increases in sales and telemarketing cost and increases in our overall product marketing costs.

But over the long-term, I think the business still has a lot of growth in it. and in the areas where we thought there would be growth, there is continued opportunity to sell a Triple Play package to residential customers who don't buy today. There's still a considerable amount of satellite penetration in our footprint which we think is an inferior product at its core. And ultimately, gives us a path to additional residential growth. The business opportunity for continued penetration of telecommunication services in the business environment continues. Even that area is challenged, although it is growing rapidly in terms of share, you still have a lot of pressure in the business universe in terms of growth there as well because of the cyclical situation. And you have the opportunity to continue to shift advertising share on to the cable platform and interactive platform. So I think all of this growth drivers still exist in the business and you have a situation currently where you have a pretty slow housing growth -- virtually no housing growth, and actual reduction in household formation. People are moving in with each other. So it's a cyclically challenging time. But the ultimate drivers I think is still in the business."

One of the reasons I pointed out in my comments that we've retired 2% of the outstanding shares this quarter is that if you go back and look at the history year over a 5 quarter period, we've retired roughly 10% of our Class A share. So the way I've been looking at the program, and I think we've been thinking about it, has been trying to just over time, make a significant reduction in the number of outstanding shares. And so I don't it's all so hard to look at last quarter or any particular quarter, and declare it be more or less than prior quarters because while the absolute dollars changed a lot, there have been the AMC spend is taking place. And so the dollars that we had to allocate to repurchase in the past reflected the AMC, AOCF also. The constraint that we face right now is our leverage. We're approximately 4.5x after backing out the impact of Hurricane Irene. And even though that number is in the upper end of our normal target range, we're comfortable at that leverage level. We have $200 million remaining of repurchase authorization from our board, and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in looking at repurchases. But one thing that we're not at this point in time prepared to do, is to ramp up our leverage to buy back additional stock. We are at the upper end of that range, and I think we've been pretty consistent about wanting to stay in that type of a leverage range. Oh, on the swap side, yes, we have a substantial portion of our interest rate swaps coming off around June 30 of next year. The impact of that is roughly $50 million a year at current interest rates. We haven't made any determination at this point in time how much of that we're going to continue to allow to flow if any or have maybe we made any decision that we're going to go out and reswap. We continuously look at our capital structure. We've been very focused on extending maturities. And as we get closer to the swaps coming off, we'll certainly make decisions as to where we want to be."

For the third quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 8% to $1.67 billion while AOCF was essentially flat at $539 million when compared to the prior-year period.

For the third quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 8% to $1.67 billion while AOCF was essentially flat at $539 million when compared to the prior-year period. These results were impacted by Hurricane Irene, as well as the addition of the Bresnan properties. Without these 2 items, revenue growth would've been essentially flat and AOCF would've decreased 4% for the quarter. Cablevision generated $440 million in free cash flow from continuing operations over the last 9 months, a 5% improvement over 2010. In addition, the company repurchased more than 5 million shares in the third quarter, and the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable in December.
The impact of Hurricane Irene resulted in an extended loss of electricity in a significant part of our footprint in the New York metropolitan area. Cablevision met this challenge well, responding to customers' needs and restoring service quickly. Tom is going to talk, in more detail, about the business and also highlight some positive underlying trends in our performance. These include certain improved subscriber metrics, during a quarter that has historically been seasonally weak for Cablevision, and continued growth at Optimum Lightpath. Not all of our results in the quarter are where we want them. By many measures, we have built the most successful Cable Television company in the nation, and have set nearly every industry benchmark for sales, customer retention, penetration, and financial performance. Continuing to build upon this historical performance has become more challenging in a highly competitive environment which is compounded by economic pressures, including a significant decline in housing activity. However, we are addressing the challenge and, in many ways, have been preparing for it for several years. We have taken pioneering steps to develop products and enhance our services for our customers without straining their wallets. We have sought and identified new markets that offer attractive growth opportunities to which we allocate a portion of our investable capital. Both Optimum Business and Bresnan exemplify this. And, as importantly, we have aggressively addressed the financial and capital structure of Cablevision to optimize long-term shareholder returns through the refinancing of our balance sheet, the spin off of MSG and AMC, and the allocation of our investable capital to our quarterly dividend, our stock buyback plan, and highly strategic acquisitions. That said, our primary focus is the continued improvement of our product offerings, the quality of our services, and the provision of the most attractive price value proposition in the market for our customers.  Historically, Cablevision has confronted challenges in a constantly involving business over multiple business cycles. We are highly confident that the same spirit of service, innovation, and execution will guide us as we move forward. 
We'll now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

For the third quarter, Telecom revenue grew by 9% versus the prior year quarter, and AOCF was essentially flat. We suffered hurricane damage in the third quarter, which cost us $16 million.

We suffered hurricane damage in the third quarter, which cost us $16 million. Excluding both the impact of Bresnan and the hurricane, Telecom AOCF declined by 3.9% in the third quarter over the prior year.
In addition to lack of housing growth, there are several other factors that have impacted the quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for the fiscal year. We had an unusual fourth quarter sub loss last year due to a programming dispute, which led us to take a smaller rate increase in plan to stabilize the customer base over the long term. And Verizon unilaterally reduced voice interconnection fees, which were in the revenue line, and which we are litigating. While our third quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter, we were aided by the launch of new services on the iPod Touch and iPhone, which were integrated into our promotions. In addition, one of our competitors had a strike which hurt their performance. Basic video, data, and voice lines all had net changes, which were an improvement not only of last year's third quarter but also the second quarter this year.
High-speed data subs increased by 17,000 in the quarter and our voice lines grew by 38,000. Video customers declined by 19,000 in the quarter for the total company. These improvements were accomplished largely by continuing the strategies which we've been successful with in the past. We've introduced the new Triple Play package, highlighted by a faster high-speed data service, Boost Plus, and we've marketed heavily throughout our operating areas to reinforce the value of our products and services. And our aggressive win-back strategy continues. As of September 30, our win-back total is more than 45% of customers who once tried FiOS. In the Bresnan properties, we saw growth in data and voice customers in the quarter and a slight decline in video subs. Digital penetration is rising as we deploy new and better digital services, and at the end of the third quarter, 75% of Bresnan's basics of drivers were digital. We're on track to complete a fiber ring which will interconnect roughly 85% of the Bresnan customer base by the end of this year. Once completed, we'll be able to essentially manage these geographically diverse systems as one, which will allow us to sell a state-of-the-art Triple Play product across our footprint.
Now let me address some of the new products and offers available in the metro Cablevision footprint. We've recently introduced an offer that includes a new iPod Touch, primarily for win-back situations. Sell-in for the Triple Play package of video, data, and voice is now at 74%, and roughly half of this sell-in is for our new Ultimate Triple Play, which includes a new higher-priced Boost Plus service and a wireless router. We've recently announced an agreement with Turner Networks for all of their Turner to-go content. In a month's time, more than 100,000 customers have registered for this free service. Our customers responded extremely well to our iPad, iPod Touch, and iPhone apps. We currently have 560,000 unique Apple devices using the Optimum app. And we continue to enhance our international programming with 19 new international premium channels launched this year, bringing the total number of international premiums to 86.
Cable capital spending for the quarter was $195 million, including the Bresnan properties. While CPE capital continues to decline, our investments in new products and services have been steady. For the quarter, capital as a percent of revenue was 13.1%. And year-to-date, capital expenditure [ph] was 10.7%. At Optimum Lifepath, business continues to ramp up, with revenue growth of 6% and AOCF growth of 17% for the third quarter versus the prior-year period. At Lightpath, the story has been consistent with the continued pursuit of market share at its core. As an example, we've made great progress in the school sector. In the past year, Lightpath has increased share in the New Jersey Public School District by 26%. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial overview."
25933,142262173,180993,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $1.67 billion in the third quarter represent an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, almost all of which was due to the addition of Bresnan in this yea",513,"Thank you, Tom. Let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $1.67 billion in the third quarter represent an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, almost all of which was due to the addition of Bresnan in this year's results. Total company AOCF of $539 million represented essentially flat growth compared with the prior-year period. And if you remove the impact of Bresnan properties and Hurricane Irene, AOCF would've actually decreased by 4%. We had a few significant items in the quarter affecting our results, including higher programming costs, and higher sales and marketing, as we continue to aggressively promote our products and services, while revenue growth was essentially flat. 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 9 months ended September 30 was $440 million. And that compares with 2010 year-to-date free cash flow of $418 million, an increase of 5%. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.53 a share, an 11% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow per share of $1.38 in the prior-year period.
Now turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $180 million. Net debt was $10 billion. At September 30, we had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. In calculating our total company leverage, per our indentures, annual AOCF is determined using a method that's called, the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for items such as the $16 million impact of Hurricane Irene, thus, the hurricane impact translates into a $64 million reduction in AOCF for the purpose of our debt tests. As a result, at September 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.7x. Without the impact of the hurricane, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage.  The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage was 3.2x. At September 30, Bresnan's net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 7x, down from the second quarter ratio of 7.2x. We expect the Bresnan leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters as we reach a more steady state of operations and marketing. The Cablevision NOL was $1.6 billion at September 30. We've taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012, which extends the timing for our NOL utilization.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares, totaling $93.9 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding shares. From the inception of the program, through the end of September, we've repurchased 27.1 million shares, and our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from 251 million to 225 million or roughly 10%. At September 30, we had $211 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

And in terms of Cablevision, I don't recall any sort of onetime startup costs or other issues that went away this quarter. As I mentioned in my commentary, certainly, we had higher programming cost. I can't get in, obviously, to the detail on the individual contracts but you can imagine which ones are flowing through this year, as a result of various retransmission, consent processes or negotiations. We had some increases in network management costs, increases in sales and telemarketing cost, and increases in our overall product marketing costs.

There's still a considerable amount of satellite penetration in our footprint, which we think is an inferior product at its core. And ultimately, gives us a path to additional residential growth. The business opportunity for continued penetration of telecommunication services in the business environment continues. Even that area is challenged, although growing rapidly in terms of share, you still have a lot of pressure in the business universe, in terms of growth there as well, because of the cyclical situation. And you have the opportunity to continue to shift advertising share on to the cable platform -- through the interactive platform. So I think all of those growth drivers still exist in the business and you have a situation, currently, where you have a pretty slow housing growth -- virtually no housing growth -- and actual reduction in household formation.

One of the reasons I pointed out, in my comments, that we've retired 2% of the outstanding shares this quarter is that if you go back and look at the history here, over a 5-quarter period, we've retired roughly 10% of our Class A share. So the way I've been looking at the program, and I think we've been thinking about it, has been trying to just, over time, make a significant reduction in the number of outstanding shares. And so I don't -- it's also hard to look at last quarter, or any particular quarter, and declare it be more or less than prior quarters. Because while the absolute dollars change a lot, there have been -- the AMC spend is taking place -- and so the dollars that we had to allocate to repurchase, in the past, reflected the AMC, AOCF also. The constraint that we face right now is our leverage. We're approximately 4.5x after backing out the impact of Hurricane Irene. And even though that number is at the upper end of our normal target range, we're comfortable at that leverage level. We have $200 million remaining of repurchase authorization from our board, and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in looking at repurchases. But one thing that we're not, at this point in time, prepared to do is to ramp up our leverage to buy back additional stock. We are at the upper end of that range, and I think we've been pretty consistent about wanting to stay in that type of a leverage range. On the swap side, yes. Where we have a substantial portion of our interest rate swaps coming off around June 30 of next year. The impact of that is roughly $50 million a year at current interest rates. We haven't made any determination, at this point in time, how much of that we're going to continue to allow to flow, if any, or have made any decision that we're going to go out and re-swap.

For the third quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 8% to $1.67 billion while AOCF was essentially flat at $539 million when compared to the prior-year period. These results were impacted by Hurricane Irene, as",472,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning. For the third quarter, Cablevision's consolidated revenue grew 8% to $1.67 billion while AOCF was essentially flat at $539 million when compared to the prior-year period. These results were impacted by Hurricane Irene, as well as the addition of the Bresnan properties. Without these 2 items, revenue growth would've been essentially flat and AOCF would've decreased 4% for the quarter. Cablevision generated $440 million in free cash flow from continuing operations over the last 9 months, a 5% improvement over 2010. In addition, the company repurchased more than 5 million shares in the third quarter, and the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable in December.
The impact of Hurricane Irene resulted in an extended loss of electricity in a significant part of our footprint in the New York metropolitan area. Cablevision met this challenge well, responding to customers' needs and restoring service quickly. Tom is going to talk, in more detail, about the business and also highlight some positive underlying trends in our performance. These include certain improved subscriber metrics, during a quarter that has historically been seasonally weak for Cablevision, and continued growth at Optimum Lightpath. Not all of our results in the quarter are where we want them. By many measures, we have built the most successful cable television company in the nation, and have set nearly every industry benchmark for sales, customer retention, penetration, and financial performance. Continuing to build upon this historical performance has become more challenging in a highly competitive environment which is compounded by economic pressures, including a significant decline in housing activity. However, we are addressing the challenge and, in many ways, have been preparing for it for several years. We have taken pioneering steps to develop products and enhance our services for our customers without straining their wallets. We have sought and identified new markets that offer attractive growth opportunities to which we allocate a portion of our investable capital. Both Optimum Business and Bresnan exemplify this. And, as importantly, we have aggressively addressed the financial and capital structure of Cablevision to optimize long-term shareholder returns through the refinancing of our balance sheet, the spin-off of MSG and AMC, and the allocation of our investable capital to our quarterly dividend, our stock buyback plan, and highly strategic acquisitions. That said, our primary focus is the continued improvement of our product offerings, the quality of our services, and the provision of the most attractive price value proposition in the market for our customers. Historically, Cablevision has confronted challenges in a constantly involving business over multiple business cycles. We are highly confident that the same spirit of service, innovation, and execution will guide us as we move forward.
We'll now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

For the third quarter, Telecom revenue grew by 9% versus the prior year quarter, and AOCF was essentially flat. We suffered hurricane damage in the third quarter, which cost us $16 million.

We suffered hurricane damage in the third quarter, which cost us $16 million. Excluding both the impact of Bresnan and the hurricane, Telecom AOCF declined by 3.9% in the third quarter over the prior year.
In addition to lack of housing growth, there are several other factors that have impacted the quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for the fiscal year. We had an unusual fourth quarter sub loss last year due to a programming dispute, which led us to take a smaller rate increase in plan to stabilize the customer base over the long term. And Verizon unilaterally reduced voice interconnection fees, which were in the revenue line, and which we are litigating. While our third quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter, we were aided by the launch of new services on the iPod Touch and iPhone, which were integrated into our promotions. In addition, one of our competitors had a strike which hurt their performance. Basic video, data, and voice lines all had net changes, which were an improvement not only of last year's third quarter but also the second quarter this year.
High-speed data subs increased by 17,000 in the quarter and our voice lines grew by 38,000. Video customers declined by 19,000 in the quarter for the total company. These improvements were accomplished largely by continuing the strategies which we've been successful with in the past. We've introduced a new Triple Play package, highlighted by a faster high-speed data service, Boost Plus, and we've marketed heavily throughout our operating areas to reinforce the value of our products and services. And our aggressive win-back strategy continues. As of September 30, our win-back total is more than 45% of customers who once tried FiOS. In the Bresnan properties, we saw growth in data and voice customers in the quarter and a slight decline in video subs. Digital penetration is rising as we deploy new and better digital services, and at the end of the third quarter, 75% of Bresnan's basic subscribers were digital. We're on track to complete a fiber ring which will interconnect roughly 85% of the Bresnan customer base by the end of this year. Once completed, we'll be able to essentially manage these geographically diverse systems as one, which will allow us to sell a state-of-the-art Triple Play product across our footprint.
Now let me address some of the new products and offers available in the metro Cablevision footprint. We've recently introduced an offer that includes a new iPod Touch, primarily for win-back situations. Sell-in for the Triple Play package of video, data, and voice is now at 74%, and roughly half of this sell-in is for our new Ultimate Triple Play, which includes a new higher-priced Boost Plus service and a wireless router. We've recently announced an agreement with Turner Networks for all of their Turner to-go content. In a month's time, more than 100,000 customers have registered for this free service. Our customers responded extremely well to our iPad, iPod Touch, and iPhone apps. We currently have 560,000 unique Apple devices using the Optimum app. And we continue to enhance our international programming with 19 new international premium channels launched this year, bringing the total number of international premiums to 86.
Cable capital spending for the quarter was $195 million, including the Bresnan properties. While CPE capital continues to decline, our investments in new products and services have been steady. For the quarter, capital as a percent of revenue was 13.1%. And year-to-date, capital [indiscernible] was 10.7%. At Optimum Lightpath, business continues to ramp up, with revenue growth of 6% and AOCF growth of 17% for the third quarter versus the prior-year period. At Lightpath, the story has been consistent with the continued pursuit of market share at its core. As an example, we've made great progress in the school sector. In the past year, Lightpath has increased share in the New Jersey Public School District by 26%.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Seibert for a financial overview."
25933,142262173,181097,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $1.67 billion in the third quarter represent an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, almost all of which was due to the addition of Bresnan in this yea",514,"Thank you, Tom. Let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $1.67 billion in the third quarter represent an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, almost all of which was due to the addition of Bresnan in this year's results. Total company AOCF of $539 million represented essentially flat growth compared with the prior-year period. And if you remove the impact of the Bresnan properties and Hurricane Irene, AOCF would've actually decreased by 4%. We had a few significant items in the quarter affecting our results, including higher programming costs, and higher sales and marketing, as we continue to aggressively promote our products and services, while revenue growth was essentially flat.
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the 9 months ended September 30 was $440 million. And that compares with 2010 year-to-date free cash flow of $418 million, an increase of 5%. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.53 a share, an 11% increase compared with pro forma free cash flow per share of $1.38 in the prior-year period.
Now turning to leverage and liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $180 million. Net debt was $10 billion. At September 30, we had $1.35 billion undrawn and available under the $1.41 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings. In calculating our total company leverage, per our indentures, annual AOCF is determined using a method that's called, the latest quarter annualized. There are no exclusions for items such as the $16 million impact of Hurricane Irene, thus, the hurricane impact translates into a $64 million reduction in AOCF for the purpose of our debt tests. As a result, at September 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.7x. Without the impact of the hurricane, the consolidated ratio would have been approximately 4.5x, which we consider to be a more representative measure of our total company financial leverage. The CSC Holdings restricted group leverage was 3.2x.
At September 30, Bresnan's net debt was approximately $1 billion, with $75 million undrawn and available on its revolving credit facility. The leverage ratio for the quarter was 7x, down from the second quarter ratio of 7.2x. We expect the Bresnan leverage ratio to improve in upcoming quarters as we reach a more steady state of operations and marketing. The Cablevision NOL was $1.6 billion at September 30. We've taken advantage of the bonus depreciation provisions in 2010 and 2011, and intend to do so again in 2012, which extends the timing for our NOL utilization.
Turning to Cablevision's stock repurchase program. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares, totaling $93.9 million. This represents approximately 2% of the company's outstanding shares. From the inception of the program, through the end of September, we've repurchased 27.1 million shares, and our total outstanding Class A shares have decreased from 251 million to 225 million or roughly 10%. At September 30, we had $211 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.

I think what was discussed on the conference call was the termination of an interconnection agreement, at Bresnan, with a third party provider. And indeed, we did take that in-house this past quarter. Now that resulted in a margin improvement at Bresnan, where we picked up, let's call it roughly 2.7%, 2.8% in the Bresnan margin. And in terms of Cablevision, I don't recall any sort of onetime startup costs or other issues that went away this quarter. As I mentioned in my commentary, certainly, we had higher programming cost. I can't get in, obviously, to the detail on the individual contracts but you can imagine which ones are flowing through this year, as a result of various retransmission, consent processes or negotiations. And we had some increases in network management costs, increases in sales and telemarketing cost, and increases in our overall product marketing costs. That's what resulted in the compression of margins this quarter."

But over the long-term, I think the business still has a lot of growth in it. And in the areas where we thought there would be growth, there is continued opportunity to sell a Triple Play package to residential customers who don't buy it today. There's still a considerable amount of satellite penetration in our footprint, which we think is an inferior product at its core. And ultimately, gives us a path to additional residential growth. The business opportunity for continued penetration of telecommunication services in the business environment continues. Even that area is challenged, although growing rapidly in terms of share, you still have a lot of pressure in the business universe, in terms of growth there as well, because of the cyclical situation. And you have the opportunity to continue to shift advertising share on to the cable platform -- through the interactive platform. So I think all of those growth drivers still exist in the business and you have a situation, currently, where you have a pretty slow housing growth -- virtually no housing growth -- and actual reduction in household formation. People are moving in with each other. So it's a cyclically challenging time. But the ultimate drivers, I think, are still in the business."

One of the reasons I pointed out, in my comments, that we've retired 2% of the outstanding shares this quarter is that if you go back and look at the history here, over a 5-quarter period",383,"Let me take the easy question first, which is the share repurchase. One of the reasons I pointed out, in my comments, that we've retired 2% of the outstanding shares this quarter is that if you go back and look at the history here, over a 5-quarter period, we've retired roughly 10% of our Class A share. So the way I've been looking at the program, and I think we've been thinking about it, has been trying to just, over time, make a significant reduction in the number of outstanding shares. And so I don't -- it's also hard to look at last quarter, or any particular quarter, and declare it be more or less than prior quarters. Because while the absolute dollars change a lot, there have been -- the AMC spend is taking place and so the dollars that we had to allocate to repurchase, in the past, reflected the AMC, AOCF also. The constraint that we face right now is our leverage. We're approximately 4.5x after backing out the impact of Hurricane Irene. And even though that number is at the upper end of our normal target range, we're comfortable at that leverage level. We have $200 million remaining of repurchase authorization from our board, and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in looking at repurchases. But one thing that we're not, at this point in time, prepared to do, is to ramp up our leverage to buy back additional stock. We are at the upper end of that range, and I think we've been pretty consistent about wanting to stay in that type of a leverage range. On the swap side, yes. Where we have a substantial portion of our interest rate swaps coming off around June 30 of next year, the impact of that is roughly $50 million a year at current interest rates. We haven't made any determination, at this point in time, how much of that we're going to continue to allow to float, if any, or have we made any decision that we're going to go out and re-swap. We continuously look at our capital structure, we've been very focused on extending maturities. And as we get closer to the swaps coming off, we'll certainly make decisions as to where we want to be."
