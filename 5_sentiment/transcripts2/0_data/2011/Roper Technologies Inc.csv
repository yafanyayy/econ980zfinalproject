We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll l",3234,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll look at the individual segment details and the outlook for each one of those segments for 2011. I'll talk a little bit about sort of beyond the numbers, things that happened in 2010 that have been learnings for us during the downturn as we come out, and then establish our 2011 guidance and move to Q&A for you.
So next slide. For 2010, our enterprise financial results are just fundamentally in every category, an all-time record whether it's orders, sales, backlog, earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, anything one can think of. Our EBITDA margins for the year reached 26.7%, of course, another all-time high.
Our operating teams performed exceptionally well, and we enjoyed full year EBITDA leverage on the next dollar of incremental sales of 40%. We had a record asset loss, we will have more to talk about there. And for the first time, we ordered $500 million in operating cash flow for the calendar year.
Our free cash flow became 20% of sales. We look around it, capital market competitors for us, and many of the S&P 500 businesses don't enjoy 20% operating margin, a little 20% free cash flow to sales. Our free cash flow exceeded net income for the 13th consecutive year. We increased our dividend this year by 16% for 2011 after raising them last year, 15% for 2009.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the full year was 1.06. This has created a record backlog of $785 million, which is up $220 million from our year-end backlog last year, and I think one of the things that's amazing for us is that the excellence that we had really permeated throughout the enterprise with only to our three businesses not participating.
Next slide. Our full-year income statement, you can see here bookings reach  about $2.5 billion for the first-time. Our bookings were up 25% on the year. Our net sales were up 16%, 8% organic for the year but of course, it continued to move up throughout the year starting out the year with a minus 3% and then a plus 5%, and a plus 14% and closing out at a plus 15%. Our gross margin, again, spectacular 53.4% for the year, up 250 basis points over the prior year.
Our income from operations for the year was up 30% at $514 million, and I would like to remind people that we had about $86 million of non-cash and capital intangible amortization that depresses those income margin. So our operating profit margins reached 21.6% for the year. If you add back the non-cash tangible amortization, you're over 25%.
Our interest expense was up just modestly at $67 million, and the tax rate was slightly down this year at 28.1% versus 29.5% for the prior year. That left us with net earnings of $323 million, up from last year's $239 million, and full-year diluted earnings per share of $3.34 versus $2.58 last year.
Next slide. Our full-year operating cash flow as we said before was $500 million, that was up 36% from last year's $367 million, and our operating cash flow as a percent of sales, you can see it continues to trend up. It was 16% in '07, 19% in '08, dropped by a point to 18% in the great recession, and it's now back to 21% here in 2010, and our cash conversion, or on operating cash flow basis was 155% of net income.
Next slide. On a full-year free cash flow basis, the $500 million drops to $471 million, as we have about $29 million of CapEx. Our free cash flow as I said was 20% of revenue, up 300 basis points from last year. We had stellar execution, which you'll see our asset velocity numbers in just a minute. And you could see here, you've gone from 122% free cash flow in 2006 to 128%, and then 143%. I think, 2008 that was of course, a record for us. People expected with fallout in a downturn, and we did, we held the 143%. Now this year us to start back up, we're at 146%. So really, sustained cash flow performance conversion despite very difficult economic markets during that five-year period.
Next slide. On asset velocity, this is sort of a slight internal year because we focus so much on it, it takes our breath away. You look here at 12/31/10, and our inventory is down to 6.6% of revenue and receivables at 14.8%, payables and accruals at 16%. So when you add inventory in receivables and Subtract be able that accruals, which is our core measurement, we are at 5.4% of sales. if you go back to '07 and we were at a 10% of sales, and those of you who followed us a long time though, the numbers you could dramatically higher than that.
And when you think about 5.4%, the support your revenue and you've got 26.7% EBITDA and 20% free cash flow to sales on a 5.4% number, it truly is outstanding performance and speaks volumes about this asset-like business strategy and execution that we put in place.
Next slide. On a balance sheet perspective, we closed the year up with $270 million in cash and $520 million in undrawn revolver, so it's that about $800 million existing capacity. Our net debt to EBITDA is at only $1.07 billion, and our EBITDA and interest coverage is at 10x. We've invested $900 million in the last 50 months in transactions and certainly, we're positioned to capture opportunities at that level in the next 15 days.
Next slide. We'll here, we look at the specific Q4 enterprise results. Once again, to an all-time right heard. Truly remarkable quarter fries. Sales were up 23% to $679 million, and organic growth represented 15%. Our backlog at $785 million is up 39% from the prior year. Net earnings were up 49% to $107 million. EBITDA at $200 million in the quarter kind of breath-taking number, up $53 million from a year ago, and EBITDA margins at 29.4%, I just asked people to compare those to gross margins from your S&P 500 diversified companies. 
Our free cash flow at 22% of sales and up 21% to $147 million, again, just very strong and by closing out the year, as strong as we have, truly gives us a lot of confidence going in to 2011, it will have another record here in 2011.
Next slide. Our Q4 income statement, you can see here sales and bookings of 23% both organic and 15%. Book to bill closed down at 102%. Gross profit, 54.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Operating margins at 24.5%, and I'd remind you again about our non-cash intangible amortization which is about $25 million in the quarter. So another 3.7%, you take a 20 4.5% and a $3.7 million, you get an EBITDA number of $20.2 million in the quarter ended. 
Interest expense, the same in the fourth quarter of oh then as it was last year. Our tax rate dropped to 27.7%. Our guidance was for it to be a little bit above that. We had the benefit of the R&D tax credit there in the quarter.  Net earnings were up 49% as we said to $107 million, and earnings per share on a debts basis, $110 million versus $0.77.
When we get specifically into each of the segments, we'll talk a little bit about how the fourth quarter was and more importantly, what we think 2011 looks like, next slide. So if you look at the margin performance in the segments, you can see Our Avenue was at 50% gross margins and industrial, 52%, energy, 56%, and medical and imaging 63%. Just virtually, the same EBITDA performance along the way to 31%, 32%, 31%, 32%, which excludes the corporate costs that brings us down to our enterprise number. 
We had really exceptional margins throughout the enterprise with really no segment lagging very much. Of course, the RF is made up of two entirely different kind of entities now, with a little less than half of it being totally transportation and administrative activities, which of course carry much lower margins.  And then the majority of the business in our Software-as-a-Service and other RF products basis which enjoy the higher margins.
Next slide. In the RF Technology segment, you can see orders were up 4%, sales up 17%, organic sales were up 6%, finally returning to organic growth in the radio frequency. Our CBORD and Horizon software businesses had excellent results, with campus security, which is picked back up, as people are interfacing new systems and integrating them on the blocks and other technologies on campus, and then the healthcare applications were a little better than we expected given the Hospital weakness. 
We got the benefit of the first full quarter of iTradeNetwork in the numbers, and then in a bit of a surprise, we actually shipped the first phase of the Houston Metropole project which actually we've switched over now to our United Toll service system technology, just quite valuable for not only the city but for us as well. That was something that we would've expected much earlier in the year having committed earlier the year, we thought it will be an 2011 item. A little bit of that has been moved into 2010.
For full-year 2011, we expect that the software businesses will grow through expanding subscription-basis, new applications that are going to be offered to existing clients, and then a roll out of the recent wins, which is going to benefit us throughout the year and certainly more so in the second half of '11.
Our tolling project in 2011 as we ship much more of the Houston project will add growth but it does come in at lower margins. And that organic growth could be expected to reach double digits in that segment in 2011. However, we don't see any improvements in the state and local government activities, so we're really not counting for anything incrementally out of that space.
Next slide. In the Industrial Technology arena, you can see organic growth here was 21%. We had double-digit order growth in every business that reports into that segment. Our Oil & Gas business that go along with the broker pomp and a few of the other businesses were exceptionally strong. And we had said earlier this year that we thought we'd do a little bit better on our material test equipment sales. 
Well, we did a little better. We did 50% better, which was certainly well above anything we would've envision. We also won Mexico City for Neptune for products that have been selected for delivery in 2011. And that will add to our Toronto project, which is finally underway a little bit in the fourth quarter.
For 2011, full year, we think Neptune will be able to grow, driven by the Toronto project ramp-up and the Mexico City shipments, and then modest growth in the U.S. water market. We still have copper cost pressures, that could drag down pretax earnings as much as $10 million in 2011. And if it keeps going at a rate that is going, but hopefully, we won't have to suffer all of that.
We expect a record year in Fluid Handling. Everyone in these businesses is doing exceptionally well, and we see continued recovery in industrial end markets, which is very important for our Material Analysis business which could have a record here this next year.
Our backlog supports very strong first half in the segment. The DuraTorque products that we're selling for drilling technologies continued to gain share rapidly, and our De-watering comp sales are growing very sharply here on 2011.
Next slide. Energy Systems & Controls, it was up organically, 26%. You can see orders up 26% as well. Again, we had double-digit growth in every business in that segment, very strong performance for any global activity that was related to oil and gas, and we have several businesses and this segment at our. And then we had very strong continued momentum in our sensors and analytical instrument businesses.
For 2011, we see favorable end markets, particularly in upstream oil and gas, all the process industries in our turbine control business which is performing at a spectacular level. And we see growth and operational execution across the segment in 2011, actually improving the margins from where they are today, and with very solid, detail bridges as to why we think our margins will be better again in 2011.
Next slide. Here, if you look at medical and our scientific imaging technology businesses, just again driven by the Verathon acquisition, orders up 41%, sales up 34%. Verathon just performed in an outstanding way, both economically and with the growth that they've demonstrated and the fourth quarter and the full year as a whole. We had very strong sales of our small dosage pump business that really has performed at full-time record levels in 2010 and we would expect more of the same next year. Medical Consumables has been very strong here in the fourth quarter, and we've had quite strong continued growth in the OEM solutions we provide for videoconferencing, things like telepresence and the like.
Our full-year 2011 to us, it looks again, like a double-digit growth year. Medical continues to do really well, with the investment we've made on a global basis and adding sales talent. We've got new product launches that will curb midyear in Verathon, with premium products, and we have a better global reach to be able to launch these things around the world instead of just here in North America. 
We've got a record backlog as we enter 2011 for scientific imaging, so really think that, that should insulate us from what we would worry about being softness in research funding as the year unfolds on a global basis. Although we haven't seen that yet.
Next slide. If you go beyond just the quantitative numbers in the business us, these were some critical things we feel we've learned this year. The recovery really continued throughout the year in almost all of our end markets, which is why we went from negative 3% to plus 5%, plus 14% and plus 15%. The worst-performing end markets we had all seemed to have bottomed, and while some of them are balancing off the bottom much, they are all trending a little bit more favorably.
And we have fewer downside risk concerns going in to 2011 and in '10, or about finished with all of our 2011 through '13 planning, and struck by the confidence level that all of our business leaders have about 2011 compared to where we were last year at the same time. The business as we thought would do well this year, really dramatically outperformed our assumptions. Some of these businesses were up 50%, and we would've expected small double-digit growth from them.
Our niche businesses has held or gained share during the downturn. We had been worried that some of these would be attacked by larger companies that aren't in the space today who would try to enter. I think some of that happened, and they were really entry barriers prove to be quite significant, just anybody trying to enter these markets in which we participate. And our growth investment in R&D and product development and sales channel development are really helping guide this organic growth you've seen in the second half of the year, and why we have confidence going into 2011 on organic growth.
Our more cyclical business that had variable costs did very well last year in terms of decremental margins, and they've done spectacularly well this year in terms of incremental margins that we've grown. 
Our restructuring benefits from the fourth quarter of '08, first part of '09, along with this organic growth drive have really brought us to margin expansion to heights that most people thought were the never attainable. 
Our United toll service technology customer acceptance in the year was really a wonderful development and allowed us to ship a number of products that could have been supplied the other people to our own UTS technologies, and have created a number of new bid opportunities for us and programs we're working on throughout the country, people to deploy this much improved technology in the tolling arena.
Verathon exceeded our expectations and the integration benefits have been more substantial than we had forecast at the time of the acquisition. The investment in sales coverage and global channel reach and product development, they've been able to turn around immediately into measurable growth.
Next slide. So with that, we'll get into our 2011 guidance. Next slide. Here we go you'll see we're establishing full-year guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis of $3.82 to $4.02. We'll talk a little bit about how we made that our. We see sales up on the year between 11% and 13%, we should be organic growth of 9% to 11% in 2011, and about two points from acquisitions. 
Our iTrade acquisition will roll over in the second half of the year, so we really don't have a lot yet from acquisitions to add to those numbers at the moment. Our foreign exchange rates would be the same as they actually were on January 1 of 2011 as you model what we're doing.
Our tax rate's an important thing this year in 2011, we think will be in around 30% tax. This past year, we were able to close up at 20.1%. The different in tax is it gives us and about $0.11 a share headwind in 2011 versus '10. When you're looking at $3.82 to $4.02, that's in the face of. Our diluted share count of $90.5 million is what we would expect to route the year, is up from the 2010 number of 96.7%, and our primarily share count closed out the year December 31 to 95.1 million shares, probably would reach 97 million shares at the end of the year. And I do think there are some people that have share counts that are lower out there then what's the reality. So again, diluted share count for the year, 90.5 million primary share count by the 95 million now, and still DEPS of $3.82 to $4.2. First quarter, we're seeing $0.83 to $0.87 in the quarter, which represented about 21.5%, and the full year, slightly better than normal, usually we're in the sort of 80% to 81% range for Q1. And then full year operating cash flow should exceed $550 million, which is once again, very, very modest CapEx for 2011.
Next slide. So in summary, what we have year is just a wide variety of all-time performance records that were established in 2010. We had the $500 million in operating cash flow, 20% in free cash flow to sales, really quite outstanding margin leverage as the growth continues, and then broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise which gives us the belief that we'll have a strong record here at 2011. And with that, I think we can open it up, John, for Q&A."

So it's been a drag throughout the year in terms of actual sales, and its been certainly frustrating, the E-ZPass thing is beyond unbelievable. And I can't say a lot more about it. Some people have written recently that we maybe be a decision in August of 2011. We saw another article from somebody was talking to somebody else well, maybe they won't decide and then maybe they would rollover to August of 2013. And we have a lot of questions about what's going on there but we have very little influence in. We just offer them the best technology in the world at the lowest price, and continue to pay money to get it tested. And sometimes, somebody will decide something. And now as far as other projects are concerned, the decision-making around project has been very slow. We thought we might get some benefit in 2010 as just this stimulus situation went away. But in fact, there's just very slow decisions. We saw a lot of questions, we got a lot of people who are wanting to convert to our United toll products and so that's given us kind of a leg up. But we're not assuming any kind of real spike in 2011 on that portion of the business. Now remember in that segment for us, it's now finally less than half of the segment. So we got a lot of other things in this segment that are really driving margin and driving cash and driving economic performance. I do think that our results in terms of revenue have really bottomed on the items in the transportation and traffic arena.

So if you look and there's a reconciliation to reconciliation pages that are in the appendix that show you by quarter, and we try to make this really granular this time where you'll see in a reconciliation in OP line, the amortization line segment and then an EBITDA number, and then depreciation added through EBITDA, we gave you the revenue number, we gave you the  EBITDA margins. So for instance, and RF in the fourth quarter, the EBITDA margin was 29.7%, EBITDA margin was 31.2%. In the fourth quarter, I think, our intangible amortization was about right at $25 million. Our full-year intangible amortization of '10 was about 86 million. So clearly, you're seeing the affect of the intangible amortization on iTrade just quite sizable. And a portion, which has nothing to do with the reinvestment CapEx or anything else is going to be like $100 million. So that tends to pull down operating profit margins and it is, in our view, a foolish way for somebody to think about how well the company is performing. So you'll see continued growth in iTrade. If we'll add significantly to our cash performance. It will add aggressively to the OP margin line. So that's an important distinction. And then the tolling traffic business is less than half the segment. It comes in at dramatically lower gross margins. We are not talking 50% and 60% there. We are talking very much less than that. And then it's operating profit margins is relatively good given its low gross margins. And then the rest of the segment, let's say it gets to be 55%, 60% of war, it's going to have highest gross margin profile higher than imaging does and it's going to come in with the EBITDA higher than any portion of the enterprise. So it's a hard question to answer and say we'll use to replug, I don't think I'll do that. But it's easy to put a plug-in on a cash performance basis quarter-to-quarter."

We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll l",3236,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll look at the individual segment detail and the outlook for each one of those segments for 2011. I'll talk a little bit about sort of beyond the numbers, things that happened in 2010 that have been learnings for us during the downturn as we come out. And then establish our 2011 guidance and move to Q&A for you.
So next slide. For 2010, our enterprise financial results are just fundamentally in every category, an all-time record whether it's orders, sales, backlog, earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, anything one can think of. Our EBITDA margins for the year reached 26.7%, of course, another all-time high.
Our operating teams performed exceptionally well, and we enjoyed full year EBITDA leverage on the next dollar of incremental sales of 40%. We had a record asset loss, we will have more to talk about there. And for the first time, we were at $500 million in operating cash flow for the calendar year.
Our free cash flow became 20% of sales. We look around it, capital market competitors for us and many of the S&P 500 businesses don't enjoy 20% operating margin, let alone 20% free cash flow to sales. Our free cash flow exceeded net income for the 13th consecutive year. We increased our dividend this year by 16% for 2011 after raising them last year, 15% for 2009.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the full year was 1.06. This has created a record backlog of $785 million, which is up $220 million from our year-end backlog last year, and I think one of the things that's amazing for us is that the excellence that we had really permeated throughout the enterprise with only to or three businesses not participating.
Next slide. Our full year income statement, you can see here bookings reach about $2.5 billion for the first time. Our bookings were up 25% on the year. Our net sales were up 16%, 8% organic for the year but of course, it continued to move up throughout the year starting out the year with a minus 3% and then a plus 5%, and a plus 14% and closing out at a plus 15%. Our gross margin, again, spectacular 53.4% for the year, up 250 basis points over the prior year.
Our income from operations for the year was up 30% at $514 million, and I would like to remind people that we have about $86 million of noncash intangible amortization that depresses those income margin. So our operating profit margins reached 21.6% for the year. If you add back the noncash intangible amortization, you're over 25%.
Our interest expense was up just modestly at $67 million, and the tax rate was slightly down this year at 28.1% versus 29.5% for the prior year. That left us with net earnings of $323 million, up from last year's $239 million, and full year diluted earnings per share of $3.34 versus $2.58 last year.
Next slide. Our full year operating cash flow as we said before was $500 million, that was up 36% from last year's $367 million. And our operating cash flow as a percent of sales, you can see it continues to trend up, it was 16% in '07, 19% in '08, dropped by a point to 18% in the great recession and it's now back to 21% here in 2010. And our cash conversion on an operating cash flow basis was 155% of net income.
Next slide. On a full year free cash flow basis, the $500 million drops to $471 million as we had about $29 million of CapEx. Our free cash flow, as I said, was 20% of revenue, up 300 basis points from last year. 
We had stellar execution, which you'll see in our asset velocity numbers in just a minute. And you could see here, you're gone from 122% free cash flow in 2006 to 128%, and then 143%. I think, the 2008 that was of course a record for us. People expected we'd fall off in the downturn, but we didn't. We held the 143%, and now this year as we start back up, we're at 146%. So really, sustained cash flow performance conversion and despite very difficult economic markets during that five-year period.
Next slide. On asset velocity, this is sort of a slight internal year because we focused so much on it that it kind of takes our breath away. You look here at 12/31/10, and our inventory is down to 6.6% of the revenue, receivables at 14.8%, payables and accruals at 16%. So when you add inventory and receivables and subtract the payables and accruals, which is our core measurement, we are at 5.4% of sales. If you go back to '07 and we were at 10% of sales, and those of you who followed us a long time, those numbers used to dramatically higher than that.
And when you think about 5.4% that support your revenue and you've got 26.7% EBITDA and 20% free cash flow to sales on a 5.4% number, it truly is outstanding performance and speaks volumes about this asset-like business strategy and execution that we put in place.
Next slide. On a balance sheet perspective, we closed the year out with $270 million in cash and $520 million in undrawn revolver, so it's about $800 million of existing capacity. Our net debt to EBITDA is only at 1.7x, and our EBITDA to interest coverage is nearly 10x. We invested $900 million in the last 15 months in transactions. And certainly, we're positioned to capture opportunities at that level in the next 15 days.
Next slide. Well here, we look at the specific Q4 enterprise results. Once again, it's an all-time record, truly remarkable quarter for us. Sales were up 23% to $679 million and organic growth represented 15%. Our backlog at $785 million is up 39% from the prior year. Net earnings were up 49% to $107 million. EBITDA at $200 million in the quarter, kind of breath-taking number, up $53 million from a year ago, and EBITDA margins at 29.4%, I just asked people to compare those to gross margins from your S&P 500 diversified companies. 
Our free cash flow at 22% of sales and up 21% to $147 million, again just very strong, and by closing out the year, the strongest we have, it really gives us a lot of confidence going into 2011 that we'll have another record year in 2011.
Next slide. Our Q4 income statement, you can see here sales and bookings up 23%, both organic at 15%. Book-to-bill closed out at 1.02. Gross profit, 54.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Operating margins at 24.5%. And I'd remind you again about our noncash intangible amortization, about $25 million in the quarter, so another 3.7%. You take the 24.5% and the 3.7%, you get an EBITDA number of 28.2% in the quarter net debt. 
Interest expense, the same in the fourth quarter of '10 as it was last year. Our tax rate dropped to 27.7%. Our guidance was for it to be a little bit above that. We had the benefit of the R&D tax there in the quarter. Net earnings were up 49%, as we said, to $107 million, and earnings per share on a DEPS basis is $1.10 versus $0.77.
Next slide. When we get specifically into each of the segments here, we'll talk a little bit about how the fourth quarter was and more importantly, what we think 2011 looks like. 
Next slide. So if we look at the margin performance in the segments, you can see RF was at 50% gross margins and Industrial, 52%, Energy, 56%, and Medical and Imaging 63%. Just virtually, the same EBITDA performance along the way 31%, 32%, 31%, 32%, which excludes the corporate cost that brings us down to our enterprise number. 
We had really exceptional margins throughout the enterprise with really no segment lagging very much. Of course, the RF is made up of two entirely different kind of entities now, with a little less of half of it being tolling and transportation and administrative activities, which of course carry much lower margins. And then the majority of the business in our Software-as-a-Service and other RF products basis which enjoy the higher margins.
Next slide. In the RF Technology segment, you can see orders were up 4%, sales up 17%, organic sales were up 6%, finally returning to organic growth in the radio frequency. Our CBORD and Horizon software businesses had excellent results with campus security, which is picked back up as people are introducing new systems and integrating them with locks and other technologies on campus. And then the healthcare applications were a little better than we expected given the hospital weakness. 
We got the benefit of the first full quarter of iTradeNetwork in the numbers, and then in a bit of a surprise, we actually shipped the first phase of the Houston METRO Toll project, which actually we switched over now to our United Toll Service system technology, just quite valuable for not only the city but for us as well. That was something that we would have expected much earlier in the year having not had committed earlier the year, we thought it would be a 2011 item. A little bit of that has moved into 2010.
For full year 2011, we expect that the software businesses will grow through expanding subscription basis, new applications that are going to be offered to existing clients and then a roll out of recent wins which is going to benefit us throughout the year and certainly more so in the second half of '11.
Our tolling projects in 2011 as we ship much more of the Houston project will add growth but it does come in at lower margins. And then our organic growth could be expected to reach double digits in the segment in 2011. However, we don't see any improvements to state and local government activities, so we're really not counting for anything incrementally out of that space.
Next slide. In the Industrial Technology arena, you can see organic growth here was 21%. We had double-digit order growth in every business that reports into that segment. Our Oil & Gas businesses that go along with the broker pomp and a few of the other businesses were exceptionally strong. And we had said earlier this year that we thought we'd do a little bit better on our material test equipment sales, well we did a little better. We did 50% better, which was certainly well above anything we would have envisioned. 
We also won Mexico City for Neptune, for products that have been selected for delivery in 2011. And that will add to our Toronto project which is finally underway a little bit in the fourth quarter.
For 2011 full year, we think Neptune will be able to grow driven by the Toronto project ramp-up and the Mexico City shipments, and then modest growth in the U.S. water market. We still have copper cost pressures that could drag down pretax earnings as much as $10 million in 2011 if it keeps going at a rate it's going. But hopefully, we won't have to suffer all of that.
We expect a record year in Fluid Handling. Everyone of these businesses is doing exceptionally well. And we see a continued recovery in industrial end markets which is very important for our Material Analysis business which could have a record here this next year.
Our backlog supports very strong first half in the segment. The DuraTorque products that we're selling for drilling technologies continue to gain share rapidly and our dewatering pump sales are growing very sharply here on 2011.
Next slide. Energy Systems & Controls, it was up organically, 26%. You can see orders up 26% as well. Again, we had double-digit growth in every business in that segment, very strong performance for any global activity that was related to oil and gas and we have several businesses in this segment there are and I know we had very strong continued momentum in our sensors and analytical instrument businesses.
For 2011, we see favorable end markets, particularly in upstream oil and gas, all the process industries in our turbine control business which is performing at a spectacular level. And we see growth and operational execution across the segment in 2011, actually improving the margins from where they are today, and with very solid detailed bridges as to why we think our margins will be better again in 2011.
Next slide. Here, if we look at Medical and our Scientific Imaging technology businesses, just again driven by the Verathon acquisition, orders up 41%, sales up 34%. Verathon just performed in an outstanding way both economically and with the growth that they've demonstrated in the fourth quarter and the full year as a whole. We had very strong sales of our small dosage pump business that really has performed at full-time record levels in 2010 and we would expect more of the same next year. medical consumables have been very strong here in the fourth quarter, and we've had quite strong continued growth in the OEM solutions we provide for videoconferencing, things like telepresence and the like.
Our full year 2011 to us, it looks again like a double-digit growth here. Medical will continue to do really well with the investment we've made on a global basis and adding sales talent. We've got new product launches that will occur midyear in Verathon, with premium products. And we have a better global reach to be able to launch these things around the world instead of just here in North America. 
We've got a record backlog as we enter 2011 for Scientific Imaging, so we really think that that should insulate us from what we would worry about being softness in research funding as the year unfolds on a global basis although we haven't seen that yet.
Next slide. If you go beyond just the quantitative numbers in the businesses, these were some critical things we feel we've learned this year. The recovery really continued throughout the year in almost all of our end markets, which is why we went from negative 3% to plus 5%, plus 14% and plus 15%. The worst-performing end markets we have all seemed to have bottomed. And while some of them are balancing off the bottom much, they're all trending a little bit more favorably.
And we have fewer downside risk concerns going in to 2011 and in '10, or about finished with all of our 2011 through '13 planning, and struck by the confidence level that all of our business leaders have about 2011 compared to where we were last year at the same time. The businesses we thought would do well this year really dramatically outperformed our assumptions. Some of these businesses were up 50% and we would've expected small double-digit growth from them.
Our niche business has held or gained share during the downturn. We had been worried that some of these would be attacked by larger companies that aren't in the space today who would try to enter. I think some of that happened, and they worded our entry barriers proved to be quite significant against anybody trying to enter these markets in which we participate. 
And our growth investments in R&D and product development and sales channel development are really helping drive this organic growth you've seen in the second half of the year and why we have confidence going into 2011 on organic growth.
Our more cyclical business that had variable costs did very well last year in terms of decremental margins, and they've done spectacularly well this year in terms of incremental margins that we've grown. 
Our restructuring benefits from the fourth quarter of '08, the first part of '09, along with this organic growth drive have really brought us to margin expansion to heights that most people thought were never attainable. 
Our United Toll Service technology customer acceptance in the year was really a wonderful development and allowed us to ship a number of projects that would have been supplied by other people to our own UTS technologies, and have created a number of new bid opportunities for us and programs we're working on throughout the country, people to deploy this much improved technology in the tolling arena.
Verathon exceeded our expectations. The integration benefits have been more substantial than we had forecast at the time of the acquisition. The investment in sales coverage and global channel reach and product development, they've been able to churn around immediately into measurable growth.
Next slide. So with that, we'll get into our 2011 guidance. Next slide. Here you'll see we're establishing full year guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis of $3.82 to $4.02. We'll talk a little bit about how we make that up. We see sales up on the year between 11% and 13%, which would be organic growth of 9% to 11% in 2011, and about two points from acquisitions. 
Our iTrade acquisition will roll over in the second half of the year, so we really don't have a lot yet from acquisitions to add to those numbers at the moment. Our foreign exchange rates would be the same as they actually were on January 1 of 2011 as you model what we're doing.
Our tax rate's an important thing. This year in 2011, we think will be in around 30% tax. This past year, we were able to close out at 28.1%. The difference in tax as it gives is about $0.11 a share headwind in 2011 versus '10. When you're looking at $3.82 to $4.02, that's in the face of '11 and headwind. Our diluted share count of 98.5 million is what we would expect throughout the year, is up from the 2010 number of 96.7 million, and our primary share count closed out the year December 31 at 95.1 million shares, probably would reach 97 million shares at the end of the year. And I do think there are some people that have share counts that are lower out there than what's in reality. So again, diluted share count for the year, 98.5 million primary share count, 95 million. 
And still DEPS at $3.82 to $4.2. First quarter, we're seeing $0.83 to $0.87 in the quarter, which represents about 21.5% for the full year, slightly better than normal, usually we're in the sort of 18% to 21% range for Q1. And then full year operating cash flow should exceed $550 million with once again very, very modest CapEx for 2011.
Next slide. So in summary, what we have here is just a wide variety of all-time performance records that were established in 2010. We had the $500 million in operating cash flow, 20% in free cash flow to sales, really quite outstanding margin leverage as the growth continues and then broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise which gives us the belief that we'll have a strong record year at 2011. And with that, I think we can open it up, John, for Q&A."

Some people have written recently that well maybe there'll be a decision in August of 2011. We saw another article from somebody who's talking to somebody saying, ""Well, maybe they won't decide then they could rollover to August of 2013."" And we have a lot of questions about what's going on there but we have very little influence in it. We just offer them the best technology in the world at the lowest price and continue to pay money to get it tested. And sometimes, somebody will decide something. And now as far as other projects are concerned, the decision making around projects has been very slow. We thought we might get some benefit in 2010 as just the stimulus situation went away. But in fact, there's just very slow decisions. We saw a lot of questions, we got a lot of people who are wanting to convert to our United Toll products and so that's given us kind of a leg up. But we're not assuming any kind of real spike in 2011 on that portion of the business. Now remember in that segment for us, it's now finally less than half of the segment. So we got a lot of other things in the segment that are really driving margin and driving cash and driving economic performance. I do think that our results in terms of revenue have really bottomed on the items in the transportation and traffic arena. We've got a meeting later this week to kind of refresh where we are, I know people are starting to develop a little bit more confidence."

So if you look and there's a reconciliation to reconciliation pages that are in the appendix that show you by quarter. And we try to make this really granular this time where you'll see in  a reconciliation in OP line, the amortization line segment and then an EBITA number, and then appreciation added through EBITDA, we gave you the revenue number, we gave you the EBITA margins. So for instance, and RF in the fourth quarter, the EBITDA margin was 29.7%, EBITDA margin was 31.2%. In the fourth quarter, I think our intangible amortization was about right at $25 million. Our full year intangible amortization for '10 was about $86 million. So clearly, you're seeing the effects of the intangible amortization on iTrade, just, quite sizable. And a portion, which has nothing to do with the reinvestment CapEx or anything else is going to be like $100 million. So that tends to pull down operating profit margins and it is, in our view, a foolish way for somebody to think about how well the company is performing. So you'll see a continued growth in iTrade. If we'll add significantly to our cash performance. It will add aggressively to the OP margin line. So that's an important distinction. And then the Tolling traffic business is less than half the segment. It comes in at dramatically lower gross margins. We are not talking 50% and 60% there. We are talking very much less than that. And then its operating profit margin is relatively good given its low gross margins. Then the rest of the segment, let's say it gets to be 55%, 60% or more, it's going to have highest gross margin profile higher than imaging does and it's going to come in with the EBITDA higher than any portion of the enterprise. So it's a hard question to answer and say, ""Well use a 23 plug."" I don't think I'll do that. But it's easy to put a plug-in on a cash performance basis quarter-to-quarter."

But I'm frowning at him a little bit. I'd be nice, I don't know. But clearly, first half of the year is going to be in the low-teens organic growth. The second half of the year is going to be more like the average we had for 2010, is my guess. And I think if we have upside of the year, it's probably going to manifest itself in the fourth quarter. I think that our field people are forecasting light in the fourth quarter versus what we would think in -- I don't really blame them for that. It's hard to envision you could have double-digit organic growth every quarter in 2011, but it's certainly possible."

We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll l",3241,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll look at the individual segment detail and the outlook for each one of those segments for 2011. I'll talk a little bit about sort of beyond the numbers, things that happened in 2010 that have been learnings for us during the downturn as we come out. And then establish our 2011 guidance and move to Q&A for you.
So next slide. For 2010, our enterprise financial results are just fundamentally in every category, an all-time record whether it's orders, sales, backlog, earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, anything one can think of. Our EBITDA margins for the year reached 26.7%, of course, another all-time high.
Our operating teams performed exceptionally well, and we enjoyed full year EBITDA leverage on the next dollar of incremental sales of 40%. We had a record asset loss, we will have more to talk about there. And for the first time, we were at $500 million in operating cash flow for the calendar year.
Our free cash flow became 20% of sales. We look around it, capital market competitors for us and many of the S&P 500 businesses don't enjoy 20% operating margin, let alone 20% free cash flow to sales. Our free cash flow exceeded net income for the 13th consecutive year. We increased our dividend this year by 16% for 2011 after raising them last year, 15% for 2009.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the full year was 1.06. This has created a record backlog of $785 million, which is up $220 million from our year-end backlog last year, and I think one of the things that's amazing for us is that the excellence that we had really permeated throughout the enterprise with only two or three businesses not participating.
Next slide. Our full year income statement, you can see here bookings reached about $2.5 billion for the first time. Our bookings were up 25% on the year. Our net sales were up 16%, 8% organic for the year but of course, it continued to move up throughout the year starting out the year with a minus 3% and then a plus 5%, and a plus 14% and closing out at a plus 15%. Our gross margin, again, spectacular 53.4% for the year, up 250 basis points over the prior year.
Our income from operations for the year was up 30% at $514 million, and I would remind people that we have about $86 million of noncash intangible amortization that depresses those income margin. So our operating profit margins reached 21.6% for the year. If you add back the noncash intangible amortization, you're over 25%.
Our interest expense was up just modestly at $67 million, and the tax rate was slightly down this year at 28.1% versus 29.5% for the prior year. That left us with net earnings of $323 million, up from last year's $239 million, and full year diluted earnings per share of $3.34 versus $2.58 last year.
Next slide. Our full year operating cash flow as we said before was $500 million, that was up 36% from last year's $367 million. And our operating cash flow as a percent of sales, you can see it continues to trend up, it was 16% in '07, 19% in '08, dropped by a point to 18% in the Great Recession and it's now back to 21% here in 2010. And our cash conversion on an operating cash flow basis was 155% of net income.
Next slide. On a full year free cash flow basis, the $500 million drops to $471 million as we had about $29 million of CapEx. Our free cash flow, as I said, was 20% of revenue, up 300 basis points from last year. 
We had stellar execution, which you'll see in our asset velocity numbers in just a minute. And you could see here, you've gone from 122% free cash flow in 2006 to 128%, and then 143%. And I think, in 2008 that was of course a record for us. People expected we'd fall off in the downturn and we didn't. We held the 143%, and now this year as we start back up, we're at 146%. So really, sustained cash flow performance conversion in despite very different economic markets during that five-year period.
Next slide. On asset velocity, this is sort of a slide internally here because we focus so much on it that it kind of takes our breath away. You look here at 12/31/10, and our inventory is down to 6.6% of the revenue, receivables at 14.8%, payables and accruals at 16%. So when you add inventory and receivables and subtract the payables and accruals, which is our core measurement, we are at 5.4% of sales. If you go back to '07 and we were at 10% of sales, and those of you who followed us a long time, those numbers used to dramatically higher than that.
And when you think about 5.4% to support your revenue and you've got 26.7% EBITDA and 20% free cash flow to sales on a 5.4% number, it truly is outstanding performance and speaks volumes about this asset-like business strategy and execution that we put in place.
Next slide. On a balance sheet perspective, we closed the year out with $270 million in cash and $520 million in undrawn revolver, so it's about $800 million of existing capacity. Our net debt to EBITDA is only at 1.7x, and our EBITDA to interest coverage is nearly 10x. We invested $900 million in the last 15 months in transactions. And certainly, we're positioned to capture opportunities at that level in the next 15 days.
Next slide. Well here, we look at the specific Q4 enterprise results. Once again, it's an all-time record, truly remarkable quarter for us. Sales were up 23% to $679 million and organic growth represented 15%. Our backlog at $785 million is up 39% from the prior year. Net earnings were up 49% to $107 million. EBITDA at $200 million in the quarter, kind of breath-taking number, up $53 million from a year ago, and EBITDA margins at 29.4%, I just asked people to compare those to gross margins from your S&P 500 diversified companies. 
Our free cash flow at 22% of sales and up 31% to $147 million, again just very strong, and by closing out the year, the strongest we have, it really gives us a lot of confidence going into 2011 that we'll have another record year in 2011.
Next slide. Our Q4 income statement, you can see here sales and bookings up 23%, both organic at 15%. Book-to-bill closed out at 1.02. Gross profit, 54.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Operating margins at 24.5%. And I'd remind you again about our noncash intangible amortization, about $25 million in the quarter, so another 3.7%. You take the 24.5% and the 3.7%, you get an EBITDA number of 28.2% in the quarter, not bad. 
Interest expense, the same in the fourth quarter of '10 as it was last year. Our tax rate dropped to 27.7%. Our guidance was for it to be a little bit above that. We had the benefit of the R&D tax there in the quarter. Net earnings were up 49%, as we said, to $107 million, and earnings per share on a DEPS basis is $1.10 versus $0.77.
Next slide. When we get specifically into each of the segments here, we'll talk a little bit about how the fourth quarter was and more importantly, what we think 2011 looks like. 
Next slide. So if we look at the margin performance in the segments, you can see RF was at 50% gross margins and Industrial, 52%, Energy, 56%, and Medical and Imaging 63%. Just virtually, the same EBITDA performance along the way 31%, 32%, 31%, 32%, which excludes the corporate cost that brings us down to our enterprise number. 
We had really exceptional margins throughout the enterprise with really no segment lagging very much. Of course, the RF is made up of two entirely different kind of entities now, with a little less than of half of it being tolling and transportation and administrative activities, which of course carry much lower margins. And then the majority of the business in our Software-as-a-Service and other RF products basis which enjoy the higher margins.
Next slide. In the RF Technology segment, you can see orders were up 4%, sales up 17%, organic sales were up 6%, finally returning to organic growth in the Radio Frequency. Our CBORD and Horizon software businesses had excellent results with campus security, which is picked back up as people are introducing new systems and integrating them with locks and other technologies on campus. And then the healthcare applications were a little better than we expected given the hospital weakness. 
We got the benefit of the first full quarter of iTradeNetwork in the numbers, and then in a bit of a surprise, we actually shipped the first phase of the Houston METRO Toll project, which actually we’ve switched over now to our United Toll Service system technology, which quite valuable for not only the city but for us as well. That was something that we would have expected much earlier in the year having not had it come in earlier the year, we thought it would be a 2011 item. A little bit of that has moved into 2010.
For full year 2011, we expect that the software businesses will grow through expanding subscription basis, new applications that are going to be offered to existing clients and then a roll out of recent wins which is going to benefit us throughout the year and certainly more so in the second half of '11.
Our tolling projects in 2011 as we ship much more of the Houston project will add growth but it does come in at lower margins. And then our organic growth could be expected to reach double digits in the segment in 2011. However, we don't see any improvements to state and local government activities, so we're really not counting for anything incrementally out of that space.
Next slide. In the Industrial Technology arena, you can see organic growth here was 21%. We had double-digit order growth in every business that reports into that segment. Our Oil & Gas businesses that go along with the broker pump and a few of the other businesses were exceptionally strong. And we had said earlier this year that we thought we'd do a little bit better on our material test equipment sales, well we did a little better. We did 50% better, which was certainly well above anything we would have envisioned. 
We also won Mexico City for Neptune, for products that have been selected for delivery in 2011. And that will add to our Toronto project which is finally underway a little bit in the fourth quarter.
For 2011 full year, we think Neptune will be able to grow driven by the Toronto project ramp-up and the Mexico City shipments, and then modest growth in the U.S. water market. We still have copper cost pressures that could drag down pretax earnings as much as $10 million in 2011 if it keeps going at a rate it's going. But hopefully, we won't have to suffer all of that.
We expect a record year in Fluid Handling. Everyone of these businesses is doing exceptionally well. And we see a continued recovery in industrial end markets which is very important for our Material Analysis business which could have a record year this next year.
Our backlog supports very strong first half in the segment. The DuraTorque products that we're selling for drilling technologies continue to gain share rapidly and our dewatering pump sales are growing very sharply here on 2011.
Next slide. Energy Systems & Controls, it was up organically, 26%. You can see orders up 26% as well. Again, we had double-digit growth in every business in that segment, very strong performance for any global activity that was related to oil and gas and we have several businesses in this segment that are and then we had very strong continued momentum in our sensors and analytical instrument businesses.
For 2011, we see favorable end markets, particularly in upstream oil and gas, all the process industries in our turbine control business which is performing at a spectacular level. And we see growth and operational execution across the segment in 2011, actually improving the margins from where they are today, and with very solid detailed bridges as to why we think our margins will be better again in 2011.
Next slide. Here, if we look at Medical and our Scientific Imaging technology businesses, just again driven by the Verathon acquisition, orders up 41%, sales up 34%. Verathon just performed in an outstanding way both economically and with the growth that they've demonstrated in the fourth quarter and the full year as a whole. We had very strong sales of our small dosage pump business that really has performed at full-time record levels in 2010 and we would expect more of the same next year. medical consumables have been very strong here in the fourth quarter, and we've had quite strong continued growth in the OEM solutions we provide for videoconferencing, things like telepresence and the like.
Our full year 2011 to us, it looks again like a double-digit growth year. Medical will continue to do really well with the investment we've made on a global basis and adding sales talent. We've got new product launches that will occur midyear in Verathon, with three new products. And we have a better global reach to be able to launch these things around the world instead of just here in North America. 
We've got a record backlog as we enter 2011 for Scientific Imaging, so we really think that that should insulate us from what we would worry about being softness in research funding as the year unfolds on a global basis although we haven't seen that yet.
Next slide. If you go beyond just the quantitative numbers in the businesses, these were some critical things we feel we've learned this year. The recovery really continued throughout the year in almost all of our end markets, which is why we went from negative 3% to plus 5%, plus 14% and plus 15%. The worst-performing end markets we have all seemed to have bottomed. And while some of them are balancing off the bottom much, they're all trending a little bit more favorably.
And we have fewer downside risk concerns going in to 2011 and in '10, or about finished with all of our 2011 through '13 planning, and struck by the confidence level that all of our business leaders have about 2011 compared to where we were last year at this same time. The businesses we thought would do well this year really dramatically outperformed our assumptions. Some of these businesses were up 50% and we would've expected small double-digit growth from them.
Our niche businesses held or gained share during the downturn. We had been worried that some of these would be attacked by larger companies that aren't in the space today who would try to enter. I think some of that happened, and they were really thwarted, our entry barriers proved to be quite significant against anybody trying to enter these markets in which we participate. 
And our growth investments in R&D and product development and sales channel development are really helping drive this organic growth you've seen in the second half of the year and why we have confidence going into 2011 on organic growth.
Our more cyclical business that had variable costs did very well last year in terms of decremental margins, and they've done spectacularly well this year in terms of incremental margins that we've grown. 
Our restructuring benefits from the fourth quarter of '08, the first part of '09, along with this organic growth drive have really brought us to margin expansion to heights that most people thought were never attainable. 
Our United Toll Service technology customer acceptance in the year was really a wonderful development and allowed us to ship a number of projects that would have been supplied by other people to our own UTS technologies, and it created a number of new bid opportunities for us and programs we're working on throughout the country, people to deploy this much improved technology in the tolling arena.
Verathon exceeded our expectations. The integration benefits have been more substantial than we had forecast at the time of the acquisition. The investment in sales coverage and global channel reach and product development, they've been able to churn around immediately into measurable growth.
Next slide. So with that, we'll get into our 2011 guidance. Next slide. Here you'll see we're establishing full year guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis of $3.82 to $4.02. We'll talk a little bit about how we make that up. We see sales up on the year between 11% and 13%, which would be organic growth of 9% to 11% in 2011, and then about two points from acquisitions. Our iTrade acquisition will roll over in the second half of the year, so we really don't have a lot yet from acquisitions to add to those numbers at the moment. Our foreign exchange rates would be the same as they actually were on January 1 of 2011 as you model what we're doing.
A tax rate's an important thing this yea. In 2011, we think will be in around 30% tax. This past year, we were able to close out at 28.1%. The difference in tax as it gives is about $0.11 a share headwind in 2011 versus '10. When you're looking at $3.82 to $4.02, that's in the face of an $0.11 headwind. Our diluted share count of 98.5 million is what we would expect throughout the year, is up from the 2010 number of 96.7 million, and our primary share count closed out the year December 31 at 95.1 million shares, probably would reach 97 million shares at the end of the year. And I do think there are some people that have share counts that are lower out there than what's in reality. So again, diluted share count for the year, 98.5 million primary share count, 95 million now. 
And still DEPS at $3.82 to $4.02. First quarter, we're seeing $0.83 to $0.87 in the quarter, which represents about 21.5% for the full year, slightly better than normal, usually we're in the sort of 18% to 21% range for Q1. And then full year operating cash flow should exceed $550 million with once again very, very modest CapEx for 2011.
Next page. So in summary, what we have here is just a wide variety of all-time performance records that were established in 2010. We had the $500 million in operating cash flow, 20% in free cash flow to sales, really quite outstanding margin leverage as the growth continues and then broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise which gives us the belief that we'll have a strong record year at 2011. And with that, I think we can open it up, John, for Q&A."

So it's been a drag throughout the year in terms of actual sales and it’s been certainly frustrating. The E-ZPass thing is beyond unbelievable. And I can't say a lot more about it. Some people have written recently that well maybe there'll be a decision in August of 2011. We saw another article from somebody who's talking to somebody saying, ""Well, maybe they won't decide then it could rollover to August of 2013."" And we have a lot of questions about what's going on there but we have very little influence in it. We just offer them the best technology in the world at the lowest price and continue to pay money to get it tested. And some time somebody will decide something. And now as far as other projects are concerned, the decision making around projects has been very slow. We thought we might get some benefit in 2010 as just the stimulus situation went away. But in fact, there's just very slow decisions. We still got a lot of questions, we got a lot of people who are wanting to convert to our United Toll products and so that's given us kind of a leg up. But we're not assuming any kind of real spike in 2011 on that portion of the business. Now remember in that segment for us, it's now finally less than half of the segment. So we got a lot of other things in the segment that are really driving margin and driving cash and driving economic performance.

So if you look and there's a reconciliation, two reconciliation pages that are in the appendix that show you by quarter. And we try to make this really granular this time where you'll see in a reconciliation in OP line, the amortization line separate and then an EBITA number, and then appreciation added through EBITDA, we gave you the revenue number, we gave you the EBITA margins. So for instance, and RF in the fourth quarter, the EBITA margin was 29.7%, EBITDA margin was 31.2%. In the fourth quarter, I think our intangible amortization was about right at $25 million. Our full year intangible amortization for '10 was about $86 million. So clearly, you're seeing the effects of the intangible amortization on iTrade, which is quite sizable. And the A portion, which has nothing to do with the reinvestment CapEx or anything else is going to be like $100 million. So that tends to pull down operating profit margins and it is, in our view, a foolish way for somebody to think about how well the company is performing. So you'll see a continued growth in iTrade. It will add significantly to our cash performance. It will add less aggressively to the OP margin line. So that's an important distinction. And then the Tolling traffic business is less than half the segment. It comes in at dramatically lower gross margins. We are not talking 50% and 60% there. We are talking very much less than that. And then its operating profit margin is relatively good given its low gross margins. Then the rest of the segment, let's say it gets to be 55%, 60% or more, it's going to have highest gross margin profile higher than imaging does and it's going to come in with the EBITDA higher than any portion of the enterprise. So it's a hard question to answer and say, ""Well use a 23 plug."" I don't think I'll do that. But it's easy to put a plug-in on a cash performance basis quarter-to-quarter."

But clearly, first half of the year is going to be in the low-teens organic growth. The second half of the year is going to be more like the average we had for 2010, is my guess. And I think if we have upside of the year, it's probably going to manifest itself in the fourth quarter. I think that our field people are forecasting light in the fourth quarter versus what we would think in -- I don't really blame them for that.

We'll take you first through the Q1 financial results in detail, and then we'll look at the segment performance, and the outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll talk about raising our guidance and then so",2486,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We'll take you first through the Q1 financial results in detail, and then we'll look at the segment performance, and the outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter, and take your questions.
First Slide here is the financial results. You can see we achieved a record, all-time record for Q1, in orders in sales backlog, net earnings and EBITDA and pretty much any measurement you can imagine. and the thing that was particularly gratifying was our book-to-bill ratio was 109%, and generally we're at the sort of 97% to 103%, so to be 109% is very encouraging for the remainder of the year. 
Organic growth was really quite spectacular, we thought 20% of our growth, and all four of the segments had double-digit order growth and revenue growth as you can see organically was 16%.
Gross margins increased to 54.3%, so any fear of input costs creating any difficulty of Roper was not well-founded. EBITDA margins are up 310 basis points to 27.4%. Remember what does that was mostly EBITA there's not much depreciation here. 
Our balance sheet was enhanced, as we continued to pay down our revolver, and we ended the quarter with an all-time record backlog of $851 million in revenue, which is 43% higher than the backlog at the end of the first quarter last year of $257 million. Now we certainly, when we established our guidance for Q1 thought we would have a strong start, but this is even better than our best expectations.
Next slide. Our income statement here you can see the bookings of $702 million up 24% in total, and 20% organically, net sales of $645 million, up 21% in total, and 16% organically. Our gross profit went up from 52.3% the first quarter of last year to 54.3%, here an increase of 200 basis points. 
Our operating income was up 41% and went from 18.8% last year to 22% this year, so that's really quite an outstanding leverage. We'll talk a little bit more about our leverage on the variable contribution here for the revenue.
Our interest expense was basically flat. The tax rate was also quite similar to the prior-year, and that produced net earnings of up 49% to $89 million from $59.7 million last year, and a diluted earnings per share number of $0.91, versus the $0.62 gap number from the prior-year.
On the next slide. On the asset velocity, while the absolute amount of dollars amount of inventory receivables up a little bit as a function of the revenue, it continues to decline. You'll see in the first quarter, our inventory was 7.7% of revenue, down from 8.2% in the prior-year, our receivables were down to 16%, a pickup of 50 basis points from the 16.5% the prior-year, and our payables and accruals or liabilities there actually increased to 16.1% from 15.8%. So when we total it, at the end of last year we were 8.9% of sales in this year, is down 130 basis points to 7.6% of revenues. So year-over-year, we see continued improvement in our asset velocity.
Next slide. We ended the quarter with a really strong balance sheet. Cash was $261 million. We paid down the revolver so there's quite a bit of a role for left when you take the revolver in cash together, we wind up with $813 million of available liquidity and of course, we'll have very strong cash in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year. 
Our net debt is down to $980 million, and you can see that gives us a net debt to EBITDA ratio on a trailing basis of only 1.4x, and our EBITDA will continue to expand rapidly throughout the year on a trailing basis. Our EBITDA to interest coverage is already a 10.2x, so these ratios are extremely strong, and they really enhance our liquidity and our ability to use the balance sheet in the quarters ahead.
Next slide. Here we are going to look at the individual segment performance in the outlook. Next slide. Orders strength as you can see, was really spectacular. Industrial Technology was up 30%, RF Technology was up 30%, Energy systems and controls, 16%, and Medical and Scientific up 15%. The book-to-bill ratios were very strong all the way across, anywhere from 118%, and Industrial at 103% and Medical and Imaging we had in organic growth in all four segments in revenue as well.
Next slide. If you look at the RF Technology, you can see that orders rich $270 million in the quarter, up 30% from the prior-year and 18% organically. Our sales were $200 million which was up 23% year-over-year, and up more than 10% organically. 
Our gross margin expanded to 51.4% which was up 170 basis points, and our operating margin was up 270 basis points. We finished the quarter with an EBITDA margin of 30.7%, which was up 450 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. So you see very strong EBITDA performance with our iTrade business contributing a substantial amount of non-cash amortization to the EBITDA measure here.
In the first quarter of 2011, we had very strong pack sales for both Florida, Oklahoma and Dubai. In fact our Amtech business was up over 40%. A significant growth in our gas automated meter reading business with the Gaz de France project, and a quite substantial increase in the U.K. our water network metering and motoring business was up well in excess of 40% as well. 
And in CBORD, we've got an expanded subscriber base we've won another University of Miami University in Ohio, a big security win there displacing a long time occupant in that role.
In Q2, what we've seen is that the Gaz de France AMR project continued at similar levels to Q1. We'll have very strong seasonal Q2 because CBORD winds up with their annual renewals following into the second quarter, so we should see double-digit growth there. 
Our Houston METRO project appears to be on schedule, and we ought to see what we have in, or forecast for the second quarter. And iTrade has won a very, very significant opportunity to launch a system for a major European food retailer that we can't yet announce. But the launch is underway, and the integration will begin within the year.
It's very encouraging for us to see the direction that our technology, because last year in 2010's first quarter our organic revenue was down 12%, the second quarter was down 7%, third quarter was down 1%, the fourth quarter was up 6%, so we're out of the gate year with more than 10% organic the here in the first quarter, and we expect the balance of the year is going to give us double-digit growth throughout the next three quarters.  Q2 a little lighter, Q3 much stronger, and Q4 similar to this quarter.
Next slide. In Industrial Technology, is absolutely is a spectacular performance here. Our orders were up 30% to $201 million of course, that's all organic. Our sales were up 26% aided by about 60 basis points of FX, so you can round organic that to 25%. 
Gross margins were 50.4%, so they continue to expand, and their operating margin was up 370 basis points to 27.2%. EBITDA and Industrial Technology finished the quarter at 30.6%. 
Virtually, everyone there had a very strong quarter. Our Fluid Handling businesses that deal with gas exploration with the new products we've launched in the last year and half, just are having extraordinary performance. These businesses are nearly up 50%. The material testing business that we have as you can to you to get better capacity utilization around the country's growing very rapidly. 
And we actually had double-digit growth in our U.S. business in Neptune, and that is still more growth earnings per share result of Canada continuing shift Mexico City order we announced in the fourth quarter. So Neptune had a very strong Q1, and we expect that to continue.
In Q2 the backlog at our Fluid Handling businesses Cornell pump will assure double-digit growth in the second quarter. The Toronto project installation phase of that's going to actually ramp up in Q2, although because there's a lot of labor in that it comes in at the expected lower margins that we have there. 
End markets remain very strong always in all these Industrial categories, and the operating leverage do we have is continuing to drive margin performance. You can really see just how effective we are when you look at the spot price for copper in the first quarter last year, was $3.55 this year, spot price this year is $4.30 and yet our gross margin expanded across the board gross margin operating margins or EBITDA margins.
Our next slide. The Energy systems and control segment it continues to perform well here orders were up 16% all organic, sales were up 23%. Gross margin expanded quite a bit from up 350 basis points to 54.1% and the operating profit margin increased 450 basis point. You might remember we were somewhat disappointed in Q1 2010 where the operating margin got that corrupted in the second quarter, and this shows the kind of firm disciplined approach to what you need to do of the first quarter last year. And that certainly supports this quarter's 50-basis point improvement in OP. EBITDA margins year was 26%. 
Again, you can say exactly the same thing, the same words that apply to Industrial Technology broad-based strength across all businesses and end markets. Everything here is really doing exceptionally well, very dramatic growth in our diesel engine search protection business. We almost called that explosive growth, but that might scare people. But that business is up nearly 40% this year. Industrial end market growth continues to drive our sensors business, capacity utilization back in the latex or rubber industry looks very good and equipment sales ensure output this things are up sharply. And all of our Energy lab equipment businesses are doing okay, as we've finally got a little bit improvement both at refining and petrochem markets.
In the second quarter, the end market dynamics we think will continue to be strong. Our backlog is really quite substantial, and our Compressor Control business which will start to drive better this year in Q2 and particularly, in the second half of the year. And the margin expansion, we think will continue to be driven just by the operating leverage as sales increased throughout the year.
Next slide. Here's the Medical and Imaging segment. Orders were up 15%, tiny bit of FX there, so organic it was 14%, sales were up 12%, the gross margins here was 62.8%, up another 330 basis points, and our OP was up to 24.1%. EBITDA in this segment is 29.1% so EBITDA margins increased by 110 basis points. 
We've done quite a bit of investing in the first quarter in our Verathon business. We're launching two new products, one is called Veraport, and that has had as increase of growth expense in Q1, and that will continue a little bit into Q2, as we launch all of that collateral literature and the various programs held sales meeting in Q1 to kick that product off along with some other things we're doing as well. 
Medical remains a strong on consumables, double-digit growth in all these businesses, and our kidney dialysis application for our dosage delivery pump business continued to be a double-digit grower. Very significant order growth in our higher-end imaging cameras and filtering technology, it was the broad start of the quarter, as we look at the filters for electron microscopy of being up very dramatically.
In the second quarter of 2011, we see Medical continuing to grow at double digits, as we get continuing adoption rates regards opened to report new products must in this year. And the Scientific Imaging has a really quite substantial backlog as they will support a strong Q2. 
The Japanese supply risks have proven to be less difficult than what we've feared on certain higher-end chips that are made very specifically for us. We've kind of dealt with all these issues, and felt quite good about it. The only thing for Japan is a substantial portion of our camera business goes into the Japanese market. It represents disproportionate of share compared to the rest of Roper. 
Our total sales into Japan are in the neighborhood of 3% of revenues, so it's not something that's overly difficult for us that could depress revenue growth for the camera portion of the business in the next quarter or two. But then still backlog, that will be good news for us later.
Next slide. Here as we look at the guidance, we're going to raise the guidance. Next slide. We were at $3.82 to $4.2 when we went into the year. We raised the base by $0.15. On the top end by $0.10 to take us to $3.97 to $4.12. The midpoint is more than a 20% increase over last year's $3.34 depth space. And in the second quarter were at $0.95 to $1, which is a quite sharp increase over last year's future performance. 
Basically, the sales we expect to have in the mid-teens organic growth in the second quarter and the second half of the year, are probably in the kind of high single-digit, 8% to 10% or 11%, so the full year will be double-digit organic growth. 
The next slide would be the we are still reaffirming that the cash flow will be in excess of $550 million, so that you can imagine the next three quarters will be quite substantial in terms of operating cash flow would generate.
In quarter one summary, the next slide, all-time record there in Q1 for orders sales backlog net earnings and EBITDA, gross margin demonstrated that we didn't have any difficulty with input costs, 54.3%. Operating margins up 320 basis points to 22% that's leverage of 37%, by the way, on the OP line. And our EBITDA margins up 310 basis points to 27.4%, gives us a leverage of 43%.  As 43% leverage of course, benefits from iTrade we its amortization. 
Organic growth was 20% on orders, and 16% on sales. The $151 million backlog, I can remember were the total sales of the year, was $500 million. So being up 43% over the prior-year gives us a lot of optimism for the rest. Most importantly, as everything really performed well and if you look around, you can only find two or three things, which are quite small in our scope that are really doing exceptionally well. So we raised our guidance up to $3.97 to $4.12, and certainly, our position for another record year of Roper. And with that, let's open it up to questions, John."

On the same vein, somebody called me last night from Europe about a transaction that people think we should be interested in, which we never would be, but bragging that they would going to get a debt staple, of 6.75 on this transaction. So I mean the and lack of discipline around debt being applied to sales processes is pretty much back to the status that it's ever been. So you do want to be careful about what it is that you're doing. But we have more than enough really outstanding opportunity to execute over the next 12 months, so we're very encouraged.

That we have nothing to do with them in that space, that's the largest portion of their revenue how profitable it this is something you have to talk to them about. So there's a small group of competitors like CBORD and Blackboard that are driving what's happening from an abduction viewpoint from universities. We've got we think, the best offerings in this space. So if Blackboard and does transact, then someone else takes it over, we wouldn't see that if anything other than what you said, which is validating the quality of the space. If you look at the kind of trading models that Blackboard had even before these 35% premium jack-up, you get, why sometimes we get frustrated about people thinking about us as a multi-industry company, as opposed to a diversified growth company, because so many of our assets today in the SaaS platform space just hinder values our extraordinary compared to the industry multiples and we think people should focus on the light of the assets we hold in that space. And secondary, as far as -- sure it was basically, unprofitable trading dollars business in Canada that was acquired by Federal Signal, so we do think we think of the now was Federal Signal, which is selling to municipal aspects of stuff. The series kind of the low end of technology, certainly. And then if you go over to which is in Australia company publicly-traded, they bought the Mark 4 assets out of that transaction around Mark 4 and bankruptcy and things were tangential to that. We haven't seen any resurgence of anything under Federal Signal, and we certainly haven't seen any resurgence of anything, other than Mark 4 is just continuing the sale of products in the E-ZPass.

And if you look at our trailing EBITDA, it's going to ramp up quite dramatically here in the next quarter and third quarters. So we're going to have well in excess of $1 billion capacity with our existing structure without having to issue equity. I can't imagine issuing equity. You will have to be one heck of a breathtaking opportunity for us, and I just don't see that happening. I mean I wouldn't rule it out, if you have some kind of nirvana opportunity. But what we continue to just reinvest our cash flow, we think $500 million, $600 million a year is probably, where you go when you lever it up at 3x, could be more, we've got a lot of capacity now and exceptionally low. So maybe it goes up, but I wouldn't think we'd be doing some $2 billion transaction, I think we'd do $1 billion first."

So we continue to think that the talk in the service arena and the medical arena remain quite attractive businesses and there's plenty of growth in those businesses in terms of investments, acquisitions, and they really crowd out most of the other investment opportunities in terms of their cash and cash returns over time. So that remains our sharp focus. Maybe there'll be some niche thing along the way that we think is particularly good, but other than that pretty much, we're focused on those 2 areas. And I would just say, Terry, I think we had $87 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, not unusual for Q1. So with $550 million for the full year, we're talking about generating $463 million of operating cash flow in the next three quarters. And that $463 million in operating cash flow will be quite substantial is a function of revenue for the balance of the year. And when you already got $800 million in available liquidity, and you know you're going to create another $400-plus million of free cash flow between now and the end of the year, that gives us all the power we're going to need to make real by high-quality transactions."

We'll take you first through the Q1 financial results in detail, and then we'll look at the segment performance and the outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and take your questions.
First slide here is the financial results. You can see we achieved a record, all-time record for Q1, in orders and sales backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and pretty much every other measurement you can imagine. The thing that was particularly gratifying was our book-to-bill ratio was 109%. Generally, we're at the sort of 97% to 103%, so to be at 109% is very encouraging for the remainder of the year. 
Organic growth was really quite spectacular, we thought with 20% order growth. And all 4 of the segments had double-digit order growth and revenue growth, which you can see organically was 16%.
Gross margins increased to 54.3%, so any fear of input costs creating any difficulty at Roper was not well founded. EBITDA margins are up 310 basis points to 27.4%. Remember with us that's mostly EBITA. There's not much depreciation here. 
Our balance sheet was enhanced as we continued to pay down our revolver, and we ended the quarter with an all-time record backlog of $851 million in revenue, which is 43% higher than the backlog at the end of the first quarter last year, up $257 million. Now we certainly, when we established our guidance for Q1, thought we would have a strong start, but this is even better than our best expectations.
Next slide. Our income statement. Here you could see the bookings at $702 million, up 24% in total and 20% organically. Net sales of $645 million, up 21% in total and 16% organically. Our gross profit went from 52.3% at first quarter of last year to 54.3% here, an increase of 200 basis points. 
Our operating income was up 41%, that went from 18.8% last year to 22% this year, so that's really quite outstanding leverage. In fact, we'll talk a little bit more about our leverage on the variable contribution here for the revenue.
Our interest expense was basically flat. The tax rate was also quite similar to the prior year and that produced net earnings, up 49% to $89 million from $59.7 million last year and a diluted earnings per share number of $0.91 versus the $0.62 GAAP number from the prior year.
On the next slide. On the asset velocity, while the absolute amount -- the dollar amount of inventory receivable was up a little bit, as a function of the revenue it continues to decline. You'll see in the first quarter our inventory was 7.7% of revenue, down from 8.2%. In the prior year, our receivables were down to 16%, a pickup of 50 basis points from the 16.5% the prior year. And our payables and accruals or liabilities there actually increased to 16.1% from 15.8%. So when we total it, at the end of last year, we were 8.9% of sales, and this year it's down 130 basis points to 7.6% of revenues. So year-over-year, we see continued improvement in our asset velocity.
Next slide. We ended the quarter with a really strong balance sheet. Cash was $261 million. We paid down the revolver, so there's quite a bit of the revolver left. When you take the revolver and the cash together, we wind up with $813 million of available liquidity. And of course, we'll have very strong cash in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year. 
Our net debt is down to $980 million, and you can see that gives us a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a trailing basis of only 1.4x, and our EBITDA will continue to expand rapidly throughout the year on a trailing basis. Our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is already at 10.2x. So these ratios are extremely strong and they really enhance our liquidity and our ability to use the balance sheet in the quarters ahead.
Next slide. Here we're going to look at the individual segment performance and the outlook. 
Next slide. Order strength, as you can see, was really spectacular. Industrial Technology was up 30%, RF Technology was up 30%, Energy systems & Controls at 16% and Medical & Scientific up 15%. The book-to-bill ratios were very strong all the way across, anywhere from 118% in Industrial down to 103% in Medical & Imaging. We had double-digit organic growth in all 4 segments for revenue as well.
Next slide. If you look at the RF Technology, you can see that orders reached $217 million in the quarter, up 30% from the prior year and 18% organically. Our sales were $200 million, which was up 23% year-over-year and up more than 10% organically. Our gross margin expanded to 51.4%, which was up 170 basis points, and our operating margin was up 270 basis points. We finished the quarter with an EBITDA margin of 30.7%, which was up 450 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. So you see very strong EBITDA performance with our iTrade business contributing a substantial amount of noncash amortization to the EBITDA measure here.
In the first quarter of 2011, we had very strong tag sales for both Florida, Oklahoma and Dubai. In fact our Amtech business was up over 40%. A significant growth in our Gas Automated Meter Reading business with the Gaz de France project and quite substantial increase in the U.K., our Water Network Metering and Motoring business as those were up well in excess of 40% as well. And in CBORD, we had an expanded subscriber base. We won in another major University of Miami, university in Ohio, a big security win there, displacing a longtime occupant in that role.
In Q2, what we'd see is that the Gaz de France AMR project ought to continue at similar levels to Q1. We'll have a very strong seasonal Q2 because CBORD winds up with their annual renewals following into the second quarter, so we should see a double-digit growth there. 
Our Houston METRO project appears to be on schedule, and we ought to see what we have in our forecast for the second quarter. And iTrade has won a very, very significant opportunity to launch a system for a major European food retailer that we can't yet announce, but the launch is underway and the integration will begin within the year.
It's very encouraging for us to see the direction at RF Technology because last year in 2010's first quarter, our organic revenue was down 12%, the second quarter was down 7%, third quarter was down 1%, the fourth quarter was up 6%. So we're out of the gate here with more than a 10% organic gain here in the first quarter, and we expect the balance of the year is going to give us double-digit growth throughout the next 3 quarters.  Q2 a little lighter, Q3 much stronger and Q4 similar to this quarter.
Next slide. In Industrial Technology, just absolutely spectacular performance here. Our orders were up 30% to $201 million. Of course, that's all organic. Our sales were up 26%, aided by about 60 basis points of FX, so you could round organic down to 25%. Gross margins were at 50.4%, so they've continued to expand, and their operating margin was up 370 basis points to 27.2%. EBITDA in Industrial Technology finished the quarter at 30.6%. 
Virtually, everyone there had a very strong quarter. Our Fluid Handling businesses that deal with gas and exploration with the new products we've launched in the last year and half just are having extraordinary performance. These businesses are nearly up 50%. The Material Testing business we have as we can to get better capacity utilization around the country is growing very rapidly. 
And we actually had double-digit growth in our U.S. business in Neptune and then still more growth as a result of Canada continuing to shift in the Mexico City order we announced in the fourth quarter. So Neptune had a very strong Q1, and we expect that to continue.
In Q2, the backlog at our Fluid Handling businesses that are offering Cornell Pump will assure double-digit growth in the second quarter. The Toronto project installation phase is going to actually ramp up in Q2, although because there's a lot of labor in that it comes in at the expected lower margins that we have there. 
End markets remain very strong always in all these Industrial categories, and the operating leverage that we get is continuing to drive margin performance. You can really see just how effective we are when you look at the spot price for copper. In the first quarter last year, it was $3.55. Spot price this year is $4.30 and yet our margins expanded across the board whether they're gross margins, operating margins or EBITDA margins.
Next slide. The Energy Systems & Control segment. It continues to perform well. Here, orders were up 16%, all organic. Sales up 23%. Gross margin expanded quite a bit from up 350 basis points to 54.1%. And the operating profit margin increased 450 basis point. You might remember we were somewhat disappointed in Q1 2010 where the operating margin got that corrected in the second quarter, and this shows the kind of firm, disciplined approach to what we needed to do after that first quarter of last year. And that certainly supports this 450 basis point improvement in OP. EBITDA margins here were about 26%. 
Again you can say exactly the same thing, the same words that apply to Industrial Technology: broad-based strength across all businesses and end markets. Everything here is really doing exceptionally well. Very dramatic growth in our Diesel Engine Surge Protection business. We almost called it explosive growth, but thought that might scare people. That business is up nearly 40% this year. Industrial end market growth continues to drive our Sensors business as capacity utilization back in the latex or rubber industry looks very good and then equipment sales to measure the output of those things were up sharply. And all of our Energy Lab Equipment businesses are doing okay as we've finally got a little bit improvement in both refining and petrochem markets.
In the second quarter, the end market dynamics we think will continue to be strong. Our backlog is really quite substantial in our Compressor Control business, which will start to drive better Vs here in Q2 and particularly in the second half of the year. And the margin expansion we think will continue to be driven just by the operating leverage as sales increased throughout the year.
Next slide. Here's the Medical & Imaging segment. Orders were up 15%. Tiny bit of FX there, so organic it was 14%. Sales were up 12%. The gross margins here, 62.8%, up 330 basis points. And our OP was up to 24.1%. EBITDA in this segment is 29.1%, so EBITDA margins increased by 110 basis points. 
We've done quite a bit of investing in the first quarter in our Verathon business. We're launching 2 new products, one is called Velaport [ph] and that has had us incur some growth expense in Q1 and that will continue a little bit into Q2 as we launch all that collateral literature and the various programs and held a sales meeting in Q1 to kick that product off along with some other things we're doing as well. 
Medical remains a strong on consumables, double-digit growth in all these businesses in our kidney dialysis application for our Dosage Delivery Pump business continued to be a double-digit grower. Very significant order growth in our high-end imaging cameras and filtering technology. It was the growth star of the quarter as we look at the filters for electron microscopy being up very dramatically.
In the second quarter of 2011, we see Medical continuing to grow at double digits as we get continuing adoption rates for GlideScope and Velaport [ph]. Those new products have been launched within this year. And the Scientific Imaging has a really quite substantial backlog. They will support a strong Q2. 
The Japanese supply risks have proven to be less difficult than what we feared on certain high-end chips that are made very specifically for us. We've kind of dealt with all those issues and feel quite good about it. The only thing for Japan is that a substantial portion of our Camera business goes into the Japanese market. It represents a disproportionate share compared to the rest of Roper.  
Our total sales into Japan are in the neighborhood of 3% of revenues, so it's not something that's overly difficult for us that could depress revenue growth for the camera portion of the business in the next quarter or 2. But then that will just fill the backlog. It will be good news for us later.
Next slide. Here, as we look at the guidance, we're going to raise the guidance. 
Next slide. We were at $3.82 to $4.2. When we went into the year, we've raised the base by $0.15 and the top end by $0.10 to take us to $3.97 to $4.12. The midpoint of that is more than a 20% increase over last year's $3.34 on a GAAP basis. And in the second quarter, we're at $0.95 to $1, which is quite a sharp increase over last year's Q2 performance. 
Basically, the sales we expect to have, kind of mid-teens organic growth in the second quarter and the second half of the year. Probably in the kind of high single digit, 8% to 10% or 11%, so the full year will be double-digit organic growth. 
Just the next slide would be the -- well, we're still reaffirming that the cash flow would be in excess of $550 million, so that -- you can imagine the next 3 quarters will be quite substantial in terms of operating cash flow will generate.
In quarter 1 summary, the next slide. All-time record there in Q1 for order sales backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Gross margin demonstrated that we didn't have any difficulty with input costs at 54.3%. Operating margin is up 320 basis points to 22%. That's leverage of 37%, by the way, on the OP line. And our EBITDA margin is up 310 basis points to 27.4%. It gives us a leverage of 43%.  At 43% leverage, of course, benefits from iTrade with its amortization. 
Organic growth was 20% on orders and 16% on sales. The $851 million backlog -- boy, I can remember when our total sales for the year were $500 million. So being up 43% over the prior year gives us a flood of optimism for the rest. 
Most importantly, as everything really performed well. If you look around, you can only find 2 or 3 things, which are quite small in their scope that aren't really doing exceptionally well. So we raised our guidance up to $3.97 to $4.12 and certainly our position for another record year at Roper. 
And with that, let's open it up to questions, John."

So I mean the frothiness and lack of discipline around debt being applied to sales processes is pretty much back to the status it's ever been.

And it will take us a couple of years to do everything we're going to be able to do with them and lots to build that opportunity and then later analytic opportunity with that. So we're really excited about that. It's 1 of the things we're really hoping we'd able to bring into the wheelhouse. And we have -- we're making some growth investments in that because we have to increase our server space. We have to have specific things in Europe for these people to access. In terms of other opportunities within the Roper, we have opportunities both in freight matching and in CBORD around menu planning and nutrition information, which we continue to work on. We've had some -- they're not cross-selling, they're technology-sharing opportunities for applications. And we had important household names in the food industry. And just recently in Miami, Florida extensive program, and we're going to continue to do that throughout the year. So yes, I think we will see some -- I think most of the sales will accrete to iTrade, but some may accrete to other things within the ""software as a service"" platform we're building within RF."

It never happened. Isn't going to happen. And all you got to do is look at the other people in Q1 and look at us. So this is the best premier business in the world than what it does. I would say the markets are fairly mature, certainly held back dramatically by the lack of housing starts. My goodness, if we hadn't any housing starts, you'd think how much more organic growth we would get back in that business. It's just well positioned with the right sort of hybrid ability to deal with fixed network, so we're mobile in any form of integration and migration. There's another thing that's emerging that people haven't paid enough attention to and that is that we have the only U.S. lead-free water meter. Period. End of discussion.

Somebody is making lead-free and lead in the same factory in Mexico, I hardly think it would qualify as buying American lead-free-only water meter. So we're very proud of Neptune.

The adoption rates, particularly for GlideScope continues to be very strong, with a lot of product enhancements and other things that we're doing there to make it a more mobile, so more people are able to have access to that in a hospital setting. So continued product refinements or continuing the adoption rate on the GlideScope side. And then on the BladderScan side, continuing to take that core technology of the ultrasound and be able to make that applied in other areas. That's what we've done with AortaScan. That's what we're going to do with Velaport [ph] also in order to make it easier to basically have an IV needle inserted into someone's arm when the vein may be very difficult to find or difficult to see. So taking that same basic technology and making new products and new applications out of it is one of the things that Gerald and the team are just fabulous at being able to do out there at Verathon. And we continue to see lots of opportunities for that going forward. And in addition, don't forget we did acquire product line called Heartscape about this time last year, and we expect that to have some product introductions into the marketplace late in 2011, and that'll also add to growth in 2012.

They have a business, which is like CBORD which we feel we continue to gain share against them in that space. That for them may be viewed more as a legacy business. You'd have to ask them. That's their university business. And then they have their business, which is really education software that's -- had it not be involved with the university in the same traditional teaching setting we're familiar with. We have nothing to do with them in that space. That's the largest portion of their revenue. How profitable it is, is something you have to talk to them about. So there's a small group of competitors like CBORD and Blackboard that are driving what's happening from an adoption viewpoint with universities. We've got a, we think, the best offering in this space. So if Blackboard, in fact does transact, then someone else takes it over we wouldn't see that as anything other than what you said, which is validating the quality of the space. If you look at the kind of trading mobiles that Blackboard had even before this 35% premium jack-up, you get why sometimes we get frustrated about people thinking about us as a multi-industry company as opposed to a diversified growth company because so many of our assets today in the SaaS platform space are just [indiscernible] values are extraordinary compared to the multi-industry multiples. And we think people should focus on all of the assets we hold in that space. And secondary, as far as -- I mean, Sirit was basically unprofitable or bad trading dollar business in Canada. That was acquired by Federal Signal, so we do think of Misure it now. We think of it as Federal Signal, which is primarily business selling to different municipal aspects of stuff. Sirit is at kind of the low end of technology, certainly. And then if you go over to Kapsch, which is an Austrian company publicly traded, they bought the Mark IV assets out of that transaction around Mark 4 and bankruptcy and all those things that were tangential to that. We haven't seen any resurgence, of anything under Federal Signal, and we certainly haven't seen any resurgence of anything other than Mark IV as just continuing the sale of products in the E-ZPass. They don't win anything new. We have been winning business in California with platforms that one of those people used to be involved with. It's certainly doesn't -- it doesn't hurt us in anyway. We wind up with Canadians and the Austrians and once again we're the only American company. If people focus on the Buy American provisions, we'd be getting even more of the business that those businesses used to enjoy. It hasn't happened yet. But we do think people ought to focus on that. We have a wide range of technologies. We can do anything that those competitors can do at the bottom end or the high end, so we're kind of one-stop shop. I don't see that really changing."

They're -- and we've done a very deep dive in looking at how much of our spending on the water meter side is really related to municipalities versus related to the other facilities that are funded in different ways. We're actually much more optimistic about what's happening in how we distribution and go-to-market and create revenue. We wouldn't have any good to say about municipal spending or state spending. But the DOTs and the people we work with in those arenas are really outside of that list because everything we do in this space is revenue generation. It's not -- we don't need a budget or a muni bond to fund the activity that is going to happen with us. So the growth that we've got in Q1 and we expect throughout the year is certainly ahead of our fears, which is really part of the reason we're willing to raise guidance as much as we did."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.

We'll take you first through the Q1 financial results in detail, and then we'll look at the segment performance and the outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and take your questions.
First slide here is the financial results. You can see we achieved a record, all-time record for Q1, in orders and sales backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and pretty much every other measurement you can imagine. The thing that was particularly gratifying was our book-to-bill ratio was 109%. Generally, we're at the sort of 97% to 103%, so to be at 109% is very encouraging for the remainder of the year. 
Organic growth was really quite spectacular, we thought, with 20% order growth. And all 4 of the segments had double-digit order growth and revenue growth, which you can see organically was 16%.
Gross margins increased to 54.3%, so any fear of input costs creating any difficulty at Roper was not well founded. EBITDA margins are up 310 basis points to 27.4%. Remember with us that's mostly EBITA. There's not much depreciation here. 
Our balance sheet was enhanced as we continued to pay down our revolver, and we ended the quarter with an all-time record backlog of $851 million in revenue, which is 43% higher than the backlog at the end of the first quarter of last year, up $257 million. Now we certainly, when we established our guidance for Q1, thought we would have a strong start, but this is even better than our best expectations.
Next slide. Our income statement. Here you could see the bookings at $702 million, up 24% in total and 20% organically. Net sales of $645 million, up 21% in total and 16% organically. Our gross profit went from 52.3% the first quarter of last year to 54.3% here, an increase of 200 basis points. 
Our operating income was up 41%, that went from 18.8% last year to 22% this year, so that's really quite outstanding leverage. In fact, we'll talk a little bit more about our leverage on the variable contribution here for the revenue.
Our interest expense was basically flat. The tax rate was also quite similar to the prior year and that produced net earnings, up 49% to $89 million from $59.7 million last year and a diluted earnings per share number of $0.91 versus the $0.62 GAAP number from the prior year.
On the next slide. On the asset velocity, while the absolute amount -- the dollar amount of inventory receivable was up a little bit, as a function of the revenue it continues to decline. You'll see in the first quarter our inventory was 7.7% of revenue, down from 8.2%. In the prior year, our receivables were down to 16%, a pickup of 50 basis points from the 16.5% the prior year. And our payables and accruals or liabilities there actually increased to 16.1% from 15.8%. So when we total it, at the end of last year, we were 8.9% of sales, and this year it's down 130 basis points to 7.6% of revenues. So year-over-year, we see continued improvement in our asset velocity.
Next slide. We ended the quarter with a really strong balance sheet. Cash was $261 million. We paid down the revolver, so there's quite a bit of the revolver left. When you take the revolver and the cash together, we wind up with $813 million of available liquidity. And of course, we'll have very strong cash in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year. 
Our net debt is down to $980 million, and you can see that gives us a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a trailing basis of only 1.4x, and our EBITDA will continue to expand rapidly throughout the year on a trailing basis. Our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is already at 10.2x. So these ratios are extremely strong and they really enhance our liquidity and our ability to use the balance sheet in the quarters ahead.
Next slide. Here we're going to look at the individual segment performance and the outlook. 
Next slide. Order strength, as you can see, was really spectacular. Industrial Technology was up 30%, RF Technology was up 30%, Energy Systems & Controls 16% and Medical & Scientific up 15%. The book-to-bill ratios were very strong all the way across, anywhere from 118% in Industrial down to 103% in Medical & Imaging. We had double-digit organic growth in all 4 segments for revenue as well.
Next slide. If you look at RF Technology, you can see that orders reached $217 million in the quarter, up 30% from the prior year and 18% organically. Our sales were $200 million, which was up 23% year-over-year and up more than 10% organically. Our gross margin expanded to 51.4%, which was up 170 basis points, and our operating margin was up 270 basis points. We finished the quarter with an EBITDA margin of 30.7%, which was up 450 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. So you see very strong EBITDA performance with our iTrade business contributing a substantial amount of noncash amortization to the EBITDA measure here.
In the first quarter of 2011, we had very strong tag sales for both Florida, Oklahoma and Dubai. In fact our Amtech business was up over 40%. A significant growth in our Gas Automated Meter Reading business with the Gaz de France project and quite substantial increase in the U.K., our Water Network Metering and Monitoring business as those were up well in excess of 40% as well. And in CBORD, we had an expanded subscriber base. We won in another major university in Miami, a university in Ohio, a big security win there, displacing a longtime occupant in that role.
In Q2, what we'd see is that the Gaz de France AMR project ought to continue at similar levels to Q1. We'll have a very strong seasonal Q2 because CBORD winds up with their annual renewals following into the second quarter, so we should see double-digit growth there. 
Our Houston METRO project appears to be on schedule, and we ought to see what we have in our forecast for the second quarter. And iTrade has won a very, very significant opportunity to launch a system for a major European food retailer that we can't yet announce, but the launch is underway and the integration will begin within the year.
It's very encouraging for us to see the direction at RF Technology because last year in 2010's first quarter, our organic revenue was down 12%, the second quarter it was down 7%, third quarter it was down 1%, the fourth quarter it was up 6%. So we're out of the gate here with more than a 10% organic gain here in the first quarter, and we expect the balance of the year is going to give us double-digit growth throughout the next 3 quarters. Q2 a little lighter, Q3 much stronger and Q4 similar to this quarter.
Next slide. In Industrial Technology, just absolutely spectacular performance here. Our orders were up 30% to $201 million. Of course, that's all organic. Our sales were up 26%, aided by about 60 basis points of FX, so you could round organic down to 25%. Gross margins were at 50.4%, so they've continued to expand, and their operating margin was up 370 basis points to 27.2%. EBITDA in Industrial Technology finished the quarter at 30.6%. 
Virtually, everyone there had a very strong quarter. Our Fluid Handling businesses that deal with gas and exploration with the new products we've launched in the last year and half just are having extraordinary performance. These businesses are nearly up 50%. The Material Testing business we have as we can to get better capacity utilization around the country is growing very rapidly. 
And we actually had double-digit growth in our U.S. business in Neptune and then still more growth as a result of Canada continuing to ship in the Mexico City order we announced in the fourth quarter. So Neptune had a very strong Q1, and we expect that to continue.
In Q2, the backlog at our Fluid Handling businesses that are offering Cornell Pump will assure double-digit growth in the second quarter. The Toronto project installation phase is going to actually ramp up in Q2, although because there's a lot of labor in that it comes in at the expected lower margins that we have there. 
End markets remain very strong in all these Industrial categories, and the operating leverage that we get is continuing to drive margin performance. You can really see just how effective we are when you look at the spot price for copper. In the first quarter last year, it was $3.55. Spot price this year is $4.30 and yet our margins expanded across the board whether they're gross margins, operating margins or EBITDA margins.
Next slide. The Energy Systems & Control segment. It continues to perform well. Here, orders were up 16%, all organic. Sales up 23%. Gross margin expanded quite a bit from up 350 basis points to 54.1%. And the operating profit margin increased 450 basis point. You might remember we were somewhat disappointed in Q1 2010 with the operating margin. Got that corrected in the second quarter, and this shows the kind of firm, disciplined approach to what we needed to do after that first quarter of last year. And that certainly supports this 450 basis point improvement in OP. EBITDA margins here were about 26%. 
Again you can say exactly the same thing, the same words that apply to Industrial Technology: broad-based strength across all businesses and end markets. Everything here is really doing exceptionally well. Very dramatic growth in our Diesel Engine Surge Protection business. We almost called it explosive growth, but thought that might scare people. That business is up nearly 40% this year. Industrial end market growth continues to drive our Sensors business as capacity utilization back in the latex and rubber industry looks very good and then equipment sales to measure the output of those things were up sharply. And all of our Energy Lab Equipment businesses are doing okay as we've finally got a little bit improvement in both refining and petrochem markets.
In the second quarter, the end market dynamics we think will continue to be strong. Our backlog is really quite substantial in our Compressor Control business, which will start to drive better Vs here in Q2 and particularly in the second half of the year. And the margin expansion we think will continue to be driven just by the operating leverage as sales increase throughout the year.
Next slide. Here's the Medical & Imaging segment. Orders were up 15%. Tiny bit of FX there, so organic it was 14%. Sales were up 12%. The gross margins here, 62.8%, up 330 basis points. And our OP was up to 24.1%. EBITDA in this segment is 29.1%, so EBITDA margins increased by 110 basis points. 
We've done quite a bit of investing in the first quarter in our Verathon business. We're launching 2 new products, 1 is called Velaport [ph] and that has had us incur some growth expense in Q1 and that will continue a little bit into Q2 as we launch all that collateral literature and the various programs and held a sales meeting in Q1 to kick that product off along with some other things we're doing as well. 
Medical remains strong on consumables, double-digit growth in all these businesses in our kidney dialysis application for our Dosage Delivery Pump business continued to be a double-digit grower. Very significant order growth in our high-end imaging cameras and filtering technology. It was the growth star of the quarter as we looked at the filters for electron microscopy being up very dramatically.
In the second quarter of 2011, we see Medical continuing to grow at double digits as we get continuing adoption rates for GlideScope and Velaport [ph]. No new products have been launched within this year. And the Scientific Imaging has a really quite substantial backlog that will support a strong Q2. 
The Japanese supply risks have proven to be less difficult than what we feared on certain high-end chips that are made very specifically for us. We've kind of dealt with all those issues and feel quite good about it. The only thing for Japan is that a substantial portion of our Camera business goes into the Japanese market. It represents a disproportionate share compared to the rest of Roper.  
Our total sales into Japan are in the neighborhood of 3% of revenues, so it's not something that's overly difficult for us that could depress revenue growth for the camera portion of the business in the next quarter or 2. But then that will just fill the backlog. It will be good news for us later.
Next slide. Here, as we look at the guidance, we're going to raise the guidance. 
Next slide. We were at $3.82 to $4.02 when we went into the year. We've raised the base by $0.15 and the top end by $0.10 to take us to $3.97 to $4.12. The midpoint of that is more than a 20% increase over last year's $3.34 on a GAAP basis. And in the second quarter, we're at $0.95 to $1.00, which is quite a sharp increase over last year's Q2 performance. 
Basically, the sales we expect to have, kind of mid-teens organic growth in the second quarter and the second half of the year. Probably in the kind of high single digit, 8% to 10% or 11%, so the full year will be double-digit organic growth. 
I guess the next slide would be the -- well, we're still reaffirming that cash flow would be in excess of $550 million, so that -- you can imagine the next 3 quarters will be quite substantial in terms of operating cash flow will generate.
In quarter 1 summary, the next slide. All-time record there in Q1 for order sales backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Gross margin demonstrated that we didn't have any difficulty with input costs at 54.3%. Operating margin is up 320 basis points to 22%. That's leverage of 37%, by the way, on the OP line. And our EBITDA margin is up 310 basis points to 27.4%. It gives us a leverage of 43%.  At 43% leverage, of course, benefits from iTrade with its amortization. 
Organic growth was 20% on orders and 16% on sales. The $851 million backlog -- boy, I can remember when our total sales for the year were $500 million. So being up 43% over the prior year gives us a flood of optimism for the rest. 
Most importantly, is everything really performed well. If you look around, you can only find 2 or 3 things, which are quite small in their scope that aren't really doing exceptionally well. So we raised our guidance up to $3.97 to $4.12 and certainly our position for another record year at Roper. 
And with that, let's open it up to questions, John."

In the same venue, somebody called me last night from Europe about a transaction that people think we should be interested in, which we never would be, but bragging that they were going to get a debt staple of 6 3/4 on this transaction. So I mean the frothiness and lack of discipline around debt being applied to sales processes is pretty much back to the status it's ever been. So you do want to be careful about what it is you're doing. But we have more than enough really outstanding opportunity to execute over the next 12 months. So we're very encouraged.

And it will take us a couple of years to do everything we're going to be able to do with them and a lot to build that opportunity and then later analytic opportunity with that. So we're really excited about that. It's 1 of the things we were really hoping we'd able to bring into the wheelhouse. And we have -- we're making some growth investments in that because we have to increase our server space. We have to have specific things in Europe for these people to access. In terms of other opportunities within Roper, we have opportunities both in freight matching and in CBORD around menu planning and nutrition information, which we continue to work on. We've had some -- they're not cross-selling, they're technology-sharing opportunities for applications. And we've had important household names in the food industry. And just recently in Miami, Florida extensive program, and we're going to continue to do that throughout the year. So yes, I think we will see some -- I think most of the sales will accrete to iTrade, but some may accrete to other things within the ""software as a service"" platform we're building within RF."

I would say the markets are fairly mature, certainly held back dramatically by the lack of housing starts. My goodness, if we had any housing starts, you'd think how much more organic growth we would get back in that business. It's just well positioned with the right sort of hybrid ability to deal with fixed network, so we're mobile in any form of integration and migration. There's another thing that's emerging that people haven't paid enough attention to and that is that we have the only U.S. lead-free water meter. Period. End of discussion. If anybody ever reinforces buy American or says I want lead-free water meters, which is a mandated requirement in the coming years, we're the sole sourceability to do that. Somebody is making lead-free and lead in the same factory in Mexico, I hardly think it would qualify as buying American lead-free-only water meter. So we're very proud of Neptune. It's a wonderful management team. They're very dedicated. They're working a lot on forward technologies. And you know, we may make further investments in that space to help them."

They have a business, which is like CBORD which we feel we continue to gain share against them in that space. That for them may be viewed more as a legacy business. You'd have to ask them. That's their university business. And then they have their business, which is really education software that's -- had it not be involved with the university in the same traditional teaching setting we're familiar with. We have nothing to do with them in that space. That's the largest portion of their revenue. How profitable it is, is something you'd have to talk to them about. So there's a small group of competitors like CBORD and Blackboard that are driving what's happening from an adoption viewpoint with universities. We've got a, we think, the best offering in the space. So if Blackboard in fact does transact then someone else takes it over, we wouldn't see that as anything other than what you said, which is validating the quality of the space. If you look at the kind of trading mobiles that Blackboard had even before this 35% premium jack-up, you get why sometimes we get frustrated about people thinking about us as a multi-industry company as opposed to a diversified growth company because so many of our assets today in the SaaS platform space are just undervalues [ph] are extraordinary compared to the multi-industry multiples. And we think people should focus on the quality of the assets we hold in that space. And secondary, as far as -- I mean, Sirit was a basically unprofitable or bad trading dollar business in Canada. That was acquired by Federal Signal, so we don't think of it as Sirit now. We think of it as Federal Signal, which is primarily a business selling the different municipal aspects of stuff. Sirit is kind of at the low end of technology, certainly. And then if you go over to Kapsch, which is an Austrian company publicly traded, they bought the Mark IV assets out of that transaction around Mark IV and bankruptcy and all those things that were tangential to that. We haven't seen any resurgence of anything under Federal Signal, and we certainly haven't seen any resurgence of anything other than Mark IV as just continuing the sale of product and the E-ZPass. They don't win anything new. We have been winning business in California with platforms that 1 of those people used to be involved with. It certainly doesn't -- it doesn't hurt us in anyway. We wind up with Canadians and the Austrians and once again we're the only American company. If people focused on the buy American provisions, we'd be getting even more of the business that those businesses used to enjoy. It hasn't happened yet. But we do think people ought to focus on that. We have a wide range of technologies. We can do anything that those competitors can do at the bottom end or the high end, so we're kind of a one-stop shop. I don't see that really changing."

We'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and its implications for the future and take your questions.
Next slide. The key chief financial results here are really spectacular quarter for us. We achieved a series of all-time company historical results around orders and sales and backlog and operating cash flow and then in the quarter, our net earnings EBITDA and free cash flow were outstanding. Total sales for the quarter were up 23% and 16% of that was organic. We enjoyed again double-digit sales growth in each one of the 4 segments, which frankly was a little bit better than we expected going into the quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio is still above one for the eighth straight quarter, so that's resulting in continuing backlog. We've got record backlog at the end of the second quarter of $872 million, which is up $230 million from last year's second quarter.
Gross margins were very sold in the quarter, they hit 53.9%. And our EBITDA margins, when you exclude this remeasurement gain, which is a required to be included here on a GAAP basis but we've excluded it for looking at our leverage. So the EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 28.5%, without that remeasurement gain, of course, [indiscernible] the margin will even be better. NDI's acquisition was completed in the quarter that's off to a good start we've already begun the financial integration and had some marketplace meetings with our various people in medical and look actually at some other acquisitions in that area with them. And then we were pleased to see the Moody's upgrade that we received in the quarter on all of our debt that structure to be AA, too. 
Next slide. On the income statement, there's just not much to say about this, except we achieved another amazing great quarter. Bookings, you can see book-to-bill of $708 million it's 1.01 eight straight quarter. Net sales were $700 million in the quarter, first time we've done that, 23% increase, gross profit up 70 basis point, operating income was up 240 basis points from 21%. Second quarter of last year to 23.4% here. Our interest rate expense was flat. Tax rate in the quarter was actually headwind for us. We came in at 31.4% Q2 this year versus 29.6% last year and that caused us a couple of pennies. Net earnings again, that's [indiscernible] to show the net earnings number without the foreign currency remeasurement gain in the quarter was up 43% and diluted earnings per share was $1.03 versus 70% on a GAAP basis had to be reported at $1.08.
Next slide. The free cash flow in Q2 got back to where we expect with like to be. Terrific results, 21% of sales. Free cash flow was up 41% over the same quarter a year ago with a move up from $103 million to $145 million.
Next slide. If you look at the asset velocity performance in the quarter it's one of the things I know everybody's very happy with inside the company despite having a 23% gain in revenue, actually inventories as a function of revenue improved by 10 basis points. So inventory last year was 7.6% of sales. Here we are up 23% and inventory has dropped to 7.5% of sales. So we're very pleased with our results. Payables about 5.5% with inventory at 7.5% we're not having to invest very much to continue to maintain our growth which is great news.
Next slide. If we look at the balance sheet of the company, we can honestly say the balance sheet has never been in better shape. We ended the quarter with $196 million in cash and that's after acquiring Northern Digital for $200 million by the way. Our available liquidity, including the [indiscernible] revolver at the end of quarter was $753 million but it will continue to move up here as we add cash rapidly now. That gives a net debt of $1,050,000,000. And our net-debt-to-net-cap, you can see as 26%. We reported here debt-to-EBITDA, meaning gross debt-to-EBITDA because not all of that $196 million immediately available without repatriation. So the gross debt-to-EBITDA number is 1.7x. If you look at the net debt, which includes all the cash it drops that ratio to 1.4. Our interest expense coverage is about 11x and despite investing $725 million in the last 12 months we're really in wonderful shape going forward and by the way our trailing EBITDA now on a 12-month basis is up to $739 million. So as the trailing EBITDA grows rapidly, if you look at the debt situation being held constant the balance sheet gets better and better.
Next slide. Now we want to take a look at the individual performance of the 4 segments and what we think they'll look like in the second half. Next slide. Here we're looking at the sort of consolidated segment-by-segment approach on gross margins and EBITDA in the quarter. Everybody at 50% or higher. The Industrial EBITDA margin is again are just breathtaking at 31%. Just terrific results in the water, including handling portion of our Industrial business as we'll talk more about.
Next slide. We start with RF Technology with the largest portion of reported sales in the quarter at 31% of revenue. You can see orders for RF were up 13%, sales were up 26% and operating margin was up 410 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter for RF by the way was 31% as we have a good deal of amortization in RF.
The second quarter, we wound with organic sales of 13%. We had particularly strong growth in the U.K. with our water network monitoring products from [indiscernible] and continued growth in gas fronts installation projects with catalog in France. We had very strong double-digit sales increases out at CBORD which was driven by deployments of business we won earlier out of college and university environments and that portion of the business is continuing to do really quite well, despite what some people might think.
Very strong North American tag sales for transport throughout the second quarter and then if we look to the second half of the year, we're going to have continued growth in both Toll & Traffic operations with more tags shipments out of transport but also several traffic projects that we're putting in, in the United States. And then we have significant expansion of electronic tolling in Puerto Rico where we're going to be converting from coin-operated technologies to electronic collection.
CBORD's backlog is very strong, so it's assuring ourselves a double-digit growth throughout the rest of the staff the year and very strong Q3 cash. And iTrade is continuing to do well. We've been encouraging them and investing in them to focus really on their core business on a global basis and that is going well, although we had to continue to beef up the nimbleness of our operations in Europe which we're doing.
Next slide. In Industrial Technology, you can see we had again spectacular performance, orders were up 15%, sales up 26%, operating margin increased 160 basis points to 28.2%, EBITDA was 31% for them as well. We had exceptional growth in all of our pump and water Fluid Handling businesses, largely driven by oil and gas and irrigation projects. Our materials are used in all the shale activity that you see and we're doing a lot of dewatering and we're doing a lot of drilling support mechanisms for those projects. We had very strong demands for our material test business in Denmark and then we had double-digit growth again at Neptune, which was kind I wouldn't say a surprise, but it was pleasant to see because all of the indicators around those businesses would be less than exciting.
The next generation residential water meter that we develop at Neptune that some people have seen are and has been introduced and it's beginning to ship, it does lower material content than our previous water meter for residential applications and it's a very easy product to install and incorporate our reading technology. Neptune already meets the 2014 federal lead-free standard associated with the Safe Water Drinking Act. I think this is something that is not talked about enough in the marketplace around just how important and critical that will be. And we will encourage our investors to go online on YouTube, you'll see at [indiscernible]. You'll see a 4 to 4.5 minute think we put together basically for municipalities to help them try to understand what's going on and while there was this one standard now there is better standard that has to be lead-free. Neptune is the only really producer of lead-free water meters here in the United States. A significant development for us it's not something we've been working on throughout the last 10 years and we're going to get wide market acceptance going forward.
In the second half of the year, we expect Neptune's momentum to continue which we would think we would at least as well as the revenue the half of the year as we did in the first half, even though in the third quarter for Neptune we have extremely difficult comp because last year we had a blowout there were about third quarter.
Our order trends and backlog continue to support all of our Fluid Handling businesses. The weather [indiscernible] and Cornell and [indiscernible] or any of these are all doing spectacularly well. New product introductions and strong Q4 seasonality we think we'll continue to drive our [indiscernible] large [indiscernible] businesses also in the fourth quarter.
Next slide. When we look at the Energy Systems & Controls business, here you can see orders up 19%, sales up 22%. The operating margin here was 25.9%, which is up 150 basis points. EBITDA came in at the quarter at 29%. In the quarter, virtually all of our end markets were very strong. The diesel engine safety systems that we continue to advertise and push into the marketplace have had continuing growth and their adoption rate with the diesel engine manufacturers. They're going to reach record levels here in the third quarter coming up. The refining and petrochem market is doing much better for us again, instruments sales have taken off. And as then when we look at the sort of global industrial production and capacity utilization around the latex entire manufacturing and analytics that we do in the rubber industry, those are all doing exceptionally well and perhaps most importantly, we haven't seen any signs of any slow down in that business, which along with material test, have been kind of 2 leading indicators for us about if there's any softness anywhere. They both continue to grow.
In the second half of 2011, we've got a very strong backlog in energy, which assures our Q3 growth and all the indicators which suggest that seasonally strong Q4 which is usually our best quarter in that segment. The control systems business activity is certainly should drive our second half record performance here. That activity and backlog has grown at a very fast days and shipments ought to start to manifest themselves here in the second half. And we expect continued margin expansion with great leverage throughout the segment in the second half of the year.
Next slide. The Medical & Scientific Imaging segment, you can see was up 11% on orders and up 18% on revenue. Operating margin was up 180 basis points to 23.4%. There's quite a bit of noncash amortization here, so EBITDA was 29%. If you look at the medical in the second quarter, pretty much across the line performed very well. We've got faster adoption rates again in Bladderscan and GlideScope, we think GlideScope is intervention and product Bladderscan is the product that helps avoid [indiscernible] in the hospital and that is the can of again this year. Very strong ultrasound consumables sales for [indiscernible]. In Northern Digital, we completed the acquisition in the quarter. We'll talk a lot more about that in a second. And then our high-end products that we're driving for [indiscernible] that's really around our filters up for proprietary technology for [indiscernible], are performing as well.
In the second half of the year, if we look at the backlog that we go into, again, we're kind of assured a very strong second half. We don't have to rely much on book and ship here. Continued strength throughout the medical platform. We've got the product introductions that Verathon has been working on with Velaport [indiscernible] and other products are basically on trend where we want them to be for our 2012 launches. We take those products will carry our growth soundly into next year. And in Northern Digital will have income growth in the second half of the year it's a pretty and our nominee maybe $0.01 in Q3 and then stronger in Q4 with $0.03 or so. That acquisition we thought we can kind of introduced the product to you since we have the chance today and so the next slide here is really detailed explanation about what Northern Digital does and I've asked John to explain that to you."

Thanks, Brian. Northern Digital acquisition that really adds to our growing medical platform using both Sensors as well as cameras as leading provider for both optical and electromagnetic tracking systems and then minimally invasive surgery, where you really had to have very precise application of treatment in a nonline of sight situation. You really need to know exactly where the treatment is being applied. And Northern Digital provides the technology and the systems that allow the doctor to be able to do that and this is really going into a part of the medical market that is growing very quickly around the image-guided and minimally invasive surgery and it really has a couple of different parts to it you can see it's about 90% medical and it's about 50% systems and 40% consumables. The consumables are the spears, these very hiGh-tech optical spheres that really provide the 3D location information back to the doctor. It's a unique technologies it has [indiscernible] business model as all of our acquisitions do. Really comes with a very strong and experienced management team led by Jimmy Frazier and it once again a very nice addition to our growing medical platform and really in the image-guided part of our medical platform. You'll hear us talk about ultrasound applications with Verathon ultrasound type of applications with Cisco. This is another situation where the image-guided surgery is building on that ultrasound technology. So it's a very nice addition for us. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk about the new guidance for the year."

So we think that's quite good performance around the guidance going forward given the strength of last third quarter.
Next slide. If we look at how Q2 shapes up in terms of the summary, we wound up with all-time historical quarter performance for any quarter in our history, even better than the fourth quarter last year for order sales, backlog and operating cash flow. The very broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise we have a number of small niche P&L's and all a, so of the more of. Total sales grew to 23%, the gross margin up 70 basis point. Operating margin where you can really see the leverage was up 240 basis point so on an incremental operating margin against the incremental sales, our leverage the quarter was 34%. EBITDA because of the noncash amortization that hits [indiscernible] margin, EBITDA was higher at 280 basis points to 28.5% and that excludes the remeasurement gain of course we kept that in there under GAAP with even higher leverage. So the leverage on EBITDA was 40% of the new revenue.
Record backlog ended the quarter at $872 million. We raised the guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 and I think most importantly, when you see what's happening here is that our niche business focus continues to deliver this outstanding results when so many people concentrate what are you going to do about at the BRICS? What are you doing about that? What are you doing Chenard? Our sales BRICS was about 5% of revenue in the second quarter this year and they were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter last year, maybe a little less. So that's helpful but that's not what's absolutely required for us to continue to grow. It was just another terrific quarter and will position of course for a record year. 
And with that, think we can open up to Q&A."

In the pump businesses, we generally have enough pricing power that if we got cost push inflation on materials side that we can pass that through and not market up, it's almost just as separate side for things are. Surpassed it doesn't really hurt us in any event. I think we continue to get leverage as revenue goes up so on the OP line you can see we've got 30% leverage in the quarter and in both industrial and energy, we don't have very much noncash amortization that's coming off of those.

So I think we're doing a great job in that arena. And as a result of there kind of customer, they don't lend themselves to a forced synergies from a physical asset basis. So our pump, we great recent pump this company went you can't put those factors together they fundamentally 2 different kinds of things. In the network arena, that's actually not true. I mean it's very ironic but in fact they're doing a lot of data storage, they've got a lot of things that are really quite similar in the backend of an enterprise that you can you believe that a lot of the synergies around. So absolutely positive to get cost synergies out of software is service business that we can get out of the Industrial businesses. So that makes them pretty attractive and as long as these small network opportunities are available, we think it's an attractive place to invest. Now we're not trying to turn Roper into a single-use software network application company. So we believe our focus around that has been opportunistic. They generate more cash than the other businesses do and they require less assets and they virtually never have anything that depreciates and their assets go home at night and as long as you're motivate them, they've got wonderful cash and cash return over the long period of time. Today, John, I don't know if you provided much guidance around the overall revenue, but that it's getting to be certainly a very significant portion of the RF business at some point you're in a split so that you see tolling business completely separate from all the rest of the RF business. That's something I expect we would probably do for 2012 so it's easier for everybody to see the variance in the 2 because you do have this terribly lumpy TransCore order input situation that's up terrifically in Q1 and down a little bit in Q2 but over the first half the year it's double-digit growth but it certainly makes it confusing.

Some of the other public companies have that are publicly traded have reported degradation and numbers.

But I think we are we are encouraged we have to be more certain the future because we've got clearly superior length the technology to the people. Again backlog front that's that certainly games share but it's like a turn key thing and then you fill it out right. It's doing fine. On CBORD, it's certainly I believe most people would agree with us gain share, gained expenses their people with universities taken over used to be covered by different folks. So it's definitely gaining share. I think it's so focused rather than being somebody that in a diverse area a. I think were really proud of the team we have been customer obviously they have any follow-up they have with their customers and the ability to do things integrated online. I think they will continue to gain share and I think is the same with Horizon now the Horizon activities very better than we would have hoped for given the difficulty with educational spending. I think if you ever gotten any relief in the K-12 arena which you may or may not get, if you get it is probably because of the attrition was a lot of build out where we see new platform of what happens in K-12 education around data-gathering and we have a number of software development that we are putting in place around school it can manage its kind of inflow of cash from families take class program how we run 2 new avenues and they're working hard on that now."

Let me start here with the Slide 3 on my deck. We'll go through the second quarter financial results for the enterprise as a whole and then we'll dissect how the segments performed and what the outlook appears for each of the segment in the second half of the year. We'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and its implications for the future and take your questions.
Next slide. The Q2 financial results here are really a spectacular quarter for us. We achieved a series of all-time company historical results around orders and sales and backlog and operating cash flow. And then in the quarter, our net earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow were outstanding. 
Total sales for the quarter were up 23% and 16% of that was organic. We enjoyed again double-digit sales growth in each one of the 4 segments, which frankly was a little bit better than we expected going into the quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio is still above 1 for the eighth straight quarter, so that's resulting in continuing backlog. We've got record backlog at the end of the second quarter of $872 million, which is up $230 million from last year's second quarter.
Gross margins were very solid in the quarter. They hit 53.9%. And our EBITDA margins, when you exclude this remeasurement gain, which is required to be included here on a GAAP basis, but we've excluded it for looking at our leverage. So the EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 28.5%. Without that remeasurement gain, of course, if we left it, the margin will even be better. 
NDI's acquisition was completed in the quarter that's off to a good start. We've already begun the financial integration and had some marketplace meetings with our various people in medical and look actually at some other acquisitions in that area with them. And then we were pleased to see the Moody's upgrade that we received in the quarter on all of our debt structure to be AA, too. 
Next slide. On the income statement, there's just not much to say about this, except we achieved another amazingly great quarter. Bookings, you can see book-to-bill at $708 million, it's 1.01 up, our eighth straight quarter. Net sales were $700 million in the quarter. First time we've done that. 23% increase. Gross profit up 70 basis points. Operating income was up 240 basis points from 21%. Second quarter of last year to 23.4% here. Our interest expense was flat. Tax rate in the quarter was actually headwind for us. We came in at 31.4% in Q2 this year versus 29.6% last year and that caused us a couple of pennies. Net earnings again, that's asterisked to show the net earnings number without the foreign currency remeasurement gain in the quarter. It was up 43%. And diluted earnings per share, $1.03 versus $0.74. On a GAAP basis, it had to be reported at $1.08.
Next slide. The free cash flow in Q2 got back to where we expect it -- we'd like to be. We had terrific, terrific results, 21% of sales. Free cash flow was up 41% over the same quarter a year ago with a move up from $103 million to $145 million.
Next slide. If you look at the asset velocity performance in the quarter, it's one of the things I know everybody's very happy with inside the company. Despite having a 23% gain in revenue, actually inventory as a function of revenue improved by 10 basis points. So inventory last year was 7.6% of sales. Here, we are up 23% and inventory has dropped to 7.5% of sales. So we're very pleased with our results. Payable is about 5.5% with inventory at 7.5%. We're not having to invest very much to continue to maintain our growth, which is great news.
Next slide. If we look at the balance sheet of the company, we can honestly say the balance sheet's never been in better shape. We ended the quarter with $196 million in cash and that's after acquiring Northern Digital for $200 million, by the way. Our available liquidity, including the undrawn revolver at the end of quarter was $753 million, but it'll continue to move up here as we add cash rapidly now. That gives us a net debt of $1,050,000,000. And our net debt-to-net cap, you can see as 26%. We reported here debt-to-EBITDA, meaning gross debt-to-EBITDA because not all of that $196 million is immediately available without repatriation. So the gross debt-to-EBITDA number is 1.7x. If you look at the net debt, which includes all the cash, it drops that ratio to 1.4. Our EBITDA-to-interest expense coverage is about 11x. And despite investing $725 million in the last 12 months, we're really in  a wonderful shape going forward. And by the way, our trailing EBITDA now on a 12-month basis is up to $739 million. So as the trailing EBITDA grows rapidly, if you look at the debt situation being held constant, the balance sheet gets better and better.
Next slide. Now we want to take a look at the individual performance of the 4 segments and what we think they'll look like in the second half. Next slide. Here we're looking at the sort of consolidated segment-by-segment approach on gross margins and EBITDA in the quarter. Everybody at 50% or higher. The industrial EBITDA margins again are just breathtaking at 31%. Just terrific results in the quarter, including handling portion of our industrial businesses we'll talk more about.
Next slide. We start with RF Technology with the largest portion of reported sales in the quarter at 31% of revenue. You can see orders for RF were up 13%, sales were up 26% and operating margin was up 410 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter for RF, by the way, was 31% as we have a good deal of amortization in RF.
The second quarter, we wound up with organic sales of 13%. We had particularly strong growth in the U.K. with our water network monitoring products from Technolog and continued growth in gas fronts installation project with Technolog in France. We had very strong double-digit sales increases out of CBORD, which was driven by deployments business we won earlier out of college and university environments, and that portion of the business is continuing to do really quite well despite what some people might think.
Very strong North American tag sales for transport throughout the second quarter. And then if we look to the second half of the year, we're going to have continued growth in both toll and traffic operations with more tags shipments out of TransCore, but also several traffic projects that we're putting in, in the United States. And then we have a significant expansion of electronic tolling in Puerto Rico where we're going to be converting from coin-operated technologies to electronic collection.
CBORD's backlog is very strong, so it's assuring ourselves a double-digit growth throughout the rest of this half of the year and very strong Q3 cash. And iTrade is continuing to do well. We've been encouraging them and investing in them to focus really on their core business on a global basis and that is going well, although we have to continue to beef up the nimbleness of our operations in Europe, which we're doing.
Next slide. In industrial technology, you can see we had again a spectacular performance. Orders were up 15%, sales up 26%, operating margin increased 160 basis points to 28.2%. EBITDA was 31% for them as well. We had exceptional growth in all of our pump and water fluid handling businesses, largely driven by oil and gas and irrigation projects. Our materials are used in all the shale activity that you see and we're doing a lot of dewatering and we're doing a lot of drilling support mechanisms for those projects. We have very strong demands for our material test business in Denmark and then we had double-digit growth again at Neptune, which was kind of, I wouldn't say, a surprise but it was pleasant to see because all of the indicators around those businesses would be less than exciting.
The next generation residential water meter that we developed at Neptune that some people have seen has been introduced and it's beginning to ship. It has a lower raw material content than our previous water meter had for residential applications, and it's a very easy product to install and incorporate our reading technology. Neptune already meets the 2014 federal lead-free standard associated with the Safe Water Drinking Act. I think this is something that's not talked about enough in the marketplace around just how important and critical that'll be. And we would encourage our investors to go online on YouTube, you'll see at www.shedthelead.com\video\. You'll see a 4 to 4.5 minute thing we put together basically for municipalities to help them try to understand what's going on and while there was this one standard now, there's another standard that has to be lead free. Neptune is the only really producer of lead-free water meters here in the United States. Quite a significant development for us. It's something that we've been working on throughout the last 10 years and feel that it's going to get widespread market acceptance going forward.
In the second half of the year, we expect Neptune's momentum to continue, which we would think will do at least as well on revenue in the second half of the year there as we did in the first half, even though in the third quarter, for Neptune, we have extremely difficult comp because last year we had a blowout favorable third quarter.
Our order trends and backlog continue to support all of our fluid handling businesses. They -- whether it's Roper or Cornell or Abel or Hansen, any of these are all doing just spectacularly well. New product introductions and a strong Q4 seasonality, we think, will continue to drive or stir us into Logitech [indiscernible] businesses also in the fourth quarter.
Next slide. When we look at the energy systems and controls business, here you can see orders up 19%, sales up 22%. The operating margin here was 25.9%, which is up 150 basis points. EBITDA came into the quarter at 29%. In the quarter, virtually all of our end markets were very strong. The diesel engine safety systems that we continue to advertise and push into the marketplace have had continuing growth in their adoption rate with the diesel engine manufacturers. They're going to reach record levels here in this third quarter coming up. The refining and petrochem market is doing much better for us again. Instruments sales have taken off. And then when we look at the sort of global industrial production and capacity utilization around the latex and tire manufacturing and analytics that we do in the rubber industry, those all are doing exceptionally well. And perhaps most importantly, we haven't seen any sign of any slowdown in that business, which, along with material test, have been the kind of 2 leading indicators for us about if there's any softness anywhere. They both continue to grow.
In the second half of 2011, we've got a very strong backlog in energy, which assures our Q3 growth and all the indicators, which suggest that seasonally strong Q4 which is usually our best quarter in that segment. 
The control systems business activity certainly should drive our second half record performance here. That activity and backlog has grown at a very fast pace, and shipments ought to start to manifest themselves here in the second half. And we expect continued margin expansion with great leverage throughout this segment in the second half of the year.
Next slide. The medical and scientific imaging segment, you can see was up 11% on orders and up 18% on revenue. Operating margin was up 180 basis points to 23.4%. There's quite a bit of noncash amortization here, so EBITDA was 29%. If you look at the medical in the second quarter, pretty much across the line performed very well. We've got faster adoption rates again in Bladderscan and GlideScope. We think -- GlideScope is the intubation product. Bladderscan is the product that helps avoid catheterization in the hospital, and that has taken off again this year. Very strong ultrasound consumables sales for CIVCO. In Northern Digital, we completed that acquisition in the quarter. We'll talk a little bit more about that in a second. And then our high-end products that we're driving for photonics that are really around our filters up for Gatan and proprietary technology for Princeton are performing well as well.
In the second half of the year, if we look at the backlog that we go into, again we're kind of assured a very strong second half. We don't have to rely much on book and ship here. Continued strength throughout the medical platform. We've got the product introductions that Verathon has been working on with Velaport [ph], Heartscape and other products are basically on trend for where we want them to be for our 2012 launches. We think those products will carry our growth soundly into next year. 
In Northern Digital, we'll have a little bit of income growth in the second half of the year. It's accretive nominally, maybe $0.01 in Q3 and then stronger in Q4 with $0.03 or so. That acquisition we thought we kind of introduce the product to you since we have that chance today and so the next slide here is really a detailed explanation about what Northern Digital does and I've asked John to explain that to you."

Thanks, Brian. The Northern Digital acquisition that really adds to our growing medical platform using both sensors as well as cameras is the leading provider for both optical and electromagnetic tracking systems and in minimally invasive surgery where you really had to have very precise application of treatment in a nonline-of-sight situation. You really need to know exactly where the treatment is being applied. And Northern Digital provides the technology and the systems that allow the doctor to be able to do that. And this is really going into a part of the medical market that is growing very quickly around image-guided and minimally invasive surgery. And it really has a couple of different parts to it. You can see it's about 90% medical, and it's about 60% systems and 40% consumables. The consumables are the spheres, these very high-tech optical spheres that really provide the 3D location information back to the doctor. It's a unique and patented technology. It has asset light business model as all of our acquisitions do. Really comes with a very strong and experienced management team led by Jamie Frazier. And it's once again a very nice addition to our growing medical platform and really in the image-guided part of our medical platform. You'll hear us talk about ultrasound applications with Verathon, ultrasound type of applications with CIVCO. This is another situation where the image-guided surgery is building on that ultrasound technology. So it's a very nice addition for us. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk about the new guidance for the year."

We now think that operating cash flow should exceed $575 million for the full year. Our full year DEPS number now is going to be $4.20 to $4.30, which includes the GAAP $0.05 from Q2, and that's up from $3.97 to $4.12 last quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to earn between $1.05 and a $1.09, which is up about 25% from the $0.87 that we earned in the third quarter last year. And I'd remind you actually that third quarter last year was an exceptionally strong quarter. So we think that's quite good performance around the guidance going forward given the strength of last third quarter.
Next slide. If we look at how Q2 then shapes up in terms of a summary, we wound up with all-time historical quarter performance for any quarter in our history, even better than the fourth quarter last year for order sales, backlog and operating cash flow. The very broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise, we have a number of small niche P&L's and almost all of them were up. Total sales growth at 23%, the gross margin up 70 basis points. Operating margin, where you can really see the leverage, was up 240 basis points. So on the incremental, operating margin against the incremental sales, our leverage in the quarter was 34%. EBITDA, because of the noncash amortization that hits the OP margin, EBITDA was higher at 280 basis points to 28.5% and that excludes the remeasurement gain. Of course, we kept that in there under GAAP without even higher leverage. So the leverage on EBITDA was 40% of the new revenue.
Record backlog ended the quarter at $872 million. We raised the guidance to $4.20 to $4.30. And I think most importantly, when you see what's happening here is that our niche business focus continues to deliver these outstanding results. When so many people concentrate on what are you going to do about the BRICS? What are you doing about that? What are you doing this? Our sales into the BRICS were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter this year and they were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter last year, maybe a little less. So that's helpful, but that's not what's absolutely required for us to continue to grow. It was another just terrific quarter and will position the course for a record year. 
And with that, I think we can open up to Q&A."

And then we'll have some international development in the Middle East that will improve shipments. So all these things help. So I think one thing that has really been sort of encouraging, it's counterintuitive to how we would think about municipal spending is that we've got a number of design projects that we're doing, some in the Far West, important one that we just won around Pennsylvania on a conversion project. So our traffic business is actually doing pretty well. And I think we probably commented in here relative to -- we would have expected it to be a headwind. It's been certainly neutral to modest upside for us."

It accounts for well over 2/3 of their revenue is software and naturally spread ratably over the year. So the growth that we're seeing there is not because of installations. It's because of new wins and the continued deployment of software into other areas like security application in a campus environment."

So we would give them great credit for how they're performing. Now we continue to make a commitment that we're going to have lead-free water meters that are bronze-based technologies as opposed to some people who are looking at going to plastic, which we think is a long way from being a safe installation project for people. In the pump businesses, we generally have enough pricing power that if we've got cost-push inflation on materials side that we can pass that through and not market up. It's almost just as separate side matter for things. So it hasn't really hurt us in any event. I think we continue to get leverage as revenue goes up, so on the OP line you could see we got 34% leverage in the quarter. And in both industrial and energy, we don't have very much noncash amortization that's coming off of those. So that kind of 30%, 35% leverage, I think, continues with us.

And it's a very ironic thing about -- as we look at all of our businesses on a niche basis and we want to keep focused on the P&L basis and customer profitability basis, I think we're doing a great job in that arena. And as a result of their kind of customer intimacy, they don't lend themselves to forced synergies from a physical asset basis. So in our pump, we've got a great centrifugal pump, we got piston pump company. You can't put those factors together, they fundamentally do different kind of things. In the network arena, that's actually not true. I mean it's very ironic, but in fact they're doing a lot of data storage, they've got a lot of things that are really quite similar in the back end of an enterprise that you can nimbly get a lot of the synergies around. So absolutely positive to get cost synergies out of software network businesses that we can't get out of the industrial and energy businesses. So that makes them pretty attractive. And as long as these small network opportunities are available, we think it's an attractive place to invest. Now we're not trying to turn Roper into a single-use software network application company, so we believe our focus around that has been opportunistic. They generate more cash than the other businesses do and they require less assets and they virtually never have anything that depreciates, and their assets go home at night. And as long as you motivate them, you get a wonderful cash and cash return over a long period of time. Today, John, I don't know if you've provided much guidance around the overall revenue, but that it's getting to be certainly a very significant portion of the RF business. At some point, we're going to split this out for you so that you'll see the tolling business completely separate from all the rest of the RF business. That's something I expect we would probably do for 2012, so that it's easier for everybody to see the variance in the 2 because you do have this terribly lumpy TransCore order input situation that's up terrifically in Q1 and down a little bit in Q2, but over the first half the year it's double-digit growth. But it certainly makes it confusing. We just have to do a few things to get that in place to be able to respond to your question clearly, which we'll do for next year."

Whenever we have growth in the other portions of the activity at much faster rate than those business grow, then we get a whole lot better contribution because, I mean, you're looking at an order of magnitude several times the difference there. So the other thing that's happening, of course, is we get more embedded growth out of the software businesses at the expense of the TransCore tolling and traffic business, and so as you get that, you get a higher margin capture and better cash. And lastly, when the tag shipments occur then that tends to be better than the administrative margin activity does. So the administrative activity hasn't grown. In fact, it was down a little bit, I believe, in the second quarter year-over-year and so that's bad news on revenue, good news on margins."

Some of the other public companies either have debt or publicly traded have reported degradation in numbers. So whether that's project related or us gaining share is always hard to answer, but we've certainly been outperforming people this year, and so I'd say they're gaining share. But I think, for us, what we're encouraged by is we had to gain more share in the future because I think we've got a clearly superior lead-free technology to the people. On the Technolog front, I mean that's something that certainly gains share but it's like a turnkey thing and then you fill it out right, so it's doing fine. On CBORD, it's certainly -- I believe most people would agree that it has gained share at the expense of people with universities that it's taken over that used to be covered by different folks. So it's definitely gaining share. I think it's so focused rather than being somebody that's in a diverse area. I think we're really proud of the team we have and the customer intimacy they have and the follow-up they have with customers and their ability to get things integrated online. So I think we will continue to gain share. And I'd say the same with Horizon. The Horizon activity is very better than we would have hoped for given the difficulty with educational spending. I think if you've ever gotten any relief around funding in the K through 12 arena, which you may or may not get, if you get it it's probably because of nutrition. We see a lot of build-out opportunities where we can do things to see beside the meal platform of what happens in K through 12 education around data gathering and we have a number of new software developments that we're putting in place around how a school can manage its kind of inflow of cash from families.

Let me start here with the Slide 3 on my deck. We'll go through the second quarter financial results for the enterprise as a whole and then we'll dissect how the segments performed and what the outlook appears for each of the segment in the second half of the year. We'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and its implications for the future and take your questions.
Next slide. The Q2 financial results here are really a spectacular quarter for us. We achieved a series of all-time company historical results around orders and sales and backlog and operating cash flow. And then in the quarter, our net earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow were outstanding. 
Total sales for the quarter were up 23% and 16% of that was organic. We enjoyed again double-digit sales growth in each one of the 4 segments, which frankly was a little bit better than we expected going into the quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio is still above 1 for the eighth straight quarter, so that's resulting in continuing backlog. We've got record backlog at the end of the second quarter of $872 million, which is up $230 million from last year's second quarter.
Gross margins were very solid in the quarter. They hit 53.9%. And our EBITDA margins, when you exclude this remeasurement gain, which is required to be included here on a GAAP basis, but we've excluded it for looking at our leverage. So the EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 28.5%. Without that remeasurement gain, of course, if we left it, the margin would even be better. 
NDI's acquisition was completed in the quarter. That's off to a good start. We've already begun the financial integration and had some marketplace meetings with our various people in medical and looked actually at some other acquisitions in that area with them. And then we were pleased to see the Moody's upgrade that we received in the quarter on all of our debt structure to Baa2. 
Next slide. On the income statement, there's just not much to say about this, except we achieved another amazingly great quarter. Bookings, you can see book-to-bill at $708 million, it's 1.01 up, our eighth straight quarter. Net sales were $700 million in the quarter. First time we've done that. 23% increase. Gross profit up 70 basis points. Operating income was up 240 basis points from 21%. Second quarter of last year to 23.4% here. Our interest expense was flat. Tax rate in the quarter was actually headwind for us. We came in at 31.4% in Q2 this year versus 29.6% last year and that cost us a couple of pennies. Net earnings again, that's asterisked to show the net earnings number without the foreign currency remeasurement gain in the quarter. It was up 43%. And the diluted earnings per share, $1.03 versus $0.74. On a GAAP basis, it had to be reported at $1.08.
Next slide. The free cash flow in Q2 got back to where we expect it -- we'd like to be. We had terrific, terrific results, 21% of sales. Free cash flow was up 41% over the same quarter a year ago with a move up from $103 million to $145 million.
Next slide. If you look at the asset velocity performance in the quarter, it's one of the things I know everybody's very happy with inside the company. Despite having a 23% gain in revenue, actually inventory as a function of revenue improved by 10 basis points. So inventory last year was 7.6% of sales. Here, we are up 23% and inventory has dropped to 7.5% of sales. So we're very pleased with our results. Payable is about 5.5% with inventory at 7.5%. We're not having to invest very much to continue to maintain our growth, which is great news.
Next slide. If we look at the balance sheet of the company, we can honestly say the balance sheet's never been in better shape. We ended the quarter with $196 million in cash and that's after acquiring Northern Digital for $200 million, by the way. Our available liquidity, including the undrawn revolver at the end of quarter was $753 million, but it'll continue to move up here as we add cash rapidly now. That gives us a net debt of $1,050,000,000. And our net debt-to-net cap, you can see as 26%. We reported here debt-to-EBITDA, meaning gross debt-to-EBITDA because not all of that $196 million is immediately available without repatriation. So the gross debt-to-EBITDA number is 1.7x. If you look at the net debt, which includes all the cash, it drops that ratio to 1.4. Our EBITDA-to-interest expense coverage is about 11x. And despite investing $725 million in the last 12 months, we're really in wonderful shape going forward. And by the way, our trailing EBITDA now on a 12-month basis is up to $739 million. So as the trailing EBITDA grows rapidly, and you look at the debt situation being held constant, the balance sheet gets better and better.
Next slide. Now we want to take a look at the individual performance of the 4 segments and what we think they'll look like in the second half. Next slide. Here we're looking at the sort of consolidated segment-by-segment approach on gross margins and EBITDA in the quarter. Everybody at 50% or higher. The industrial EBITDA margins again are just breathtaking at 31%. Just terrific results in the quarter, including handling a portion of our industrial businesses that we'll talk more about.
Next slide. We start with RF Technology with the largest portion of reported sales in the quarter at 31% of revenue. You can see orders for RF were up 13%, sales were up 26% and operating margin was up 410 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter for RF, by the way, was 31% as we have a good deal of amortization in RF.
The second quarter, we wound up with organic sales of 13%. We had particularly strong growth in the U.K. with our water network monitoring products from Technolog and continued growth in Gaz de France installation project with Technolog in France. We had very strong double-digit sales increases out of CBORD, which was driven by deployments business we won earlier out of college and university environments, and that portion of the business is continuing to do really quite well despite what some people might think.
Very strong North American tag sales for transport throughout the second quarter. And then if we look to the second half of the year, we're going to have continued growth in both toll and traffic operations with more tags shipments out of TransCore, but also several traffic projects that we're putting in, in the United States. And then we have a significant expansion of electronic tolling in Puerto Rico where we're going to be converting from coin-operated technologies to electronic collection.
CBORD's backlog is very strong, so it's assuring ourselves a double-digit growth throughout the rest of this half of the year and very strong Q3 cash. And iTrade is continuing to do well. We've been encouraging them and investing in them to focus really on their core business on a global basis and that is going well, although we have to continue to beef up the nimbleness of our operations in Europe, which we're doing.
Next slide. In industrial technology, you can see we had again a spectacular performance. Orders were up 15%, sales up 26%, operating margin increased 160 basis points to 28.2%. EBITDA was 31% for them as well. We had exceptional growth in all of our pump and water fluid handling businesses, largely driven by oil and gas and irrigation projects. Our materials are used in all the shale activity that you see and we're doing a lot of dewatering and we're doing a lot of drilling support mechanisms for those projects. We have very strong demands for our material test business in Denmark and then we had double-digit growth again at Neptune, which was kind of, I wouldn't say a surprise, but it was pleasant to see because all of the indicators around those businesses would be less than exciting.
The next generation residential water meter that we developed at Neptune that some people have seen has been introduced and it's beginning to ship. It has a lower raw material content than our previous water meter had for residential applications, and it's a very easy product to install and incorporate our reading technology. Neptune already meets the 2014 federal lead-free standard associated with the Safe Water Drinking Act. I think this is something that's not talked about enough in the marketplace around just how important and critical that'll be. And we would encourage our investors to go online on YouTube, you'll see at www.shedthelead.com/video/. You'll see a 4 to 4.5 minute thing we put together basically for municipalities to help them try to understand what's going on and while there was this one standard, now there's another standard that has to be lead free. Neptune is the only really producer of lead-free water meters here in the United States. Quite a significant development for us. It's something that we've been working on throughout the last 10 years and feel that it's going to get widespread market acceptance going forward.
In the second half of the year, we expect Neptune's momentum to continue, which we would think will do at least as well on revenue in the second half of the year there as we did in the first half, even though in the third quarter, for Neptune, we have extremely difficult comp because last year we had a blowout favorable third quarter.
Our order trends and backlog continue to support all of our fluid handling businesses. They -- whether it's Roper or Cornell or Abel or Hansen, any of these are all doing just spectacularly well. New product introductions and a strong Q4 seasonality, we think, will continue to drive or stir us in Logitech [indiscernible] businesses also in the fourth quarter.
Next slide. When we look at the energy systems and controls business, here you can see orders up 19%, sales up 22%. The operating margin here was 25.9%, which is up 150 basis points. EBITDA came into the quarter at 29%. In the quarter, virtually all of our end markets were very strong. The diesel engine safety systems that we continue to advertise and push into the marketplace have had continuing growth in their adoption rate with the diesel engine manufacturers. They're going to reach record levels here in this third quarter coming up. The refining and petrochem market is doing much better for us again. Instruments sales have taken off. And then when we look at the sort of global industrial production and capacity utilization around the latex and tire manufacturing and analytics that we do in the rubber industry, those all are doing exceptionally well. And perhaps most importantly, we haven't seen any sign of any slowdown in that business, which, along with material test, have been the kind of 2 leading indicators for us about if there's any softness anywhere. And they both continue to grow.
In the second half of 2011, we've got a very strong backlog in energy, which assures our Q3 growth and all the indicators, which suggest a seasonally strong Q4 which is usually our best quarter in that segment. 
The control systems business activity certainly should drive our second half record performance here. That activity and backlog has grown at a very fast pace, and shipments ought to start to manifest themselves here in the second half. And we expect continued margin expansion with great leverage throughout the segment in the second half of the year.
Next slide. The medical and scientific imaging segment, you can see was up 11% on orders and up 18% on revenue. Operating margin was up 180 basis points to 23.4%. There's quite a bit of noncash amortization here, so EBITDA was 29%. If you look at the medical in the second quarter, pretty much across the line performed very well. We've got faster adoption rates again in BladderScan and GlideScope. We think -- GlideScope is the intubation product. BladderScan is the product that helps avoid catheterization in the hospital, and that has taken off again this year. Very strong ultrasound consumables sales for CIVCO. Northern Digital, we completed that acquisition in the quarter. I will talk a little bit more about that in a second. And then our high-end products that we're driving for photonics that are really around our filters for Gatan and proprietary technology for Princeton are performing well as well.
In the second half of the year, if we look at the backlog that we go into, again we're kind of assured a very strong second half. We don't have to rely much on book and ship here. Continued strength throughout the medical platform. We've got the product introductions that Verathon has been working on with Velaport [ph], Heartscape and other products are basically on trend for where we want them to be for our 2012 launches. We think those products will carry our growth soundly into next year. 
In Northern Digital, we'll add a little bit of income growth in the second half of the year. It's accretive nominally, maybe $0.01 in Q3 and then stronger in Q4 with $0.03 or so. That acquisition we thought we'd kind of introduce the product to you since we have that chance today and so the next slide here is really a detailed explanation about what Northern Digital does and I've asked John to explain that to you."

Thanks, Brian. The Northern Digital acquisition that really adds to our growing medical platform using both sensors as well as cameras is the leading provider for both optical and electromagnetic tracking systems and in minimally invasive surgery where you really had to have very precise application of treatment in a nonline-of-sight situation. You really need to know exactly where the treatment is being applied. And Northern Digital provides the technology and the systems that allow the doctor to be able to do that. And this is really going into a part of the medical market that is growing very quickly around image-guided and minimally invasive surgery. And it really has a couple of different parts to it. You can see it's about 90% medical, and it's about 60% systems and 40% consumables. The consumables are the spheres, these very high-tech optical spheres that really provide the 3D location information back to the doctor. It's a unique and patented technology. It has asset-light business model as all of our acquisitions do. Really comes with a very strong and experienced management team led by Jamie Frazier. And it's once again a very nice addition to our growing medical platform and really in the image-guided part of our medical platform. You'll hear us talk about ultrasound applications with Verathon, ultrasound type of applications with CIVCO. This is another situation where the image-guided surgery is building on that ultrasound technology. So it's a very nice addition for us. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk about the new guidance for the year."

We now think that operating cash flow should exceed $575 million for the full year. Our full year DEPS number now is going to be $4.20 to $4.30, which includes the GAAP $0.05 from Q2, and that's up from $3.97 to $4.12 last quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to earn between $1.05 and a $1.09, which is up about 25% from the $0.87 that we earned in the third quarter last year. And I'd remind you actually that third quarter last year was an exceptionally strong quarter. So we think that's quite good performance around the guidance going forward given the strength of last year's third quarter.
Next slide. If we look at how Q2 then shapes up in terms of a summary, we wound up with all-time historical quarter performance for any quarter in our history, even better than the fourth quarter of last year for order sales, backlog and operating cash flow. The very broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise, we have a number of small niche P&Ls and almost all of them are up. Total sales growth at 23%, the gross margin up 70 basis points. Operating margin, where you can really see the leverage, was up 240 basis points. So on the incremental, operating margin against the incremental sales, our leverage in the quarter was 34%. EBITDA, because of the noncash amortization that hits the OP margin, EBITDA was up higher at 280 basis points to 28.5% and that excludes the remeasurement gain. Of course, if we kept that in there under GAAP we'd have even higher leverage. So the leverage on EBITDA was 40% of the new revenue.
Record backlog ended the quarter at $872 million. We raised the guidance to $4.20 to $4.30. And I think most importantly, when you see what's happening here is that our niche business focus continues to deliver these outstanding results. When so many people concentrate on what are you going to do about the BRICS? What are you doing about that? What are you doing this? Our sales into the BRICS were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter this year and they were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter last year, maybe a little less. So that's helpful, but that's not what's absolutely required for us to continue to grow. It was another just terrific quarter and we're positioned of course for a record year. 
And with that, I think we can open up to Q&A."

So our traffic business is actually doing pretty well. And I think we probably commented in here relative to -- we would have expected it to be a headwind.

Horizon is focused on elementary education and K through 12, and there, most of that business is public business. It's really driven by nutrition management and by sorting out how much the free lunch program is going to be paid for individual people and the proof of that. And so Horizon has very large public institution contracts like Dallas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, things like that and bids large contracts in that arena and then also does somewhat smaller domain places as well."

And it's a very ironic thing about -- as we look at all of our businesses on a niche basis and we want to keep focused on a P&L basis and customer profitability basis, I think we do a great job in that arena. And as a result of their kind of customer intimacy, they don't lend themselves to forced synergies from a physical asset basis. So in our pump, we've got a great centrifugal pump company, we got a great piston pump company. You can't put those factories together, they fundamentally do different kind of things. In the network arena, that's actually not true. I mean it's very ironic, but in fact they're doing a lot of data storage, they've got a lot of things that are really quite similar in the back end of an enterprise that you can nimbly get a lot of synergies around. So it's absolutely positive to get cost synergies out of software network businesses that we can't get out of the industrial and energy businesses. So that makes them pretty attractive. And as long as these small network opportunities are available, we think it's an attractive place to invest. Now we're not trying to turn Roper into a single-use software network application company, so we believe our focus around that has been opportunistic. They generate more cash than the other businesses do and they require less assets and they virtually never have anything that depreciates, and their assets go home at night. And as long as you motivate them, you get a wonderful cash-on-cash return over a long period of time. Today, John, I don't know if you've provided much guidance around overall revenue, but that it's getting to be certainly a very significant portion of the RF business. At some point, we're going to split this out for you so that you'll see the tolling business completely separate from all the rest of the RF business. That's something I expect we would probably do for 2012, so that it's easier for everybody to see the variance in the 2 because you do have this terribly lumpy TransCore order input situation that's up terrifically in Q1 and down a little bit in Q2, but over the first half of the year it's double-digit growth. But it certainly makes it confusing. So we just have to do a few things to get that in place to be able to respond to your question clearly, which we'll do for next year."

Whenever we have growth in the other portions of the activity at much faster rate than those business grow, then we get a whole lot better contribution because, I mean, you're looking at an order of magnitude several times the difference there. So the other thing that's happening, of course, is we get more embedded growth out of the software businesses at the expense of the TransCore tolling and traffic business, and so as you get that, you get a higher margin capture and better cash. And lastly, when the tag shipments occur, then that tends to be better than the administrative margin activity does. So the administrative activity hasn't grown.

On the Technolog front, I mean that's something that certainly gains share, but it's like a turnkey thing and then you fill it out right, so it's doing fine.

I think we're really proud of the team we have and the customer intimacy they have and the follow-up they have with customers and their ability to get things integrated online.

I think if you ever got any relief around funding in the K through 12 arena, which you may or may not get, if you get it, it's probably because of nutrition. We see a lot of build-out opportunities where we can do things beside the meal platform of what happens in K through 12 education around data gathering, and we have a number of new software developments that we're putting in place around how a school can manage its kind of inflow of cash from families.

Next slide. The Q2 financial results here are really a spectacular quarter for us. We achieved a series of all-time company historical results around orders and sales and backlog and operating cash flow. And then in the quarter, our net earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow were outstanding. 
Total sales for the quarter were up 23% and 16% of that was organic. We enjoyed again double-digit sales growth in each one of the 4 segments, which frankly was a little bit better than we expected going into the quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio is still above 1 for the eighth straight quarter, so that's resulting in continuing backlog. We've got record backlog at the end of the second quarter of $872 million, which is up $230 million from last year's second quarter.
Gross margins were very solid in the quarter. They hit 53.9%. And our EBITDA margins, when you exclude this remeasurement gain, which is required to be included here on a GAAP basis, but we've excluded it for looking at our leverage. So the EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 28.5%. Without that remeasurement gain, of course, if we left it, the margin would even be better. 
NDI's acquisition was completed in the quarter. That's off to a good start. We've already begun the financial integration and had some marketplace meetings with our various people in medical and looked actually at some other acquisitions in that area with them. And then we were pleased to see the Moody's upgrade that we received in the quarter on all of our debt structure to Baa2. 
Next slide. On the income statement, there's just not much to say about this, except we achieved another amazingly great quarter. Bookings, you can see book-to-bill at $708 million, it's 1.01 up, our eighth straight quarter. Net sales were $700 million in the quarter. First time we've done that. 23% increase. Gross profit up 70 basis points. Operating income was up 240 basis points from 21%. Second quarter of last year to 23.4% here. Our interest expense was flat. Tax rate in the quarter was actually headwind for us. We came in at 31.4% in Q2 this year versus 29.6% last year and that cost us a couple of pennies. Net earnings again, that's asterisked to show the net earnings number without the foreign currency remeasurement gain in the quarter. It was up 43%. And the diluted earnings per share, $1.03 versus $0.74. On a GAAP basis, it had to be reported at $1.08.
Next slide. The free cash flow in Q2 got back to where we expect it -- we'd like to be. We had terrific, terrific results, 21% of sales. Free cash flow was up 41% over the same quarter a year ago with a move up from $103 million to $145 million.
Next slide. If you look at the asset velocity performance in the quarter, it's one of the things I know everybody's very happy with inside the company. Despite having a 23% gain in revenue, actually inventory as a function of revenue improved by 10 basis points. So inventory last year was 7.6% of sales. Here, we are up 23% and inventory has dropped to 7.5% of sales. So we're very pleased with our results. Payable is about 5.5% with inventory at 7.5%. We're not having to invest very much to continue to maintain our growth, which is great news.
Next slide. If we look at the balance sheet of the company, we can honestly say the balance sheet's never been in better shape. We ended the quarter with $196 million in cash and that's after acquiring Northern Digital for $200 million, by the way. Our available liquidity, including the undrawn revolver at the end of quarter was $753 million, but it'll continue to move up here as we add cash rapidly now. That gives us a net debt of $1,050,000,000. And our net debt-to-net cap, you can see as 26%. We reported here debt-to-EBITDA, meaning gross debt-to-EBITDA because not all of that $196 million is immediately available without repatriation. So the gross debt-to-EBITDA number is 1.7x. If you look at the net debt, which includes all the cash, it drops that ratio to 1.4. Our EBITDA-to-interest expense coverage is about 11x. And despite investing $725 million in the last 12 months, we're really in wonderful shape going forward. And by the way, our trailing EBITDA now on a 12-month basis is up to $739 million. So as the trailing EBITDA grows rapidly, and you look at the debt situation being held constant, the balance sheet gets better and better.
Next slide. Now we want to take a look at the individual performance of the 4 segments and what we think they'll look like in the second half. Next slide. Here we're looking at the sort of consolidated segment-by-segment approach on gross margins and EBITDA in the quarter. Everybody at 50% or higher. The industrial EBITDA margins again are just breathtaking at 31%. Just terrific results in the quarter, including handling a portion of our industrial businesses that we'll talk more about.
Next slide. We start with RF Technology with the largest portion of reported sales in the quarter at 31% of revenue. You can see orders for RF were up 13%, sales were up 26% and operating margin was up 410 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter for RF, by the way, was 31% as we have a good deal of amortization in RF.
The second quarter, we wound up with organic sales of 13%. We had particularly strong growth in the U.K. with our water network monitoring products from Technolog and continued growth in Gaz de France installation project with Technolog in France. We had very strong double-digit sales increases out of CBORD, which was driven by deployments business we won earlier out of college and university environments, and that portion of the business is continuing to do really quite well despite what some people might think.
Very strong North American tag sales for transport throughout the second quarter. And then if we look to the second half of the year, we're going to have continued growth in both toll and traffic operations with more tags shipments out of TransCore, but also several traffic projects that we're putting in, in the United States. And then we have a significant expansion of electronic tolling in Puerto Rico where we're going to be converting from coin-operated technologies to electronic collection.
CBORD's backlog is very strong, so it's assuring ourselves a double-digit growth throughout the rest of this half of the year and very strong Q3 cash. And iTrade is continuing to do well. We've been encouraging them and investing in them to focus really on their core business on a global basis and that is going well, although we have to continue to beef up the nimbleness of our operations in Europe, which we're doing.
Next slide. In industrial technology, you can see we had again a spectacular performance. Orders were up 15%, sales up 26%, operating margin increased 160 basis points to 28.2%. EBITDA was 31% for them as well. We had exceptional growth in all of our pump and water fluid handling businesses, largely driven by oil and gas and irrigation projects. Our materials are used in all the shale activity that you see and we're doing a lot of dewatering and we're doing a lot of drilling support mechanisms for those projects. We have very strong demands for our material test business in Denmark and then we had double-digit growth again at Neptune, which was kind of, I wouldn't say a surprise, but it was pleasant to see because all of the indicators around those businesses would be less than exciting.
The next generation residential water meter that we developed at Neptune that some people have seen has been introduced and it's beginning to ship. It has a lower raw material content than our previous water meter had for residential applications, and it's a very easy product to install and incorporate our reading technology. Neptune already meets the 2014 federal lead-free standard associated with the Safe Water Drinking Act. I think this is something that's not talked about enough in the marketplace around just how important and critical that'll be. And we would encourage our investors to go online on YouTube, you'll see at www.shedthelead.com/video/. You'll see a 4 to 4.5 minute thing we put together basically for municipalities to help them try to understand what's going on and while there was this one standard, now there's another standard that has to be lead free. Neptune is the only really producer of lead-free water meters here in the United States. Quite a significant development for us. It's something that we've been working on throughout the last 10 years and feel that it's going to get widespread market acceptance going forward.
In the second half of the year, we expect Neptune's momentum to continue, which we would think will do at least as well on revenue in the second half of the year there as we did in the first half, even though in the third quarter, for Neptune, we have extremely difficult comp because last year we had a blowout favorable third quarter.
Our order trends and backlog continue to support all of our fluid handling businesses. They -- whether it's Roper or Cornell or Abel or Hansen, any of these are all doing just spectacularly well. New product introductions and a strong Q4 seasonality, we think, will continue to drive or stir us in Logitech [indiscernible] businesses also in the fourth quarter.
Next slide. When we look at the energy systems and controls business, here you can see orders up 19%, sales up 22%. The operating margin here was 25.9%, which is up 150 basis points. EBITDA came into the quarter at 29%. In the quarter, virtually all of our end markets were very strong. The diesel engine safety systems that we continue to advertise and push into the marketplace have had continuing growth in their adoption rate with the diesel engine manufacturers. They're going to reach record levels here in this third quarter coming up. The refining and petrochem market is doing much better for us again. Instruments sales have taken off. And then when we look at the sort of global industrial production and capacity utilization around the latex and tire manufacturing and analytics that we do in the rubber industry, those all are doing exceptionally well. And perhaps most importantly, we haven't seen any sign of any slowdown in that business, which, along with material test, have been the kind of 2 leading indicators for us about if there's any softness anywhere. And they both continue to grow.
In the second half of 2011, we've got a very strong backlog in energy, which assures our Q3 growth and all the indicators, which suggest a seasonally strong Q4 which is usually our best quarter in that segment. 
The control systems business activity certainly should drive our second half record performance here. That activity and backlog has grown at a very fast pace, and shipments ought to start to manifest themselves here in the second half. And we expect continued margin expansion with great leverage throughout the segment in the second half of the year.
Next slide. The medical and scientific imaging segment, you can see was up 11% on orders and up 18% on revenue. Operating margin was up 180 basis points to 23.4%. There's quite a bit of noncash amortization here, so EBITDA was 29%. If you look at the medical in the second quarter, pretty much across the line performed very well. We've got faster adoption rates again in BladderScan and GlideScope. We think -- GlideScope is the intubation product. BladderScan is the product that helps avoid catheterization in the hospital, and that has taken off again this year. Very strong ultrasound consumables sales for CIVCO. Northern Digital, we completed that acquisition in the quarter. I will talk a little bit more about that in a second. And then our high-end products that we're driving for photonics that are really around our filters for Gatan and proprietary technology for Princeton are performing well as well.
In the second half of the year, if we look at the backlog that we go into, again we're kind of assured a very strong second half. We don't have to rely much on book and ship here. Continued strength throughout the medical platform. We've got the product introductions that Verathon has been working on with Velaport [ph], Heartscape and other products are basically on trend for where we want them to be for our 2012 launches. We think those products will carry our growth soundly into next year. 
In Northern Digital, we'll add a little bit of income growth in the second half of the year. It's accretive nominally, maybe $0.01 in Q3 and then stronger in Q4 with $0.03 or so. That acquisition we thought we'd kind of introduce the product to you since we have that chance today and so the next slide here is really a detailed explanation about what Northern Digital does and I've asked John to explain that to you."

Thanks, Brian. The Northern Digital acquisition that really adds to our growing medical platform using both sensors as well as cameras is the leading provider for both optical and electromagnetic tracking systems and in minimally invasive surgery where you really had to have very precise application of treatment in a nonline-of-sight situation. You really need to know exactly where the treatment is being applied. And Northern Digital provides the technology and the systems that allow the doctor to be able to do that. And this is really going into a part of the medical market that is growing very quickly around image-guided and minimally invasive surgery. And it really has a couple of different parts to it. You can see it's about 90% medical, and it's about 60% systems and 40% consumables. The consumables are the spheres, these very high-tech optical spheres that really provide the 3D location information back to the doctor. It's a unique and patented technology. It has asset-light business model as all of our acquisitions do. Really comes with a very strong and experienced management team led by Jamie Frazier. And it's once again a very nice addition to our growing medical platform and really in the image-guided part of our medical platform. You'll hear us talk about ultrasound applications with Verathon, ultrasound type of applications with CIVCO. This is another situation where the image-guided surgery is building on that ultrasound technology. So it's a very nice addition for us. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk about the new guidance for the year."

We now think that operating cash flow should exceed $575 million for the full year. Our full year DEPS number now is going to be $4.20 to $4.30, which includes the GAAP $0.05 from Q2, and that's up from $3.97 to $4.12 last quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to earn between $1.05 and a $1.09, which is up about 25% from the $0.87 that we earned in the third quarter last year. And I'd remind you actually that third quarter last year was an exceptionally strong quarter. So we think that's quite good performance around the guidance going forward given the strength of last year's third quarter.
Next slide. If we look at how Q2 then shapes up in terms of a summary, we wound up with all-time historical quarter performance for any quarter in our history, even better than the fourth quarter of last year for order sales, backlog and operating cash flow. The very broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise, we have a number of small niche P&Ls and almost all of them are up. Total sales growth at 23%, the gross margin up 70 basis points. Operating margin, where you can really see the leverage, was up 240 basis points. So on the incremental, operating margin against the incremental sales, our leverage in the quarter was 34%. EBITDA, because of the noncash amortization that hits the OP margin, EBITDA was up higher at 280 basis points to 28.5% and that excludes the remeasurement gain. Of course, if we kept that in there under GAAP we'd have even higher leverage. So the leverage on EBITDA was 40% of the new revenue.
Record backlog ended the quarter at $872 million. We raised the guidance to $4.20 to $4.30. And I think most importantly, when you see what's happening here is that our niche business focus continues to deliver these outstanding results. When so many people concentrate on what are you going to do about the BRICS? What are you doing about that? What are you doing this? Our sales into the BRICS were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter this year and they were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter last year, maybe a little less. So that's helpful, but that's not what's absolutely required for us to continue to grow. It was another just terrific quarter and we're positioned of course for a record year. 
And with that, I think we can open up to Q&A."

And then we'll have some international development in the Middle East that will improve shipments. So all those things help. So I think one thing that has really been sort of encouraging, it's counterintuitive to how we would think about municipal spending is that we've got a number of design projects that we're doing, some in the Far West, an important one that we just won around Pennsylvania on a conversion project. So our traffic business is actually doing pretty well. And I think we probably commented in here relative to -- we would have expected it to be a headwind. And it's been certainly neutral to modest upside for us."

However, because of the software recognition rules that we have and the fact that we really sell the software on a 1-year license basis, we actually defer that revenue over a 12-month period.

It accounts for well over 2/3 of their revenue is software and naturally spread ratably over the year. So the growth that we're seeing there is not because of installations. It's because of new wins and the continued deployment of software into other areas like security application in a campus environment."

And so in order for us to -- let's take India, for instance, where our bid activity and channel development is expanding most rapidly. Again, our markets are pretty small, right? So it's pretty hard to make a major investment in India that might drive $10 million in growth for 3 of the pump companies. It's just not pragmatic and the things that we do are so application-specific that you probably got to have to rely on local distribution for what happens, and we're probably the most conservative people you'll meet on how we look at distribution channels and assuring that we're very comfortable with all the activity that create revenue in these countries."

I mean, I can remember when it used to be $0.74 a pound or something, and here it is at $4.39. And now, there's almost 2 pounds of copper in every meter, so it's a big deal when you got a product that maybe sells for $20 or something. So we would give them great credit for how they're performing. Now we continue to make a commitment that we're going to have lead-free water meters that are bronze-based technologies as opposed to some people who are looking at going to plastic, which we think is a long way from being a safe installation project for people. In the pump businesses, we generally have enough pricing power that if we've got cost-push inflation on materials side that we can pass that through and not mark it up, it's almost just a separate side matter of things. So it hasn't really hurt us in any event. I think we continue to get leverage as revenue goes up, so on the OP line you could see we got 34% leverage in the quarter. And in both industrial and energy, we don't have very much noncash amortization that's coming off of those. So that kind of 30%, 35% leverage, I think, continues with us. That ought to be a perpetual opportunity as long as revenue is expanding."

And it's a very ironic thing about -- as we look at all of our businesses on a niche basis and we want to keep focused on a P&L basis and customer profitability basis, I think we do a great job in that arena. And as a result of their kind of customer intimacy, they don't lend themselves to forced synergies from a physical asset basis. So in our pump, we've got a great centrifugal pump company, we got a great piston pump company. You can't put those factories together, they fundamentally do different kind of things. In the network arena, that's actually not true. I mean it's very ironic, but in fact they're doing a lot of data storage, they've got a lot of things that are really quite similar in the back end of an enterprise that you can nimbly get a lot of synergies around. So it's absolutely positive to get cost synergies out of software network businesses that we can't get out of the industrial and energy businesses. So that makes them pretty attractive. And as long as these small network opportunities are available, we think it's an attractive place to invest. Now we're not trying to turn Roper into a single-use software network application company, so we believe our focus around that has been opportunistic. They generate more cash than the other businesses do and they require less assets and they virtually never have anything that depreciates, and their assets go home at night. And as long as you motivate them, you get a wonderful cash-on-cash return over a long period of time. Today, John, I don't know if you've provided much guidance around overall revenue, but that it's getting to be certainly a very significant portion of the RF business. At some point, we're going to split this out for you so that you'll see the tolling business completely separate from all the rest of the RF business. That's something I expect we would probably do for 2012, so that it's easier for everybody to see the variance in the 2 because you do have this terribly lumpy TransCore order input situation that's up terrifically in Q1 and down a little bit in Q2, but over the first half of the year it's double-digit growth. But it certainly makes it confusing. So we just have to do a few things to get that in place to be able to respond to your question clearly, which we'll do for next year."

Whenever we have growth in the other portions of the activity at much faster rate than those business grow, then we get a whole lot better contribution because, I mean, you're looking at an order of magnitude several times the difference there. So the other thing that's happening, of course, is we get more embedded growth out of the software businesses at the expense of the TransCore tolling and traffic business, and so as you get that, you get a higher margin capture and better cash. And lastly, when the tag shipments occur, then that tends to be better than the administrative margin activity does. So the administrative activity hasn't grown. In fact, it was down a little bit, I believe, in the second quarter year-over-year and so that's bad news on revenue, good news on margins."

Some of the other public companies, they either have debt or publicly traded have reported degradation in numbers. So whether that's project related or us gaining share is always hard to answer, but we've certainly been outperforming people this year, so I'd say they're gaining share. But I think, for us, what we're encouraged by is we ought to gain more share in the future because I think we've got a clearly superior lead-free technology to people. On the Technolog front, I mean that's something that certainly gains share, but it's like a turnkey thing and then you fill it out right, so it's doing fine. On CBORD, it's certainly -- I believe most people would agree that it has gained share at the expense of people with universities that it's taken over that used to be covered by different folks. So it's definitely gaining share. I think it's so focused rather than being somebody that's in a diverse area. I think we're really proud of the team we have and the customer intimacy they have and the follow-up they have with customers and their ability to get things integrated online. So I think they'll continue to gain share. And I'd say the same with Horizon. The Horizon activity is very better than we would have hoped for given the difficulty with educational spending. I think if you ever got any relief around funding in the K through 12 arena, which you may or may not get, if you get it, it's probably because of nutrition. We see a lot of build-out opportunities where we can do things beside the meal platform of what happens in K through 12 education around data gathering, and we have a number of new software developments that we're putting in place around how a school can manage its kind of inflow of cash from families. Our MealpayPlus program, it's a homerun, but it can get applied to a lot of new avenues, and they're working hard on that now."

22751,141401955,176145,"Roper Industries Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up",2676,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up to questions and answers. 
So first slide. If we look at the Q3 financial results, once again, they're an all-time record for any quarter in the history of the company, not just a record third quarter. Orders were at the highest level in history, sales the same. Backlog, the highest level, net earnings our highest level, and operating and free cash flow in the quarter set a standard for the company. Our total sales in the quarter were up 18%, and organic sales were up 13%, which was frankly better-than-expected. 
Our book-to-bill was greater than 1 for the 9th straight quarter and our record backlog of $876 million is up $106 million from the third quarter a year ago. Operating margins were terrific throughout the enterprise, they were up 230 basis points, so that operating margin was 23.5% of revenue in the quarter. Our EBITDA was $203 million in the quarter, just truly an astonishing number by any standard and EBITDA margin was 28.6%. Our operating cash flow was 23% of sales at $167 million and our free cash flow was 22% of sales at $157 million.
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you should see that bookings again were above 1.01. Net sales were as we said, up 13% organically. Gross profit picked up 50 basis points from a year ago. Our operating income was up 30% from $128 million, the $167 million in margins at 23.5%, up from 21.2% in the third quarter a year ago. Our tax rate was actually a headwind in the quarter year. In the third quarter last year come it's only 25.9. As most of you would know, third quarter results tend to have whatever rollover there is in that 104A [ph] calculation for filing tax returns. This year, our tax rate was 27.7%, 180 basis points increase over the prior year, which took a couple of pennies out of our results. 
Net earnings were $110 million, up 31% from the prior year and our diluted earnings per share were $1.12 versus $0.87.
Next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter was truly spectacular. 22% of revenue and 142% of net earnings, so it'd be the 14th consecutive year that our free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. And really, we had very strong execution throughout the family of businesses. And you can see the comparisons to prior her on the graph.
Next slide. We had quite substantial EBITDA growth. I'm not sure people caught to just how much our trailing EBITDA continues to grow. We're up 33% in EBITDA over the prior year and our trailing 12 months EBITDA now ending the third quarter is $779 million. That's up from $585 million in the corresponding trailing 12-month period ended in the third quarter of '10 and up from $507 million in 2009. Part of the reason for that is continued margin expansion. Our EBITDA margins in 2009 were 24.5% for that TTM period. In 2010, they were up 140 basis points to 25.9% and this year they skyrocketed to 28.5% from 25.9.
Next slide. Our asset philosophy performance continues to be best-in-class. You can see inventory has actually dropped to 7.4% from 8.9% just 2 years ago. Our receivables are down 200 basis points to 14.7% from 16.7%. Just a terrific performance by all our field operating units around receivables and payables and accruals have actually come down, our numbers would even be spectacular. So in total, when we look at the inventory plus receivables, minus payables and accruals, we finished the quarter at 6.5%. That's 240 basis points better than just 2 years ago. So our exceptional performance in that category continues.
Next slide. Here we look at sort of our strong balance sheet and financial position. We ended the quarter with $246 million in cash. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $779 million. Our gross that number is $1,174,000,000. If you take that $246 million and cash away, you got net debt at $928 million. Shareholder equity continues to be strong there, in excess of $3 billion, meaning our net debt-to-net cap number is about 23%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.5x, so we have very ample capacity inside anything we'd like to do. And our EBITDA to the rest coverage is over 2x. The last 2 years, we invested $1.1 billion in transactions. But as you can see, the balance sheet is stronger than ever.
Next slide. So here we'll take a look at our segment performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Next slide. Our Q3 segment performance was remarkably similar. You can see EBITDA margins and industrial RF are up and medical over 31% and energy, they were 29%. The OP margins continue to march forward as we have revenue growth and we capture leverage associated with that and throughout the enterprise, we're very happy with the margin performance.
Next slide. If we go to the largest segment in the quarter was RF Technology. It had sales up 19%, operating profit was up 41% and the operating profit margin reached 23.8%, up 380 basis points from the corresponding period in the prior year. Orders exceeded revenue. If you look at the specific commentary here, by the way, the leverage on incremental revenue was about 44%. So we had very strong growth throughout the segment, organic sales, up 15%. The software businesses had double-digit organic growth, with particular tribute to CBORD, who continues to have quite spectacular performance around integrated security solutions that we provide the universities. That business has nearly doubled this year compared to last. Our Freight Matching business grew at a double digits rate as we got more new subscribers and their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market due to volatility of gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. 
Our Toll & Traffic solutions business, which is [indiscernible] half of the segment we remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade where we're converting Puerto Rico from a coined-base technology to an electronic technology and we have strong tag shipments in several locations around the world.
In the fourth quarter, looking forward, we're going to continue to benefit from this electronic tolling project in Puerto Rico. Our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement even given what we had here in the third quarter. We think we'd even do better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France, where we've been installing system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that will allow us to get our data services revenue which comes in at lower revenue but much higher margins.
Next slide. Here, looking at the industrial technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune because it's traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here, our orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. The sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16% and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. 
Fluid handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner, driven really by all the shale, gas and oil activity that's occurring in Canada and the U.S. Lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. 
And then in Neptune in North American meter revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the U.S. order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the U.S. We had a very successful launch of our low-profile, lead-free residential water meter. A lot of people currently haven't checked the shared video that we have been and it certainly created a lot interested in our water meter business. 
So we look at Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the energy business and we haven't seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double-digit growth, led by the Toronto installation activity, which is going to start to pickup in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. 
And then our favorable end markets are pretty much generally true in [indiscernible] not doing well in the 30-plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope to improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next.
If we go next slide. If you look here at the medical and scientific imaging segment, it was up 16% in revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%. So we had strong leverage here, about 34%. And the OP margin increased 150 basis points to 24.7%. Our high-end imaging solutions driven largely by continued [indiscernible] quantum and direct detection camera lines are continuing performer, a fantastic way and we have a new product out there that's processing frame speeds at 83 gigabytes a second. I'm not sure that anybody could relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it's leading-edge technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year. 
The medical platform continues to perform well. The adoption rates for both Bladderscan and GlideScope continue to escalate. We continue to gain ground internationally in terms of consumables and our ultrasound business and our [indiscernible] positioning technology for the MRI processes is beginning to gain momentum. There's a lot of favorable papers, write-ups and comments about this, so we think it will be a long-term winning proposition for the enterprise. 
In the third quarter, on a order comparison basis, that very tough comps because of 2 things that happened last year. We do report our record Mobile business in here, which is certainly not key to the enterprise but it had a particularly strong Q3 order for long-term delivery last year, which, of course, wouldn't have been repeated in any one quarter. Is it a new initiation of an order. And then we had very strong dosage delivery business last year and this year was more normalized. So both have created a bit a headwind in terms of comps. But if you must take that the way, the book-to-bill was above one, sequentially higher than the second quarter and our backlog stong, so we don't expect any difficulty here.
In the fourth quarter, we wind up, of course, with record backlog entering the quarter. So that kind of assures our shipment pattern should be fine. We expect to have continued growth in medical because the patient treatment of technologies that were involved and our continuing to grow. We have a higher fourth quarter because Northern Digital, which was acquired will begin to kick in. It has traditionally strong seasonality in the fourth quarter and we haven't seen anything that wouldn't suggest that will occur here.
Next slide. Here when we get to energy systems and controls, you can see once again very strong performance, sales were up 22%. Orders were just slightly ahead of sales, up 12%. Operating profit was up 35% and our OP margins expanded 250 basis points to 25.7%. Growth again is led by the continued development of the diesel engine safety system technology and that continues to get this U.S. and North American shale activity. We've got some new engine OEMs that are building the technology into their platforms and that helps us well. We had a record Q3 in terms of our instruments sales around the refinery business, so that seems to be picking up steam. It had been slowed at a much better this year, but still relatively to slow. One of the very few businesses that's not back to the 2008 results and now that's largely there. 
We had an expansion in our alfa [ph] and [indiscernible] Genesco [ph] family of businesses around Sensor Technologies. They've been up over 30% here for instrumentation to measure composites and process manufacturing. And just excellent execution throughout the segment with the exception of our nuclear [indiscernible] business, which has been very soft due to the nuclear plant shutdowns around the world. But for fortunately, it's not a big piece of the total. 
In the fourth quarter, we will benefit from an acquisition that we made right at the end of the third quarter for United Controls. United Controls is a small business in the Midwest, which has a large OEM component with Rolls-Royce. It's got great field service, technical support and its technologies is very complementary to our compressor control business. We've done very little historically [indiscernible], so this gives us a new partner in effect to provide field service and aftermarket application for technology improvements. And it certainly expands our OEM channel access. 
In the oil and gas area, the trends just continue to perform exceptionally well and there's no downturn of any kind, I think expected this year or early next year ago. And seasonality here has always been very important in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of MRO purchases that than to get that in the fourth quarter [indiscernible] residual budgets but do expect that will continue this year and also think margins in the segment will expand in the fourth quarter over where they were reported in the third.
Given all that, we look now to guidance update, next slide. The guidance were increasing our full year guidance from $4.20 to $4.30 to $4.29 to $4.33. Now we started out this year with guidance at $3.82 to $4.02. We increased our load when guidance be $0.47. So at $4.29 to $4.33, that results in Q4 at $1.18 to $1.22 and our full year operating cash flow will exceed $575 million on that revenue.
Next slide. If you look at a summary here before we get into the Q&A period. What we have is the best quarter in the history of the company. It's the highest level of sales, orders, backlog, net earnings, operating and free cash flow ever. Organic sales came in at plus 13%, largely driven by new products and new applications to existing customers and then favorable niche markets. We're really not seeing any slowdown in any activity and any of things that we might consider to be bellwether items that would say things are getting slower. We're just not seeing that. Very broad-based momentum us we entered the fourth quarter, which has allowed us to increase our guidance. Our gross margins at 53.7%, certainly best-in-class. Operating margin at 23.5%, with 36% over leverage and new revenue, I think, again probably best-in-class. Operating cash flow at 23% of sales is nothing short of spectacular. And really, a new milestone for us, it's just as we said, I don't think people are focused how much our EBITDA is growing. But our cash flow, operating cash flow, in the last 2 years has exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history and if you think about those acquisitions in the last 2 years at $1.1 billion, cash flow were over $1 billion, and we give you some idea about our capacity and transactions looking forward and the cash machine that we've created here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions, John."

And now you're not seeing any debt [indiscernible] from those folks. So that has an effect both on the reality and the attitude of people. Debt stables in the U.S. have dropped. I think it's hard for most people to get a debt funding towards transaction more than 5x EBITDA and so that trends the multiple [indiscernible] down. They're going to put a lot more equity than they would have before when the debt stable was much higher. Furthermore, the spreads for them and the blended cost of their interest to get a deal done are higher now than they were if spreads have gone up a bit and the mentioned portion of the that. So we're seeing multiples come down a little bit.

I would not expect there's always this kind of United full situation we could have 2 or 3 of those but we're kind of patiently waiting for the right balance here. People still are worried about CMS reimbursement and medical, so that's an area you we have to be actually carefully in and in the software side, we've got things going that we like a lot.

As you know, the only real exposure that we have in this type of raw material inputs cost is in copper and it goes into our Neptune business. And Neptune we've done a couple of smart things. One, with the redesign of the residential water meter, which reduces the amount of material content as well as improves the quality for the customers which is real positive thing for that. That mitigate some of that exposure. And then we also just entered into supply agreements that are usually 6 to 9 months out, which gives us a little bit better visibility at what the cost structure is going to look like on the input side which allows us to still be able to manage the price equation in no way this doesn't really try of the customers around all the time in that end market.

Upgrading compressors, that had been sold by OEMs with the OEMs controls on them. And it was at the time where there was a very large market for Compressor Controls and actually working with OEMs to put the controls on initially rather than retrofitting them later. But never really developed because most of these compressor makers wanted to make their own controls and sell their own controls and it was only 1% or 2% of the cost of the compressor. Anyways, so I think Compressor Controls continue to operate in the aftermarket. Now is this a change, is this a wedge into the OEM putting the controls directly under compressors when they're shipped from the factory?"

And United Controls has, I wouldn't say had a total lock on Rolls-Royce but, certainly been a significantly player for them.

We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up",2707,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up to questions and answers. 
So first slide. If we look at the Q3 financial results, once again, they're an all-time record for any quarter in the history of the company, not just a record third quarter. Orders were at the highest level in history, sales, the same. Backlog, highest level. Net earnings, our highest level, and operating and free cash flow in the quarter set a new standard for the company. Our total sales in the quarter were up 18% and organic sales were up 13%, which was frankly better than expected. 
Our book-to-bill was greater than 1 for the 9th straight quarter and our record backlog of $876 million is up $106 million from the third quarter a year ago. Operating margins were terrific throughout the enterprise, they were up 230 basis points so that operating margin was 23.5% of revenue in the quarter. Our EBITDA was $203 million in the quarter, just fairly astonishing number by any standard, and EBITDA margin was 28.6%. Our operating cash flow was 23% of sales at $167 million and our free cash flow was 22% of sales at $157 million.
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you should see that bookings again were above 1, at 1.01. Net sales were, as we said, up 13% organically. Gross profit picked up 50 basis points from a year ago. Our operating income was up 30% from $128 million to $167 million, and margin at 23.5%, up from 21.2% in the third quarter a year ago. Our tax rate was actually a headwind in the quarter year. In the third quarter last year, it's only 25.9%. As most of you would know, third quarter results tend to have whatever rollover there is in that 104A calculation for filing tax returns. This year, our tax rate was 27.7%, a 180 basis points increase over the prior year, which took a couple of pennies out of our results. 
Net earnings were $110 million, up 31% from the prior year and our diluted earnings per share were $1.12 versus $0.87.
Next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter was truly spectacular. 22% of revenue and 142% of net earnings, so it'd be the 14th consecutive year that our free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. And really, we had very strong execution throughout the family of businesses. And you can see the comparisons to prior year here on the graph.
Next slide. We had quite substantial EBITDA gross. I'm not sure people caught up to just how much our trailing EBITDA continues to grow. We're up 33% in EBITDA over the prior year and our trailing 12 months EBITDA now ending the third quarter is $779 million. That's up from $585 million in the corresponding trailing 12-month period ended in the third quarter of '10, and up from $507 million in 2009. Part of the reason for that is continued margin expansion. Our EBITDA margins in 2009 were 24.5% for that TTM period. In 2010, they were up 140 basis points to 25.9% and this year they skyrocketed to 28.5% from 25.9%.
Next slide. Our asset velocity performance continues to be best-in-class. You can see inventory has actually dropped to 7.4% from 8.9% just 2 years ago. Our receivables are down 200 basis points to 14.7% from 16.7%, just a terrific performance by all our field operating units around receivables. And payables and accruals have actually come down, our numbers would be even more spectacular. So in total, when we look at the inventory plus receivables minus payables and accruals, we finished the quarter at 6.5%. That's 240 basis points better than just 2 years ago. So our exceptional performance in that category continues.
Next slide. Here we look at sort of balance sheet and financial position. We ended the quarter with $246 million in cash. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $779 million. Our gross debt number is $1,174,000,000. If you take that $246 million and cash away, you got net debt at $928 million. Shareholder equity continues to be strong there, in excess of $3 billion, meaning our net debt-to-net cap number is about 23%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.5x, so we have very ample capacity inside anything we'd like to do. And our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is over 12x. Now in the last 2 years, we invested $1.1 billion in transactions. But as you can see, the balance sheet is stronger than ever.
Next slide. So here we'll take a look at our segment performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Next slide. Our Q3 segment performance was remarkably similar. You can see EBITDA margins in industrial, RF and medical all were 31%, and energy, they were 29%. The OP margins continue to march forward as we have revenue growth and we capture leverage associated with that and throughout the enterprise, we're very happy with the margin performance.
Next slide. If we go to the largest segment in the quarter was RF Technology. It had sales up 19%, operating profit was up 41% and the operating profit margin reached 23.8%, up 380 basis points from the corresponding period in the prior year. Orders exceeded revenue. If you look at the specific commentary here, by the way, the leverage there on incremental revenue was about 44%. So we had very strong growth throughout the segment, organic sales, up 15%. The software businesses had double-digit organic growth, with particular tribute to CBORD, who continues to have quite spectacular performance around Integrated Security Solutions that we provide the universities. That business has nearly doubled this year compared to last. Our Freight Matching business grew at a double-digit rate as we've got more new subscribers and their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market due to volatility in gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. 
Our Toll & Traffic Solutions business, which is less than half of the segment, we remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade where we're converting Puerto Rico from a coin-base technology to an electronic technology and we have strong tag shipments in several locations around the world.
In the fourth quarter, looking forward, we're going to continue to benefit from this electronic tolling project in Puerto Rico. Our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement, even given what we had here in the third quarter. We think we'll even do a bit better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France, where we've been installing a system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that will allow us to get our data services revenue, which comes in at lower revenue but much higher margins.
Next slide. Here, looking at the industrial technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune because it's traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here, our orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. Sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16% and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. 
Fluid handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner, driven really by all the shale, gas and oil activity that's occurring in Canada and the U.S. Lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. 
And then in Neptune in North American meter revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the U.S. order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the U.S. We had a very successful launch of our low-profile, lead-free residential water meter. A lot of people currently haven't checked the Shed The Lead video that we have and it certainly created a lot of interest in our water meter business. 
So we look to Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the energy business and we haven't seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double-digit growth, led by the Toronto installation activity, which is going to start to pick up in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. 
And then our favorable end markets are pretty much generally true in the -- so just so we are not doing well in the 30-plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope it'll improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next.
If we go next slide. If you look here at the Medical and Scientific Imaging segment, it was up 16% in revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%. So we had strong leverage here, about 34%. And the OP margin increased 150 basis points to 24.7%. Our high-end imaging solutions driven largely by Gatan's quantum and direct detection camera lines are continuing to perform in a fantastic way and we have a new product out there that's processing frame speeds at 83 gigabytes a second. I'm not sure anybody could relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it's the leading-edge technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year. 
The medical platform continues to perform well. The adoption rates for both Bladderscan and GlideScope continue to escalate. We continue to gain ground internationally in terms of consumables and our ultrasound business and our couch top patient positioning technology for the MRI processes is beginning to gain momentum. There's a lot of favorable papers, write-ups and comments about this, and we think it will be a long-term winning proposition for the enterprise. 
In the third quarter, on an order comparison basis, we got very tough comps because of 2 things that happened last year. We do report our Rugged Mobile business in here, which is certainly not key to the enterprise but it had a particularly strong Q3 order for long-term delivery last year, which, of course, wouldn't have been repeated in any one quarter. So it's a new initiation of an order. And then we had very strong dosage delivery business last year, and this year was more normalized. So both of that created a bit a headwind in terms of comps. But if you mask, take that the way, the book-to-bill was above 1, sequentially higher than the second quarter, and our backlog is stong so we don't expect any difficulty here.
In the fourth quarter, we wind up, of course, with record backlog entering the quarter. So that kind of assures our shipment pattern should be fine. We expect to have continued growth in medical because the patient treatment technologies that were involved and our continuing to grow. We have a higher fourth quarter because Northern Digital, which was acquired, will begin to kick in. It has traditionally strong seasonality in the fourth quarter and we haven't seen anything that wouldn't suggest that will occur here.
Next slide. Here when we get to energy systems and controls, you can see once again very strong performance. Sales were up 22%. Orders were just slightly ahead of sales, up 12%. Operating profit was up 35% and our OP margins expanded 250 basis points to 25.7%. Growth again is led by the continued development of the diesel engine safety system technology and that continues to get this U.S. and North American shale activity. We've got some new engine OEMs that are building the technology into their platforms and that helps us well. We had a record Q3 in terms of our instrument sales around the refinery business, so that seems to be picking up steam. It had been slow. It had been much better this year, but still relatively slow. One of the very few businesses that's not back to the 2008 results and now that's largely there. 
We had an expansion in our Alpha, Viatran and Dynisco family of businesses around sensor technologies. They've been up over 30% here for instrumentation to measure composites and process manufacturing. And just excellent execution throughout the segment with the exception of our nuclear techs business, which has been very soft due to the nuclear plant shutdowns around the world. But fortunately, it's not a big piece of the total. 
In the fourth quarter, we will benefit from an acquisition that we made right at the end of the third quarter for United Controls. United Controls is a small business in the Midwest, which has a large OEM component with Rolls-Royce. It's got great field service, technical support and its technologies is very complementary to our compressor control business. We've done very little historically with Rolls-Royce and so this gives us a new partner in effect to provide field service and aftermarket application for technology improvements. And it certainly expands our OEM channel access. 
In the oil and gas area, the trends just continue to perform exceptionally well and there's no downturn of any kind I think expected this year or early next. And seasonality here has always been very important. In the fourth quarter, there's a lot of MRO purchases that tend to get done in the fourth quarter with residual budgets but we expect that would continue this year. And we also think margins in the segment will expand in the fourth quarter over where they were reported in the third.
Given all that, we look now to guidance update, next slide. The guidance, we're increasing our full year guidance from $4.20 to $4.30 to $4.29 to $4.33. Now we started out this year with guidance at $3.82 to $4.02. And when we look, we've actually now increased our low-end guidance by $0.47. So at $4.29 to $4.33, that results in Q4 at $1.18 to $1.22. And our full year operating cash flow will exceed $575 million on that revenue.
Next slide. If you look at a summary here before we get into the Q&A period, what we have is the best quarter in the history of the company. It's the highest level of sales, orders, backlog, net earnings, operating and free cash flow ever. Organic sales came in at plus 13%, largely driven by new products and new applications to existing customers and then to favorable niche markets. We're really not seeing any slowdown in any activity and any of things that we might consider to be bellwether items that would say things are getting slower. We're just -- we're not seeing that. Very broad-based momentum as we entered the fourth quarter, which has allowed us to increase our guidance. Our gross margin is at 53.7%, certainly best-in-class. Operating margin is at 23.5%, with 36% overall leverage and new [ph] revenue, I think, again probably best-in-class. Operating cash flow at 23% of sales is nothing short of spectacular. And really, a new milestone for us, it's just as we've said, I don't think people are focused on just how much our EBITDA is growing. But our cash flow, our operating cash flow now in the last 2 years has exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. And if you think about those acquisitions in the last 2 years at $1.1 billion and cash flow over $1 billion, and we give you some idea about our capacity in transactions looking forward and the cash machine that we've created here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions, John."

As we said, orders are -- in the U.S. for them went up over 10% in the third quarter. So that's really not a problem area for us at the moment. And in fact, I think the municipal funding has started to pick up a little steam with community bond so we were worried about that going into the year and it certainly outperformed our peers. It's not as a robust as it was in the past but new products and applications and selling some software along with data collection helps that. In the image area, you have the NIH situation in the U.S. and then similar situation in Japan. Total of which people fear is a little slow but the technologies we've launched through our research scientists are so compelling that they really blown through any of that risk. We're not seeing anything that would be measured as softness that would be driven by the National Institute of Health Funding or really the Japanese. You see a little more of that actually in Europe than you do here. But nothing that's much of a headwind. So that's actually better than we would expected in the radio frequency arena, again the applications we have tend to be cash registers for people. So really they're not really viewed as capital spending. I think if they weren't delivering sort of immediate paybacks for people, we'd be more worried than they are. We certainly performed better in the third quarter on an order-end sales basis than we would have expected because we do occasionally listen to the news and manage, if you look at all the externalities should be scared to death. But fortunately, our businesses are so  niche-y and so specific and value-added that those externalities haven't had much effect on us at this time. So we're not seeing nor does anybody feel fearful about the fourth quarter or frankly next year."

And then the strategic for investment controls, so material to them. Pipeline remains very full. We have continuing activity and a lot going on there. I think we've finally seen a little breakdown in Europe where the European banks are offering very much support for us. Not too long ago you were seeing 6.5x debt staples from those folks and now you're not seeing any debt staples from those folks. So that has an effect both on the reality and the attitude of people. Debt staples in the U.S. have dropped. I think it's hard for most people to get a debt funding towards transaction more than about 5x EBITDA and so that trends the multiple down as we're not going to put in a whole lot more equity than they would have before when the debt staple was much higher. Furthermore, the spreads for them and the blended cost of their interest to get a deal that are higher now than they were if spreads brought up a bit on the mezzanine portion of the debt. So we're seeing multiples come down a little bit. Sell orders are still -- their expectations throughout the year were too high. It's one of the reasons that, with our disciplined approach, we have large transaction but we continue to look at a number of large transactions. And sometime, I think in the foreseeable future, we'll execute on something. Most of the deals we're looking at are relatively large and I wouldn't expect that there's always this kind of the United full situation, we could have 2 or 3 of those, but we're kind of patiently waiting for the right balance here. People still are worried about CMS reimbursement on medical, so that's an area you have to be exceptionally careful in. And in the software side, we've got things going that we like a lot. And it's just the price gap kind of discussion. And we're patient and ultimately it's better to be patient. We don't need to do a deal because a deal is available. We need to do a deal because it makes sense for our institutional holders and our shareholders."

It gives us confidence that our businesses are doing the right things with respect to pricing and heading off any material cost for inflation. As you know, the only real exposure that we have any type of raw material input cost is in copper and it goes into our Neptune business. And Neptune has really done a couple of very smart things. One, with the redesign of the residential water meter, which reduces the amount of material content as well as improves the quality for the customers, which is a real positive thing. So that mitigates some of that exposure. And then we also just entered into supply agreements that are usually 6 to 9 months out, which gives us a little bit better visibility at what the cost structure is going to look like on the input side, which allows us to still be able to manage the price equation in a way that doesn't really jerk the customers around all the time in that end market. So those are the things that we look at, and so we're confident that our businesses have done the right things on price/cost as long as we continue to have the gross profit margins where we see them."

Viatran in northern New York, which is a sensor-related business that goes into oil and gas and supports some of the technology they need to know about reading information on sensors.

And the dollar that we gain for an incremental student is very low. So it's really how much of a suite of services and data collection technologies they buy that's critical. So if it's a turnkey installation where somebody is putting in electronic locking mechanisms and parking control and crude management and nutrition management, they're generally going start out with a portion of the activity or try it in an area as opposed to putting in at the entire university. So the system grows over time into a full mature suite of applications and becomes very valuable.

And now we've been very fortunate in the last 2 years to displace another competitor in several locations and we look forward to continuing to do that. And we have an awful lot of equity and activity and Obama. [ph] We just finished a CBORD user conference within the last couple of weeks with hundreds and hundreds of people in attendance. And there's over 500 different kinds of people who attend this conference that are thinking about ways to use our software and system data collection technologies in a variety of ways around the campus. So it's a mind-share thing that drives the growth sort of more than the, ""Gosh, I got the largest university in the country."" I mean, it could be that the smallest one would get you more revenue than a large one because the amount of c activity they're purchasing and the number of cards and applications that they're applying it to if it's sort of long-winded answer but it's the truth."

Upgrading compressors that had been sold by OEMs with the OEMs controls on them. And it was at the time that there was a very large market for Compressor Controls in actually working with OEMs to put the controls on initially rather than retrofitting them later. But that really never developed because most of these compressor makers wanted to make their own controls and sell their own controls and was only 1% or 2% of the cost of the compressor. Anyway, so I think Compressor Controls continued to operate in the aftermarket. Now is this a change, is this a wedge into the OEM putting the controls directly under compressors when they're shipped from the factory?"

And United Controls has, I wouldn't say had a total lock on Rolls-Royce but, certainly been a very significantly player for them.

We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up",2707,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up to questions and answers. 
So first slide. If we look at the Q3 financial results, once again, they're an all-time record for any quarter in the history of the company, not just a record third quarter. Orders were at the highest level in history, sales, the same. Backlog, highest level, net earnings, a highest level, and operating and free cash flow in the quarter set a new standard for the company. Our total sales in the quarter were up 18% and organic sales were up 13%, which was frankly better than expected. 
Our book-to-bill was greater than one for the 9th straight quarter and our record backlog of $876 million is up $106 million from the third quarter a year ago. Operating margins were terrific throughout the enterprise, they were up 230 basis points so that operating margin was 23½% of revenue in the quarter. Our EBITDA was $203 million in the quarter, a fairly astonishing number by any standard, and EBITDA margin was 28.6%. Our operating cash flow was 23% of sales at $167 million and our free cash flow was 22% of sales at $157 million.
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you should see that bookings again were above 1, at 1.01. Net sales were, as we said, up 13% organically. Gross profit picked up 50 basis points from a year ago. Our operating income was up 30% from $128 million to $167 million, and margin at 23 ½%, up from 21.2% in the third quarter a year ago. Our tax rate was actually a headwind in the quarter year. In the third quarter last year, it's only 25.9%. As most of you would know, third quarter results tend to have whatever rollover there is in that 104A calculation for filing tax returns. This year, our tax rate was 27.7%, a 180 basis points increase over the prior year, which took a couple a pennies out of our results. 
Net earnings were $110 million, up 31% from the prior year and our diluted earnings per share were $1.12 versus $0.87.
Next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter was truly spectacular. 22% of revenue and 142% of net earnings, so it'd be the 14th consecutive year that our free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. And really, we had very strong execution throughout the family of businesses. And you can see the comparisons prior year here on the graph.
Next slide. We had quite substantial EBITDA gross. I'm not sure people caught up to just how much our trailing EBITDA continues to grow. We're up 33% in EBITDA over the prior year and our trailing 12 months EBITDA now ending the third quarter is $779 million. That's up from $585 million in the corresponding trailing 12-month period ended in the third quarter of '10, and up from $507 million in 2009. Part of the reason for that is continued margin expansion. Our EBITDA margins in 2009 were 24 ½% for that TTM period. In 2010, they were up 140 basis points to 25.9% and this year they've skyrocketed to 28 ½% from 25.9%.
Next slide. Our asset velocity performance continues to be best-in-class. You can see inventory has actually dropped to 7.4% from 8.9% just 2 years ago. Our receivables are down 200 basis points to 14.7% from 16.7%, just a terrific performance by all our field operating units around receivables. And payables and accruals have actually come down, or our numbers would be even more spectacular. So in total, when we look at the inventory plus receivables minus payables and accruals, we finished the quarter at 6 ½%. That's 240 basis points better than just 2 years ago. So our exceptional performance in that category continues.
Next slide. Here we look at our sort of balance sheet and financial position. We ended the quarter with $246 million in cash. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $779 million. Our gross debt number is $1,174,000,000. If you take that $246 million and cash away, you got net debt at $928 million. Shareholder equity continues to be strong there, in excess of $3 billion, meaning our net debt-to-net cap number is about 23%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.5x, so we have very ample capacity inside anything we'd like to do. And our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is over 12x. Now in the last 2 years, we invested $1.1 billion in transactions. But as you can see, the balance sheet is stronger than ever.
Next slide. So here we'll take a look at our segment performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Next slide. Our Q3 segment performance was remarkably similar. You can see EBITDA margins in industrial, RF and medical all were 31%, and energy, they were 29%. The OP margins continue to march forward as we have revenue growth and we capture leverage associated with that and throughout the enterprise, we're very happy with the margin performance.
Next slide. If we go to the largest segment in the quarter was RF Technology. It had sales up 19%, operating profit was up 41% and the operating profit margin reached 23.8%, up 380 basis points from the corresponding period in the prior year. Orders exceeded revenue. If you look at the specific commentary here, by the way, the leverage there on incremental revenue was about 44%. So we had very strong growth throughout the segment, organic sales, up 15%. The software businesses had double-digit organic growth, with particular tribute to CBORD, who continues to have quite spectacular performance around Integrated Security Solutions that we provide the universities. That business has nearly doubled this year compared to last. Our Freight Matching business grew at a double-digit rate as we've got more new subscribers and their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market due to volatility in gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. 
Our Toll & Traffic Solutions business, which is less than half of the segment, we remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade where we're converting Puerto Rico from a coin-base technology to an electronic technology and we had strong tag shipments in several locations around the world.
In the fourth quarter, looking forward, we're going to continue to benefit from this electronic tolling project in Puerto Rico. Our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement, even given what we had here in the third quarter. We think we'll even do a bit better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France, where we've been installing a system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that'll allow us to get our data services revenue, which comes in at lower revenue but much higher margins.
Next slide. Here, looking at the industrial technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune because it's traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here, orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. Sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16% and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. 
Fluid handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner, driven really by all the shale, gas and oil activity that's occurring in Canada and the U.S. Lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. 
And then in Neptune in North American meter revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the U.S. order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the U.S. We had a very successful launch of our low-profile, lead-free residential water meter. A lot of people have gone out and checked the Shed The Lead video that we have and it certainly created a lot of interest in our water meter business. 
So we look to Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the energy business and we haven't seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double-digit growth, led by the Toronto installation activity, which is going to start to pick up in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. 
And then our favorable end markets are pretty much generally true in the -- so just so we are not doing well in the 30-plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope it'll improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next.
If we go next slide. If you look here at the Medical and Scientific Imaging segment, it was up 16% in revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%. So we had strong leverage here, about 34%. And the OP margin increased 150 basis points to 24.7%. Our high-end imaging solutions driven largely by Gatan's quantum and direct detection camera lines are continuing to perform in a fantastic way and we have a new product out there that's processing frame speeds at 83 gigabytes a second. I'm not sure anybody could relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it's leading-edge technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year. 
The medical platform continues to perform well. The adoption rates for both Bladderscan and GlideScope continue to escalate. We continue to gain ground internationally in terms of consumables and our ultrasound business and our couch top patient positioning technology for the MRI processes is beginning to gain momentum. There's a lot of favorable papers, write-ups and comments about this, and we think it'll be a long-term winning proposition for the enterprise. 
In the third quarter, on an order comparison basis, we had very tough comps because of 2 things that happened last year. We do report our Rugged Mobile business in here, which is certainly not key to the enterprise but it had a particularly strong Q3 order for long-term delivery last year, which, of course, wouldn't have been repeated in any one quarter. So it's a new initiation of an order. And then we had very strong dosage delivery business last year, and this year was more normalized. So both of that created a bit a headwind in terms of comps. But if you mask, take that away, the book-to-bill was above one, sequentially higher than the second quarter, and our backlog is strong so we don't expect any difficulty here.
In the fourth quarter, we wind up, of course, with record backlog entering the quarter. So that kind of assures our shipment pattern should be fine. We expect to have continued growth in medical because the patient treatment technologies that were involved and our continuing to grow. We have a higher fourth quarter because Northern Digital, which was acquired, will begin to kick in. It has traditionally strong seasonality in the fourth quarter and we haven't seen anything that wouldn't suggest that will occur here.
Next slide. Here when we get to energy systems and controls, you can see once again very strong performance. Sales were up 22%. Orders were just slightly ahead of sales, up 12%. Operating profit was up 35% and our OP margins expanded 250 basis points to 25.7%. Growth again is led by the continued development of the diesel engine safety system technology and that continues to get this U.S. and North American shale activity. We've got some new engine OEMs that are building the technology into their platforms and that helps as well. We had a record Q3 in terms of our instrument sales around the refinery business, so that seems to be picking up steam. It had been slow. It had been much better this year, but still relatively slow. One of the very few businesses that's not back to the 2008 results and now that's largely there. 
We had an expansion in our Alpha, and Viatran and Dynisco family of businesses around sensor technologies. They've been up over 30% here for instrumentation to measure composites and process manufacturing. And just excellent execution throughout the segment with the exception of our nuclear techs business, which has been very soft due to the nuclear plant shutdowns around the world. But fortunately, it's not a big piece of the total. 
In the fourth quarter, we will benefit from an acquisition that we made right at the end of the third quarter called United Controls. United Controls is a small business in the Midwest, which has a large OEM component with Rolls-Royce. It's got great field service, technical support and its technology is very complementary to our compressor control business. We've done very little historically with Rolls-Royce and so this gives us a new partner in effect to provide field service and aftermarket application for technology improvements. And it certainly expands our OEM channel access. 
In the oil and gas area, the trends just continue to perform exceptionally well and there's no downturn of any kind expected this year or early next. And seasonality here has always been very important. At fourth quarter, there's a lot of MRO purchases that tend to get done in the fourth quarter with residual budgets, but we expect that would continue this year. And we also think margins in the segment will expand in the fourth quarter over where they were reported in the third.
Given all that, we look now to guidance update, next slide. The guidance, we're increasing our full year guidance from $4.20 to $4.30 to $4.29 to $4.33. Now we started out this year with guidance at $3.82 to $4.02. And when we look cumulatively, we've actually now increased our low-end guidance by $0.47. So at $4.29 to $4.33, that results in Q4 at $1.18 to $1.22. And our full year operating cash flow will exceed $575 million on that revenue.
Next slide. If you look at a summary here before we get into the Q&A period, what we have is the best quarter in the history of the company. It's the highest level of sales orders, backlog, net earnings, operating and free cash flow ever. Organic sales came in at plus 13%, largely driven by new products and new applications to existing customers and then to favorable niche markets. We're really not seeing any slowdown in any activity in any of things that we might consider to be bellwether items that would say things are getting slower. We're just -- we're not seeing that. Very broad-based momentum as we entered the fourth quarter, which has allowed us to increase our guidance. Our gross margin is at 53.7%, certainly best-in-class. Operating margin is at 23.5%, with 36% overall leverage a new revenue, again, I think probably best-in-class. Operating cash flow at 23% of sales is nothing short of spectacular. And really, a new milestone for us, it's just as we've said, I don't think people are focused on just how much our EBITDA is growing. But our cash flow, our operating cash flow now in the last 2 years has exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. And if you think about those acquisitions in the last 2 years at $1.1 billion and cash flow over $1 billion, and we give you some idea about our capacity in transactions looking forward and the cash machine that we've created here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions, John."

First, Brian, how are you thinking about the business whether it be in imaging or RF tag or industrial technology that bit touch areas that are at least in part funded by public sources, municipal sources, how are you feeling about those businesses heading into 2012?

As we said, orders are -- in the U.S. for them went up over 10% in the third quarter. So that's really not a problem area for us at the moment. And in fact, I think the municipal funding has started to pick up a little steam with community bond so we were worried about that going into the year and it certainly outperformed our fears. It's not as a robust as it was in the past but new products and applications and selling some software along with data collection helps that. In the image area, you have the NIH situation in the U.S. and then a similar situation in Japan, a total of which people fear is a little slow but the technologies we've launched through our research scientists are so compelling that they really blown through any of that risk. We're not seeing anything that would be measured as softness that would be driven by the National Institute of Health Funding or really the Japanese. You see a little more of that actually in Europe than you do here. But nothing that's much of a headwind. So that's actually better than we would've expected in the radio frequency arena, again the applications we have tend to be cash registers for people. So really they're not really viewed as capital spending. I think if they weren't delivering sort of immediate paybacks for people, we'd be more worried than they are. We certainly performed better in the third quarter on an order-end sales basis than we would have expected because we do occasionally listen to the news and manage, if you look at all the externalities you'd be scared to death. But fortunately, our businesses are so niche-y and so specific and value-added that those externalities haven't had much effect on us at this time. So we're not seeing nor does anybody feel fearful about the fourth quarter or frankly next year."

And then the lesser,  very strategic for compressor controls, so material to them. Pipeline remains very full. We have continuing activity and a lot going on there. I think we've finally seen a little breakdown in Europe where the European banks aren't offering very much support whereas not too long ago you were seeing 6.5x debt staples from those folks and now you're not seeing any debt staples from those folks. So that has an effect both on the reality and the attitude of people. Debt staples in the U.S. have dropped. I think it's hard for most people to get a debt funding for a transaction more than about 5x EBITDA and so that trends the multiple down as we're not going to put in a whole lot more equity than they would have before when the debt staple was much higher. Furthermore, the spreads for them and the blended cost of their interest to get a deal done are higher now than they were as spreads have gone up a bit on the mezzanine portion of the debt. So we're seeing multiples come down a little bit. Sell orders are still -- their expectations throughout the year were too high. It's one of the reasons that, with our disciplined approach, we haven't done a large transaction, but we continue to look at a number of large transactions. And sometime, I think in the foreseeable future, we'll execute on something. Most of the deals we're looking at are relatively large and I wouldn't expect that there's always this kind of the United full situation, we could have 2 or 3 of those, but we're kind of patiently waiting for the right balance here. People still are worried about CMS reimbursement on medical, so that's an area you have to be exceptionally careful in. And in the software side, we've got things going that we like a lot. And it's just a price gap kind of discussion. And we're patient and ultimately it's better to be patient. We don't need to do a deal because a deal is available. We need to do a deal because it makes sense for our institutional holders and our shareholders."

It gives us confidence that our businesses are doing the right things with respect to pricing and heading off any material cost push inflation. As you know, the only real exposure that we have any type of raw material input cost is in copper and it goes into our Neptune business. And Neptune has really done a couple of very smart things. One, with the redesign of the residential water meter, which reduces the amount of material content as well as improves the quality for the customers, which is a real positive thing. So that mitigates some of that exposure. And then we also just enter into supply agreements that are usually 6 to 9 months out, which gives us a little bit better visibility at what the cost structure is going to look like on the input side, which allows us to still be able to manage the price equation in a way that doesn't really jerk the customers around all the time in that end market. So those are the things that we look at, and so we're confident that our businesses have done the right things on price/cost as long as we continue to have the gross profit margins where we see them."

And the dollar that we gain for an incremental student is very low. So it's really how much of a suite of services and data collection technologies they buy that's critical. So if it's a turnkey installation where somebody is putting in electronic locking mechanisms and parking control and crude management and nutrition management, they're generally going start out with a portion of the activity or try it in an area as opposed to putting in at the entire university. So the system grows over time into a full mature suite of applications and becomes very valuable. So it's really how many new things can you win to sort of get your foot in the door with these people as they build it out. And now we've been very fortunate in the last 2 years to displace another competitor in several locations and we look forward to continuing to do that. And we have an awful lot of sweat equity and activity involved. We just finished a CBORD user conference within the last couple of weeks with hundreds and hundreds of people in attendance. And there's over 500 different kinds of people who attend this conference that are thinking about ways to use our software and system data collection technologies in a variety of ways around the campus. So it's a mind-share thing that drives the growth sort of more than the, ""Gosh, I got the largest university in the country."" I mean, it could be that the smallest one would get you more revenue than a large one because the amount of c activity they're purchasing and the number of cards and applications that they're applying it to if it's sort of long-winded answer but it's the truth."

Those meters, more standard meters, going into Mexico, which have a slightly different margin profile but still a nice win for us. But if you take a wider lens and look at just the U.S. for Neptune, really on the year-to-date basis, revenue was up kind of in a mid-single digit range and the orders continue to outpace sales.

We generally don't have contracts for people. We have long-term compensation programs for people. They're all involved with different forms of stock option and other stock criteria and then their cash bonus programs are related to improvement year-over-year in operating income. So if you think about going into any kind of a slow-growth environment, one of the reasons our people are so nimble in our opinion is that the only way they earn a bonus to drive continued performance is to get better in the new year than they were in the prior year. There's no sort of forgiveness for the fact that the market's difficult. So all these guys are prepared to be quite nimble. They have very strong operating people in all of those units and those people are -- they understand their compensation better than any of us do and I think we understand it quite well. So they're highly motivated about that and they have a very strong view of how stuff happens. And enterprise level, we're somewhat compensated the same way on a cash basis. So that sort of focuses attention here. We continue to add modestly to our corporate staff. We've got -- we've strengthened our legal area and tax area. We've brought in a couple of new executives this year that are dedicated to corporate development activity in software and medical orientation.

We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up",2707,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up to questions and answers. 
So first slide. If we look at the Q3 financial results, once again, they're an all-time record for any quarter in the history of the company, not just a record third quarter. Orders were at the highest level in history, sales, the same. Backlog, highest level, net earnings, a highest level, and operating and free cash flow in the quarter set a new standard for the company. Our total sales in the quarter were up 18% and organic sales were up 13%, which was frankly better than expected. 
Our book-to-bill was greater than one for the 9th straight quarter and our record backlog of $876 million is up $106 million from the third quarter a year ago. Operating margins were terrific throughout the enterprise, they were up 230 basis points so that operating margin was 23½% of revenue in the quarter. Our EBITDA was $203 million in the quarter, a fairly astonishing number by any standard, and EBITDA margin was 28.6%. Our operating cash flow was 23% of sales at $167 million and our free cash flow was 22% of sales at $157 million.
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you should see that bookings again were above 1, at 1.01. Net sales were, as we said, up 13% organically. Gross profit picked up 50 basis points from a year ago. Our operating income was up 30% from $128 million to $167 million, and margin at 23 ½%, up from 21.2% in the third quarter a year ago. Our tax rate was actually a headwind in the quarter year. In the third quarter last year, it's only 25.9%. As most of you would know, third quarter results tend to have whatever rollover there is in that 104A calculation for filing tax returns. This year, our tax rate was 27.7%, a 180 basis points increase over the prior year, which took a couple a pennies out of our results. 
Net earnings were $110 million, up 31% from the prior year and our diluted earnings per share were $1.12 versus $0.87.
Next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter was truly spectacular. 22% of revenue and 142% of net earnings, so it'd be the 14th consecutive year that our free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. And really, we had very strong execution throughout the family of businesses. And you can see the comparisons prior year here on the graph.
Next slide. We had quite substantial EBITDA gross. I'm not sure people caught up to just how much our trailing EBITDA continues to grow. We're up 33% in EBITDA over the prior year and our trailing 12 months EBITDA now ending the third quarter is $779 million. That's up from $585 million in the corresponding trailing 12-month period ended in the third quarter of '10, and up from $507 million in 2009. Part of the reason for that is continued margin expansion. Our EBITDA margins in 2009 were 24 ½% for that TTM period. In 2010, they were up 140 basis points to 25.9% and this year they've skyrocketed to 28 ½% from 25.9%.
Next slide. Our asset velocity performance continues to be best-in-class. You can see inventory has actually dropped to 7.4% from 8.9% just 2 years ago. Our receivables are down 200 basis points to 14.7% from 16.7%, just a terrific performance by all our field operating units around receivables. And payables and accruals have actually come down, or our numbers would be even more spectacular. So in total, when we look at the inventory plus receivables minus payables and accruals, we finished the quarter at 6 ½%. That's 240 basis points better than just 2 years ago. So our exceptional performance in that category continues.
Next slide. Here we look at our sort of balance sheet and financial position. We ended the quarter with $246 million in cash. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $779 million. Our gross debt number is $1,174,000,000. If you take that $246 million and cash away, you got net debt at $928 million. Shareholder equity continues to be strong there, in excess of $3 billion, meaning our net debt-to-net cap number is about 23%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.5x, so we have very ample capacity inside anything we'd like to do. And our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is over 12x. Now in the last 2 years, we invested $1.1 billion in transactions. But as you can see, the balance sheet is stronger than ever.
Next slide. So here we'll take a look at our segment performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Next slide. Our Q3 segment performance was remarkably similar. You can see EBITDA margins in industrial, RF and medical all were 31%, and energy, they were 29%. The OP margins continue to march forward as we have revenue growth and we capture leverage associated with that and throughout the enterprise, we're very happy with the margin performance.
Next slide. If we go to the largest segment in the quarter was RF Technology. It had sales up 19%, operating profit was up 41% and the operating profit margin reached 23.8%, up 380 basis points from the corresponding period in the prior year. Orders exceeded revenue. If you look at the specific commentary here, by the way, the leverage there on incremental revenue was about 44%. So we had very strong growth throughout the segment, organic sales, up 15%. The software businesses had double-digit organic growth, with particular tribute to CBORD, who continues to have quite spectacular performance around Integrated Security Solutions that we provide the universities. That business has nearly doubled this year compared to last. Our Freight Matching business grew at a double-digit rate as we've got more new subscribers and their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market due to volatility in gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. 
Our Toll & Traffic Solutions business, which is less than half of the segment, we remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade where we're converting Puerto Rico from a coin-base technology to an electronic technology and we had strong tag shipments in several locations around the world.
In the fourth quarter, looking forward, we're going to continue to benefit from this electronic tolling project in Puerto Rico. Our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement, even given what we had here in the third quarter. We think we'll even do a bit better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France, where we've been installing a system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that'll allow us to get our data services revenue, which comes in at lower revenue but much higher margins.
Next slide. Here, looking at the industrial technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune because it's traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here, orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. Sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16% and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. 
Fluid handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner, driven really by all the shale, gas and oil activity that's occurring in Canada and the U.S. Lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. 
And then in Neptune in North American meter revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the U.S. order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the U.S. We had a very successful launch of our low-profile, lead-free residential water meter. A lot of people have gone out and checked the Shed The Lead video that we have and it certainly created a lot of interest in our water meter business. 
So we look to Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the energy business and we haven't seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double-digit growth, led by the Toronto installation activity, which is going to start to pick up in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. 
And then our favorable end markets are pretty much generally true in the -- so just so we are not doing well in the 30-plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope it'll improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next.
If we go next slide. If you look here at the Medical and Scientific Imaging segment, it was up 16% in revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%. So we had strong leverage here, about 34%. And the OP margin increased 150 basis points to 24.7%. Our high-end imaging solutions driven largely by Gatan's quantum and direct detection camera lines are continuing to perform in a fantastic way and we have a new product out there that's processing frame speeds at 83 gigabytes a second. I'm not sure anybody could relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it's leading-edge technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year. 
The medical platform continues to perform well. The adoption rates for both Bladderscan and GlideScope continue to escalate. We continue to gain ground internationally in terms of consumables and our ultrasound business and our couch top patient positioning technology for the MRI processes is beginning to gain momentum. There's a lot of favorable papers, write-ups and comments about this, and we think it'll be a long-term winning proposition for the enterprise. 
In the third quarter, on an order comparison basis, we had very tough comps because of 2 things that happened last year. We do report our Rugged Mobile business in here, which is certainly not key to the enterprise but it had a particularly strong Q3 order for long-term delivery last year, which, of course, wouldn't have been repeated in any one quarter. So it's a new initiation of an order. And then we had very strong dosage delivery business last year, and this year was more normalized. So both of that created a bit a headwind in terms of comps. But if you mask, take that away, the book-to-bill was above one, sequentially higher than the second quarter, and our backlog is strong so we don't expect any difficulty here.
In the fourth quarter, we wind up, of course, with record backlog entering the quarter. So that kind of assures our shipment pattern should be fine. We expect to have continued growth in medical because the patient treatment technologies that were involved and our continuing to grow. We have a higher fourth quarter because Northern Digital, which was acquired, will begin to kick in. It has traditionally strong seasonality in the fourth quarter and we haven't seen anything that wouldn't suggest that will occur here.
Next slide. Here when we get to energy systems and controls, you can see once again very strong performance. Sales were up 22%. Orders were just slightly ahead of sales, up 12%. Operating profit was up 35% and our OP margins expanded 250 basis points to 25.7%. Growth again is led by the continued development of the diesel engine safety system technology and that continues to get this U.S. and North American shale activity. We've got some new engine OEMs that are building the technology into their platforms and that helps as well. We had a record Q3 in terms of our instrument sales around the refinery business, so that seems to be picking up steam. It had been slow. It had been much better this year, but still relatively slow. One of the very few businesses that's not back to the 2008 results and now that's largely there. 
We had an expansion in our Alpha, and Viatran and Dynisco family of businesses around sensor technologies. They've been up over 30% here for instrumentation to measure composites and process manufacturing. And just excellent execution throughout the segment with the exception of our nuclear techs business, which has been very soft due to the nuclear plant shutdowns around the world. But fortunately, it's not a big piece of the total. 
In the fourth quarter, we will benefit from an acquisition that we made right at the end of the third quarter called United Controls. United Controls is a small business in the Midwest, which has a large OEM component with Rolls-Royce. It's got great field service, technical support and its technology is very complementary to our compressor control business. We've done very little historically with Rolls-Royce and so this gives us a new partner in effect to provide field service and aftermarket application for technology improvements. And it certainly expands our OEM channel access. 
In the oil and gas area, the trends just continue to perform exceptionally well and there's no downturn of any kind expected this year or early next. And seasonality here has always been very important. At fourth quarter, there's a lot of MRO purchases that tend to get done in the fourth quarter with residual budgets, but we expect that would continue this year. And we also think margins in the segment will expand in the fourth quarter over where they were reported in the third.
Given all that, we look now to guidance update, next slide. The guidance, we're increasing our full year guidance from $4.20 to $4.30 to $4.29 to $4.33. Now we started out this year with guidance at $3.82 to $4.02. And when we look cumulatively, we've actually now increased our low-end guidance by $0.47. So at $4.29 to $4.33, that results in Q4 at $1.18 to $1.22. And our full year operating cash flow will exceed $575 million on that revenue.
Next slide. If you look at a summary here before we get into the Q&A period, what we have is the best quarter in the history of the company. It's the highest level of sales orders, backlog, net earnings, operating and free cash flow ever. Organic sales came in at plus 13%, largely driven by new products and new applications to existing customers and then to favorable niche markets. We're really not seeing any slowdown in any activity in any of things that we might consider to be bellwether items that would say things are getting slower. We're just -- we're not seeing that. Very broad-based momentum as we entered the fourth quarter, which has allowed us to increase our guidance. Our gross margin is at 53.7%, certainly best-in-class. Operating margin is at 23.5%, with 36% overall leverage a new revenue, again, I think probably best-in-class. Operating cash flow at 23% of sales is nothing short of spectacular. And really, a new milestone for us, it's just as we've said, I don't think people are focused on just how much our EBITDA is growing. But our cash flow, our operating cash flow now in the last 2 years has exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. And if you think about those acquisitions in the last 2 years at $1.1 billion and cash flow over $1 billion, and we give you some idea about our capacity in transactions looking forward and the cash machine that we've created here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions, John."

As we said, orders are -- in the U.S. for them went up over 10% in the third quarter. So that's really not a problem area for us at the moment. And in fact, I think the municipal funding has started to pick up a little steam with community bond so we were worried about that going into the year and it certainly outperformed our fears. It's not as a robust as it was in the past but new products and applications and selling some software along with data collection helps that. In the image area, you have the NIH situation in the U.S. and then a similar situation in Japan, a total of which people fear is a little slow but the technologies we've launched through our research scientists are so compelling that they really blown through any of that risk. We're not seeing anything that would be measured as softness that would be driven by the National Institute of Health Funding or really the Japanese. You see a little more of that actually in Europe than you do here. But nothing that's much of a headwind. So that's actually better than we would've expected in the radio frequency arena, again the applications we have tend to be cash registers for people. So really they're not really viewed as capital spending. I think if they weren't delivering sort of immediate paybacks for people, we'd be more worried than they are. We certainly performed better in the third quarter on an order-end sales basis than we would have expected because we do occasionally listen to the news and manage, if you look at all the externalities you'd be scared to death. But fortunately, our businesses are so niche-y and so specific and value-added that those externalities haven't had much effect on us at this time. So we're not seeing nor does anybody feel fearful about the fourth quarter or frankly next year."

And then the lesser,  very strategic for compressor controls, so material to them. Pipeline remains very full. We have continuing activity and a lot going on there. I think we've finally seen a little breakdown in Europe where the European banks aren't offering very much support whereas not too long ago you were seeing 6.5x debt staples from those folks and now you're not seeing any debt staples from those folks. So that has an effect both on the reality and the attitude of people. Debt staples in the U.S. have dropped. I think it's hard for most people to get a debt funding for a transaction more than about 5x EBITDA and so that trends the multiple down as we're not going to put in a whole lot more equity than they would have before when the debt staple was much higher. Furthermore, the spreads for them and the blended cost of their interest to get a deal done are higher now than they were as spreads have gone up a bit on the mezzanine portion of the debt. So we're seeing multiples come down a little bit. Sell orders are still -- their expectations throughout the year were too high. It's one of the reasons that, with our disciplined approach, we haven't done a large transaction, but we continue to look at a number of large transactions. And sometime, I think in the foreseeable future, we'll execute on something. Most of the deals we're looking at are relatively large and I wouldn't expect that there's always this kind of the United full situation, we could have 2 or 3 of those, but we're kind of patiently waiting for the right balance here. People still are worried about CMS reimbursement on medical, so that's an area you have to be exceptionally careful in. And in the software side, we've got things going that we like a lot. And it's just a price gap kind of discussion. And we're patient and ultimately it's better to be patient. We don't need to do a deal because a deal is available. We need to do a deal because it makes sense for our institutional holders and our shareholders."

Those always have to be looked in combination with each other. And so what we always track is our gross profit margin. And the fact that gross profits came in at 53.7% and up 50 basis points from where we were at this point last year. It gives us confidence that our businesses are doing the right things with respect to pricing and heading off any material cost push inflation. As you know, the only real exposure that we have any type of raw material input cost is in copper and it goes into our Neptune business. And Neptune has really done a couple of very smart things. One, with the redesign of the residential water meter, which reduces the amount of material content as well as improves the quality for the customers, which is a real positive thing. So that mitigates some of that exposure. And then we also just enter into supply agreements that are usually 6 to 9 months out, which gives us a little bit better visibility at what the cost structure is going to look like on the input side, which allows us to still be able to manage the price equation in a way that doesn't really jerk the customers around all the time in that end market. So those are the things that we look at, and so we're confident that our businesses have done the right things on price/cost as long as we continue to have the gross profit margins where we see them."

Then the diesel shut-off valve is really making sure that all these diesel engines in fact do shut off instead of continue to run after somebody turned it off. Now we also have a couple other businesses, Viatran in northern New York, which is a sensor-related business that goes into oil and gas and supports some of the technology they need to know about reading information on sensors. So there's really about 6 different businesses. They don't go to market under one common sales force because it's not how that business works. So they share customers and talk about things with people but generally, different influences are making volume decisions about it. So you have to call through our channel, mostly direct to the end user or mine itself. And it does get closer and closer to mining applications, which is increasingly interesting to us."

And the dollar that we gain for an incremental student is very low. So it's really how much of a suite of services and data collection technologies they buy that's critical. So if it's a turnkey installation where somebody is putting in electronic locking mechanisms and parking control and crude management and nutrition management, they're generally going start out with a portion of the activity or try it in an area as opposed to putting in at the entire university. So the system grows over time into a full mature suite of applications and becomes very valuable.

And there's over 500 different kinds of people who attend this conference that are thinking about ways to use our software and system data collection technologies in a variety of ways around the campus.

Upgrading compressors that had been sold by OEMs with the OEMs controls on them. And it was thought the time that there was a very large market for Compressor Controls in actually working with OEMs to put the controls on initially rather than retrofitting them later. But that really never developed because most of these compressor makers wanted to make their own controls and sell their own controls and was only 1% or 2% of the cost of the compressor. Anyway, so I think Compressor Controls continued to operate in the aftermarket. Now is this a change, is this a wedge into the OEM putting the controls directly on the compressors when they're shipped from the factory?"

That's masking the strength there. The strength in medical is really a bit better than you're able to see in the aggregate numbers. So we also have really important family of products around couch tops, which we have been launching throughout the year. And they're in a bunch of different trial applications.

We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up",2703,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then open it up to questions and answers. 
So first slide. If we look at the Q3 financial results, once again, they're an all-time record for any quarter in the history of the company, not just a record third quarter. Orders were at the highest level in history, sales, the same. Backlog, highest level, net earnings, a highest level, and operating and free cash flow in the quarter set a new standard for the company. Our total sales in the quarter were up 18% and organic sales were up 13%, which was frankly better than expected. 
Our book-to-bill was greater than one for the 9th straight quarter and our record backlog of $876 million is up $106 million from the third quarter a year ago. Operating margins were terrific throughout the enterprise, they were up 230 basis points so that operating margin was 23.5% of revenue in the quarter. Our EBITDA was $203 million in the quarter, a fairly astonishing number by any standard, and EBITDA margin was 28.6%. Our operating cash flow was 23% of sales at $167 million and our free cash flow was 22% of sales at $157 million.
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you should see that bookings again were above 1, at 1.01. Net sales were, as we said, up 13% organically. Gross profit picked up 50 basis points from a year ago. Our operating income was up 30% from $128 million to $167 million, and margin at 23.5%, up from 21.2% in the third quarter a year ago. Our tax rate was actually a headwind in the quarter year. In the third quarter last year, it's only 25.9%. As most of you would know, third quarter results tend to have whatever rollover there is in that 104A calculation for filing tax returns. This year, our tax rate was 27.7%, a 180 basis points increase over the prior year, which took a couple a pennies out of our results. 
Net earnings were $110 million, up 31% from the prior year and our diluted earnings per share were $1.12 versus $0.87.
Next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter was truly spectacular. 22% of revenue and 142% of net earnings, so it'd be the 14th consecutive year that our free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. And really, we had very strong execution throughout the family of businesses. And you can see the comparisons prior year here on the graph.
Next slide. We had quite substantial EBITDA gross. I'm not sure people caught up to just how much our trailing EBITDA continues to grow. We're up 33% in EBITDA over the prior year and our trailing 12 months EBITDA now ending the third quarter is $779 million. That's up from $585 million in the corresponding trailing 12-month period ended in the third quarter of '10, and up from $507 million in 2009. Part of the reason for that is continued margin expansion. Our EBITDA margins in 2009 were 24.5% for that TTM period. In 2010, they were up 140 basis points to 25.9% and this year they've skyrocketed to 28.5% from 25.9%.
Next slide. Our asset velocity performance continues to be best-in-class. You can see inventory has actually dropped to 7.4% from 8.9% just 2 years ago. Our receivables are down 200 basis points to 14.7% from 16.7%, just a terrific performance by all our field operating units around receivables. And payables and accruals have actually come down, or our numbers would be even more spectacular. So in total, when we look at the inventory plus receivables minus payables and accruals, we finished the quarter at 6.5%. That's 240 basis points better than just 2 years ago. So our exceptional performance in that category continues.
Next slide. Here we look at our sort of balance sheet and financial position. We ended the quarter with $246 million in cash. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $779 million. Our gross debt number is $1,174,000,000. If you take that $246 million and cash away, you got net debt at $928 million. Shareholder equity continues to be strong there, in excess of $3 billion, meaning our net debt-to-net cap number is about 23%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.5x, so we have very ample capacity inside anything we'd like to do. And our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is over 12x. Now in the last 2 years, we invested $1.1 billion in transactions. But as you can see, the balance sheet is stronger than ever.
Next slide. So here we'll take a look at our segment performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Next slide. Our Q3 segment performance was remarkably similar. You can see EBITDA margins in industrial, RF and medical all were 31%, and energy, they were 29%. The OP margins continue to march forward as we have revenue growth and we capture leverage associated with that and throughout the enterprise, we're very happy with the margin performance.
Next slide. If we go to the largest segment in the quarter was RF Technology. It had sales up 19%, operating profit was up 41% and the operating profit margin reached 23.8%, up 380 basis points from the corresponding period in the prior year. Orders exceeded revenue. If you look at the specific commentary here, by the way, the leverage there on incremental revenue was about 44%. So we had very strong growth throughout the segment, organic sales, up 15%. The software businesses had double-digit organic growth, with particular tribute to CBORD, who continues to have quite spectacular performance around Integrated Security Solutions that we provide the universities. That business has nearly doubled this year compared to last. Our Freight Matching business grew at a double-digit rate as we've got more new subscribers and their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market due to volatility in gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. 
Our Toll & Traffic Solutions business, which is less than half of the segment, we remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade where we're converting Puerto Rico from a coin-base technology to an electronic technology and we had strong tag shipments in several locations around the world.
In the fourth quarter, looking forward, we're going to continue to benefit from this electronic tolling project in Puerto Rico. Our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement, even given what we had here in the third quarter. We think we'll even do a bit better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France, where we've been installing a system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that'll allow us to get our data services revenue, which comes in at lower revenue but much higher margins.
Next slide. Here, looking at the industrial technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune because it's traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here, orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. Sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16% and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. 
Fluid handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner, driven really by all the shale, gas and oil activity that's occurring in Canada and the U.S. Lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. 
And then in Neptune in North American meter revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the U.S. order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the U.S. We had a very successful launch of our low-profile, lead-free residential water meter. A lot of people have gone out and checked the Shed The Lead video that we have and it certainly created a lot of interest in our water meter business. 
So we look to Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the energy business and we haven't seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double-digit growth, led by the Toronto installation activity, which is going to start to pick up in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. 
And then our favorable end markets are pretty much generally true in the -- so just so we are not doing well in the 30-plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope it'll improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next.
If we go next slide. If you look here at the Medical and Scientific Imaging segment, it was up 16% in revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%. So we had strong leverage here, about 34%. And the OP margin increased 150 basis points to 24.7%. Our high-end imaging solutions driven largely by Gatan's quantum and direct detection camera lines are continuing to perform in a fantastic way and we have a new product out there that's processing frame speeds at 83 gigabytes a second. I'm not sure anybody could relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it's leading-edge technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year. 
The medical platform continues to perform well. The adoption rates for both Bladderscan and GlideScope continue to escalate. We continue to gain ground internationally in terms of consumables and our ultrasound business and our couch top patient positioning technology for the MRI processes is beginning to gain momentum. There's a lot of favorable papers, write-ups and comments about this, and we think it'll be a long-term winning proposition for the enterprise. 
In the third quarter, on an order comparison basis, we had very tough comps because of 2 things that happened last year. We do report our Rugged Mobile business in here, which is certainly not key to the enterprise but it had a particularly strong Q3 order for long-term delivery last year, which, of course, wouldn't have been repeated in any one quarter. So it's a new initiation of an order. And then we had very strong dosage delivery business last year, and this year was more normalized. So both of that created a bit a headwind in terms of comps. But if you mask, take that away, the book-to-bill was above one, sequentially higher than the second quarter, and our backlog is strong so we don't expect any difficulty here.
In the fourth quarter, we wind up, of course, with record backlog entering the quarter. So that kind of assures our shipment pattern should be fine. We expect to have continued growth in medical because the patient treatment technologies that were involved and our continuing to grow. We have a higher fourth quarter because Northern Digital, which was acquired, will begin to kick in. It has traditionally strong seasonality in the fourth quarter and we haven't seen anything that wouldn't suggest that will occur here.
Next slide. Here when we get to energy systems and controls, you can see once again very strong performance. Sales were up 22%. Orders were just slightly ahead of sales, up 12%. Operating profit was up 35% and our OP margins expanded 250 basis points to 25.7%. Growth again is led by the continued development of the diesel engine safety system technology and that continues to get this U.S. and North American shale activity. We've got some new engine OEMs that are building the technology into their platforms and that helps as well. We had a record Q3 in terms of our instrument sales around the refinery business, so that seems to be picking up steam. It had been slow. It had been much better this year, but still relatively slow. One of the very few businesses that's not back to the 2008 results and now that's largely there. 
We had an expansion in our Alpha, and Viatran and Dynisco family of businesses around sensor technologies. They've been up over 30% here for instrumentation to measure composites and process manufacturing. And just excellent execution throughout the segment with the exception of our nuclear techs business, which has been very soft due to the nuclear plant shutdowns around the world. But fortunately, it's not a big piece of the total. 
In the fourth quarter, we will benefit from an acquisition that we made right at the end of the third quarter called United Controls. United Controls is a small business in the Midwest, which has a large OEM component with Rolls-Royce. It's got great field service, technical support and its technology is very complementary to our compressor control business. We've done very little historically with Rolls-Royce and so this gives us a new partner in effect to provide field service and aftermarket application for technology improvements. And it certainly expands our OEM channel access. 
In the oil and gas area, the trends just continue to perform exceptionally well and there's no downturn of any kind expected this year or early next. And seasonality here has always been very important. At fourth quarter, there's a lot of MRO purchases that tend to get done in the fourth quarter with residual budgets, but we expect that would continue this year. And we also think margins in the segment will expand in the fourth quarter over where they were reported in the third.
Given all that, we look now to guidance update, next slide. The guidance, we're increasing our full year guidance from $4.20 to $4.30 to $4.29 to $4.33. Now we started out this year with guidance at $3.82 to $4.02. And when we look cumulatively, we've actually now increased our low-end guidance by $0.47. So at $4.29 to $4.33, that results in Q4 at $1.18 to $1.22. And our full year operating cash flow will exceed $575 million on that revenue.
Next slide. If you look at a summary here before we get into the Q&A period, what we have is the best quarter in the history of the company. It's the highest level of sales orders, backlog, net earnings, operating and free cash flow ever. Organic sales came in at plus 13%, largely driven by new products and new applications to existing customers and then to favorable niche markets. We're really not seeing any slowdown in any activity in any of things that we might consider to be bellwether items that would say things are getting slower. We're just -- we're not seeing that. Very broad-based momentum as we entered the fourth quarter, which has allowed us to increase our guidance. Our gross margin is at 53.7%, certainly best-in-class. Operating margin is at 23.5%, with 36% overall leverage a new revenue, again, I think probably best-in-class. Operating cash flow at 23% of sales is nothing short of spectacular. And really, a new milestone for us, it's just as we've said, I don't think people are focused on just how much our EBITDA is growing. But our cash flow, our operating cash flow now in the last 2 years has exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. And if you think about those acquisitions in the last 2 years at $1.1 billion and cash flow over $1 billion, and we give you some idea about our capacity in transactions looking forward and the cash machine that we've created here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions, John."

As we said, orders are -- in the U.S. for them went up over 10% in the third quarter. So that's really not a problem area for us at the moment. And in fact, I think the municipal funding has started to pick up a little steam with community bond so we were worried about that going into the year and it certainly outperformed our fears. It's not as a robust as it was in the past but new products and applications and selling some software along with data collection helps that. In the image area, you have the NIH situation in the U.S. and then a similar situation in Japan, a total of which people fear is a little slow but the technologies we've launched through our research scientists are so compelling that they really blown through any of that risk. We're not seeing anything that would be measured as softness that would be driven by the National Institute of Health Funding or really the Japanese. You see a little more of that actually in Europe than you do here. But nothing that's much of a headwind. So that's actually better than we would've expected in the radio frequency arena, again the applications we have tend to be cash registers for people. So really they're not really viewed as capital spending. I think if they weren't delivering sort of immediate paybacks for people, we'd be more worried than they are. We certainly performed better in the third quarter on an order-end sales basis than we would have expected because we do occasionally listen to the news and manage, if you look at all the externalities you'd be scared to death. But fortunately, our businesses are so niche-y and so specific and value-added that those externalities haven't had much effect on us at this time. So we're not seeing nor does anybody feel fearful about the fourth quarter or frankly next year."

And then the lesser,  very strategic for compressor controls, so material to them. Pipeline remains very full. We have continuing activity and a lot going on there. I think we've finally seen a little breakdown in Europe where the European banks aren't offering very much support whereas not too long ago you were seeing 6.5x debt staples from those folks and now you're not seeing any debt staples from those folks. So that has an effect both on the reality and the attitude of people. Debt staples in the U.S. have dropped. I think it's hard for most people to get a debt funding for a transaction more than about 5x EBITDA and so that trends the multiple down as we're not going to put in a whole lot more equity than they would have before when the debt staple was much higher. Furthermore, the spreads for them and the blended cost of their interest to get a deal done are higher now than they were as spreads have gone up a bit on the mezzanine portion of the debt. So we're seeing multiples come down a little bit. Sell orders are still -- their expectations throughout the year were too high. It's one of the reasons that, with our disciplined approach, we haven't done a large transaction, but we continue to look at a number of large transactions. And sometime, I think in the foreseeable future, we'll execute on something. Most of the deals we're looking at are relatively large and I wouldn't expect that there's always this kind of the United full situation, we could have 2 or 3 of those, but we're kind of patiently waiting for the right balance here. People still are worried about CMS reimbursement on medical, so that's an area you have to be exceptionally careful in. And in the software side, we've got things going that we like a lot. And it's just a price gap kind of discussion. And we're patient and ultimately it's better to be patient. We don't need to do a deal because a deal is available. We need to do a deal because it makes sense for our institutional holders and our shareholders."

It gives us confidence that our businesses are doing the right things with respect to pricing and heading off any material cost push inflation. As you know, the only real exposure that we have any type of raw material input cost is in copper and it goes into our Neptune business. And Neptune has really done a couple of very smart things. One, with the redesign of the residential water meter, which reduces the amount of material content as well as improves the quality for the customers, which is a real positive thing. So that mitigates some of that exposure. And then we also just enter into supply agreements that are usually 6 to 9 months out, which gives us a little bit better visibility at what the cost structure is going to look like on the input side, which allows us to still be able to manage the price equation in a way that doesn't really jerk the customers around all the time in that end market. So those are the things that we look at, and so we're confident that our businesses have done the right things on price/cost as long as we continue to have the gross profit margins where we see them."

Then the diesel shut-off valve is really making sure that all these diesel engines in fact do shut off instead of continue to run after somebody turned it off. Now we also have a couple other businesses, Viatran in northern New York, which is a sensor-related business that goes into oil and gas and supports some of the technology they need to know about reading information on sensors. So there's really about 6 different businesses. They don't go to market under one common sales force because it's not how that business works. So they share customers and talk about things with people but generally, different influences are making volume decisions about it.

We worked both with [indiscernible] and different deployment strategies. So there's a lot of revenue that comes through the locking piece. We generally are at the front of the whole system solution, so we're providing a lot of different things to different people. And I'll have John talk a little bit about overall integration. We bring Inovonics in here with sensor technology and we do things with parkings troll that come out of transport. So it is a leading-edge solution to people we love at the university level, but not everybody can work with us people. It's not the easiest sale, there's a lot of sweat equity and a lot of customer service post sale."

The problem in answering the question is that if you look at where we get like the -- I wouldn't think of this a revenue per student because, let's say you're doing Michigan State University, which is a big application for a variety of things at CBORD, you've got -- it's a big 10 school with thousands of that but it's not -- the incremental cost of a student is exceptionally low. And the dollar that we gain for an incremental student is very low. So it's really how much of a suite of services and data collection technologies they buy that's critical. So if it's a turnkey installation where somebody is putting in electronic locking mechanisms and parking control and crude management and nutrition management, they're generally going start out with a portion of the activity or try it in an area as opposed to putting in at the entire university. So the system grows over time into a full mature suite of applications and becomes very valuable. So it's really how many new things can you win to sort of get your foot in the door with these people as they build it out. And now we've been very fortunate in the last 2 years to displace another competitor in several locations and we look forward to continuing to do that. And we have an awful lot of sweat equity and activity involved. We just finished a CBORD user conference within the last couple of weeks with hundreds and hundreds of people in attendance. And there's over 500 different kinds of people who attend this conference that are thinking about ways to use our software and system data collection technologies in a variety of ways around the campus. So it's a mind-share thing that drives the growth sort of more than the, ""Gosh, I got the largest university in the country."" I mean, it could be that the smallest one would get you more revenue than a large one because the amount of c activity they're purchasing and the number of cards and applications that they're applying it to if it's sort of long-winded answer but it's the truth."
