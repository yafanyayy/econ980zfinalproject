Medco is pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings, reflecting strong financial and operating performance at the high end of previously increased guidance.",1527,"Thank you, Valeria, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Medco is pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings, reflecting strong financial and operating performance at the high end of previously increased guidance. Today, I will focus my remarks on full year 2010 results and 2011 guidance, while Rich will focus on our balance sheet, our fourth quarter results and details surrounding our 2011 guidance. At our analyst in November, we shared with you our expectations for Medco and our business strategy that is designed to continue to delivering strong growth for 2020. We outlined our portfolio of growth drivers that will advance our mission to make medicine smarter for our clients and the more than $65 million members we served. Today we remain confident in our expectations and are pleased to provide you with the details of our performance for 2010 and expectations for 2011. Let's begin with our year-over-year 2010 financial and operational performance.
For the year, we delivered record GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.15 representing growth of 21.1%. Our diluted earnings per share excluding the amortization of intangibles from the 2003 spin-off grew 20.1% to a record $3.40. Our net revenues reached a record of $66 billion, up 10.3% from 2009 despite the higher volumes of lower-cost generics that reduced our net revenues by nearly $3.7 billion and correspondingly resulted in record client and patient savings. 
Within the revenues, our higher margin generating service revenues grew 28% to a record $1.08 billion fueled by our United BioSource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company. We achieved total gross margin of $4.3 billion, an increase of 7.7% over 2009.
Our EBITDA increased 8.1% to nearly $3 billion and our EBITDA per adjusted script increased 1.6% to a full year record of $3.11. And finally, our net income increased 11.5% to a record $1.4 billion. With respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results, overall prescription volumes adjusted for the dates applied between retail and mail grew a strong 6.5% to a record 957 million prescription. 
Mail-order prescriptions for the year grew at a strong 6.5% to 109.8 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of 109 million prescriptions and set a new record. Importantly, we experienced continued strength in generic mail-order volumes increasing a substantial 13.4% to 67.6 million prescriptions as patients continue to choose lower-cost generic medications. 
Growth of generic have now for the fourth quarter was even greater at 15.1%. Our overall generic dispensing rate rose 3.5 percentage points to 71% and within that our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased an even greater amount by 3.7 percentage points to a record 61.5%. For the full year, our Medicare part D PDP revenues achieved a record increasing 33.5% to well over $1.4 billion. We are proud to have been the first and only national PDP to be awarded five stars by CMS and believe these world-class recognition operationally not only validates our investments in our agile enterprise but also enables continued strength in our Medicare business going forward.
Moving on to our Specialty business. Accredo's performance remains strong with revenues increasing 19.1% to a record $11.3 billion and operating income rising 22.7% to a record $438.2 million. Turning to sales and client retention results, Medco delivered another solid year of performance. Our 2010 annualized new-named and net-new sales each remained strong at $5.3 billion and our client retention rate remained over 99%. For 2011 today, our annualized new-named sales stand at $1.7 billion and our net-new sales are currently $1.5 billion, up from the $1.4 billion previously disclosed on our third quarter earnings call. We have now completed over 80% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 50% we reported on our third quarter call and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
This past year, we continue to invest in our enterprise by expanding our expertise in genomic and personalized medicines with the acquisition of DNA Direct. We also entered the market for post-approval Phase IV safety economic evaluation and outcomes research through our acquisition of United BioSource. We are very pleased with the results to date for both of these acquisitions. DNA Direct's genomic services are gaining traction in the marketplace. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the addition of four new community hospital clients to DNA Direct genomic medicine hospital networks come extending web-based physicians of core and genetic expertise to their physicians and their which is. We also announced the position addition of four new health plan clients who are implementing DNA Direct policy and benefit support program from molecular diagnostic and genetic tests. This program enables payors to determine coverage for more than 800 molecular diagnostic and genetic tests and provides realtime access to the DNA Direct team of genetic counselors for clinical guidance and counseling on the more than 2,000 genetic tests available today. We are encouraged by the level of market interest in this new service offerings.
We are very pleased with the acquisition of UBC which has been enthusiastically embraced by more than 100 Medco clients representing more than 40 million lives volunteering to be part of the Medco research consortium to participate in UBC research study. This is up from the previously disclosed 89 clients and 33 million lives. As we noted at Analyst Day, both our clients and biotech drug manufacturers have common interests to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs coming to market. On top of that, Medco and its clients are fully aligned to pursue better outcomes and lower total healthcare costs, the essence of Making Medicine Smarter.
As we move forward, we anticipate UBC will continue to realize strong growth from its impressive pipeline of opportunities, including safety surveillance for UBC hold to market-leading position globally. Additionally, we expect to leverage UBC as Medco's and Accredo's capabilities to the benefit of our clients and patients as we fundamentally changed the way drugs are introduced to delivered and monitored for both safety and economics. 
Turning to guidance, we are reaffirming our full year 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.66 reflecting a growth rate of 12% to 16% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization, are new EPS measure is to reaffirm to be in the range of $3.99 to $4.12 reflecting 12% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. Please note that the growth rate change for GAAP and pure cash EPS was 12% to 17% previously, but is narrowed due to the fact that we achieved the high end of our 2010 guidance range.
In closing, we remain confident in our ability to generate strong EPS growth well into the future. In the weeks since we shared our long-range plans with you, I have been asked how we can this be so confidence over such an extended horizon? There are two primary reasons that the first is a detail behind our ten-year strategic financial plan. As we shared on Analyst Day last November, we have a very detailed roadmap for growth that is reasonable and logical based upon the many compelling opportunities we foresee over the next 10 years and a realistic view of the risks we may have encountered along the way. I believe that our growing portfolio of capabilities with leaders who are dedicated and accountable to each one of them will enable us to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions that will likely remain unmatched in the marketplace. 
The second is our people. Our employees are united to a greater good, a noble cause that fuels the passion around Making Medicine Smarter in world-class manner people. While a common vision is important, our people also have proven ability to execute with unparalleled excellence. 
Our CMS five-star rating is a testament to this, further evidence can be found in our January 1 install, which were virtually despite the record number of complex changes required by CMS in the recent healthcare reform mandate. As we continue to make progress in advancing our capabilities through our agile enterprise initiatives, we expect to achieve unprecedented improvements in the way we deliver operational excellence to the benefit of our clients and members.
Yet another example of our operational excellence is the recent final approval we received from the Indiana Board of Pharmacy for our new third-generation automated pharmacy located in Indiana. In the testing phase that ran from September through mid-January, the board found that the pharmacy filled every prescription of the tens of thousands tested with 100% accuracy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our over 24,000 Medco employees now standing the globe with their continued efforts on behalf of clients, patients and shareholders resulting in another great year and strong long-term prospects. They are delivering everyday for our clients, members and shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Rich Rubino who will take you through our balance sheet, the fourth quarter 2010 financials and further details on our guidance for 2011. Rich?"

We are pleased to the river another quarter and full year financial operating performance. As Valery mentioned, the slides on our website will prove helpful in following along with my commentary.Starting with our balance s",2359,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. We are pleased to the river another quarter and full year financial operating performance. As Valery mentioned, the slides on our website will prove helpful in following along with my commentary.
Starting with our balance sheet, we closed the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $853 million, and our cash flow from operations for full year 2010 totaled over $2.34 billion. While our mail-order prescription volumes set record highs in 2010, our inventory balances represent a record year of just over $1 billion at the end of 2010. A $272 million reduction from year end 2009 on top of the $571 million reduction we generated during 2009.
Our capital expenditure at full year 2010 were in line with our guidance at $250 million, reflecting investments in our business to drive agility and enhance efficiencies across the organization, prepare for healthcare reform implementation and to fund future growth. We achieved a full year 2010 return on invested capital of 35%, excluding 2010 acquisitions such as UBC, a meaningful increase over the 2009 return was 27% which was already seven points higher than 2008. 
Our fourth quarter 2010 EPS results were records, with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88 representing 25.7% growth over fourth quarter 2009 and diluted EPS excluding the amortization of intangibles from the 2003 spin-off of $0.94 representing 23.7% growth over 2009.
Total fourth quarter 2010 net revenues reached a record $16.9 billion, representing growth of 11.1% over fourth quarter 2009. Our product revenue grew 10.4%, reflecting our new business wins as well as higher prices brand name Pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics in fact a record generic effect of approximately $1.1 billion on fourth quarters revenue a loan.
Service revenue continued to be very meaningful growth driver, increasing 58.7% over fourth quarter 2009. This strong performance reflects a full quarter of service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base at our Medicare part D services.
Starting with rebates, we earned $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.8 billion for full year 2010, both records, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medications and more generics. These rebate levels represent 7% growth for the quarter and 8.1% growth for the year attributable to new client wins and continues improvements in formulary contracting. Our fourth quarter 2010 rebate retention rate was 13.0% compared to 14.1% in fourth quarter 2009 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. For the full year, our rebate retention rate of 12.5% compared to 13.7% in 2009.
In terms of claims volumes totaled fourth quarter prescription adjusted for the differences in days supply between retail and mail reached a record $244.3 million, an increase of 7.4% over fourth quarter 2009. Retail prescriptions in fourth quarter 2010 grew 7.5% to a record $161.4 million. Mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose the lowest cost and most clinically effective channel.
Our mail-order prescriptions reached a record $27.9 million in fourth quarter 2010, a 7.3% increase from fourth quarter 2009. The adjusted mail-order prescription volumes for fourth quarter 2010 comprised 33.9% of the total adjusted prescriptions in line with the 34.0% mail penetration rates in the fourth quarter 2009.
Within the record fourth quarter 2010 mail-order prescription volumes total, generic prescription volumes increased 15.1% to a record $17.5 million, reflecting new generic introductions and continued growth in previous generics, while brand-name prescription volumes decreased 3.7% to 10.4 million prescriptions. The strength in our generic mail-order prescription volumes was an important driver of our fourth quarter gross margin, which increased 13.1% over fourth quarter 2009 to a record of $1.16 billion.
Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.9% for the quarter held steady with what we reported a third quarter 2010 and on the year-over-year basis, increased 20 basis points from the 6.7% in fourth quarter 2009, again a result of the strong fourth quarter 2010 mail-order generic prescription volumes and our strong service gross margins. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $428.5 million for the fourth quarter increased over fourth quarter 2009 by $53 million or 14.1%, reflecting the addition of UBC as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Excluding UBC, SG&A for the fourth quarter was up $32.2 million or 8.6% from fourth quarter 2009. 
The expenses we incurred in 2010 for strategic initiatives are critical to our transformation and to a world-class agile enterprise focused on speed, accuracy, efficiency and providing highest levels of clients and patient care. We invest in ourselves because we are a growth company, with many exciting components of expanding portfolio of businesses. These investments, whether in the form of expense or capital are designed to proactively drive unparalleled levels of client and patient service and top off what we believe is already a world-class service model.
Total EBITDA for fourth quarter 2010 reached a record $786.5 million, representing growth of 13.2%. EBITDA per adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 5.2% to $3.22, a fourth quarter record. Our intangible amortization of $75 million in fourth quarter 2010 decreased slightly from $75.5 million at fourth quarter 2009. The full year amortization of $287.4 million decreased in 2009 by 6.0% or $18.2 million, primarily reflecting lower intangible amortization from Europa and Accredo partially offset by the addition of UBC and DNA Direct intangible assets.
Total net interest and other expense of $50.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $10.5 million from the $39.9 million in fourth quarter 2009, reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. For the full year, total net interest and other expense of $163.1 million was slightly higher compared to the $162.6 million for 2009, reflecting this new debt, offset by lower interest rates associated with floating rate debt.
The fourth quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 37.7% compared to 36.3% in 2009 primarily reflecting a 2009 benefit from state-related income tax items. Our effective tax rate for full year was 38.9% in line with the 39.1% in 2009. Net income for the quarter increased 10.8% to a record $378.5 million from the $341.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, net income increased 11.5% to a record of over $1.4 billion from the $1.3 billion reported for 2009.
Moving on to share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 15.8 million shares for $963.3 million at an average per share cost of $61.05. For Full year 2010, share repurchases totaled 69.9 million at a cost of $4.1 billion with an average per share cost of $58.97. Since share repurchases commenced in 2005, we repurchased a total of 256.2 million shares, with a total cost of $11.1 billion with an average per share cost of $43.18. 
For 2011 to date, we repurchased 7.0 million shares with an average per share cost of $62.06. In January 2011, we completed the remaining $437 million of the $3.0 million authorization that was approved in May 2010. By February 2, 2011, our board authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase plan. We continue to complete approximately $2 billion in share repurchases in 2011, driving meaningful value to our shareholders. We expect the commenced share repurchases under the new authorization later this quarter or.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Accredo achieved record revenues of $3.2 million for fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 21.3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Consistent with our guidance, Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter amounted to 6.5% compared to the 7.0% in fourth quarter of 2009. This Accredo gross declined reflect product channel and client mix. The 2010 product mix reflects significant growth in our multiple sclerosis, arthritis, oncology and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with product volumes. Accredo's operating income for fourth quarter 2010 increased 30.7% to $109.9 million. 
Moving on to Medicare. We continue to experience growth in our Medicare PDP. For fourth quarter 2010, Medco's PDP revenues increased 27.7% to $331.7 million. As Dave discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2011. To briefly repeat our reaffirmed 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is expected to grow 12% to 16% over 2010 in the range of $3.53 to $3.66. As we noted last quarter, the non-GAAP diluted EPS measure change commencing in 2011 to exclude all intangible amortization. Diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization remains in the guidance range of $3.99 to $4.12, representing growth of 12% to 16% over the 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
While this measure will not be used in 2011, diluted EPS, excluding intangible amortization from the 2003 spin-off, would be guided to increase to a range of $3.80 to $3.93 also representing growth of 12% to 16% over 2010. The detailed components of our 2011 guidance are as follows. We currently expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including schedules and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we have over 80% of our 2011 renewals already completed. As I previously guided, approximately 75% of the renewal pricing is in effect in the first quarter with the majority of the remainder effective in the third quarter of 2011.
Our guidance for mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 remains in the range of $107 million to $109 million, demonstrating solid growth in our base business considering the 3 million script offset I discussed at Analyst day. You may recall the expected reduction of approximately 2 million scripts from the contribution of the Europa Apotheek to the Medco Celesio joint and another 1 million scripts associated with the generic form of Allegra known as fexofenadine to OTC status in early 2011. These expectations remain intact.
As you can see from our slides on the Web, the vast majority of our detailed 2011 guidance components remains consistent with those we provided at our Analyst Day. Including, as examples, the $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics and expectations for stability with probable expansion in gross margin percentage and EBITDA per adjusted script performance in 2011. There is one guidance point that is changing. As I alluded to on our Analyst Day, we are narrowing our guidance for 2011 SG&A expense from a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion to a narrower range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.
Now let's focus specifically on the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is expected to increase over the first quarter 2010 equivalent of $0.76 by approximately 16% to 17%. This first quarter 2011 guidance includes a planned $0.04 benefit to earnings associated with changes to various employee benefit clients across the company. This item reflects the financial effects associated with the prior service credit from employee, post-employment benefit plan that was in place before our 2003 spin-off. These benefit which equates to approximately 1% full year EPS guidance, was included in our internal operating plan upon where our guidance is based and was ultimately approved by our Board of Directors in January 2011.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect improvement in gross margin and EBITDA per script compared to first quarter 2010, even when excluding the $0.04 benefit I just mentioned of which 3/4 flows to cost of sales and 1/4 flows to the SG&A expense. Now let me provide some pointers to help you model the remaining quarters of 2011.
You may recall that I indicated on Analyst Day when you look at earnings progression for the year, EPS in 2011 will be even more backend loaded than we experienced in 2010. When excluding the $0.04 first quarter benefited I just mentioned, EPS is expected to be fairly consistent in the first two quarters of 2011 and improve progressively in each of the last two quarters, in part the result of incremental contribution from new generics, with zero, $0.01, $0.02 and $0.06 EPS contributions, respectively for each of the four quarters.
Let me now discuss an item that is not included in guidance at this time, as a matter of fact, it's currently indeterminable. With the contribution of Europa Apotheek Menlo or EAV to the Medco Celesio joint venture is now expected to take place in March 2011. We still expect to record a foreign exchange lost upon contribution, we are awaiting the final fair market valuation of the EAV asset we are contributing. At this point, we believe the exchange loss will likely equate to approximately $20 million. But it remains too early to quantify any gain or loss on the fair market valuation of EAV. This will be onetime transaction we will call out in our first quarter 2011 results that, again, was not and is not included in our quarterly or full year guidance. 
As we reported during the quarter, the Medicare Part D business of Universal American, our Medco client, is planned to be acquired by one of our competitors. As a result, it is expected that their business will no longer be serviced by Medco beginning in 2012. The termination of this business will not impact 2011 financial results and will not have a material impact to 2012 earnings since this account is very heavily weighted toward particularly low margin dual eligible business.
I know many of you in the call are interested in our expected renewals for 2012. At this point, we estimate our 2012 renewals in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our books. One last point, we look forward to look into our scheduled availability late in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the many other blockbuster brand-name drugs that lose their patent protection and become available in generic form in 2012. As we stated at our Analyst Day and on many other occasions, our clients, members and shareholders all stand to benefit from what we expect in 2012. The highest level of generic savings generating in our company's history. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions.  Vanessa?"

So our client clearly loved the concept of therapeutic resource centers. It's highly applicable to the oncology space. Our clients also do want us to bring the medical spend, which is half the specialty spend, that is on the medical side over to the pharmacy side to be better managed. So we're doing many things. One of them we highlighted at Analyst Day, which is many of the drugs on the oncology space are infusible. And one of our nurses got up and demonstrated to all of you the iPad technology that we've developed to manage total patient care in the home that goes well beyond the infusion they're delivering. And we found out that we can actually at the point of care, manage the source of the drug, get that drug sourced at a better price, mail environment for our client. We also can take care of the other drugs needs and the drug gaps in care around the patient, around that home setting and we have well over 1,000 nurses to do nothing but manage patient care in the home around all of these infusibles. And by the way, in the pipeline well over 30% of the drugs in the pipeline are infusible. We are going to see that trend growth the major part of our arsenal at the point-of-care to change how these drugs are managed your. In addition, we are working, especially with our health plan clients, to isolate those specialty drugs that are hidden what people call under the medical coding. J. Coates to me are by definition 100% unmanaged. They are mystery codes that allow payors to the AWP plus dispensing markup, which is grotesquely inefficient and clients are becoming more and more aggressive around pulling that out and managing it properly, levering scale and everything else that we as TDM bring. We do that today and we're actually looking at some more highly scalable model for the future do we can rollout of would one even better job there. but that's literally we could double the size of Accredo simply by taking all of the spend that's burden the medical side of the business and moving into the managed environment we create for specialty jars within Accredo. So we consider that an enormous opportunity and our clients are motivated to work us spirit."

But the disease and the growth pattern of that disease among the population is far lower than the growth of many of the other specialty drugs tied to the disease pattern and the population. So Rich and his comments pointed out things like rheumatoid arthritis, things like pulmonary arterial, those are stable margins that we like and when just do the math and they grow dramatically, they change the weightings of margin across the drug products and that simply changes the overall margin perspective. but I wouldn't want investors think about this is declining margins.

Medco is pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings, reflecting strong financial and operating performance at the high end of our previously increased guidance. Today, I will focus my remarks on full year 2010 results and 2011 guidance, while Rich will focus on our balance sheet, our fourth quarter results and details surrounding our 2011 guidance. At our Analyst Day in November, we shared with you our expectations for Medco and our business strategy that is designed to continue delivering strong growth through 2020. We outlined our portfolio of growth drivers that will advance our mission to make medicine smarter for our clients and the more than $65 million members we serve. Today, we remain confident in our expectations and are pleased to provide you with the details of our performance for 2010 and expectations for 2011. 
Let's begin with our year-over-year 2010 financial and operational performance. For the year, we delivered record GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.15 representing growth of 21.1%. Our diluted earnings per share excluding the amortization of intangibles from the 2003 spin-off grew 20.1% to a record $3.40. Our net revenues reached a record $66 billion, up 10.3% from 2009 despite the higher volumes of lower-cost generics that reduced our net revenues by nearly $3.7 billion and correspondingly resulted in record client and patient savings. 
Within net revenues, our higher margin-generating service revenues grew 28% to a record $1.08 billion, fueled by our United BioSource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company. We achieved record total gross margin of $4.3 billion, an increase of 7.7% over 2009.
Our EBITDA increased 8.1% to nearly $3 billion and our EBITDA per adjusted script increased 1.6% to a full year record of $3.11. And finally, our net income increased 11.5% to a record $1.4 billion. With respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results, overall prescription volumes adjusted for the dates applied between retail and mail grew a strong 6.5% to a record 957 million prescriptions. 
Mail-order prescriptions for the year grew at a strong 6.5% to 109.8 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of 109 million prescriptions and set a new record. Importantly, we experienced continued strength in generic mail-order volumes, increasing a substantial 13.4% to 67.6 million prescriptions as patients continued to choose lower-cost generic medications. 
Growth of generics have now for the fourth quarter was even greater at 15.1%. Our overall generic dispensing rate rose 3.5 percentage points to 71% and within that, our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased an even greater amount by 3.7 percentage points to a record 61.5%. For the full year, our Medicare Part D PDP revenues achieved a record, increasing 33.5% to well over $1.4 billion. We are proud to have been the first and only national PDP to be awarded five stars by CMS and believe this world-class recognition operationally not only validates our investments in our agile enterprise but also enables continued strength in our Medicare business going forward.
Moving on to our Specialty business, Accredo's performance remained strong with revenues increasing 19.1% to a record $11.3 billion and operating income rising 22.7% to a record $438.2 million. Turning to sales and client retention results, Medco delivered another solid year of performance. Our 2010 annualized new-named and net-new sales each remained strong at $5.3 billion, and our client retention rate remained over 99%. For 2011 today, our annualized new-named sales stand at $1.7 billion and our net-new sales are currently $1.5 billion, up from the $1.4 billion previously disclosed on our third quarter earnings call. We have now completed over 80% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 50% we reported on our third quarter call, and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
This past year, we continued to invest in our enterprise by expanding our expertise in genomic and personalized medicines with the acquisition of DNA Direct. We also entered the market for post-approval Phase IV safety, economic evaluation and outcomes research through our acquisition of United BioSource. We are very pleased with the results to date for both of these acquisitions. DNA Direct's genomic services are gaining traction in the marketplace. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the addition of four new community hospital clients to DNA Direct genomic medicine hospital network, extending web-based physician support and genetic expertise to their physicians and their patients. 
We also announced the addition of four new health plan clients who are implementing DNA Direct's Policy & Benefit Support Program for molecular diagnostic and genetic tests. This program enables payers to determine coverage for more than 800 molecular diagnostic and genetic tests and provides real-time access to the DNA Direct team of genetic counselors for clinical guidance and counseling on the more than 2,000 genetic tests available today. We are encouraged by the level of market interest in this new service offering.
We are very pleased with the acquisition of UBC, which has been enthusiastically embraced by more than 100 Medco clients, representing more than 40 million lives volunteering to be part of the Medco research consortium to participate in UBC research study. This is up from the previously disclosed 89 clients and 33 million lives. As we noted at Analyst Day, both our clients and biotech drug manufacturers have common interest to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs coming to market. On top of that, Medco and its clients are fully aligned to pursue better outcomes and lower total healthcare costs, the essence of Making Medicine Smarter.
As we move forward, we anticipate UBC will continue to realize strong growth from its impressive pipeline of opportunities, including safety surveillance where UBC holds the market-leading position globally. Additionally, we expect to leverage UBC's, Medco's and Accredo's capabilities to the benefit of our clients and patients as we fundamentally change the way drugs are introduced, delivered and monitored for both safety and economics. 
Turning to guidance, we are reaffirming our full year 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.66 reflecting a growth rate of 12% to 16% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share excluding all intangible amortization, our new pure cash EPS measure is reaffirmed to be in the range of $3.99 to $4.12, reflecting 12% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. Please note that the growth rate change for GAAP and pure cash EPS was 12% to 17% previously, but is narrowed due to the fact that we achieved the high end of our 2010 guidance range.
In closing, we remain confident in our ability to generate strong EPS growth well into the future. In  the weeks since we shared our long-range plans with you, I have been asked how we can be so confident over such an extended horizon. There are two primary reasons; the first is the rigor and granular detail behind our 10-year strategic financial plan. As we shared on the Analyst Day last November, we have a very detailed roadmap for growth that is reasonable and logical based upon the many compelling opportunities we foresee over the next 10 years and a realistic view of the risk we may have encountered along the way. I believe that our growing portfolio of capabilities with leaders who are dedicated and accountable for each one of them will enable us to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions that will likely remain unmatched in the marketplace. 
The second is our people. Our employees are united to a greater good, a noble cause that fuel the passion around Making Medicine Smarter in a world-class manner. While a common vision is important, our people also have proven ability to execute with unparalleled excellence. Our CMS five-star rating is a testament to this, further evidence can be found in our January 1 install, which were virtually flawless despite the record number of complex changes required by CMS in the recent healthcare reform mandate. 
As we continue to make progress in advancing our capabilities through our agile enterprise initiative, we expect to achieve unprecedented improvements in the way we deliver operational excellence to the benefit of our clients and members. Yet another example of our operational excellence is the recent final approval we received from the Indiana Board of Pharmacy for our new third-generation automated pharmacy located in Whitestown, Indiana. 
In the testing phase that ran from September through mid-January, the board found that the pharmacy filled every prescription of the tens of thousands tested with 100% accuracy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our over 24,000 Medco employees now standing the globe for their continued efforts on behalf of clients, patients and shareholders resulting in another great year and strong long-term prospects. They are delivering everyday for our clients, members and shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Rich Rubino, who will take you through our balance sheet, the fourth quarter 2010 financials and further details on our guidance for 2011. Rich?"

We are pleased to deliver another quarter and full year of strong financial and operating performance. As Valerie mentioned, the slides on our website will prove helpful in following along with my commentary.
Starting with our balance sheet, we closed the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $853 million, and our cash flow from operations for full year 2010 totaled over $2.34 billion. While our mail-order prescription volumes set record highs in 2010, our inventory balances represent a record year end low of just over $1 billion at the end of 2010, a $272 million reduction from year-end 2009 on top of the $571 million reduction we generated during 2009.
Our capital expenditures at full year 2010 were in line with our guidance at $250 million, reflecting investments in our business to drive agility and enhance efficiency across the organization, prepare for healthcare reform implementation and to fund the future growth. We achieved the full year 2010 return on invested capital of 35%, excluding 2010 acquisitions such as UBC. A meaningful increase over the 2009 return was 27%, which was already seven points higher than 2008. 
Our fourth quarter 2010 EPS results were record with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88 representing 25.7% growth over fourth quarter 2009 and diluted EPS excluding the amortization of intangibles from the 2003 spin-off of $0.94 representing 23.7% growth over 2009.
Total fourth quarter 2010 net revenues reached a record $16.9 billion, representing growth of 11.1% over fourth quarter 2009. Our product revenue grew 10.4%, reflecting our new business wins as well as higher prices charged by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics, in fact, a record generic effect of approximately $1.1 billion on fourth quarter's revenue alone.
Service revenue continued to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 58.7% over fourth quarter 2009. This strong performance reflects a full quarter of service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base at our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned nearly $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.8 billion for full year 2010, both records, even though we are dispensing fewer brand name medications and more generics. These earned rebate levels represent 7% growth for the quarter and 8.1% growth for the year attributable to new client wins and continuous improvements in formulary contracting. Our fourth quarter 2010 rebate retention rate was 13.0% compared to 14.1% in fourth quarter 2009 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. For the full year, our rebate retention rate of 12.5% compared to 13.7% in 2009.
In terms of claims volumes, total fourth quarter prescriptions adjusted for the difference in days supply between retail and mail reached a record $244.3 million, an increase of 7.4% over fourth quarter 2009. Retail prescriptions in fourth quarter 2010 grew 7.5% to a record $161.4 million. Mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose the lowest cost and most clinically effective channel.
Our mail-order prescriptions reached a record $27.9 million in fourth quarter 2010, a 7.3% increase from fourth quarter 2009. The adjusted mail-order prescription volumes for fourth quarter 2010 comprised 33.9% of the total adjusted prescriptions, in line with the 34.0% mail penetration rate in fourth quarter 2009.
Within the record fourth quarter 2010 mail-order prescription volume total, generic prescription volumes increased 15.1% to a record $17.5 million, reflecting new generic introductions and continued growth in previously released generics, while brand-name prescription volumes decreased 3.7% to 10.4 million prescriptions. The strength in our generic mail-order prescription volumes was an important driver of our fourth quarter gross margin, which increased 13.1% over fourth quarter 2009 to a record of $1.16 billion.
Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.9% for the quarter held steady with what we reported at third quarter 2010, and on a year-over-year basis, increased 20 basis points from the 6.7% in fourth quarter 2009, again a result of the strong fourth quarter 2010 mail-order generic prescription volumes and our strong service gross margins. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $428.5 million for the fourth quarter increased over fourth quarter 2009 by $53 million or 14.1%, reflecting the addition of UBC as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Excluding UBC, SG&A for the fourth quarter was up $32.2 million or 8.6% from fourth quarter 2009. 
The expenses we incurred in 2010 for strategic initiatives are critical to our transformation into a world-class agile enterprise focused on speed, accuracy, efficiency and providing the highest levels of clients and patient care. We invest in ourselves because we are a growth company, with many exciting components of our expanding portfolio of businesses. These investments, whether in the form of expense or capital, are designed to proactively drive unparalleled levels of client and patient service on top of what we believe is already a world-class service model.
Our total EBITDA for fourth quarter 2010 reached a record $786.5 million, representing growth of 13.2%. EBITDA per adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 5.2% to $3.22, a fourth quarter record. Our intangible amortization of $75 million in fourth quarter 2010 decreased slightly from $75.5 million at fourth quarter 2009. The full year amortization of $287.4 million decreased in 2009 by 6.0% or $18.2 million, primarily reflecting lower intangible amortization from PolyMedica and Accredo, partially offset by the addition of UBC and DNA Direct intangible assets.
Total net interest and other expense of $50.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $10.5 million from the $39.9 million in fourth quarter 2009, reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. For the full year, total net interest and other expense of $163.1 million was slightly higher compared to the $162.6 million for 2009, reflecting this new debt, offset by lower interest rates associated with floating rate debt.
The fourth quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 37.7% compared to 36.3% in 2009, primarily reflecting a 2009 benefit from state-related income tax items. Our effective tax rate for full year was 38.9%, in line with the 39.1% in 2009. Net income for the quarter increased 10.8% to a record $378.5 million from the $341.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, net income increased 11.5% to a record of over $1.4 billion from the $1.3 billion reported for 2009.
Moving on to share repurchases, during the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 15.8 million shares for $963.3 million at an average per share cost of $61.05. For Full year 2010, share repurchases totaled 69.9 million at a cost of $4.1 billion with an average per share cost of $58.97. Since share repurchases commenced in 2005, we repurchased a total of 256.2 million shares, with a total cost of $11.1 billion, with an average per share cost of $43.18. 
For 2011 to date, we repurchased 7.0 million shares with an average per share cost of $62.06. In January 2011, we completed the remaining $437 million of the $3.0 billion authorization that was approved in May 2010. By February 2, 2011, our Board authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase plan. We continued to complete approximately $2 billion in share repurchases in 2011, driving meaningful value to our shareholders. We expect the commenced share repurchases under the new authorization later this quarter.
Turning to our Specialty segment, Accredo achieved record revenues of $3.0 billion for fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 21.3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Consistent with our guidance, Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter amounted to 6.5% compared to the 7.0% in fourth quarter 2009. This Accredo gross margin decline reflects product channel and new client mix. The 2010 product mix reflects significant growth in our multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, oncology and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with product volumes. Accredo's operating income for fourth quarter 2010 increased 30.7% to $109.9 million. 
Moving on to Medicare, we continued to experience growth in our Medicare PDP. For fourth quarter 2010, Medco's PDP revenues increased 27.7% to $331.7 million. As Dave discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2011. To briefly repeat our reaffirmed 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is expected to grow 12% to 16% over 2010 in the range of $3.53 to $3.66. As we noted last quarter, the non-GAAP diluted EPS measure change commencing in 2011 to exclude all intangible amortization. Diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization remains in the guidance range of $3.99 to $4.12, representing growth of 12% to 16% over the 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
While this measure will not be used in 2011, diluted EPS, excluding intangible amortization from the 2003 spin-off would be guided to increase to a range of $3.80 to $3.93, also representing growth of 12% to 16% over 2010. The detailed components of our 2011 guidance are as follows. We currently expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including scheduled and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we have over 80% of our 2011 renewals already completed. As I've previously guided, approximately 75% of the renewal pricing is in effect in the first quarter with the majority of the remainder effective in the third quarter of 2011.
Our guidance for mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 remains in the range of $107 million to $109 million, demonstrating solid growth in our base business considering the 3 million script offset I discussed at Analyst day. You may recall the expected reduction of approximately 2 million mail-order scripts from the contribution of Europa Apotheek to the Medco Celesio joint venture and another 1 million scripts associated with the conversion of generic Allegra known as fexofenadine to OTC status in early 2011. These expectations remain intact.
As you can see from our slides on the Web, the vast majority of our detailed 2011 guidance components remain consistent with those we provided at our Analyst Day including, as example, the $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics and expectations for stability or probable expansion in gross margin percentage and EBITDA per adjusted script performance in 2011. There is one guidance point that is changing. As I alluded to on Analyst Day, we are narrowing our guidance for 2011 SG&A expense from a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion to a narrower range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.
Now let's focus specifically on the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is expected to increase over the first quarter 2010 equivalent of $0.76 by approximately 16% to 17%. This first quarter 2011 guidance includes a planned $0.04 benefit to earnings associated with changes to various employee benefit plans across the company. This item reflects the financial effects associated with the prior service credit for our employee post-employment benefit plan that was in place before our 2003 spin-off. This benefit, which equates to approximately 1% full year EPS guidance, was included in our internal operating plan upon which guidance was based and was ultimately approved by our Board of Directors in January 2011.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect improvement in gross margin and EBITDA per script compared to first quarter 2010, even when excluding the $0.04 benefit I just mentioned of which 3/4 flows to cost of sales and 1/4 flows to SG&A expense. Now let me provide some pointers to help you model the remaining quarters of 2011.
You may recall that I indicated on Analyst Day, when you look at earnings progression for the year, EPS in 2011 will be even more back-end loaded than we experienced in 2010. When excluding the $0.04 first quarter benefit I just mentioned, EPS is expected to be fairly consistent in the first two quarters of 2011 and improve progressively in each of the last two quarters, in part the result of the incremental contribution from new generics, with zero, $0.01, $0.02 and $0.06 EPS contributions, respectively, for each of the four quarters.
Let me now discuss an item that is not included in guidance at this time as the net effect is currently indeterminable. The contribution of Europa Apotheek Venlo or EAV to the Medco Celesio joint venture is now expected to take place in March 2011. We still expect to record a foreign exchange loss upon contribution. We are awaiting the final fair market valuation of the EAV asset we are contributing. At this point, we believe the exchange loss will likely equate to approximately $20 million and it remains too early to quantify any gain or loss on the fair market valuation of EAV. This will be a onetime transaction that we  will call out in our first quarter 2011 results that, again, was not and is not included in our quarterly or full year guidance. 
As we reported during the quarter, the Medicare Part D business of Universal American, a current Medco client, is planned to be acquired by one of our competitors. As a result, it is expected that their business will no longer be serviced by Medco beginning in 2012. The termination of this business will not impact 2011 financial results and will not have a material impact to 2012 earnings since this account is very heavily weighted towards particularly low-margin dual-eligible business.
I know many of you in the call are interested in our expected renewals for 2012. At this point, we estimate our 2012 renewals in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our book. One last point, we look forward to Lipitor's scheduled availability late in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the many other blockbuster brand-name drugs that lose their patent protection and become available in generic form in 2012. As we stated at our Analyst Day and on many other occasions, our clients, members and shareholders all stand to benefit from what we expect in 2012, the highest level of generic savings generating in our company's history. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions.  Vanessa?"

As you know, at a strategic level, many people are talking about oncologic issues moving from catastrophic to chronic in nature tied to the innovations in the drug world.

As you know, at a strategic level, many people are talking about oncologic issues moving from catastrophic to chronic in nature tied to the innovations in the drug world. And we've also mentioned to you many times, but we highlighted in the Analyst Day, that when you look at the pipeline of biotech drugs coming to market, 50% of them are oncologic in nature, and the vast majority of them have a biomarker associated with the drug, which obviously we've been building around now for years. This state-of-the-art oncologic TRC that opened up in Whitestown, Indiana is really gorgeous, and it has capacity for 130 pharmacists who do nothing but manage patient care to protocols around various tumor types. We have actually sub-stratified capabilities tied to evidence-based protocols, working with physicians and patients to drive better outcomes for this what is now becoming chronic disease. So our clients clearly love the concept of therapeutic resource centers. It's highly applicable to the oncology space. Our clients also do want us to bring the medical spend, which is half the specialty spend, that is on the medical side over to the pharmacy side to be better managed. So we are doing many things. One of them, we highlighted at Analyst Day, which is many of the drugs on the oncology space are infusible. And one of our nurses got up and demonstrated to all of you the iPad technology that we've developed to manage total patient care in the home that goes well beyond the infusion they're delivering. And we find out, we can actually, at the point of care, manage the source of the drug, get that drug sourced at a better price, mail environment for our client. We also can take care of the other drug needs and the drug gaps in care around that patient in that home setting, and we have well over 1,000 nurses, who do nothing but manage patient care in the home around all of these infusibles. And by the way, in the pipeline, well over 30% of the drugs in the pipeline are infusible. So we're going to see that trend grow as a major part of our arsenal as a point of care to change how these drugs are managed. In addition, we are working, especially with our health plan clients, to isolate those specialty drugs that are hidden under what people call J-Codes under the medical coding. J-Codes to me are, by definition, 100% unmanaged. They are mystery codes that allow payers to pay AWP plus the dispensing fee plus a mark-up, which is just grotesquely inefficient, and clients are becoming more and more aggressive around pulling that out and managing it properly, levering scale and everything else that we as PBM bring. And we do that today, and we're actually looking at some more highly scalable models in the future that we can rollout to do an even better job there but that's -- literally, we could double the size of Accredo simply by taking all of the spend that's buried on the medical side of the business and moving it to the managed environment we create for specialty drugs within Accredo. So we consider that an enormous opportunity and our clients are motivated to work with us."

I would tell you that margins, generally, are quite stable. But what we try to explain in our formal comments is that mix is something you just need to be aware of. So for example, hemophilia as a category, has been a higher-margin business. But the disease and the growth pattern of that disease among the population is far slower than the growth of many of the other specialty drugs tied to the disease patterns in the population. So, Rich, in his comments pointed out things like rheumatoid arthritis, things like pulmonary arterial hypertension. Those are stable margins that we like and when you just do the math and they grow dramatically, they change the weightings of margin across the drug products and that simply changes the overall margin perspective. But I wouldn't want investors think about this as declining margins for specialty, that's really not the story. It's just the relative growth across the product lines. So that's how I would think about it. Steve Fitzpatrick is here with us. Steve, do you want to add anything to that?"

We are not seeing the co-pay couponing, let's call it influencing our volume.

So today, I can tell you that we're not seeing any meaningful influence by coupons. However, let me be clear, to the extent couponing drives the wrong behavior, so what I mean by that, if couponing, in fact, takes the prudent buyer behavior out of the consumer by eliminating their out-of-pocket responsibility, which means they go to the most expensive drugs, which end up going to the payer's pocket. We have a series of things that we can easily do to shut that down very quickly. So we monitor, we make sure what's going on is in the clients' best interest, and we are fully prepared, and we work with our clients all the time so they can see and have visibility to what's going on. To the extent it's not in the payer's best interest, we have benefit designs, plan designs and strategies ready to go that can shut couponing down overnight.

And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Medco is pleased to report record fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 earnings, reflecting strong financial and operating performance at the high end of our previously increased guida",1518,"Thank you, Valerie. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Medco is pleased to report record fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 earnings, reflecting strong financial and operating performance at the high end of our previously increased guidance. Today, I will focus my remarks on full-year 2010 results and 2011 guidance, while Rich will focus on our balance sheet, our fourth-quarter results and details surrounding our 2011 guidance. At our Analyst Day in November, we shared with you our expectations for Medco and our business strategy that is designed to continue delivering strong growth through 2020. We outlined our portfolio of growth drivers that will advance our mission to make medicines smarter for our clients and the more than $65 million members we serve. Today, we remain confident in our expectations and are pleased to provide you with the details of our performance for 2010 and expectations for 2011. 
Let's begin with our year-over-year 2010 financial and operational performance. For the year, we delivered record GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.15 representing growth of 21.1%. Our diluted earnings per share excluding the amortization of intangibles from the 2003 spin-off grew 20.1% to a record $3.40. Our net revenues reached a record $66 billion, up 10.3% from 2009 despite the higher volumes of lower-cost generics that reduced our net revenues by nearly $3.7 billion and correspondingly resulted in record client and patient savings. 
Within net revenues, our higher margin-generating service revenues grew 28% to a record $1.08 billion, fueled by our United BioSource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company. We achieved record total gross margin of $4.3 billion, an increase of 7.7% over 2009.
Our EBITDA increased 8.1% to nearly $3 billion and our EBITDA per adjusted script increased 1.6% to a full-year record of $3.11. And finally, our net income increased 11.5% to a record $1.4 billion. With respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results, overall prescription volumes adjusted for the dates applied between retail and mail grew a strong 6.5% to a record 957 million prescriptions. 
Mail-order prescriptions for the year grew at a strong 6.5% to 109.8 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of 109 million prescriptions and set a new record. Importantly, we experienced continued strength in generic mail-order volumes, increasing a substantial 13.4% to 67.6 million prescriptions as patients continued to choose lower-cost generic medications. 
Growth of generics [ph] for the fourth quarter was even greater at 15.1%. Our overall generic dispensing rate rose 3.5 percentage points to 71% and within that, our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased an even greater amount by 3.7 percentage points to a record 61.5%. For the full year, our Medicare Part D PDP revenues achieved a record, increasing 33.5% to well over $1.4 billion. We are proud to have been the first and only national PDP to be awarded five stars by CMS and believe this world-class recognition operationally not only validates our investments in our agile enterprise but also enables continued strength in our Medicare business going forward.
Moving on to our Specialty business, Accredo's performance remained strong with revenues increasing 19.1% to a record $11.3 billion and operating income rising 22.7% to a record $438.2 million. Turning to sales and client retention results, Medco delivered another solid year of performance. Our 2010 annualized new-named and net-new sales each remained strong at $5.3 billion, and our client retention rate remained over 99%. For 2011 to date, our annualized new-named sales stand at $1.7 billion and our net-new sales are currently $1.5 billion, up from the $1.4 billion previously disclosed on our third-quarter earnings call. We have now completed over 80% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 50% we reported on our third-quarter call, and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
This past year, we continued to invest in our enterprise by expanding our expertise in genomic and personalized medicines with the acquisition of DNA Direct. We also entered the market for post-approval Phase IV safety, economic evaluation and outcomes research through our acquisition of United BioSource. We are very pleased with the results to date for both of these acquisitions. DNA Direct's genomic services are gaining traction in the marketplace. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the addition of four new community hospital clients to DNA Direct genomic medicine hospital network, extending web-based physician support and genetic expertise to their physicians and their patients. 
We also announced the addition of four new health plan clients who are implementing DNA Direct's Policy & Benefit Support Program for molecular diagnostic and genetic tests. This program enables payers to determine coverage for more than 800 molecular diagnostic and genetic tests and provides real-time access to the DNA Direct team of genetic counselors for clinical guidance and counseling on the more than 2,000 genetic tests available today. We are encouraged by the level of market interest in these new service offerings.
We are very pleased with the acquisition of UBC, which has been enthusiastically embraced by more than 100 Medco clients, representing more than 40 million lives volunteering to be part of the Medco research consortium to participate in UBC research study. This is up from the previously disclosed 89 clients and 33 million lives. As we noted at Analyst Day, both our clients and biotech drug manufacturers have common interests to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs coming to market. On top of that, Medco and its clients are fully aligned to pursue better outcomes and lower total healthcare costs, the essence of Making Medicine Smarter.
As we move forward, we anticipate UBC will continue to realize strong growth from its impressive pipeline of opportunities, including safety surveillance where UBC holds the market-leading position globally. Additionally, we expect to leverage UBC's, Medco's and Accredo's capabilities to the benefit of our clients and patients as we fundamentally change the way drugs are introduced, delivered and monitored for both safety and economics. 
Turning to guidance, we are reaffirming our full year 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.66 reflecting a growth rate of 12% to 16% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share excluding all intangible amortization, our new pure cash EPS measure, is reaffirmed to be in the range of $3.99 to $4.12, reflecting 12% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. Please note that the growth rate change for GAAP and pure cash EPS was 12% to 17% previously, but has narrowed due to the fact that we achieved the high end of our 2010 guidance range.
In closing, we remain confident in our ability to generate strong EPS growth well into the future. In the weeks since we shared our long-range plans with you, I have been asked how we can be so confident over such an extended horizon. There are two primary reasons, the first is the rigor and granular detail behind our 10-year strategic financial plan. As we shared on the Analyst Day last November, we have a very detailed roadmap for growth that is reasonable and logical based upon the many compelling opportunities we foresee over the next 10 years and a realistic view of the risks we may have encountered along the way. I believe that our growing portfolio of capabilities with leaders who are dedicated and accountable for each one of them will enable us to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions that will likely remain unmatched in the marketplace. 
The second is our people. Our employees are united to a greater good, a noble cause that fuel the passion around Making Medicine Smarter in a world-class manner. While a common vision is important, our people also have proven ability to execute with unparalleled excellence. Our CMS five-star rating is a testament to this, further evidence can be found in our January 1 install, which were virtually flawless despite the record number of complex changes required by CMS in the recent healthcare reform mandate. 
As we continue to make progress in advancing our capabilities through our agile enterprise initiative, we expect to achieve unprecedented improvements in the way we deliver operational excellence to the benefit of our clients and members. Yet another example of our operational excellence is the recent final approval we received from the Indiana Board of Pharmacy for our new third-generation automated pharmacy located in Whitestown, Indiana. 
In the testing phase that ran from September through mid-January, the board found that the pharmacy filled every prescription of the tens of thousands tested with 100% accuracy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our over 24,000 Medco employees now spanning the globe for their continued efforts on behalf of clients, patients and shareholders resulting in another great year and strong, long-term prospects. They are delivering everyday for our clients, members and shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Rich Rubino, who will take you through our balance sheet, the fourth-quarter 2010 financials and further details on our guidance for 2011. Rich?"
1541811,118622458,105132,"MedcoHealth Solutions Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Medco Health Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. We are pleased to deliver another quarter and full year of strong financial and operating performance. As Valerie mentioned, the slides on our website will prove helpful in following along with my commentary.Starting with",2317,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. We are pleased to deliver another quarter and full year of strong financial and operating performance. As Valerie mentioned, the slides on our website will prove helpful in following along with my commentary.
Starting with our balance sheet, we closed the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $853 million, and our cash flow from operations for full-year 2010 totaled over $2.34 billion. While our mail-order prescription volumes set record highs in 2010, our inventory balances represent a record year-end low of just over $1 billion at the end of 2010, a $272 million reduction from year-end 2009 on top of the $571 million reduction we generated during 2009.
Our capital expenditures at full year 2010 were in line with our guidance at $250 million, reflecting investments in our business to drive agility and enhance efficiency across the organization, prepare for healthcare reform implementation and to fund the future growth. We achieved the full year 2010 return on invested capital of 35%, excluding 2010 acquisitions such as UBC. A meaningful increase over the 2009 return was 27%, which was already seven points higher than 2008. 
Our fourth quarter 2010 EPS results were records, with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88 representing 25.7% growth over fourth-quarter 2009 and diluted EPS excluding the amortization of intangibles from the 2003 spin-off of $0.94 representing 23.7% growth over 2009.
Total fourth-quarter 2010 net revenues reached a record $16.9 billion, representing growth of 11.1% over fourth-quarter 2009. Our product revenue grew 10.4%, reflecting our new business wins as well as higher prices charged by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics, in fact, a record generic effect of approximately $1.1 billion on fourth quarter's revenue alone.
Service revenue continued to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 58.7% over fourth quarter-2009. This strong performance reflects a full quarter of service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base at our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned nearly $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.8 billion for full-year 2010, both records, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medications and more generics. These earned rebate levels represent 7% growth for the quarter and 8.1% growth for the year attributable to new client wins and continuous improvements in formulary contracting. Our fourth-quarter 2010 rebate retention rate was 13.0% compared to 14.1% in fourth-quarter 2009 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. For the full year, our rebate retention rate of 12.5% compared to 13.7% in 2009.
In terms of claims volumes, total fourth-quarter prescriptions adjusted for the difference in days supply between retail and mail reached a record $244.3 million, an increase of 7.4% over fourth-quarter 2009. Retail prescriptions in fourth-quarter 2010 grew 7.5% to a record $161.4 million. Mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose the lowest cost and most clinically effective channel.
Our mail-order prescriptions reached a record $27.9 million in fourth-quarter 2010, a 7.3% increase from fourth-quarter 2009. The adjusted mail-order prescription volumes for fourth-quarter 2010 comprised 33.9% of the total adjusted prescriptions, in line with the 34.0% mail penetration rate in fourth-quarter 2009.
Within the record fourth-quarter 2010 mail-order prescription volume total, generic prescription volume increased 15.1% to a record $17.5 million, reflecting new generic introductions and continued growth in previously released generics, while brand-name prescription volumes decreased 3.7% to 10.4 million prescriptions. The strength in our generic mail-order prescription volumes was an important driver of our fourth-quarter gross margin, which increased 13.1% over fourth-quarter 2009 to a record of $1.16 billion.
Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.9% for the quarter held steady with what we reported at third-quarter 2010, and on a year-over-year basis, increased 20 basis points from the 6.7% in fourth-quarter 2009, again a result of the strong fourth-quarter 2010 mail-order generic prescription volumes and our strong service gross margins. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $428.5 million for the fourth quarter increased over fourth-quarter 2009 by $53 million or 14.1%, reflecting the addition of UBC as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Excluding UBC, SG&A for the fourth quarter was up $32.2 million or 8.6% from fourth-quarter 2009. 
The expenses we incurred in 2010 for strategic initiatives are critical to our transformation into a world-class agile enterprise focused on speed, accuracy, efficiency and providing the highest levels of client and patient care. We invest in ourselves because we are a growth company, with many exciting components of our expanding portfolio of businesses. These investments, whether in the form of expense or capital, are designed to proactively drive unparalleled levels of client and patient service on top of what we believe is already a world-class service model.
Our total EBITDA for fourth-quarter 2010 reached a record $786.5 million, representing growth of 13.2%. EBITDA per adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 5.2% to $3.22, a fourth-quarter record. Our intangible amortization of $75 million in fourth-quarter 2010 decreased slightly from $75.5 million at fourth-quarter 2009. The full-year amortization of $287.4 million decreased in 2009 by 6.0% or $18.2 million, primarily reflecting lower intangible amortization from PolyMedica and Accredo, partially offset by the addition of UBC and DNA Direct intangible assets.
Total net interest and other expense of $50.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $10.5 million from the $39.9 million in fourth-quarter 2009, reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. For the full year, total net interest and other expense of $163.1 million was slightly higher compared to the $162.6 million for 2009, reflecting this new debt, offset by lower interest rates associated with floating-rate debt.
The fourth-quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 37.7% compared to 36.3% in 2009, primarily reflecting a 2009 benefit from state-related income tax items. Our effective tax rate for full year was 38.9%, in line with the 39.1% in 2009. Net income for the quarter increased 10.8% to a record $378.5 million from the $341.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, net income increased 11.5% to a record of over $1.4 billion from the $1.3 billion reported for 2009.
Moving on to share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 15.8 million shares for $963.3 million at an average per-share cost of $61.05. For full-year 2010, share repurchases totaled 69.9 million at a cost of $4.1 billion with an average per-share cost of $58.97. Since share repurchases commenced in 2005, we repurchased a total of 256.2 million shares, at a total cost of $11.1 billion, with an average per-share cost of $43.18. 
For 2011 to date, we repurchased 7.0 million shares with an average per-share cost of $62.06. In January 2011, we completed the remaining $437 million of the $3.0 billion authorization that was approved in May 2010. By February 2, 2011, our board authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase plan. We continued to complete approximately $2 billion in share repurchases in 2011, driving meaningful value to our shareholders. We expect to commence share repurchases under the new authorization later this quarter.
Turning to our Specialty segment, Accredo achieved record revenues of $3.0 billion for fourth-quarter 2010, an increase of 21.3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Consistent with our guidance, Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter amounted to 6.5% compared to the 7.0% in fourth-quarter 2009. This Accredo gross margin decline reflects product channel and new client mix. The 2010 product mix reflects significant growth in our multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, oncology and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with product volumes. Accredo's operating income for fourth-quarter 2010 increased 30.7% to $109.9 million. 
Moving on to Medicare, we continued to experience growth in our Medicare PDP. For fourth-quarter 2010, Medco's PDP revenues increased 27.7% to $331.7 million. As Dave discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2011. To briefly repeat our reaffirmed 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is expected to grow 12% to 16% over 2010 in the range of $3.53 to $3.66. As we noted last quarter, the non-GAAP diluted EPS measure change commencing in 2011 to exclude all intangible amortization. Diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization remains in the guidance range of $3.99 to $4.12, representing growth of 12% to 16% over the 2010 full-year equivalent of $3.55.
While this measure will not be used in 2011, diluted EPS, excluding intangible amortization from the 2003 spin-off would be guided to increase to a range of $3.80 to $3.93, also representing growth of 12% to 16% over 2010. The detailed components of our 2011 guidance are as follows. We currently expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including scheduled and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we have over 80% of our 2011 renewals already completed. As I've previously guided, approximately 75% of the renewal pricing is in effect in the first quarter with the majority of the remainder effective in the third quarter of 2011.
Our guidance for mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 remains in the range of $107 million to $109 million, demonstrating solid growth in our base business considering the 3 million script offset I discussed at Analyst day. You may recall the expected reduction of approximately 2 million mail-order scripts from the contribution of Europa Apotheek to the Medco Celesio joint venture and another 1 million scripts associated with the conversion of generic Allegra known as fexofenadine to OTC status in early 2011. These expectations remain intact.
As you can see from our slides on the Web, the vast majority of our detailed 2011 guidance components remain consistent with those we provided at our Analyst Day including, as example, the $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics and expectations for stability or probable expansion in gross margin percentage and EBITDA per adjusted script performance in 2011. There is one guidance point that is changing. As I alluded to on Analyst Day, we are narrowing our guidance for 2011 SG&A expense from a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion to a narrower range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.
Now let's focus specifically on the first quarter of 2011. Our first-quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is expected to increase over the first-quarter 2010 equivalent of $0.76 by approximately 16% to 17%. This first-quarter 2011 guidance includes a planned $0.04 benefit to earnings associated with changes to various employee benefit plans across the company. This item reflects the financial effects associated with the prior service credit for our employee post-employment benefits plan that was in place before our 2003 spin-off. This benefit, which equates to approximately 1% full-year EPS guidance, was included in our internal operating plan upon which guidance was based and was ultimately approved by our Board of Directors in January 2011.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect improvement in gross margin and EBITDA per script compared to first-quarter 2010, even when excluding the $0.04 benefit I just mentioned of which 3/4 flows to cost of sales and 1/4 flows to SG&A expense. Now let me provide some pointers to help you model the remaining quarters of 2011.
You may recall that I indicated on Analyst Day, when you look at earnings progression for the year, EPS in 2011 will be even more back-end loaded than we experienced in 2010. When excluding the $0.04 first-quarter benefit I just mentioned, EPS is expected to be fairly consistent in the first two quarters of 2011 and improve progressively in each of the last two quarters, in part the result of the incremental contribution from new generics, with zero, $0.01, $0.02 and $0.06 EPS contributions, respectively, for each of the four quarters.
Let me now discuss an item that is not included in guidance at this time as the net effect is currently indeterminable. The contribution of Europa Apotheek Venlo or EAV to the Medco Celesio joint venture is now expected to take place in March 2011. We still expect to record a foreign exchange loss upon contribution. We are awaiting the final fair market valuation of the EAV asset we are contributing. At this point, we believe the exchange loss will likely equate to approximately $20 million and it remains too early to quantify any gain or loss on the fair market valuation of EAV. This will be a onetime transaction that we will call out in our first-quarter 2011 results that, again, was not and is not included in our quarterly or full-year guidance. 
As we reported during the quarter, the Medicare Part D business of Universal American, a current Medco client, is planned to be acquired by one of our competitors. As a result, it is expected that their business will no longer be serviced by Medco beginning in 2012. The termination of this business will not impact 2011 financial results and will not have a material impact to 2012 earnings since this account is very heavily weighted towards particularly low-margin dual-eligible business.
I know many of you on the call are interested in our expected renewals for 2012. At this point, we estimate our 2012 renewals in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our book. One last point, we look forward to Lipitor's scheduled availability late in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the many other blockbuster brand-name drugs that lose their patent protection and become available in generic form in 2012. As we stated at our Analyst Day and on many other occasions, our clients, members and shareholders all stand to benefit from what we expect in 2012, the highest level of generic savings generating in our company's history. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions.  Vanessa?"

So I'd have to say that we're on track to delivering what we expect for 2011 as well. So with confidence, I can point to the fact that we do expect this momentum to continue with stability and the likelihood of growth, both in gross margins as well as EBITDA per script."

As you know, at a strategic level, many people are talking about oncologic issues moving from catastrophic to chronic in nature tied to the innovations in the drug world. And we've also mentioned to you many times, but we highlighted in the Analyst Day, that when you look at the pipeline of biotech drugs coming to market, 50% of them are oncologic in nature, and the vast majority of them have a biomarker associated with the drug, which obviously we've been building around now for years. This state-of-the-art oncologic TRC that opened up in Whitestown, Indiana is really gorgeous, and it has capacity for 130 pharmacists who do nothing but manage patient care to protocols around various tumor types. We have actually sub-stratified capabilities tied to evidence-based protocols, working with physicians and patients to drive better outcomes for this -- what is now becoming chronic disease. So our clients clearly love the concept of therapeutic resource centers. It's highly applicable to the oncology space. Our clients also do want us to bring the medical spend, which is half the specialty spend, that is on the medical side over to the pharmacy side to be better managed. So we are doing many things. One of them, we highlighted at Analyst Day, which is many of the drugs on the oncology space are infusible. And one of our nurses got up and demonstrated to all of you the iPad technology that we've developed to manage total patient care in the home that goes well beyond the infusion they're delivering. And we find out, we can actually, at the point of care, manage the source of the drug, get that drug sourced at a better price, mail environment for our client. We also can take care of the other drug needs and the drug gaps in care around that patient in that home setting, and we have well over 1,000 nurses, who do nothing but manage patient care in the home around all of these infusibles. And by the way, in the pipeline, well over 30% of the drugs in the pipeline are infusible. So we're going to see that trend grow as a major part of our arsenal at the  point of care to change how these drugs are managed. In addition, we are working, especially with our health plan clients, to isolate those specialty drugs that are hidden under what people call J-Codes under the medical coding. J-Codes to me are, by definition, 100% unmanaged. They are mystery codes that allow payers to pay AWP plus a dispensing fee plus a mark-up, which is just grotesquely inefficient, and clients are becoming more and more aggressive around pulling that out and managing it properly, levering scale and everything else that we as PBM bring. And we do that today, and we're actually looking at some more highly scalable models in the future that we can rollout to do an even better job there but that's -- literally, we could double the size of Accredo simply by taking all of the spend that's buried on the medical side of the business and moving it to the managed environment, we create for specialty drugs within Accredo. So we consider that an enormous opportunity and our clients are motivated to work with us."

I would tell you that margins, generally, are quite stable. But what we try to explain in our formal comments is that mix is something you just need to be aware of. So for example, hemophilia as a category, has been a higher-margin business. But the disease and the growth pattern of that disease among the population is far slower than the growth of many of the other specialty drugs tied to the disease patterns in the population. So, Rich, in his comments pointed out things like rheumatoid arthritis, things like pulmonary arterial hypertension. Those are stable margins, margins that we like, and when you just do the math and they grow dramatically, they change the weightings of margin across the drug products and that simply changes the overall margin perspective. But I wouldn't want investors think about this as declining margins for specialties, that's really not the story. It's just the relative growth across the product lines. So that's how I would think about it. Steve Fitzpatrick is here with us. Steve, do you want to add anything to that?"

We are not seeing the co-pay couponing, let's call it influencing our volumes.

So today, I can tell you that we're not seeing any meaningful influence by coupons. However, let me be clear, to the extent couponing drives the wrong behavior, so what I mean by that, if couponing, in fact, takes the prudent buyer behavior out of the consumer by eliminating their out-of-pocket responsibility, which means they go to the most expensive drugs, which end up going to the payer's pocket. We have a series of things that we can easily do to shut that down very quickly. So we monitor, we make sure what's going on, is in the clients' best interest, and we are fully prepared, and we work with our clients all the time so they can see and have visibility to what's going on. To the extent it's not in the payer's best interest, we have benefit designs, plan designs and strategies ready to go that can shut couponing down overnight.

We have named Frank Sheehy, a 13 year Medco veteran to proceed as Accredo's President. Frank also joined Medco's executive committee. Frank has an outstanding track record of business success and has earned some of the highest client and employee satisfaction ratings ever reported in our company. Frank's deep understanding of our customers and their needs in the specialty drug space make him well-suited to lead the Accredo  business as we continue to obtain Accredo's  capability through new innovation. 
On the 2012 sales front, while it is still too early in the 2012 selling season for the majority of our prospects to have finalized their decisions, we are very pleased with several significant early season wins. We remain confident in our well differentiated services and our strategic positioning in the marketplace. A good example of our differentiated service offering is our Medicare business. For the quarter, our Medicare PDP grew 16% over first quarter 2010, driven by the national five-star rating excellence awarded to Medco. This five-star rating was the first and only 1 awarded to any national PDP by CMS. 
For 2011 year-to-date, our annualized  new-named sales remained at approximately $1.7 billion and our net sales remained approximately $1.5 billion. We have now completed over 90% of our 2011 schedule and early elected client renewal, up from the over 80% we reported on our fourth quarter call and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
Turning to guidance, it is with confidence that we raised the midpoint of what our GAAP diluted EPS and our diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization, reflecting the strength we are seeing thus far in our 2011 results. In addition, we are raising our GAAP diluted EPS range by $0.03 due to a lower-than-expected intangible amortization expense associated with our UBC asset, which Rich will discuss further. Our full year 2011 GAAP diluted guidance increased total range of $3.59 to $3.69 up from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.56, now reflecting a growth rate of 14% to 17% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization is now expected to be the range of $4.2 to $4.12, up from $3.99 to $4.12, now reflecting 13% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. 
In summary, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, and are enthusiastic about our prospects for continued strong growth. Our ability to narrow guidance this early in the year serves to further fuel back enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Rubino, who will take you through the details of our first quarter 2011 financial and 2011 guidance. Rich?"

Total first quarter 2011 net revenues reached a record $17 billion, representing growth of 4.3% over first quarter 2010. Our product revenue grew 3.6%, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand name, pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics. 
Service revenue continue to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 57.5% over first quarter 2010. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base and our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned a record $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.4% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medication and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable from new client wins and continuous improvements with formulary contracts. Our first quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 11.6% compared to 12.1% in the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remained strong as client and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective service. In the first quarters 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume was $23.7 million. Within this, generic increased 9.3% to a record $17.7 million, while brand-name prescription volume decreased 9.1% to $10 million prescriptions. Our generic this patiently very substantial 250 basis points since first quarter 2010 to a record of 63.8%. Based upon our current forecast, we are raising our 2011 mail-order volume guidance range to $108 million to $110 million, up from the previous $107 million to $109 million scripts. 
Our strong generic mail-order volumes and our fee service gross margin meaningful drove our first quarter consolidated gross margin, which increased 7.8% over first quarter 2010 to $1.07 billion. Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.3% for the quarter increased 20 basis points from the 6.1% in the first quarter 2010, including a strong first quarter 2011, generic mail-order prescription volume and growth in service margin. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $387.1 million for the first quarter increased over first quarter of 2010 by $36.5 million or 10.4%, including increased expenses associated with the addition of UBC, as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with the strategic initiatives. Our total EBITDA for first quarter of 2011 reached $734.2 million, representing growth of 6.9%. EBITDA for adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 4.9% to $3.1. Our intangible amortization of $73.2 million in the first quarter 2011 increased 3.8% from $70.5 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. The final purchase accounting valuation for the UBC acquisition resulted in a lower identified intangible asset value that we included in our previous GAAP EPS guidance. And therefore, overall intangible amortization expense for full-year 2011 will be lower than originally guided by approximately $20 million.
Total amortization of intangibles for 2011 is now expected to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million compared to the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million. The $20 million reduction in the range equates to the $0.03 improvement in our revised full-year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance.
Total net interest and other expense of $54.2 million for the first quarter of 2011 increased $14.9 million from the $39.3 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the new GAAP reedited finance the UBC acquisition last September. 
First quarter 2011 effective tax rate was 40.1% compared to 39.8% in the first quarter 2010. We still expect the full-year 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. Net income for the quarter increased 3.9% to $333.1 million from the $320.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2010.
Moving on to share repurchases, during the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased 13.5 million shares for $836.6 million at an average per share cost of $62.23 through our preauthorized trading plan. Of these repurchases a total 6.4 million shares cost of $400 million have been repurchased under the new $3 billion plan authorized by Medco's Board of Directors on February 2. We expect to begin repurchasing shares again next week and anticipate represent approximately $2 billion of shares during 2011, consistent with the detailed guidance we provided last November. 
As a result of our share repurchases and normal climate component, we close the first quarter  with the cash balance of $127 million. We expect our quarterly cash balances to increase over the course of this year. Our total debt for the first quarter remained consistent with fourth quarter 2010 of $5.0 billion.
Turning to our specialty segment, as Dave already mentioned, Accredo achieved revenue $3.1 million and record operating income of $120.6 million for first quarter 2011. Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter was 6.6% compared to 7.1% first quarter 2010, reflecting the product, channel and new client mix effects to be experienced as 2010 progressed, which includes meaningful growth across the vast majority of Accredo's products. Sequentially, Accredo's gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points from the 6.5% reported in the fourth quarter 2010.
Moving on to Medicare, we continue to experience growth in our highly-rated Medicare PDP.  First quarter 2011, Medco's PDP revenues increased over 16% to nearly $440 million. As Dave explained, we are raised the midpoint of our 2011 EPS guidance for both GAAP or pure cash EPS measures, narrowing the range for the high-end to a $0.10 to the previous $0.13 range. And additionally, increasing the full-year GAAP diluted EPS by $0.03. The raising of the midpoint reflects strengthened fundamental or earnings for the year, while the $0.03 range of the full year GAAP diluted EPS of the function of the lower intangible expense I mentioned earlier. 
Table 9 of our earnings release place out the map very clearly. To briefly repeat our improved 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is now expected to grow 14% to 17% over 2010 in the range of $3.59 to $3.69. Pure cash EPS is now expected in the guidance range of $4.02 to $4.12, representing a growth of 13% to 16% over 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
Now, I would like to take you through the detailed component of our 2011 guidance beginning with renewals. We continue to expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including schedule and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we now have over 90% of our 2011 renewals completed, up from the over 80% we recorded last quarter. As previously disclosed, approximately 75% of the 2011 renewal pricing already took effect in the first quarter 2011, which we remain to expect primarily in the third quarter. At this point, we continue to expect that 2012 renewals to be in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion. Approximately 25% of our book. 
As you can see from our slides on the web, the majority of our detailed 2011 guidance component remained consistent with those we provided on our fourth quarter call. 2011, we continuing to expect a $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics, $0.01 expected in the second quarter, $0.02 expected in the third quarter and $0.06 expected in the fourth quarter. $0.03 of which relates to Lipitor for the five-week month of December.  We continue to expect stability or year-over-year expansion in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA for adjusted script performance for 2011. 
Now I would like to walk you through some of the changes to our 2011 guidance components. As I've briefly mentioned earlier, our mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, up from the previous range of $107 million to $109 million. SG&A expenses for 2011 are now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an improvement of the previously narrowed range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion. 
Now to give you some insights into the quarterly flow of earnings for 2011, we now expect EPS to improve progressively quarter-to-quarter, with the largest sequential improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter 2011. The  second quarter 2011, pure cash EPS is now expected to increase slightly over the first quarter 2011 EPS amount of $0.91. The percentage split in EPS between the first half and the second half of 2011 is now expected to be consistent with that experienced in 2010. 
In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter of operating results and EPS, representing a solid start to 2011. We remain confident in our prospects for the quarters ahead and for our continued growth relative to the future. Now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions. Andrea?"

We didn't have -- we weren't able to tell investors where that went until our second quarter call.

But for me, continuing to expand the Consumer-driven capabilities down to the individual consumers. So, for example, expressing gaps in care and evidence-based protocols through our website in the layperson language so the consumer can understand how to manage their care better and where their gap exists and how they're following their treatment protocol has been hugely powerful. And in fact, the gap and care closure we're getting on the self-help basis has been dramatic and on-going and I'm excited about that, both because it improves outcomes at lower cost, but also it's the least expensive way to close gaps in care, because I don't need to do the labor intensive pharmacist coaching each and every time. I'm also thrilled that we just recently launched the Medco smart phone app with Verizon, available both Android and BlackBerry version. These are really exciting apps and again gets to the next level of influencing consumers a powerful way that are clinically oriented, but also give them enormous financial information at the point of care with their doctor. And I think that that's something that is going to continue to propel better outcomes at lower costs through real clinical care and in complete communication among the parties involved for that care, and I like that. The other thing that isn't getting a lot of air time, and we've talked to all of you 2 times at 2 Analyst Day's, and I don't think people fully appreciate the power of it yet, but I guarantee you they will if our investments and our efforts around what we call Medco 2.0 and the Agile Enterprise. The benefit that will bring to the competitive marketplace in go forward years is incredible for me. It will unleash our ability to innovate in a quantum way. And I think we're going to take another attempt next Analyst Day to further explain how powerful this is, but that to me is what is really going to make a difference in how we take care our patients and how we service our customers in a way no one else can. And I'm going to leave it there. I'll ask you guys, Tim and Glen, if you have anything to add."

We are continually being the leader at vendor summit to sit down with multiple points of care inside of their constellation and being able to enable a greater level of connectivity than they can get by virtue of the way it goes in an unmanaged setting. So that's very powerful and the fact that we can enabled that and bring to our table are open architecture, our patient health action plan and we can work that by directionally with these other caregivers is compelling.

I think a couple of things. First of all, clients are at a point where they understand that mail is an to effectively cost effective channel, and that mail is outstanding at driving generic expensing rates. So we have great benefit design support on part of our clients to drive this outcome, and I would also tell that the economy continues to aid the choice of generic. Because clearly when people are financially strapped, they say, ""Hey, I'd rather have less out of pocket expense,"" and then moving from brand to generic. And the interchange going on between brand and generic voluntary on the part of consumer to simply that they simply have to save some money has been incredibly strong. The final thing I've mention is that we have a team that's always working with clients to drive better generic results across the channel both mail and retail and we've come up with few new innovations that I don't choose to describe in great detail, but they've been very effective in improving mail choice and generic choices at mail. So we're actually feeling this as though this is a momentum thing that we can sustain for a while."

Today, we're reporting strong first quarter 2011 earnings reflecting continued success across our strategic growth targets. Additionally, we are raising the midpoint of our full-yea",809,"Thank you, Valerie, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Today, we're reporting strong first quarter 2011 earnings reflecting continued success across our strategic growth targets. Additionally, we are raising the midpoint of our full-year 2011 EPS guidance range. 
For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share reached $0.80, representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization, our new pure cash EPS measures reached $0.91 to 19.7% increase over  first quarter  2010 equivalent. Even with ever-growing volumes of the lower priced generic drugs in our genetic makes this quarter 2011 that revenues increased to a record of more than $17 billion, representing 4.3% growth over the same period last year. Within our net revenues, service revenues grew 57.5% to a record $357.8 million, fueled by our United Biosource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company.
With respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results, total prescription volumes for first quarter 2011 adjusted for the difference in days applied between retail and mail grew 2.1% to $244.3 million prescriptions. Importantly, mail-order prescriptions totaled $27.7 million, with generic mail-order volumes increasing a substantial 9.3% to a record $17.7 million prescription , even in the quarter where there were no contributions from a generic. Our first quarter 2011 overall generic suspending rate rose 3.4 percentage point to a record 73.1%. And within that, our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased 4.5 percentage points to a record 53.8%.
The year-over-year improvement in our overall generic dispensing rate grow record incremental savings to our clients and members of $1.1 billion for the quarter, as the growing number of members took advantage of this high-quality more affordable alternative.
Moving on to our specialty business, Accredo's performance remain strong, with record first quarter 2011 revenues of $3.1 billion, up 14.9%. Accredo's operating income rose 13.2% to a record $120.6 million. 
As in aside, Keith Fitzpatrick who has served as President of Accredo since 2008 recently announced his retirement effective July 1. We all thank Steve for his years of excellent service and wish him a very happy retirement. We have named Frank Sheehy, a 13-year Medco veteran, to succeed Steve on July 1 as Accredo's President. Frank also joins Medco's Executive Committee. Frank has an outstanding track record of business success and has earned some of the highest client and employee satisfaction ratings ever recorded in our company. Frank's deep understanding of our customers and their needs in the specialty drug space make him well suited to lead the Accredo  business as we continue to expand Accredo's capabilities through new innovations. 
On the 2012 sales front, while it is still too early in the 2012 selling season for the majority of our prospects who have finalized their decisions, we are very pleased with several significant early season wins. We remain confident in our well differentiated services and our strategic positioning in the marketplace. A good example of our differentiated service offerings is our Medicare business. For the quarter, our Medicare PDP grew 16% over first quarter 2010, driven by the national 5-star rating of excellence that was awarded to Medco. This 5-star rating was the first and only one to be awarded to any national PDP by CMS. 
For 2011 year-to-date, our annualized new-named sales remain at approximately $1.7 billion, and our net-new sales remain approximately $1.5 billion. We have now completed over 90% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 80% we reported on our fourth quarter call, and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
Turning to guidance. It is with confidence that we raise the midpoint of both our GAAP diluted EPS and our diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization, reflecting the strength we are seeing, thus far, in our 2011 results. In addition, we are raising our GAAP diluted EPS range by $0.03 due to a lower-than-expected intangible amortization expense associated with our UBC asset, which Rich will discuss further. Our full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance increased to a range of $3.59 to $3.69, up from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.56, now reflecting a growth rate of 14% to 17% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization is now expected to be in the range of $4.2 to $4.12, up from $3.99 to $4.12, now reflecting 13% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. 
In summary, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, and are enthusiastic about our prospects for continued strong growth. Our ability to narrow guidance this early in the year serves to further fuel back enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Rubino, who will take you through the details of our first quarter 2011 financial and 2011 guidance. Rich?"
1541811,129808770,118992,"MedcoHealth Solutions Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Medco Health Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19",1593,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19.7% growth over the first quarter equivalent of $0.76. 
As we previously guided, first quarter 2011 EPS results include a planned $0.04 benefit associated with changes to the employee post-retirement health care benefit plan. Approximately 3/4 of which flowed to cost of sales and 1/4 to SG&A expense. 
Even when excluding net benefit, the GAAP EPS growth rate was 13.4% and the pure cash EPS growth rate was 14.5%. Our gross margin and EBITDA per adjusted script both grew with this onetime benefit is excluded. Total first quarter 2011 net revenues reached a record $17 billion, representing growth of 4.3% over first quarter 2010. Our product revenue grew 3.6%, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand name, pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics. 
Service revenue continues to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 57.5% over first quarter 2010. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base and our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned a record $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.4% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medication and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to new client wins and continuous improvements with formulary contracting. Our first quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 11.6% compared to 12.1% in the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong as client and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective service. In the first quarters 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume was $27.7 million. Within this, generic increased 9.3% to a record $17.7 million, while brand-name prescription volume decreased 9.1% to $10 million prescriptions. Our generic dispensing rate now increased a very substantial 450 basis points since first quarter 2010 to a new record of 63.8%. Based upon our current forecast, we are raising our 2011 mail-order volume guidance range to 108 million to 110 million, up from the previous 107 million to 109 million scripts. 
Our strong generic mail-order prescription volumes and our fee service gross margin meaningfully drove our first quarter consolidated gross margin, which increased 7.8% over first quarter 2010 to $1.07 billion. Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.3% for the quarter increased 20 basis points from the 6.1% in the first quarter 2010, including the strong first quarter 2011 generic mail-order prescription volume and growth in service margin. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $387.1 million for the first quarter increased over first quarter of 2010 by $36.5 million or 10.4%, including increased expenses associated with the addition of UBC, as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Our total EBITDA for first quarter of 2011 reached $734.2 million, representing growth of 6.9%. EBITDA for adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 4.9% to $3.01. Our intangible amortization of $73.2 million in the first quarter 2011 increased 3.8% from $70.5 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. The final purchase accounting valuation for the UBC acquisition resulted in a lower identified intangible asset value that we included in our previous GAAP EPS guidance. And therefore, overall intangible amortization expense for full year 2011 will be lower than originally guided by approximately $20 million.
Total amortization of intangibles for 2011 is now expected to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million compared to the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million. The $20 million reduction in the range equates to the $0.03 improvement in our revised full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance.
Total net interest and other expense of $54.2 million for the first quarter of 2011 increased $14.9 million from the $39.3 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. 
First quarter of 2011 effective tax rate was 40.1% compared to 39.8% in the first quarter 2010. We still expect the full year of 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. Net income for the quarter increased 3.9% to $333.1 million from the $320.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2010.
Moving on to share repurchases, during the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased 13.5 million shares for $836.6 million at an average per share cost of $62.23 through our pre-authorized trading plan. Of these repurchases, a total 6.4 million shares cost of $400 million have been repurchased under the new $3 billion plan authorized by Medco's Board of Directors on February 2. We expect to begin repurchasing shares again next week and anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion of shares during 2011, consistent with the detailed guidance we provided last November. 
As a result of our share repurchases and normal climate component, we closed the first quarter with a cash balance of $127 million. We expect our quarterly cash balances to increase over the course of this year. Our total debt for the first quarter remained consistent with fourth quarter 2010 of $5.0 billion.
Turning to our Specialty segment, as Dave already mentioned, Accredo achieved revenues of $3.1 billion and record operating income of $120.6 million for first quarter 2011. Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter was 6.6% compared to 7.1% first quarter 2010, reflecting the product, channel and new client mix effects to be experienced as 2010 progressed, which includes meaningful growth across the vast majority of Accredo's products. Sequentially, Accredo's gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points from the 6.5% reported in the fourth quarter 2010.
Moving on to Medicare, we continue to experience growth in our highly rated Medicare PDP. First quarter 2011, Medco's PDP revenues increased over 16% to nearly $440 million. As Dave explained, we are raising the midpoint of our 2011 EPS guidance for both GAAP and pure cash EPS measures, narrowing the range for the high-end to a $0.10 range from the previous $0.13 range, and additionally, increasing our full year GAAP diluted EPS by $0.03. The raising of the midpoint reflects strengthened fundamental operating earnings expectations for the year, while the $0.03 raise to full year GAAP diluted EPS is the function of the lower intangible amortization expense I mentioned earlier. 
Table 9 of our earnings release lays out the map very clearly. To briefly repeat our improved 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is now expected to grow 14% to 17% over 2010 in the range of $3.59 to $3.69. Pure cash EPS is now expected in the guidance range of $4.02 to $4.12, representing growth of 13% to 16% over the 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
Now I would like to take you through the detailed component of our 2011 guidance beginning with renewals. We continue to expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including schedule and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we now have over 90% of our 2011 renewals completed, up from the over 80% we recorded last quarter. As previously disclosed, approximately 75% of the 2011 renewal pricing already took effect in the first quarter of 2011, with the remainder expected primarily in the third quarter. At this point, we continue to expect 2012 renewals to be in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our book. 
As you can see from our slides on the web, the majority of our detailed 2011 guidance component remain consistent with those we provided on our fourth quarter call. 2011, we continue to expect a $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics, $0.01 expected in the second quarter, $0.02 expected in the third quarter and $0.06 expected in the fourth quarter, $0.03 of which relates to Lipitor for the five-week month of December.  We continue to expect stability or year-over-year expansion in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA for adjusted script performance in 2011. 
Now I would like to walk you through some of the changes to our 2011 guidance components. As I briefly mentioned earlier, our mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, up from the previous range of $107 million to $109 million. SG&A expenses for 2011 are now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an improvement from the previously narrowed range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion. 
Now to give you some insights into the quarterly flow of earnings for 2011, we now expect EPS to improve progressively quarter-to-quarter, with the largest sequential improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is now expected to increase slightly over the first quarter 2011 EPS amount of $0.91. The percentage split in EPS between the first half and the second half of 2011 is now expected to be consistent with that experienced in 2010. 
In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter of operating results and EPS, representing a solid start to 2011. We remain confident in our prospects for the quarters ahead and for our continued growth well into the future. Now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions. Andrea?"

That's where all the new brand innovation is occurring, and we're working with them on some, I think, exciting solutions for the future. And that's where a lot of the conversation goes when you talk about renewals and retention. When you look at FEPO, I will just tell you that we actually went back and look at what this timing was for announcement last time they went out the full RFP. And they're on schedule actually. When we looked at it last time, which is I think 5 years ago now, they didn't actually announced till late in the second quarter. And we didn't have invest -- we weren't able to tell investors where we - where that went until our second quarter call. So they may or may not be ahead of that schedule, but relative to previous years, they're on schedule and we still feel as though we have a very competitive offering there.

And then again I'll ask the Group Presidents to add anything that I don't cover. But for me, continuing to extend the consumer-driven capabilities down to the individual consumers -- so, for example, expressing gaps in care and evidence-based protocols through our website in the layperson language, so the consumer can understand how to manage their care better and where their gap exists and how they're following their treatment protocol has been hugely powerful. And in fact, the gap in care closures we're getting on the self-help basis has been dramatic and growing, and I'm excited about that, both because it improves outcomes at lower cost, but also it's the least expensive way to close gaps in care because I don't need to do the labor-intensive pharmacist coaching each and every time. I'm also thrilled that we just recently launched the Medco's smart phone app with Verizon, available both in Android and BlackBerry version. These are really exciting apps and again get us to the next levels of influencing consumers in powerful ways that are clinically oriented, but also give them enormous financial information at the point of care with their doctor. And I think that that's something that is going to continue to propel better outcomes at lower costs through real clinical care and in complete communication among the parties involved for that care. And I like that. The other thing that isn't getting a lot of air time, and we've talked to all of you 2 times at 2 Analyst Day's, and I don't think people fully appreciate the power of it yet, but I guarantee you they will, if our investments and our efforts around what we call Medco 2.0 and the agile enterprise. The benefit that will bring to the competitive marketplace in go-forward years is incredible for me. It will unleash our ability to innovate in a quantum way. And I think we're going to take another attempt next Analyst Day to further explain how powerful this is, but that to me is what is really going to make a difference in how we take care of patients in a way and how we service our customers in a way no one else can. And I'm going to leave it there. I'll ask you guys, Tim and Glen, if you have anything to add."

Huge in terms of the response to them, what that's going to enable in terms of the way we engage with our patients. But beyond that, I think the other big thing, Dave, are 2 things. One is our extended enterprise. We are continually being the leader at vendor summits that clients have to sit down with multiple points of care inside of their constellation, and being able to enable a greater level of connectivity than they can get by virtue of the way it goes in an unmanaged setting. So that's very powerful. And the fact that we can enabled that and bring to the table our open architecture, our patient health action plan and we can work that bidirectionally with these other caregivers is compelling. The third piece I would say is our strategy has been hugely successful. We have modeled over 50 clients in terms of looking at the value. We are installing a whole lot of them for '12, or '13 we think we have brought a level of value that is unparalleled in terms of both the member care for these clients want to continue to care for members and at the same time bring a significant financial changed to what it looks likes in terms of the."

These are trickier to do than the ones [indiscernible] so it's a real positive for us to be able to figure out how that gets on. Also, we've launched our new service which is kind of like a 1-800 number to call certified generic Health Care to get advice when you're newly diagnosed with any sort of  problem like cancer and that's actually traction event even when describing that new service. We've added a number of hospitals medical institute network including 1 in Canada, which is pretty exciting where we are arming hospitals around the country genomic information to make them certified Javon at the center.

Since we announced the acquisition in September, we also launched the Medco Research Consortium, which any client interested in participating in the research, including BBC, we now have well over 100 clients representing 40 million of our lives in the consortium.

We believe it improves the ability of the physician to make decisions and prescribing treatment, and also allows us to play the evidence based protocol that allows a sort of benchmark capital the activities that are happening.

So we have great benefit design support on part of our clients to drive this outcome, and I would also tell that the economy continues to aid the choice of generic. Because clearly when people are financially strapped, they say, ""Hey, I'd rather have less out of pocket expense,"" and then moving from brand to generic. And the interchange going on between brand and generic voluntary on the part of consumer to simply that they simply have to save some money has been incredibly strong. The final thing I've mention is that we have a team that's always working with clients to drive better generic results across the channel both mail and retail and we've come up with few new innovations that I don't choose to describe in great detail, but they've been very effective in improving mail choice and generic choices at mail.

Today we're reporting strong first quarter 2011 earnings reflecting continuous success across our strategic growth drivers. Additionally, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2011 EPS guidance range of -- for the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share reached $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010. Diluted earnings split per share, excluding all intangible amortization, our new pure cash EPS measure, reached $0.91, a 19.7% increase over first quarter 2010 equivalent. 
Even with ever growing volumes at the lower-priced generic drugs in our revenue mix, first quarter 2011 net revenues increased to a record of more than $17 billion representing 4.3% growth over the same period last year. Within our net revenues, service revenues grew 57.5% to a record $357.8 million fueled by our United BioSource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company. With respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results. Total prescription volumes for first quarter 2011 adjusted to the difference in dates applied between retail and mail grew 2.1% to 244.3 million prescription. Importantly, mail-order prescriptions totaled 27.7 million, with generic mail-order volumes increasing a substantial 9.3% to a record $17.7 million prescription, even in a quarter where there were no contributions from new generics. Our first quarter 2011 overall generic dispensing rate rose 3.4 percentage point to a record 73.1%. And within that, our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased 4.5 percentage points to a record 53.8%.
The year-over-year improvement in our overall generic dispensing rate drove record incremental savings to our clients and members of $1.1 billion for the quarter, as a growing number of members took advantage of this high-quality, more affordable alternative.
Moving on to our Specialty business, Accredo's performance remains strong, with record first quarter 2011 revenues of $3.1 billion, up 14.9%. Accredo's operating income rose 13.2% to a record $120.6 million. 
As an aside, Keith Fitzpatrick, who has served as President of Accredo since 2008, recently announced his retirement effective July 1.
We all thank Steve for his years of excellent service and wish him a very happy retirement. We have named Frank Sheehy, a 13-year Medco veteran, to succeed Steve on July 1 as Accredo's President. Frank also joins Medco's Executive Committee. Frank has an outstanding track record of business success and has earned some of the highest client and employee satisfaction ratings ever recorded in our company. Frank's deep understanding of our customers and their needs in the specialty drug space make him well suited to lead the Accredo  business as we continue to expand Accredo's capabilities through new innovations. 
On the 2012 sales front, while it is still too early in the 2012 selling season for the majority of our prospects who have finalized their decisions, we are very pleased with several significant early season wins. We remain confident in our well differentiated services and our strategic positioning in the marketplace. A good example of our differentiated service offerings is our Medicare business. For the quarter, our Medicare PDP grew 16% over first quarter 2010, driven by the national 5-star rating of excellence that was awarded to Medco. This 5-star rating was the first and only one to be awarded to any national PDP by CMS. 
For 2011 year-to-date, our annualized new-named sales remain at approximately $1.7 billion, and our net-new sales remain approximately $1.5 billion. We have now completed over 90% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 80% we reported on our fourth quarter call, and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
Turning to guidance. It is with confidence that we raise the midpoint of both our GAAP diluted EPS and our diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization, reflecting the strength we are seeing, thus far, in our 2011 results. In addition, we are raising our GAAP diluted EPS range by $0.03 due to a lower-than-expected intangible amortization expense associated with our UBC asset, which Rich will discuss further. Our full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance increased to a range of $3.59 to $3.69, up from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.56, now reflecting a growth rate of 14% to 17% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization is now expected to be in the range of $4.2 to $4.12, up from $3.99 to $4.12, now reflecting 13% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. 
In summary, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, and are enthusiastic about our prospects for continued strong growth. Our ability to narrow guidance this early in the year serves to further fuel back enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Rubino, who will take you through the details of our first quarter 2011 financial and 2011 guidance. Rich?"
1541811,129808770,119062,"MedcoHealth Solutions Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Medco Health Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19",1593,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19.7% growth over the first quarter equivalent of $0.76. 
As we previously guided, first quarter 2011 EPS results include a planned $0.04 benefit associated with changes to the employee post-retirement health care benefit plan. Approximately 3/4 of which flowed to cost of sales and 1/4 to SG&A expense. 
Even when excluding net benefit, the GAAP EPS growth rate was 13.4% and the pure cash EPS growth rate was 14.5%. Our gross margin and EBITDA per adjusted script both grew with this onetime benefit is excluded. Total first quarter 2011 net revenues reached a record $17 billion, representing growth of 4.3% over first quarter 2010. Our product revenue grew 3.6%, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand name, pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics. 
Service revenue continues to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 57.5% over first quarter 2010. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base and our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned a record $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.4% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medication and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to new client wins and continuous improvements with formulary contracting. Our first quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 11.6% compared to 12.1% in the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong as client and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective service. In the first quarters 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume was $27.7 million. Within this, generic increased 9.3% to a record $17.7 million, while brand-name prescription volume decreased 9.1% to $10 million prescriptions. Our generic dispensing rate now increased a very substantial 450 basis points since first quarter 2010 to a new record of 63.8%. Based upon our current forecast, we are raising our 2011 mail-order volume guidance range to 108 million to 110 million, up from the previous 107 million to 109 million scripts. 
Our strong generic mail-order prescription volumes and our fee service gross margin meaningfully drove our first quarter consolidated gross margin, which increased 7.8% over first quarter 2010 to $1.07 billion. Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.3% for the quarter increased 20 basis points from the 6.1% in the first quarter 2010, including the strong first quarter 2011 generic mail-order prescription volume and growth in service margin. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $387.1 million for the first quarter increased over first quarter of 2010 by $36.5 million or 10.4%, including increased expenses associated with the addition of UBC, as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Our total EBITDA for first quarter of 2011 reached $734.2 million, representing growth of 6.9%. EBITDA for adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 4.9% to $3.01. Our intangible amortization of $73.2 million in the first quarter 2011 increased 3.8% from $70.5 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. The final purchase accounting valuation for the UBC acquisition resulted in a lower identified intangible asset value that we included in our previous GAAP EPS guidance. And therefore, overall intangible amortization expense for full year 2011 will be lower than originally guided by approximately $20 million.
Total amortization of intangibles for 2011 is now expected to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million compared to the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million. The $20 million reduction in the range equates to the $0.03 improvement in our revised full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance.
Total net interest and other expense of $54.2 million for the first quarter of 2011 increased $14.9 million from the $39.3 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. 
First quarter of 2011 effective tax rate was 40.1% compared to 39.8% in the first quarter 2010. We still expect the full year of 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. Net income for the quarter increased 3.9% to $333.1 million from the $320.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2010.
Moving on to share repurchases, during the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased 13.5 million shares for $836.6 million at an average per share cost of $62.23 through our pre-authorized trading plan. Of these repurchases, a total 6.4 million shares cost of $400 million have been repurchased under the new $3 billion plan authorized by Medco's Board of Directors on February 2. We expect to begin repurchasing shares again next week and anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion of shares during 2011, consistent with the detailed guidance we provided last November. 
As a result of our share repurchases and normal climate component, we closed the first quarter with a cash balance of $127 million. We expect our quarterly cash balances to increase over the course of this year. Our total debt for the first quarter remained consistent with fourth quarter 2010 of $5.0 billion.
Turning to our Specialty segment, as Dave already mentioned, Accredo achieved revenues of $3.1 billion and record operating income of $120.6 million for first quarter 2011. Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter was 6.6% compared to 7.1% first quarter 2010, reflecting the product, channel and new client mix effects to be experienced as 2010 progressed, which includes meaningful growth across the vast majority of Accredo's products. Sequentially, Accredo's gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points from the 6.5% reported in the fourth quarter 2010.
Moving on to Medicare, we continue to experience growth in our highly rated Medicare PDP. First quarter 2011, Medco's PDP revenues increased over 16% to nearly $440 million. As Dave explained, we are raising the midpoint of our 2011 EPS guidance for both GAAP and pure cash EPS measures, narrowing the range for the high-end to a $0.10 range from the previous $0.13 range, and additionally, increasing our full year GAAP diluted EPS by $0.03. The raising of the midpoint reflects strengthened fundamental operating earnings expectations for the year, while the $0.03 raise to full year GAAP diluted EPS is the function of the lower intangible amortization expense I mentioned earlier. 
Table 9 of our earnings release lays out the map very clearly. To briefly repeat our improved 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is now expected to grow 14% to 17% over 2010 in the range of $3.59 to $3.69. Pure cash EPS is now expected in the guidance range of $4.02 to $4.12, representing growth of 13% to 16% over the 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
Now I would like to take you through the detailed component of our 2011 guidance beginning with renewals. We continue to expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including schedule and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we now have over 90% of our 2011 renewals completed, up from the over 80% we recorded last quarter. As previously disclosed, approximately 75% of the 2011 renewal pricing already took effect in the first quarter of 2011, with the remainder expected primarily in the third quarter. At this point, we continue to expect 2012 renewals to be in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our book. 
As you can see from our slides on the web, the majority of our detailed 2011 guidance component remain consistent with those we provided on our fourth quarter call. 2011, we continue to expect a $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics, $0.01 expected in the second quarter, $0.02 expected in the third quarter and $0.06 expected in the fourth quarter, $0.03 of which relates to Lipitor for the five-week month of December.  We continue to expect stability or year-over-year expansion in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA for adjusted script performance in 2011. 
Now I would like to walk you through some of the changes to our 2011 guidance components. As I briefly mentioned earlier, our mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, up from the previous range of $107 million to $109 million. SG&A expenses for 2011 are now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an improvement from the previously narrowed range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion. 
Now to give you some insights into the quarterly flow of earnings for 2011, we now expect EPS to improve progressively quarter-to-quarter, with the largest sequential improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is now expected to increase slightly over the first quarter 2011 EPS amount of $0.91. The percentage split in EPS between the first half and the second half of 2011 is now expected to be consistent with that experienced in 2010. 
In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter of operating results and EPS, representing a solid start to 2011. We remain confident in our prospects for the quarters ahead and for our continued growth well into the future. Now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions. Andrea?"

But what our clients are most focused on in 2012 and beyond that is really the rate of increase in cost on the specialty side of the business. And they're looking for new innovation and solutions there because it's -- the small molecule goes from brand -- generic, they're getting great relief. But they see where specialty is heading. That's where all the new brand innovation is occurring, and we're working with them on some, I think, exciting solutions for the future. And that's where a lot of the conversation goes when you talk about renewals and retention. When you look at FEPO, I will just tell you that we actually went back and look at what this timing was for announcement last time they went out the full RFP. And they're on schedule actually. When we looked at it last time, which is I think 5 years ago now, they didn't actually announced till late in the second quarter. And we didn't have invest -- we weren't able to tell investors where we - where that went until our second quarter call. So they may or may not be ahead of that schedule, but relative to previous years, they're on schedule and we still feel as though we have a very competitive offering there. Relative to your final question, Lisa, I'm going to ask Tim Wentworth and then Glenn Taylor to reflect their markets and the CalPERS situation. So, guys, why don't you go ahead."

And then again I'll ask the Group Presidents to add anything that I don't cover. But for me, continuing to extend the consumer-driven capabilities down to the individual consumers -- so, for example, expressing gaps in care and evidence-based protocols through our website in the layperson language, so the consumer can understand how to manage their care better and where their gap exists and how they're following their treatment protocol has been hugely powerful. And in fact, the gap in care closures we're getting on the self-help basis has been dramatic and growing, and I'm excited about that, both because it improves outcomes at lower cost, but also it's the least expensive way to close gaps in care because I don't need to do the labor-intensive pharmacist coaching each and every time. I'm also thrilled that we just recently launched the Medco's smart phone app with Verizon, available both in Android and BlackBerry version. These are really exciting apps and again get us to the next levels of influencing consumers in powerful ways that are clinically oriented, but also give them enormous financial information at the point of care with their doctor. And I think that that's something that is going to continue to propel better outcomes at lower costs through real clinical care and in complete communication among the parties involved for that care. And I like that. The other thing that isn't getting a lot of air time, and we've talked to all of you 2 times at 2 Analyst Day's, and I don't think people fully appreciate the power of it yet, but I guarantee you they will, if our investments and our efforts around what we call Medco 2.0 and the agile enterprise. The benefit that will bring to the competitive marketplace in go-forward years is incredible for me. It will unleash our ability to innovate in a quantum way. And I think we're going to take another attempt next Analyst Day to further explain how powerful this is, but that to me is what is really going to make a difference in how we take care of patients in a way and how we service our customers in a way no one else can. And I'm going to leave it there. I'll ask you guys, Tim and Glen, if you have anything to add."

And everyone of them is going to heavily promote the app to their members, particularly once we get an iPhone application as well, which will be before the end of the second quarter. Huge in terms of the response to them, what that's going to enable in terms of the way we engage with our patients. But beyond that, I think the other big thing, Dave, are 2 things. One is our extended enterprise. We are continually being the leader at vendor summits that clients have to sit down with multiple points of care inside of their constellation, and being able to enable a greater level of connectivity than they can get by virtue of the way it goes in an unmanaged setting. So that's very powerful. And the fact that we can enabled that and bring to the table our open architecture, our patient health action plan and we can work that bidirectionally with these other caregivers is compelling. The third piece I would say is our EGWP strategy has been hugely successful. We have modeled over 50 clients in terms of looking at the value list. We are installing a whole lot of them for '12 or '13. And we think that we brought a level of value there that is unparalleled in terms of both the number care that these clients want to continue to care for the members and at the same time bringing it significant financial change to what it looks like in terms of providing that."

We now have over 300 clients enrolled in multiple pharmacogenomics programs, representing about 12 million of our lives.

These are trickier to do than -- the ones, they're not cheap [indiscernible] So it's a real positive for us to be able to figure out how to get that done. Also, we've launched our new service which is kind of like a 1-800 number to call certified genetic and get advice when you're newly diagnosed with any sort of  problem like cancer. And that's actually gotten a little traction even when we just started driving that new service. We've added a number of hospitals to our genomic medical institute network, including one in Canada, which is pretty exciting, where we are arming hospitals around the country with genomic information to make them certified genomic centers. And in another area in genomic which is new for us is to take the intelligence around  [ph] that DNA Direct has and offer those as the policy service health plan, who don't have their own technology equipment. And we've actually had a number of sales in that area since the beginning which has been a real uplift for us. So all areas are inspiring. They're all new. On the research front, we have a dozen large multi  [indiscernible] patient ongoing studies, several of which we'll complete this year. But you'll be hearing in the back half of the year some of the results that are very large prospective studies that has taken us into new areas including neuropsychiatry, where we have not been before. So it's pretty exciting. Actually, the scientific community has been really excited about the work we're doing since no one else is doing it.On the UBC front, the synergy has been simply awesome. Since we announced the acquisition at the end of September, we also launched the Medco Research Consortium, which is any client interested in participating in the research, including UBC. We now have well over 100 clients representing 40 million of our lives in the consortium. And we now actually have clients participating in  [indiscernible] studies or safety studies or both. And the early feedback has been really exciting. People love it. The members love it. They like the having the added protection of the safety in the particular type study.

One of the things that we're very excited when you think in terms of extended enterprise and the broad portfolio of clinical capability is -- the real game changer is to help get the healthcare system wired in the country. And 1 of the most powerful features of that is being able to help support the point of care where the patient and the physician interaction is at its most important. To be able to provide this 360 degree insights to that point of care. We believe it improves the ability of the physician to make decisions and prescribing course of treatment and also allows us to place a set of evidence-based protocol that allows us to put a benchmark to the type of activities that are happening. So I think you will see over the not too distant future an expanding portfolio of cloud computing based solutions to point of care, and it's also the mechanism we're going to be using to enable both the medical home and Campbell Care Organization  [ph as well.

And the interchange that's going on between brand and generic voluntarily on the part of consumers is simply that I need to save some money has been incredibly strong. The final thing I've mentioned is that we have a team that always is working with clients to drive better generic expensing results across the channel, both mail and retail, and we've come up with a few new innovations that I don't choose to describe in great detail, but they've been very effective in improving mail choice and generic choices at mail.

Today we're reporting strong first quarter 2011 earnings reflecting continuous success across our strategic growth drivers. Additionally, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2011 EPS guidance range of -- for the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share reached $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010. Diluted earnings split per share, excluding all intangible amortization, our new pure cash EPS measure, reached $0.91, a 19.7% increase over first quarter 2010 equivalent. 
Even with ever growing volumes at the lower-priced generic drugs in our revenue mix, first quarter 2011 net revenues increased to a record of more than $17 billion representing 4.3% growth over the same period last year. Within our net revenues, service revenues grew 57.5% to a record $357.8 million fueled by our United BioSource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company. With the respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results. Total prescription volumes for first quarter 2011 adjusted to the difference in dates applied between retail and mail grew 2.1% to 244.3 million prescription. Importantly, mail-order prescriptions totaled 27.7 million, with generic mail-order volumes increasing a substantial 9.3% to a record 17.7 million prescription, even in a quarter where there were no contributions from new generics. Our first quarter 2011 overall generic dispensing rate rose 3.4 percentage point to a record 73.1%. And within that, our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased 4.5 percentage points to a record 53.8%.
The year-over-year improvement in our overall generic dispensing rate drove record incremental savings to our clients and members of $1.1 billion for the quarter, as a growing number of members took advantage of this high-quality, more affordable alternative.
Moving on to our Specialty business, Accredo's performance remains strong, with record first quarter 2011 revenues of $3.1 billion, up 14.9%. Accredo's operating income rose 13.2% to a record $120.6 million. 
As an aside, Keith Fitzpatrick, who has served as President of Accredo since 2008, recently announced his retirement effective July 1.
2008 recently announced his retirement effective July 1. We all thank Steve for his years of excellent service and wish him a very happy retirement. We have named Frank Sheehy, a 13-year Medco veteran, to succeed Steve on July 1 as Accredo's President. Frank also joins Medco's Executive Committee. Frank has an outstanding track record of business success and has earned some of the highest client and employee satisfaction ratings ever recorded in our company. Frank's deep understanding of our customers and their needs in the specialty drug space make him well suited to lead the Accredo  business as we continue to expand Accredo's capabilities through new innovations. 
On the 2012 sales front, while it is still too early in the 2012 selling season for the majority of our prospects who have finalized their decisions, we are very pleased with several significant early season wins. We remain confident in our well differentiated services and our strategic positioning in the marketplace. A good example of our differentiated service offerings is our Medicare business. For the quarter, our Medicare PDP grew 16% over first quarter 2010, driven by the national 5-star rating of excellence that was awarded to Medco. This 5-star rating was the first and only one to be awarded to any national PDP by CMS. 
For 2011 year-to-date, our annualized new-named sales remain at approximately $1.7 billion, and our net-new sales remain approximately $1.5 billion. We have now completed over 90% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 80% we reported on our fourth quarter call, and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
Turning to guidance. It is with confidence that we raise the midpoint of both our GAAP diluted EPS and our diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization, reflecting the strength we are seeing, thus far, in our 2011 results. In addition, we are raising our GAAP diluted EPS range by $0.03 due to a lower-than-expected intangible amortization expense associated with our UBC asset, which Rich will discuss further. Our full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance increased to a range of $3.59 to $3.69, up from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.56, now reflecting a growth rate of 14% to 17% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization is now expected to be in the range of $4.02
 to $4.12, up from $3.99 to $4.12, now reflecting 13% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. 
In summary, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, and are enthusiastic about our prospects for continued strong growth. Our ability to narrow guidance this early in the year serves to further fuel that enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Rubino, who will take you through the details of our first quarter 2011 financial and 2011 guidance. Rich?"

Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19.7% growth over the first quarter equivalent of $0.76. 
As we previously guided, first quarter 2011 EPS results include a planned $0.04 benefit associated with changes to the employee post-retirement health care benefit plan. Approximately 3/4 of which flowed to cost of sales and 1/4 to SG&A expense. 
Even when excluding net benefit, the GAAP EPS growth rate was 13.4% and the pure cash EPS growth rate was 14.5%. Our gross margin and EBITDA per adjusted script both grew with this onetime benefit is excluded. Total first quarter 2011 net revenues reached a record $17 billion, representing growth of 4.3% over first quarter 2010. Our product revenue grew 3.6%, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand name, pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics. 
Service revenue continues to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 57.5% over first quarter 2010. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base and our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned a record $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.4% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medication and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to new client wins and continuous improvements with formulary contracting. Our first quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 11.6% compared to 12.1% in the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective service. In first quarters 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume was $27.7 million. Within this, generic prescription volumes increased 9.3% to a record 17.7 million, while brand-name prescription volume decreased 9.1% to 10 million prescriptions. Our generic dispensing rate has now increased a very substantial 450 basis points since first quarter 2010 to a new record of 63.8%. Based upon our current forecast, we are raising our 2011 mail-order volume guidance range to 108 million to 110 million, up from the previous 107 million to 109 million scripts. 
Our strong generic mail-order prescription volumes and our fee service gross margin, meaningfully drove our first quarter consolidated gross margin, which increased 7.8% over first quarter 2010 to $1.07 billion. Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.3% for the quarter increased 20 basis points from the 6.1% in the first quarter 2010, including the strong first quarter 2011 generic mail-order prescription volume and growth in service margin. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $387.1 million for the first quarter increased over first quarter of 2010 by $36.5 million or 10.4%, including increased expenses associated with the addition of UBC, as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Our total EBITDA for first quarter of 2011 reached $734.2 million, representing growth of 6.9%. EBITDA for adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 4.9% to $3.01. Our intangible amortization of $73.2 million in the first quarter 2011 increased 3.8% from $70.5 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. The final purchase accounting valuation for the UBC acquisition resulted in a lower identified intangible asset value that we included in our previous GAAP EPS guidance. And therefore, overall intangible amortization expense for full year 2011 will be lower than originally guided by approximately $20 million.
Total amortization of intangibles for 2011 is now expected to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million compared to the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million. The $20 million reduction in the range equates to the $0.03 improvement in our revised full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance.
Total net interest and other expense of $54.2 million for the first quarter of 2011 increased $14.9 million from the $39.3 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. 
First quarter of 2011 effective tax rate was 40.1% compared to 39.8% in the first quarter 2010. We still expect the full year of 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. Net income for the quarter increased 3.9% to $333.1 million from the $320.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2010.
Moving on to share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased 13.5 million shares for $836.6 million at an average per share cost of $60.20, through our pre-authorized trading plan. Of these repurchases, a total 6.4 million shares, cost of $400 million, have been repurchased under the new $3 billion plan authorized by Medco's Board of Directors on February 2. We expect to begin repurchasing shares again next week and anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion in shares during 2011, consistent with the detailed guidance we provided last November. 
As a result of our share repurchases and normal climate component, we closed the first quarter with a cash balance of $127 million. We expect our quarterly cash balances to increase over the course of this year. Our total debt for the first quarter remained consistent with fourth quarter 2010 of $5.0 billion.
Turning to our Specialty segment, as Dave already mentioned, Accredo achieved revenues of $3.1 billion and record operating income of $120.6 million for first quarter 2011. Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter was 6.6% compared to 7.1% first quarter 2010, reflecting the product, channel and new client mix effects to be experienced as 2010 progressed, which includes meaningful growth across the vast majority of Accredo's products. Sequentially, Accredo's gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points from the 6.5% reported in the fourth quarter 2010.
Moving on to Medicare. We continue to experience growth in our highly rated Medicare PDP. First quarter 2011, Medco's PDP revenues increased over 16% to nearly $440 million. As Dave explained, we are raising the midpoint of our 2011 EPS guidance for both GAAP and pure cash EPS measures, narrowing the range for the high-end to a $0.10 range from the previous $0.13 range, and additionally, increasing our full year GAAP diluted EPS by $0.03. The raising of the midpoint reflects strengthened fundamental operating earnings expectations for the year, while the $0.03 raise to full year GAAP diluted EPS is the function of the lower intangible amortization expense I mentioned earlier. 
Table 9 of our earnings release lays out the math very clearly. To briefly repeat our improved 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is now expected to grow 14% to 17% over 2010 in the range of $3.59 to $3.69. Pure cash EPS is now expected in the guidance range of $4.02 to $4.12, representing growth of 13% to 16% over the 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
Now I would like to take you through the detailed component of our 2011 guidance beginning with renewals. We continue to expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including schedule and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we now have over 90% of our 2011 renewals completed, up from the over 80% we recorded last quarter. As previously disclosed, approximately 75% of the 2011 renewal pricing already took effect in the first quarter of 2011, with the remainder expected primarily in the third quarter. At this point, we continue to expect 2012 renewals to be in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our book. 
As you can see from our slides on the web, the majority of our detailed 2011 guidance component remains consistent with those we provided on our fourth quarter call. 2011, we continue to expect a $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics, $0.01 expected in the second quarter, $0.02 expected in the third quarter and $0.06 expected in the fourth quarter, $0.03 of which relates to Lipitor for the five-week month of December.  We continue to expect stability or year-over-year expansion in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA for adjusted script performance in 2011. 
Now I would like to walk you through some of the changes to our 2011 guidance components. As I briefly mentioned earlier, our mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, up from the previous range of $107 million to $109 million. SG&A expenses for 2011 are now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an improvement from the previously narrowed range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion. 
Now to give you some insights into the quarterly flow of earnings for 2011, we now expect EPS to improve progressively quarter-to-quarter, with the largest sequential improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is now expected to increase slightly over the first quarter 2011 EPS amount of $0.91. The percentage split in EPS between the first half and the second half of 2011 is now expected to be consistent with that experienced in 2010. 
In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter of operating results and EPS, representing a solid start to 2011. We remain confident in our prospects for the quarters ahead and for our continued growth well into the future. Now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions. Andrea?"

That's where all the new brand innovation is occurring, and we're working with them on some, I think, exciting solutions for the future. And that's where a lot of the conversation goes when you talk about renewals and retention. When you look at FEPO, I will just tell you that we actually went back and look at what this timing was for announcement last time they went out the full RFP. And they're on schedule actually. When we looked at it last time, which is I think 5 years ago now, they didn't actually announced till late in the second quarter. And we didn't have invest -- we weren't able to tell investors where we - where that went until our second quarter call. So they may or may not be ahead of that schedule, but relative to previous years, they're on schedule, and we still feel as though we have a very competitive offering there.

And then again I'll ask the Group Presidents to add anything that I don't cover. But for me, continuing to extend the consumer-driven capabilities down to the individual consumers -- so, for example, expressing gaps in care and evidence-based protocols through our website in the layperson language, so the consumer can understand how to manage their care better and where their gap exists and how they're following their treatment protocol has been hugely powerful. And in fact, the gap in care closures we're getting on the self-help basis has been dramatic and growing, and I'm excited about that, both because it improves outcomes at lower cost, but also it's the least expensive way to close gaps in care because I don't need to do the labor-intensive pharmacist coaching each and every time. I'm also thrilled that we just recently launched the Medco's smart phone app with Verizon, available both in Android and BlackBerry version. These are really exciting apps and that again get us to the next levels of influencing consumers in powerful ways that are clinically oriented, but also give them enormous financial information at the point of care with their doctor. And I think that that's something that is going to continue to propel better outcomes at lower costs through real clinical care and in complete communication among the parties involved for that care. And I like that. The other thing that isn't getting a lot of air time, and we've talked to all of you 2 times at 2 Analyst Day's, and I don't think people fully appreciate the power of it yet, but I guarantee you they will, if our investments and our efforts around what we call Medco 2.0 and the agile enterprise. The benefit that will bring to the competitive marketplace in go-forward years is incredible to me. It will unleash our ability to innovate in a quantum way. And I think we're going to take another attempt next Analyst Day to further explain how powerful this is, but that to me is what is really going to make a difference in how we take care of patients in a way and how we service our customers in a way no one else can. And I'm going to leave it there. I'll ask you guys, Tim and Glen, if you have anything to add."

And everyone of them is going to heavily promote the app to their members, particularly once we get an iPhone application as well, which will be before the end of the second quarter. Huge in terms of the response to them, what that's going to enable in terms of the way we engage with our patients. But beyond that, I think the other big thing, Dave, are 2 things. One is our extended enterprise. We are continually being the leader at vendor summits that clients have to sit down with multiple points of care inside of their constellation, and being able to enable a greater level of connectivity than they can get by virtue of the way it goes in an unmanaged setting. So that's very powerful. And the fact that we can enabled that and bring to the table our open architecture, our patient health action plan and we can work that bidirectionally with these other caregivers is compelling. The third piece I would say is our EGWP strategy has been hugely successful. We have modeled over 50 clients in terms of looking at the value that list. We are installing a whole lot of them for '12 or '13. And we think that we brought a level of value there that is unparalleled in terms of both the number care that these clients want to continue to care for the members and at the same time bring in significant financial change to what it looks like in terms of providing that."

These are trickier to do than the prior ones, they're not cheap [indiscernible] or blood tests. So it's a real positive for us to be able to figure out how to get that done. Also, we've launched our new service which is kind of like a 1-800 number to call certified genetic counselor to get advice when you're newly diagnosed with any sort of problem like cancer. And that's actually gotten a little traction even when we just started subscribing that new service. We've added a number of hospitals to our genomic medical institute network, including one in Canada, which is pretty exciting, where we are arming hospitals around the country with genomic information to make them certified genomic centers. And then in another area in genomic which is new for us is to take the intelligence around  [ph] that DNA Direct has and offer those as the policy service health plan, who don't have their own technology equipment. And we've actually had a number of sales in that area since the beginning which has been a real uplift for us. So all areas are inspiring. They're all new. On the research front, we have a dozen large multi  [indiscernible] patient ongoing studies, several of which we'll complete this year. But you'll be hearing in the back half of the year some of the results that are very large prospective studies that has taken us into new areas including neuropsychiatry, where we have not been before. So it's pretty exciting. Actually, the neuroscientific community has been really excited about the work we're doing since no one else is really doing it.On the UBC front, the synergy has just been simply awesome. Since we announced the acquisition at the end of September, we also launched the Medco Research Consortium, which is any client interested in participating in the research, including UBC. We now have well over 100 clients representing 40 million of our lives in the consortium. And we now actually have clients participating in  [indiscernible] studies or safety studies or both. And the early feedback has been really exciting. People love it. The members love it. They like the having the added protection of the safety in the particular type study.

One of the things that we're very excited about when you think in terms of extended enterprise and the broad portfolio of clinical capability is -- the real game changer is to help get the healthcare system wired in the country. And 1 of the most powerful features of that is being able to help support the point of care where the patient and the physician interaction is at its most important. To be able to provide this 360 degree insights to that point of care. We believe it improves the ability of the physician to make decisions and prescribing course of treatment and also allows us to place a set of evidence-based protocol that allows us to put a benchmark to the type of activities that are happening.

I think a couple of things. First of all, clients are at a point where they understand that mail is an incredible cost-effective channel, and that mail is outstanding at driving generic expensing rates. So we've had great benefit design support on the part of our clients to drive this outcome. And I would also tell you the economy continues to aid the choice of generics because clearly when people are financially strapped, they say, ""Hey, I'd rather have less out of pocket expense,"" and they're moving from brands to generic. And the interchange that's going on between brand and generic voluntarily on the part of consumers is simply that I need to save some money has been incredibly strong. The final thing I've mentioned is that we have a team that always is working with clients to drive better generic expensing results across the channel, both mail and retail, and we've come up with a few new innovations that I don't choose to describe in great detail, but they've been very effective in improving mail choice and generic choices at mail. So we're actually feeling as though this is a momentum thing that we can sustain for a while."

Today we're reporting strong first quarter 2011 earnings reflecting continuous success across our strategic growth drivers. Additionally, we are raising the midpoint of our full yea",813,"Thank you, Valerie, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Today we're reporting strong first quarter 2011 earnings reflecting continuous success across our strategic growth drivers. Additionally, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2011 EPS guidance range of -- for the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share reached $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010. Diluted earnings split per share, excluding all intangible amortization, our new pure cash EPS measure, reached $0.91, a 19.7% increase over first quarter 2010 equivalent. 
Even with ever growing volumes at the lower-priced generic drugs in our revenue mix, first quarter 2011 net revenues increased to a record of more than $17 billion representing 4.3% growth over the same period last year. Within our net revenues, service revenues grew 57.5% to a record $357.8 million fueled by our United BioSource acquisition and service revenue growth across the company. With the respect to the operating metrics that contributed to our strong financial results. 
Total prescription volumes for first quarter 2011 adjusted to the difference in dates applied between retail and mail grew 2.1% to 244.3 million prescription. Importantly, mail-order prescriptions totaled 27.7 million, with generic mail-order volumes increasing a substantial 9.3% to a record 17.7 million prescription, even in a quarter where there were no contributions from new generics. Our first quarter 2011 overall generic dispensing rate rose 3.4 percentage point to a record 73.1%. And within that, our mail-order generic dispensing rate component increased 4.5 percentage points to a record 53.8%.
The year-over-year improvement in our overall generic dispensing rate drove record incremental savings to our clients and members of $1.1 billion for the quarter, as a growing number of members took advantage of this high-quality, more affordable alternative.
Moving on to our Specialty business, Accredo's performance remains strong, with record first quarter 2011 revenues of $3.1 billion, up 14.9%. Accredo's operating income rose 13.2% to a record $120.6 million. 
As an aside, Keith Fitzpatrick, who has served as President of Accredo since 2008, recently announced his retirement effective July 1. We all thank Steve for his years of excellent service and wish him a very happy retirement. We have named Frank Sheehy, a 13-year Medco veteran, to succeed Steve on July 1 as Accredo's President. Frank also joins Medco's Executive Committee. Frank has an outstanding track record of business success and has earned some of the highest client and employee satisfaction ratings ever recorded in our company. Frank's deep understanding of our customers and their needs in the specialty drug space make him well suited to lead the Accredo  business as we continue to expand Accredo's capabilities through new innovations. 
On the 2012 sales front, while it is still too early in the 2012 selling season for the majority of our prospects who have finalized their decisions, we are very pleased with several significant early season wins. We remain confident in our well differentiated services and our strategic positioning in the marketplace. A good example of our differentiated service offerings is our Medicare business. For the quarter, our Medicare PDP grew 16% over first quarter 2010, driven by the national 5-star rating of excellence that was awarded to Medco. This 5-star rating was the first and only one to be awarded to any national PDP by CMS. 
For 2011 year-to-date, our annualized new-named sales remain at approximately $1.7 billion, and our net-new sales remain approximately $1.5 billion. We have now completed over 90% of our 2011 scheduled and early elective client renewals, up from the over 80% we reported on our fourth quarter call, and our 2011 year-to-date client retention rate remains at over 99%.
Turning to guidance. It is with confidence that we raise the midpoint of both our GAAP diluted EPS and our diluted EPS excluding all intangible amortization, reflecting the strength we are seeing, thus far, in our 2011 results. In addition, we are raising our GAAP diluted EPS range by $0.03 due to a lower-than-expected intangible amortization expense associated with our UBC asset, which Rich will discuss further. Our full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance increased to a range of $3.59 to $3.69, up from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.56, now reflecting a growth rate of 14% to 17% over 2010. Diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization is now expected to be in the range of $4.02
 to $4.12, up from $3.99 to $4.12, now reflecting 13% to 16% growth over 2010 earnings per share. 
In summary, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, and are enthusiastic about our prospects for continued strong growth. Our ability to narrow guidance this early in the year serves to further fuel that enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Rubino, who will take you through the details of our first quarter 2011 financial and 2011 guidance. Rich?"
1541811,129808770,119527,"MedcoHealth Solutions Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Medco Health Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19",1595,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. As Dave mentioned come first quarter EPS results were strong with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 representing 19.4% growth over first quarter 2010 and diluted EPS excluding all of intangible amortization of $0.91, representing 19.7% growth over the first quarter equivalent of $0.76. 
As we previously guided, first quarter 2011 EPS results include a planned $0.04 benefit associated with changes to the employee post-retirement health care benefit plan. Approximately 3/4 of which flowed to cost of sales and 1/4 to SG&A expense. 
Even when excluding net benefit, the GAAP EPS growth rate was 13.4% and the pure cash EPS growth rate was 14.5%. Our gross margin and EBITDA per adjusted script both grew with this onetime benefit is excluded. Total first quarter 2011 net revenues reached a record $17 billion, representing growth of 4.3% over first quarter 2010. Our product revenue grew 3.6%, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand name, pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher representation of lower-priced generics. 
Service revenue continues to be a very meaningful growth driver, increasing 57.5% over first quarter 2010. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, which closed on September 16, 2010, as well as the expansion of our overall client base and our Medicare Part D service fees.
Turning to rebates, we earned a record $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.4% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medication and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to new client wins and continuous improvements with formulary contracting. Our first quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 11.6% compared to 12.1% in the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective service. In first quarters 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume was 27.7 million. Within this, generic prescription volumes increased 9.3% to a record 17.7 million, while brand-name prescription volume decreased 9.1% to 10 million prescriptions. Our generic dispensing rate has now increased a very substantial 450 basis points since first quarter 2010 to a new record of 63.8%. Based upon our current forecast, we are raising our 2011 mail-order volume guidance range to 108 million to 110 million, up from the previous 107 million to 109 million scripts. 
Our strong generic mail-order prescription volumes and our fee service gross margin, meaningfully drove our first quarter consolidated gross margin, which increased 7.8% over first quarter 2010 to $1.07 billion. Our consolidated gross margin percentage of 6.3% for the quarter increased 20 basis points from the 6.1% in the first quarter 2010, including the strong first quarter 2011 generic mail-order prescription volume and growth in service margin. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $387.1 million for the first quarter increased over first quarter of 2010 by $36.5 million or 10.4%, including increased expenses associated with the addition of UBC, as well as higher professional fees and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives. Our total EBITDA for first quarter of 2011 reached $734.2 million, representing growth of 6.9%. EBITDA for adjusted prescription for the quarter increased 4.9% to $3.01. 
Our intangible amortization of $73.2 million in the first quarter 2011 increased 3.8% from $70.5 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. The final purchase accounting valuation for the UBC acquisition resulted in a lower identified intangible asset value that we included in our previous GAAP EPS guidance. And therefore, overall intangible amortization expense for full year 2011 will be lower than originally guided by approximately $20 million.
Total amortization of intangibles for 2011 is now expected to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million compared to the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million. The $20 million reduction in the range equates to the $0.03 improvement in our revised full year 2011 GAAP diluted EPS guidance.
Total net interest and other expense of $54.2 million for the first quarter of 2011 increased $14.9 million from the $39.3 million in first quarter 2010, primarily reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. 
First quarter of 2011 effective tax rate was 40.1% compared to 39.8% in the first quarter 2010. We still expect the full year of 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. Net income for the quarter increased 3.9% to $333.1 million from the $320.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2010.
Moving on to share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased 13.5 million shares for $836.6 million at an average per share cost of $60.20, through our pre-authorized trading plan. Of these repurchases, a total 6.4 million shares, cost of $400 million, have been repurchased under the new $3 billion plan authorized by Medco's Board of Directors on February 2. We expect to begin repurchasing shares again next week and anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion in shares during 2011, consistent with the detailed guidance we provided last November. 
As a result of our share repurchases and normal climate component, we closed the first quarter with a cash balance of $127 million. We expect our quarterly cash balances to increase over the course of this year. Our total debt for the first quarter remained consistent with fourth quarter 2010 of $5.0 billion.
Turning to our Specialty segment, as Dave already mentioned, Accredo achieved revenues of $3.1 billion and record operating income of $120.6 million for first quarter 2011. Accredo's gross margin percentage for the quarter was 6.6% compared to 7.1% first quarter 2010, reflecting the product, channel and new client mix effects to be experienced as 2010 progressed, which includes meaningful growth across the vast majority of Accredo's products. Sequentially, Accredo's gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points from the 6.5% reported in the fourth quarter 2010.
Moving on to Medicare. We continue to experience growth in our highly rated Medicare PDP. First quarter 2011, Medco's PDP revenues increased over 16% to nearly $440 million. As Dave explained, we are raising the midpoint of our 2011 EPS guidance for both GAAP and pure cash EPS measures, narrowing the range for the high-end to a $0.10 range from the previous $0.13 range, and additionally, increasing our full year GAAP diluted EPS by $0.03. The raising of the midpoint reflects strengthened fundamental operating earnings expectations for the year, while the $0.03 raise to full year GAAP diluted EPS is the function of the lower intangible amortization expense I mentioned earlier. 
Table 9 of our earnings release lays out the math very clearly. To briefly repeat our improved 2011 guidance, diluted GAAP EPS is now expected to grow 14% to 17% over 2010 in the range of $3.59 to $3.69. Pure cash EPS is now expected in the guidance range of $4.02 to $4.12, representing growth of 13% to 16% over the 2010 full year equivalent of $3.55.
Now I would like to take you through the detailed component of our 2011 guidance beginning with renewals. We continue to expect to renew approximately $15 billion of business in 2011, including schedule and early elective renewals, representing less than 1/4 of our business. As Dave mentioned, we now have over 90% of our 2011 renewals completed, up from the over 80% we recorded last quarter. As previously disclosed, approximately 75% of the 2011 renewal pricing already took effect in the first quarter of 2011, with the remainder expected primarily in the third quarter. At this point, we continue to expect 2012 renewals to be in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, approximately 25% of our book. 
As you can see from our slides on the web, the majority of our detailed 2011 guidance component remains consistent with those we provided on our fourth quarter call. 2011, we continue to expect a $0.09 incremental contribution from new generics, $0.01 expected in the second quarter, $0.02 expected in the third quarter and $0.06 expected in the fourth quarter, $0.03 of which relates to Lipitor for the five-week month of December.  We continue to expect stability or year-over-year expansion in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA for adjusted script performance in 2011. 
Now I would like to walk you through some of the changes to our 2011 guidance components. As I briefly mentioned earlier, our mail-order prescription volumes for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, up from the previous range of $107 million to $109 million. SG&A expenses for 2011 are now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an improvement from the previously narrowed range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion. 
Now to give you some insights into the quarterly flow of earnings for 2011, we now expect EPS to improve progressively quarter-to-quarter, with the largest sequential improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 pure cash EPS is now expected to increase slightly over the first quarter 2011 EPS amount of $0.91. The percentage split in EPS between the first half and the second half of 2011 is now expected to be consistent with that experienced in 2010. 
In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter of operating results and EPS, representing a solid start to 2011. We remain confident in our prospects for the quarters ahead and for our continued growth well into the future. Now Dave and I would like to open the lines for questions. Andrea?"

And they're looking for new innovation and solutions there because it's -- the small molecule goes from brand -- generic, they're getting great relief. But they see where specialty is heading. That's where all the new brand innovation is occurring, and we're working with them on some, I think, exciting solutions for the future. And that's where a lot of the conversation goes when you talk about renewals and retention. When you look at FEPO, I will just tell you that we actually went back and look at what this timing was for announcement last time they went out the full RFP. And they're on schedule actually. When we looked at it last time, which is I think 5 years ago now, they didn't actually announced till late in the second quarter. And we didn't have invest -- we weren't able to tell investors where we - where that went until our second quarter call.

And then again I'll ask the Group Presidents to add anything that I don't cover. But for me, continuing to extend the consumer-driven capabilities down to the individual consumers -- so, for example, expressing gaps in care and evidence-based protocols through our website in the layperson language, so the consumer can understand how to manage their care better and where their gap exists and how they're following their treatment protocol has been hugely powerful. And in fact, the gap in care closures we're getting on the self-help basis has been dramatic and growing, and I'm excited about that, both because it improves outcomes at lower cost, but also it's the least expensive way to close gaps in care because I don't need to do the labor-intensive pharmacist coaching each and every time. I'm also thrilled that we just recently launched the Medco's smart phone app with Verizon, available both in Android and BlackBerry version. These are really exciting apps and that again get us to the next levels of influencing consumers in powerful ways that are clinically oriented, but also give them enormous financial information at the point of care with their doctor. And I think that that's something that is going to continue to propel better outcomes at lower costs through real clinical care and in complete communication among the parties involved for that care. And I like that. The other thing that isn't getting a lot of air time, and we've talked to all of you 2 times at 2 Analyst Day's, and I don't think people fully appreciate the power of it yet, but I guarantee you they will, if our investments and our efforts around what we call Medco 2.0 and the agile enterprise. The benefit that will bring to the competitive marketplace in go-forward years is incredible to me. It will unleash our ability to innovate in a quantum way. And I think we're going to take another attempt next Analyst Day to further explain how powerful this is, but that to me is what is really going to make a difference in how we take care of patients in a way and how we service our customers in a way no one else can. And I'm going to leave it there. I'll ask you guys, Tim and Glen, if you have anything to add."

And everyone of them is going to heavily promote the app to their members, particularly once we get an iPhone application as well, which will be before the end of the second quarter. Huge in terms of the response to them, what that's going to enable in terms of the way we engage with our patients. But beyond that, I think the other big thing, Dave, are 2 things. One is our extended enterprise. We are continually being the leader at vendor summits that clients have to sit down with multiple points of care inside of their constellation, and being able to enable a greater level of connectivity than they can get by virtue of the way it goes in an unmanaged setting. So that's very powerful. And the fact that we can enabled that and bring to the table our open architecture, our patient health action plan and we can work that bidirectionally with these other caregivers is compelling. The third piece I would say is our EGWP strategy has been hugely successful. We have modeled over 50 clients in terms of looking at the value that list. We are installing a whole lot of them for '12 or '13. And we think that we brought a level of value there that is unparalleled in terms of both the number care that these clients want to continue to care for the members and at the same time bring in significant financial change to what it looks like in terms of providing that."

We now have over 300 clients enrolled in multiple pharmacogenomics programs, representing about 12 million of our lives. So it's really exciting, and they're really excited to take on new pharmacogenomics tests which are new. These are trickier to do than the prior ones, they're not cheap [indiscernible] or blood tests. So it's a real positive for us to be able to figure out how to get that done. Also, we've launched our new service which is kind of like a 1-800 number to call certified genetic counselor to get advice when you're newly diagnosed with any sort of problem like cancer. And that's actually gotten a little traction even when we just started subscribing that new service. We've added a number of hospitals to our genomic medical institute network, including one in Canada, which is pretty exciting, where we are arming hospitals around the country with genomic information to make them certified genomic centers. And then in another area in genomic which is new for us is to take the intelligence around [ph] that DNA Direct has and offer those as the policy service health plan, who don't have their own technology equipment. And we've actually had a number of sales in that area since the beginning which has been a real uplift for us. So all areas are inspiring. They're all new. On the research front, we have a dozen large multi  [indiscernible] patient ongoing studies, several of which we'll complete this year. But you'll be hearing in the back half of the year some of the results that are very large prospective studies that has taken us into new areas including neuropsychiatry, where we have not been before. So it's pretty exciting. Actually, the neuroscientific community has been really excited about the work we're doing since no one else is really doing it. On the UBC front, the synergy has just been simply awesome. Since we announced the acquisition at the end of September, we also launched the Medco Research Consortium, which is any client interested in participating in the research, including UBC. We now have well over 100 clients representing 40 million of our lives in the consortium. And we now actually have clients participating in [indiscernible] studies or safety studies or both. And the early feedback has been really exciting. People love it. The members love it. They like the having the added protection of the safety in the particular type study. And so everything has been a real exciting first quarter for us, and we're just really looking forward to ongoing advances this year."

One of the things that we're very excited about when you think in terms of extended enterprise and the broad portfolio of clinical capability is -- the real game changer is to help get the healthcare system wired in the country. And 1 of the most powerful features of that is being able to help support the point of care where the patient and the physician interaction is at its most important. To be able to provide this 360 degree insights to that point of care. We believe it improves the ability of the physician to make decisions and prescribing course of treatment and also allows us to place a set of evidence-based protocol that allows us to put a benchmark to the type of activities that are happening. So I think you will see over the not too distant future an expanding portfolio of cloud computing-based solutions at point of care, and it's also the mechanism we're going to be using to enable both the medical home and Campbell Care Organization  [ph as well. So the wiring aspect, we think, has a lot of potential."

First of all, clients are at a point where they understand that mail is an incredible cost-effective channel, and that mail is outstanding at driving generic expensing rates. So we've had great benefit design support on the part of our clients to drive this outcome. And I would also tell you the economy continues to aid the choice of generics because clearly when people are financially strapped, they say, ""Hey, I'd rather have less out of pocket expense,"" and they're moving from brands to generic. And the interchange that's going on between brand and generic voluntarily on the part of consumers is simply that I need to save some money has been incredibly strong. The final thing I've mentioned is that we have a team that always is working with clients to drive better generic expensing results across the channel, both mail and retail, and we've come up with a few new innovations that I don't choose to describe in great detail, but they've been very effective in improving mail choice and generic choices at mail.

This unique foundation of alignment has enabled us to grow, become stronger and enhance our ability to provide dynamic services designed to drive out ways that improved healthcare outcomes. We have never been better positioned to take advantage of a long-term growth opportunities inherent in the PBMs in the marketplace. Our behavior-centric approach continues to gain traction in the marketplace and the lead our sector in earnings growth in return on invested capital. We have complemented our strong organic growth over the years through successful strategic mergers and acquisitions which created opportunities to new business segments, offer new services and increase the scope of our business. We have always been opportunistic in looking for ways to enhance value, and today's announcement of our combination with Medco is a perfect example.
This is a transaction the nation needs now. Massive changes around the horizon for our industry, including healthcare reform and the upcoming wave of brand-name drugs losing patent protection. Meanwhile, healthcare costs continued to rise. In this environment, we have to be nimble and we have to be supported off to influence events and forward thinking enough to interpret events before they occur. Combined, we can build on our legacy of advancing healthcare, do innovation and an unwavering commitment to our clients.
Both Express Scripts and Medco have different strengths in clinical, Specialty Pharmacy Services, research, the behavioral sciences, pharmacy technology and overall patient care. The combination of these complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings which will reduce costs and improve health outcomes. Our breadth of services across traditional PBM management, specialty management and Medicare Part D will be unparalleled in history. The combined company will also be well-positioned to help clients and members navigate the landscape in the wake of healthcare reform.

Let me start off by saying that we have observed Medco over the years and I've worked closely with them on this transaction. It's clear they share a passion for driving out ways in healthcare and providing world-class patient care. This merger is consistent with our philosophy on capital deployment. First, to fund internal investments, and second, to look for strategic mergers and acquisitions. We have funded our internal needs and so I'm pleased to take you through some of the details of our combination, which is expected to generate strong returns on the capital invested. The name of the combined companies will be Express Scripts Holding, Inc., it will be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. George Pause will be the Chairman and CEO, and the board will consist of Express Scripts existing board, plus members from Medco's board.
We will exchange $28.80 in cash and 0.81 shares of Express Scripts stock for each share of Medco stock. This results in a purchase price of approximately $29 billion or $71.36 per share, which represents a 28% premium over yesterday's closing price. We have committed financing in place for the cash component and anticipate raising permanent capital in the form of bank debt and bonds. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and we have structured this transaction to do so. At the close of this transaction, Express Scripts shareholders will own approximately 59% of the combined company, and Medco shareholders will own about 41%. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2012, subject to regulatory approval.
The merger is expected to be slightly accretive in the first full year after closing, and moderately accreting, accretive after the integration is completed. Based on our due diligence today, we have identified $1 billion of synergy. In addition, we expect to deliver more than $4 billion of annual cash from operations once fully integrated. For modeling purposes, we have excluded the UnitedHealthcare contract beyond the end of 2012. We have a strong track record of the completing acquisitions, integrating them seamlessly and meeting or exceeding our synergy expectations.
In addition to this track record, we have also demonstrated our ability to reduce leverage rapidly, and our expectations for this transaction are no different. At the time of closing, we expect to be at the debt level of 2.9x EBITDA. We expect to return back to our targeted range of 1x to 2x with an 18 months of closing. And now I'll turn the call back to George for some final remarks."

This is the seventh major transaction we have made since I joined the company in 1998, and the third one that is doubling the size of our company. We believe that this transaction is procompetition, will reduce healthcare costs and very much in the public interest. Everyone agrees that our country needs to get a handle on and control its healthcare costs, and our priority on behalf of our clients and patients is to help drive the way set of the healthcare industry. Reducing costs and improving health outcomes is our primary goal. This goal is reflected on our business model of aligning those at our clients and our patients. That is, we make money when they saved money. This transaction allows us to accelerate cost savings and improve health outcomes. Given the level of competition at the PBM business, the sophistication of our customers and their desire to keep their healthcare costs down, and the real benefits arising out of this very exciting transaction, we believe we will work our way successfully through the regulatory approval process. Being disciplined on our approach to acquisition is a key to our success. Our industry-leading ROIC is proof of our ability to acquire and integrate major acquisition. The combination with Medco is a continuum of our disciplined approach.
Our roadmap to completion involves completing all required SEC filings, holding special meetings for both sets of stockholders and working through the regulatory approval process.

Since our inception 25 years ago, we've had an unwavering focus on making the user prescription drugs safe and more affordable. Over the years, we identified and tackled inefficiencies in the healthcare and succeeded through innovation, execution and a commitment to our business model of alignment. This unique foundation of alignment has enabled us to grow, become stronger and enhance our ability to provide dynamic services designed to drive out ways that improve health outcomes.
We have never been better positioned to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunities inherent in the PBMs with marketplace. Our behavior-centric approach continues to gain traction in the marketplace and we lead our sector in earnings growth and return on invested capital.
We have complemented our strong organic growth over the years through successful strategic mergers and acquisitions, which create opportunities to our new business segments, offer new services and increase the scope of our business. We have always been opportunistic in looking for ways to enhance value, and today's announcement of our combination with Medco is a perfect example.
This is a transaction the nation needs now. Massive changes around the horizon for our industry, including healthcare reform and the upcoming wave of brand-name drugs losing patent protection. Meanwhile, healthcare costs continue to rise. In this environment, we have to be nimble and we have to be smart enough to influence events and forward thinking enough to interpret events before they occur. Combined, we can build on our legacy of advancing healthcare, do innovation and an unwavering commitment to our clients.
Both Express Scripts and Medco have different strengths in clinical, specialty pharmacy services, research, the behavioral sciences, pharmacy technology and overall patient care. The combination of these complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce costs and improve health outcomes. Our breadth of services across traditional PBM management, specialty management and Medicare Part D will be unparalleled in history. The combined company will also be well-positioned to help clients and members navigate the landscape in the wake of healthcare reform.
At this point, I'll invite Dave to talk about the transaction from Medco's perspective."

Since we took Medco public in 2003, we doubled the size of our business and delivered average annual earnings per share growth of 22%. We've done that by driving clinical innovation focused on addressing the 50% of patients with chronic and complex disease, who account for 96% of all drug spending and more than 75% of healthcare costs.
We launched Therapeutic Resource Centers, built a world-class Accredo Specialty Pharmacy business, generated breakthrough science in research in the area of personalized medicine, and created a Medicare business that receives CMS' first and only national 5-star rating. We are a trailblazer in pharmacogenomics and have extended our footprint internationally. Clinical excellence in service innovations were the catalyst for our growth, and over the last 8 years, we've quintupled our market cap.
With that history, why this combination? Over the past year, we at Medco have been very, very focused on the changing healthcare environment in this country, which is demanding better, faster and less expensive capabilities for all who participate in the healthcare system. This strategic combination delivers on these important value propositions to the benefit of our clients, patients and shareholders.

Our successful track record of strategic combinations is based in a philosophy of taking a best-in-class of both organizations and combining them for the benefit of our clients, patients and stockholders. We will unite the expertise of 2 complementary PBMs to make the delivery of prescription drugs safer and less expensive for millions of Americans. By boning the combined clinical skills with the behavioral sciences, we'll be able to accelerate efforts from our greater efficiencies in the healthcare system and better protect American families from the rising costs of prescription medications.
Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence, lower costs and drive to better health outcomes. This combination will truly build on our legacy of innovation, alignment with our clients and patients, and our commitment to making drugs safer, more affordable. And because we are aligned, as we deliver increased value to our clients and patients, our shareholder performance improves. This transaction continues our commitment to strong growth, both organically and through strategic combinations. The merger with Medco will provide the opportunity to accelerate our ability to achieve cost savings for our patients and clients while improving health outcomes.

Let me start off by saying that we have observed Medco over the years and have worked closely with them on this transaction. It's clear they share our passion for driving out ways in healthcare and providing world-class patient care. This merger is consistent with our philosophy on capital deployment. First, to fund internal investments, and second, to look for strategic mergers and acquisitions.
We have funded our internal needs, and so I'm pleased to take you through some of the details of our combination, which is expected to generate strong returns on the capital invested. The name of the combined companies will be Express Scripts Holding, Inc. It will be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. George Paz will be the Chairman and CEO, and the board will consist of Express Scripts existing board, plus 2 members from Medco's board.
We will exchange $28.80 in cash and 0.81 shares of Express Scripts stock for each share of Medco stock. This results in a purchase price of approximately $29 billion or $71.36 per share, which represents a 28% premium over yesterday's closing price. We have committed financing in place for the cash component and anticipate raising permanent capital in the form of bank debt and bonds. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and we have structured this transaction to do so. At the close of this transaction, Express Scripts shareholders will own approximately 59% of the combined company, and Medco shareholders will own about 41%. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2012, subject to regulatory approval.
The merger is expected to be slightly accretive in the first full year after closing, and moderately accreting -- accretive after the integration is completed. Based on our due diligence today, we have identified $1 billion of synergy. In addition, we expect to deliver more than $4 billion of annual cash from operations once fully integrated.
For modeling purposes, we have excluded the UnitedHealthcare contract beyond the end of 2012. We have a strong track record of the completing acquisitions, integrating them seamlessly and meeting or exceeding our synergy expectations.
In addition to this track record, we have also demonstrated our ability to reduce leverage rapidly, and our expectations for this transaction are no different. At the time of closing, we expect to be at the debt level of 2.9x EBITDA. We expect to return back to our targeted range of 1 to 2x with an 18 months of closing.
And now I'll turn the call back to George for some final remarks."

This is the seventh major transaction we have made since I joined the company in 1998, and the third one that is doubling the size of our company. We believe that this transaction is pro-competition, will reduce healthcare costs and very much in the public interest.
Everyone agrees that our country needs to get a handle on and control its healthcare costs, and our priority on behalf of our clients and patients is to help drive the way set of the healthcare industry. Reducing costs and improving health outcomes is our primary goal. This goal is reflected on our business model of aligning our interests to those of our clients and our patients. That is, we make money when they save money. This transaction allows us to accelerate cost savings and improve health outcomes. Given the level of competition at the PBM business, the sophistication of our customers and their desire to keep their healthcare costs down and the real benefits arising out of this very exciting transaction, we believe we will work our way successfully through the regulatory approval process. Being disciplined on our approach to acquisition is a key to our success. Our industry-leading ROIC is proof of our ability to acquire and integrate major acquisition. The combination with Medco is a continuum of our disciplined approach.
Our roadmap to completion involves completing all required SEC filings, holding special meetings for both sets of stockholders and working through the regulatory approval process. We believe this transaction can be completed in the first half of 2012. I want to again, share my enthusiasm for this transaction, which validates our differentiated business model and provides a platform of continued strong growth in the future.

The FTC is part of the administration, which is part of government, which is also is very focused on healthcare costs. We're going to work very hard to show the government the value that this brings to patients and members as we drive those costs out of the system.

GAAP dil",1419,"Thank you, Valerie, and thanks, to all of you for joining us this morning. Today, we are reporting strong third quarter 2011 earnings and narrowing the range of our full year 2011 earnings per share guidance for the high end of previous guidance. GAAP diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2011 reached $0.90 or $0.96, excluding merger-related expenses incurred in the quarter, representing solid 12.9% growth over third quarter 2010. Even when including the merger-related expenses, our GAAP EPS is a record. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, reached a record $1.07, reflecting a 12.6% growth rate over third quarter 2010. Importantly, our gross margin percentage was consistent with third quarter 2010 at 6.9%, up meaningfully from the 6.5% in second quarter 2011. And our EBITDA per script, excluding the merger-related expenses, also reached a record level at $3.43. Our mail volumes continued to be strong at this stage of the year. We are now confident that we will meaningfully surpass the high-end of our previous mail volume guidance range of 108 to 110 million script. 
Our Accredo business also delivered strong results with revenue growth of 16.7% and operating income growth of 33%, all at a 6.8% gross margin, consistent with third quarter 2010. The company is performing well across the board and we now at our a 2007 diluted earnings per share guidance excluding merger-related expenses and all intangible amortization to a range of $4.08 to $4.12, which represents 15% to 16% growth over 2010. Our previous guidance of $4.02 to $4.12 reflect the growth of 13% to 16% over 2010. 
For the 2011 selling season, our annualized new name sales totaled $3.2 billion, up from the $3 billion we previously reported. We have completed 98% of our 2011 renewals amounting to $16 billion client drove spent. Our 2012 annualized new name sales currently stand at approximately $1.6 billion, double the $800 million reported last quarter as our clinically focused model continues to have strong appeal in the marketplace. 
Now, I would like to share some thoughts on the pending merger with Express Scripts. As you saw in the recently filed S4, after an extensive review of numerous strategic alternatives through an exhaustive planning process, we determined that combining with Express Scripts was the best strategy to maximize value for our clients, members and shareholders. The merger is the solution to control escalating healthcare costs in America, the costs that are undermining U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. In 2010 alone, U.S. spending for prescription drugs reached $307.4 billion. Our aging population and an increased prevalence of chronic diseases are projected to drive a 50% increase in prescription drug spending to well over $450 billion by 2019. At Medco, we have lowered the cost of prescription medications for our clients by enabling greater use of generics, driving savings of $3.7 billion to Medco's clients in full year 2010, and $2.7 billion year-to-date in 2011. We have expertly managed the challenges associated with the rising costs of care, including specialty medications, that we have improved efficiencies my enabling clients to make effective use of the highest value channels of distribution, including mail-order delivery for chronic medication. The combined organization is well positioned to advance the quality and cost set forth in America's healthcare reform legislation by combining 2 innovative approaches, Medco advanced clinical services that utilize the evidence-based protocols and Express Script Services which focus on behavioral science to increase medication adherence. As you can see from this year's performance and our projections included in the S4, we are planning to merge from a position of strength. Combining forces with Express Scripts positions us to deliver what our nation needs now, high-quality care at even lower cost to our patients and clients, and we can do this much more effectively together. Many of you have asked where we are in the regulatory review process and what will be the likely outcome. As I have said previously, and most recently at a hearing in Washington DC, we would not have announced this combination if we were not confident in our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. As we stated when the deal was announced, we anticipated the transaction will close in the first half of 2012 and we remain confident in that projection for a number of reasons. First, the opponents of this proposed mergers are not customers. Our proposed merger is receiving very positive reaction from our customers who understand that the combination of Medco and Express Scripts can mean to them and their members. This combination includes over $1 billion in savings as it's expected to be delivered to customers after closing. Second, the PBM marketplace is highly competitive and will remain highly competitive after the deal closes. There are at least 10 PBMs serving the largest employers in the Fortune 50 and over 15 serving the Fortune 500 alone. In addition, these and and many other PBMs also serve large government account and health plan. In fact, today, our competitors include over 40 PBMs with household names like Etna, CIGNA, CVS Caremark and others who may not be as well known, but continues to make major investments such as prime therapeutic, Cialis and XC. Additionally, in specialty drugs, hundreds of different firms compete including PBMs, pharmacy chains and independents, wholesalers, managed-care organizations, as well as standalone specialty pharmacy. Also and very importantly, United Health Group has announced its plans to bring in house 40 million live previously served by Medco and combine that business with a substantial Medicare and other national employer lives that are already directly service through its own PBM known as Optimal RX. With this, United Health Group will be one of the nation's largest PBMs. The merger with Express Scripts provides us with the opportunity to reduce our acquisition costs for medication and pass on additional savings for our clients and agents. The SEC is concerned as protecting consumer, not competitors. That means ensuring competition remains healthy in the marketplace and consumers are not harmed by price increases resulting from tier competitors. We firmly believe that this combination will benefit consumers. To conclude my remarks on this topic, the proposed merger, in our view, embodies the spirit of the new healthcare reform legislation that promotes innovation to solve America's healthcare burden. As I have said previously, we are confident that this merger will receive SEC approval in the first half of 2012. We are an important part of the solution and we remain dedicated to providing our clients with quality care at the lowest possible cost. Not only does this merger promises to serve our clients well, it will create substantial value for our shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich who will cover the 2012 guidance more thoroughly, I would like to highlight a few observations for next year. First, as you saw in the S4 and in our earnings release, revenue is expected to decrease to approximately $58.9 billion in 2012, equating to a $10 billion or 14.5% decline. This decline contains many moving parts, including clients that are transitioning from Medco due to acquisitions by competitors and other regions, also contributing to the decline in revenues is the generic wave in 2012, which is projected to have reduced our net revenues next year by approximately $6.5 billion. If you look at this from the other side of the ledger, this is value that accrues to clients and patients, a massive winds to consumer. The last point I will make on guidance is regarding our EBITDA, which at the high-end is expected to grow by as much as 9.5% in 2012 as a function of the generic wave and continuously improving business efficiencies. And looking at EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, what is known as EBITDA margin, we expect this measure to increase from approximately 4.5% in 2011 to as much as 5.8% at the high-end in 2012, which would represent a Medco record. We expect meaningful increases in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA per script for 2012 as well, resulting not only from the generic wave and business efficiencies I just mentioned, but also from the fact that the large retail clients that will be transitioning in 2012 carry extraordinarily low profit margins. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rich Rubino, who will discuss additional third quarter 2011 financial performance details and provide you with additional color regarding our 2012 guidance. Rich?"

As Dave mentioned, our third quarter EPS results were strong, with record GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90. The record gets even more impressive when you exclude the $0.06 in merger-related expenses, bringing that number to an equivalent of $0.96, a growth of 12.9% over third quarter last year. Diluted EPS, excluding all intangibles and merger-related expenses, of $1.07 for this quarter is also a record, representing a 12.6% increase. This $1.07 is a meaningful $0.08 higher than our previous EPS record of $0.99 set in the fourth quarter of 2010. The merger-related expenses, which primarily include bankruptcies, legal fees and employee retention related expenses, totaled $36.6 million or $0.06 per share. And that of course, was for the third quarter of 2011, with $35.6 million flowing to SG&A expense and the remaining $1 million flowing to cost of sales. We currently expect the fourth quarter 2011 amount to merger-related expenses to be slightly less than the third quarter at $0.05 per share, bringing full the year 2011 estimated merger-related expenses to $0.11 per share. 
Total third quarter 2011 net revenues reached $17.0 billion, representing growth 4.1% over third quarter 2010. Our product revenues grew at 3.4% over third quarter 2010 to $16.6 billion, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher mix of lower-priced generics. On that generics point, our clients and members saved approximately $700 million this quarter compared to third quarter 2010 from increased utilization of generic. For 2011, we expect these savings to total approximately $3.7 billion. If you look at how much Medco clients and members have saved from generic drug utilization since 2006 when the first blockbuster drug started losing their patent, it is a very substantial number, $16.7 billion, add to that the expected record 2012 year for generic savings that Dave already mentioned, contributing another expected $6.5 billion in savings and the cumulative savings since 2006 rose to over $23 billion. 
Service revenue continued to be a significant growth driver, increasing 26.9% over third quarter 2010 to a record $379 million. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, as well as growth to our client service offerings across the company. 
Turning to rebates, we earned $1.5 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 5.6% over the same period last year even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medications and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to continuous improvements in formulary contracts. Our third quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 13.0%, consistent with the 12.8% in the third quarter 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong with clients and members continuing to the lower cost and clinically effective channel. In third quarter 2011, our toll mail-order prescription volume was 27.4 million. Within this, generic prescription mail-order volumes increased 3.5% to 17.7 million. Just 100,000 scripts shy of our record experienced last few quarter. Brand name prescription volumes decreased 4.9% to 9.7 million prescriptions. Mail-order volumes are on their way to exceeding the high end of the previous guidance we provided of 110 million scripts. We now expect 2011 mail-order volumes of approximately 112 million prescriptions. Our generic dispensing rate at mail increased 2 full percentage points from third quarter 2010 to a new record of 64.8%. The strong generic mail-order prescription volume and our increased service gross margin drove our third quarter gross margin to a new record of $1.17 billion, a 4.3% increase over the third quarter of 2010. The total gross margin percentage of 6.9% is consistent with third quarter 2010, which you may recall was an important quarter for 2010, the reflected a significant gross margin percent recovery from where we were earlier in that year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for third quarter 2011 totaled $255.6 million. When we do the $35.6 million in merger-related expenses I explained earlier, SG&A expenses declined to $420 million. When adjusted further for the effective UVC, which was acquired on September 16, 2010, our SG&A increased only 1.7%. This reflects efficiencies across the enterprise while we continued to invest in our clinical and strategic programs and new technologies to drive even higher levels of service to our clients and members. 
The EBITDA and EBITDA per script performance I'm about to explain excludes the merger-related expense. Our total EBITDA for the third quarter 2011 marks yet another record at $800.9 million, representing growth of 3.9% over third quarter 2010. EBITDA per adjusted prescription for the third quarter 2011 also represents a record, increasing 4.6% to $3.43 from the $3.28 in the third quarter of 10 '10 which was our previous record. Our intangibles amortization as $73.2 million in third quarter 2011 increased 2.8% from $71.2 million in third quarter 2010 primarily reflecting the UVC intangible assets. Total net interest and other expense of $49.6 million for third quarter 2011 increased $8.8 million from the $40.8 million in third quarter 2010, reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. Third quarter 2011 effective tax rate was 39.6% compared to 39.3% in the third quarter 2010. 
Net income in the third quarter 2011 of $355.4 million includes $22.0 million in merger-related expenses. This essentially being the tax effective equivalent of the $36.6 million pretax number I described earlier. Excluding these expenses the results of net income of $377.4 million represents a 1.6% increase in the third quarter 2010. 
Moving onto share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2011, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $350 million at an average per share cost of $55.89 to our preauthorized trading plan. This third quarter repurchase allotment under the preauthorized plan was completed on July 15. Since the repurchase, this has since been suspended as a result of the pending merger with Express Scripts. We have always huge viewed share repurchases as an effective tool in enhancing value to shareholders. On an inception to date basis since we started our first share repurchase program in 2005, we have repurchased 285.5 million shares at a cost of $12.85 billion at an average per share cost of $45 even. 
Our year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.086 billion compared to $1.365 billion for the same period in 2010, with the largest driver being the approximately $200 million payment from the IRS in 2010 related to its tax receivable in prior years. Our inventories reached a record low of $788 million. You may recall that in June 2008, our inventory balance closed at nearly $2.1 billion. We have since then reduced inventory by over 60% to the lowest it has been since 1999. and the Mail volume was about 60 million Scripps. All of that impacting patient service levels. We closed the third quarter with a cash balance of $161.5 million. We expect our quarterly cash balances to build for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012 due to the suspension of our share repurchase program. 
Our total debt for the third quarter has remained consistent since third quarter of 2010 at $5.0 billion. 
Turning to our specialty segment. Accredo achieved record revenues and operating income with growth of 16.7% and 33.0%, respectively, and sustained a strong margin of 6.8%. This strong performance our clients preference to the Accredo service model, as well as, more generally, to grow the utilization of specialty drugs. To be more specific, the product categories driving the growth in specialty include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, immune disorders and oncology, with new drug introductions also driving growth in the hepatitis class. 
As Dave mentioned, we are narrowing our 2011 EPS guidance to the high end of the previous range. Our 2011 for your gapp diluted EPS, including the merger-related expenses suspected in the range of $3.54 to $3.58. Including the merger-related expenses, 2011 guidance is $0.11 stronger as I discussed earlier the $0.11, this guidance represents a range of $3.65 to $3.69 for a growth rate of 16% to 17% over 2010. Our full year 2011 diluted EPS guidance excluding all intangible and amortization merger-related expenses is now in the range of $4.08 to $4.12, reflecting growth of 15% to 16% over 2010. We essentially updated what was previously at $0.10 guidance range and narrowed it to the high end with a much tighter $0.04 spread, reflecting confidence in our strength for the remainder of the year. 
I'm not going to walk you line by line through 2011 guidance since our current expectations are consistent with what we have previously communicated. 
Our fourth quarter is expected to be the strongest quarter in 2011 as I have guided in the past. Included in the fourth quarter is an expected lift in the incremental EPS effect in new generics led by Lipitor with an approximate $0.03 contribution. We also expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be lower, bringing in the full year effective tax rate with lower end of the previous guidance range for approximately 38.5%. You may recall that when I first gave guidance for 2011 on our third quarter 2010 earnings call, I pointed to an expectation for stability or possible expansion in gross margin percentage and EBITDA per script. Looking back to October 2011 year-to-date, excluding this year's merger-related expenses, gross margin is consistent at 6.5% through '11 and '10, and our EBITDA per adjusted script has, in fact, expanded to $3.16 in 2011 compared to $3.07 in 2010. Again, these are all year-to-date specifics. Additionally, one measure that is very important to this company, return on invested capital was projected to exceed 30% this year even if fully including the invested capital associated with the UBC acquisition in September 2010. 
Now this leads me to a discussion of our expected 2012 performance. This is an unusual year and that the S-4 recently filed by Express Scripts under the name Aristotle Holding Inc. on October 6 includes Medco forecast for 2011 through 2014 for net revenues, EBITDA and net income. You can find these forecasts on Page 123 of that document. The S-4 forecast do not exclude merger-related expenses or any one-time costs that may be incurred, they are meant to reflect Medco's expected operating performance in a stand-alone basis. For those of you who don't have the S-4 handy, the 2011 forecast presented includes revenues of $68.951 billion, EBITDA of $3.113 billion, and net income of $1.473 billion. This 2011 forecast should be viewed as a reflection of the midpoint of our recently narrowed guidance range or about $4.10 in diluted EPS, excluded all amortization and merger-related expenses. The amounts included in the S-4 for 2012 include revenues of $58.931 billion, EBITDA of $3.408 billion and net income of $1.626 billion. These 2012 amounts represent our internal operating plan. You should consider these forecasts as reflecting the high end of the 2012 guidance range with the 4% reduction representing the low end of the range. And since those ranges provided the previous years. 
Revenue for 2012 is expected to decline by $10 billion or 14.5% from 2011. This decline includes the effect of clients that were required by competitors when transition in the normal course of competitive activity, all as previously announced. It also includes the $6.5 billion generic affect discussed earlier, which decreases our revenues, and very importantly, increase the savings to clients and patients. The EBITDA growth from 2011 to 2012 using the forecast presented in the S-4 amounts to 9.5%. Our EBITDA growth from 2010 to 2011 amounts to 4.7%. As you can see, our 2012 EBITDA growth rate is expected to more than double by 2011 EBITDA growth rate. The 2012 growth rate reflects improved profitability, largely because 2012 is the peak year of the generic wave. In addition, we expect to yields efficiencies commensurate with what our business will now require. We have various alternative plans in place to yield these business efficiencies. And you must realize that the large majority of our cost and expense base is, in fact, variable and manageable. 
The 2012 net income growth of 10.4% follows the growth I explained for EBITDA. One statistic that becomes critical with these forecasted amounts being presented is the relationship with EBITDA over revenue which for the S-4 will be 5% in 2011 and 5.8% in 2012, recognizing from earlier comments of 5.8% reflects the high end of the range, we may end up with a record EBITDA margin year in 2012. With EBITDA margin expansion, gross margin percentage and EBITDA per adjusted script expansion are also expected to follow. You will note that the S-4 disclosures do not include any EPS projections for Medco as our share count is uncertain to the suspension of repurchases while the merger is pending. 
At this point, I do not expect to give any further guidance detail for 2012 beyond what I just provided. In conclusion, we delivered another strong quarter of operating results and EPS. We remain confident in our future prospects for continued growth well into the future and I do believe the value we can drive to clients and members will be even greater with a combined Medco and Express Scripts. Now, Dave and I will like to open up the lines for questions. Andrea?"

GAAP dilut",1416,"Thank you, Valerie, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Today, we are reporting strong third quarter 2011 earnings and narrowing the range of our full year 2011 earnings per share guidance to the high-end of previous guidance. GAAP diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2011 reached $0.90 or $0.96, excluding merger-related expenses incurred in the quarter, representing solid 12.9% growth over third quarter 2010. Even when including the merger-related expenses, our GAAP EPS is a record. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, reached a record $1.07, reflecting a 12.6% growth rate over third quarter 2010. Importantly, our gross margin percentage was consistent with third quarter 2010 at 6.9%, up meaningfully from the 6.5% in second quarter 2011. And our EBITDA per script, excluding the merger-related expenses, also reached a record level at $3.43. Our mail volumes continue to be strong at this stage of the year. We are now confident that we will meaningfully surpass the high-end of our previous mail volume guidance range of 108 million to 110 million script. 
Our Accredo business also delivered strong results with revenue growth of 16.7% and operating income growth of 33%, all at a 6.8% gross margin, consistent with third quarter 2010. The company is performing well across the board and we narrowed our a 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance excluding merger-related expenses and all intangible amortization to a range of $4.08 to $4.12, which represents 15% to 16% growth over 2010. Our previous guidance of $4.02 to $4.12 reflect the growth of 13% to 16% over 2010. 
For the 2011 selling season, our annualized new-named sales totaled $3.2 billion, up from the $3 billion we previously reported. We have completed 98% of our 2011 renewals amounting to $16 billion client-drove spend. Our 2012 annualized new-named sales currently stand at approximately $1.6 billion, double the $800 million reported last quarter as our clinically focused model continues to have strong appeal in the marketplace. 
Now, I would like to share some thoughts on the pending merger with Express Scripts. As you saw in the recently filed S-4, after an extensive review of numerous strategic alternatives through an exhaustive planning process, we determined that combining with Express Scripts was the best strategy to maximize value for our clients, members and shareholders. The merger is a solution to control escalating healthcare costs in America, costs that are undermining the U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. In 2010 alone, U.S. spending for prescription drugs reached $307.4 billion. Our aging population and an increased prevalence of chronic disease are projected to drive a 50% increase in prescription drug spending to well over $450 billion by 2019. 
At Medco, we have lowered the cost of prescription medications for our clients by enabling greater use of generics, driving savings of $3.7 billion to Medco's clients in full year 2010, and $2.7 billion year-to-date in 2011. We have expertly managed the challenges associated with the rising costs of care, including specialty medications, and we have improved efficiencies my enabling clients to make effective use of the highest value channels of distribution, including mail-order delivery for chronic medication. The combined organization is well positioned to advance the quality and cost goal set forth in America's healthcare reform legislation by combining 2 innovative approaches, Medco's advanced clinical services that utilize an evidence-based protocols and Express Script Services which focus on behavioral science to increase medication adherence. As you can see from this year's performance and our projections included in the S-4, we are planning to merge from a position of strength. Combining forces with Express Scripts positions us to deliver what our nation needs now, high-quality care at even lower cost to our patients and clients. And we can do this much more effectively together. 
Many of you have asked where we are in the regulatory review process and what will be the likely outcome. As I have said previously, and most recently at a hearing in Washington DC, we would not have announced this combination if we were not confident in our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. As we stated when the deal was announced, we anticipated that the transaction will close in the first half of 2012, and we remain confident in that projection for a number of reasons. First, the opponents of this proposed mergers are not customers. Our proposed merger is receiving very positive reaction from our customers who understand that the combination of Medco and Express Scripts can mean to them and their members. This combination includes over $1 billion in savings as it's expected to be delivered to customers after closing. 
Second, the PBM marketplace is highly competitive and will remain highly competitive after the deal closes. There are at least 10 PBMs serving the largest employers in the Fortune 50 and over 15 serving the Fortune 500 alone. In addition, these and many other PBMs also serve large government account and health plan. In fact, today, our competitors include over 40 PBMs with household names like Aetna, CIGNA, CVS Caremark and others who may not be as well known, but continues to make major investments such as prime therapeutic, catalysts and FXP [ph]. Additionally, in specialty drugs, hundreds of different firms compete including PBMs, pharmacy chains and independents, wholesalers, managed-care organizations, as well as stand-alone specialty pharmacy. Also, and very importantly, UnitedHealth Group has announced its plans to bring in-house the 40 million lives previously served by Medco and combine that business with a substantial Medicare and other national employer lives that already directly services through its own PBM known as Optim RX [ph]. With this, United Health Group will be one of the nation's largest PBMs. 
The merger with Express Scripts provides us with the opportunity to reduce our acquisition costs for medication and pass on additional savings for our clients and patients. The SEC is concerned at protecting consumer, not competitors. That means ensuring competition remains healthy in the marketplace and consumers are not harmed by price increases resulting from tier competitors. We firmly believe that this combination will benefit consumers. 
To conclude my remarks on this topic, the proposed merger, in our view, embodies the spirit of the new healthcare reform legislation that promotes innovation to solve America's healthcare burden. As I have said previously, we are confident that this merger will receive SEC approval in the first half of 2012. We are an important part of the solution and we remain dedicated to providing our clients with quality care at the lowest possible cost. Not only does this merger promise to serve our clients well, it will create substantial value for our shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, who will cover the 2012 guidance more thoroughly, I would like to highlight a few observations for next year. First, as you saw in the S-4 and in our earnings release, revenue is expected to decrease to approximately $58.9 billion in 2012, equating to a $10 billion or 14.5% decline. This decline contains many moving parts, including clients that are transitioning from Medco due to acquisitions by competitors and other reasons. Also, contributing to the decline in revenues is the generic wave in 2012, which is projected to reduce our net revenues next year by approximately $6.5 billion. If you look at this from the other side of the ledger, this is value that accrues to clients and patients, a massive win to the consumer. 
The last point I will make on guidance is regarding our EBITDA, which at the high-end is expected to grow by as much as 9.5% in 2012 as a function of the generic wave and continuously improving business efficiencies. And looking at EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, what is known as EBITDA margin, we expect this measure to increase from approximately 4.5% in 2011 to as much as 5.8% at the high-end in 2012, which would represent a Medco record. We expect meaningful increases in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA per script for 2012 as well. Resulting not only from the generic wave and business efficiencies I just mentioned, but also from the fact that the large retail clients that will be transitioning in 2012 carries extraordinarily low profit margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rich Rubino, who will discuss additional third quarter 2011 financial performance details, and provide you with additional color regarding our 2012 guidance. Rich?"

As Dave mentioned, our third quarter EPS results were strong, with record GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90.

As Dave mentioned, our third quarter EPS results were strong, with record GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90. The record gets even more impressive when you exclude the $0.06 of merger-related expenses, bringing that number to an equivalent of $0.96, a growth of 12.9% over third quarter last year. Diluted EPS, excluding all intangibles and merger-related expenses of $1.07 for this quarter is also a record, representing a 12.6% increase. This $1.07 is a meaningful $0.08 higher than our previous EPS record of $0.99 set in the fourth quarter of 2010. The merger-related expenses, which primarily include bankruptcies, legal fees and employee retention-related expenses, totaled $36.6 million or $0.06 per share. And that of course, was for the third quarter of 2011, with $35.6 million flowing to SG&A expense and the remaining $1 million flowing to cost of sales. We currently expect the fourth quarter 2011 amount of merger-related expenses to be slightly less than the third quarter at $0.05 per share, bringing full year 2011 estimated merger-related expenses to $0.11 per share. 
Total third quarter 2011 net revenues reached $17.0 billion, representing growth of 4.1% over  third quarter 2010. Our product revenues grew at 3.4% over third quarter 2010 to $16.6 billion, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher mix of lower-priced generics. On that generics point, our clients and members saved approximately $700 million this quarter compared to third quarter 2010 from increased utilization of generic. For 2011, we expect these savings to total approximately $3.7 billion. If you look at how much Medco clients and members have saved from generic drug utilization since 2006, when the first blockbuster drug started losing their patent, it is a very substantial number, $16.7 billion. Add to that the expected record 2012 year for generic savings that Dave already mentioned, contributing another expected $6.5 billion in savings, and the cumulative savings since 2006 rose to over $23 billion. 
Service revenue continue to be a significant growth driver, increasing 26.9% over the third quarter 2010 to a record $379 million. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, as well as growth to our client service offerings across the company. 
Turning to rebates, we earned $1.5 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 5.6% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medications and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to continuous improvements in formulary contract. Our third quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 13.0%, consistent with the 12.8% in the third quarter 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective channel. In third quarter 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume is 27.4 million. Within this, generic prescription mail-order volumes increased 3.5% to 17.7 million. Just 100,000 scripts shy of our record experienced last few quarter. Brand name prescription volumes decreased 4.9% to 9.7 million prescriptions. Mail-order volumes are on their way to exceeding the high end of the previous guidance we provided of 110 million scripts. We now expect 2011 mail-order volumes of approximately 112 million prescriptions. 
Our generic dispensing rate at mail increased 2 full percentage points from third quarter 2010 to a new record of 64.8%. The strong generic mail-order prescription volumes and our increased service gross margin drove our third quarter gross margin to a new record of $1.17 billion, a 4.3% increase over third quarter 2010. The total gross margin percentage of 6.9% is consistent with third quarter 2010, which you may recall was an important quarter for 2010, it reflected a significant gross margin percent recovery from where we were earlier in that year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for third quarter 2011 totaled $455.6 million. When reduce by the $35.6 million in merger-related expenses I explained earlier, SG&A expenses declined to $420 million. When adjusted further for the effective UBC, which was acquired on September 16, 2010, our SG&A increased only 1.7%. This reflects efficiencies across the enterprise while we continued to invest in our clinical and strategic programs and new technologies to drive even higher levels of service to our clients and members. 
The EBITDA and EBITDA per script performance I'm about to explain excludes the merger-related expenses. Our total EBITDA for the third quarter 2011 marks yet another record at $800.9 million, representing growth of 3.9% over third quarter 2010. EBITDA per adjusted prescription for the third quarter 2011 also represents a record, increasing 4.6% to $3.43 from the $3.28 in the third quarter of 2010, which was our previous record. Our intangible amortization as $73.2 million in third quarter 2011 increased 2.8% from $71.2 million in third quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. Total net interest and other expense of $49.6 million for third quarter of 2011 increased $8.8 million from the $40.8 million in third quarter 2010, reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. Third quarter 2011 effective tax rate was 39.6% compared to 39.3% in the third quarter 2010. 
Net income in the third quarter of 2011 of $355.4 million includes $22.0 million in merger-related expenses. This essentially being the tax effective equivalent of the $36.6 million pretax number I described earlier. Excluding these expenses the results of net income of $377.4 million represents a 1.6% increase in the third quarter 2010. 
Moving on to share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2011, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $350 million at an average per share cost of $55.89 to our pre-authorized trading plan. This third quarter repurchase allotment under the pre-authorized plan was completed on July 15. Future repurchases have since been suspended as a result of the pending merger with Express Scripts. We have always viewed share repurchases as an effective tool in enhancing value to shareholders. On an inception-to-date basis, since we started our first share repurchase program in 2005, we have repurchased 285.5 million shares at a cost of $12.85 billion in an average per share cost of $45 even. 
Our year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.086 billion compared to $1.365 billion for the same period in 2010, with the largest driver being the approximately $200 million payment from the IRS in 2010 related to its tax receivable in prior years. Our inventories reached a record low of $788 million. You may recall that in June 2008, our inventory balance closed at nearly $2.1 billion. We have since then reduced inventory by over 60% to the lowest it has been since 1999, the year when our mail volume was about 60 million prescription. All of that impacting patient service level. 
We closed the third quarter with a cash balance of $161.5 million, and we expect our quarterly cash balances to build for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012 due to the suspension of our share repurchase program. Our total debt for the third quarter has remained consistent since third quarter of 2010 at $5.0 billion. 
Turning to our specialty segment. Accredo achieved record revenues and operating income with growth of 16.7% and 33.0%, respectively, and sustained a strong margin of 6.8%. This strong performance reflects our clients preference to the Accredo service model, as well as, more generally, to grow the utilization of specialty drugs. To be more specific, the product categories driving the growth in specialty include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, immune disorders and oncology. With new drug introductions also driving growth in the hepatitis class. 
As Dave mentioned, we are narrowing our 2011 EPS guidance to the high end of the previous range. Our 2011 full year GAAP diluted EPS, including the merger-related expenses is expected in the range of $3.54 to $3.58. Excluding the merger-related expenses, 2011 guidance is $0.11 stronger as I discussed earlier. When adding back the $0.11, this guidance represents a range of $3.65 to $3.69 for a growth rate of 16% to 17% over 2010. Our full year 2011 diluted EPS guidance excluding all intangible and amortization and merger-related expenses is now in the range of $4.08 to $4.12, reflecting growth of 15% to 16% over 2010. We essentially updated what was previously at $0.10 guidance range and narrowed it to the high end with a much tighter $0.04 spread, reflecting confidence in our strength for the remainder of the year. I'm not going to walk you line by line through 2011 guidance since our current expectations are consistent with what we have previously communicated. 
Our fourth quarter is expected to be the strongest quarter of 2011, as I have guided in the past. Included in the fourth quarter is an expected lift in the incremental EPS effect in new generics led by Lipitor, with an approximate $0.03 contribution. We also expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be lower, bringing the full year effective tax rate to the lower end of the previous guidance range or approximately 38.5%. 
You may recall that when I first gave guidance for 2011 on our third quarter 2010 earnings call, I pointed to an expectation for stability or possible expansion in gross margin percentage and EBITDA per script. Looking back to September 2011 year-to-date, excluding this year's merger-related expenses, gross margin is consistent at 6.5% through '11 and '10, and our EBITDA per adjusted script has, in fact, expanded to $3.16 in 2011 compared to $3.07 in 2010. Again, these are all year-to-date specific. Additionally, one measure that is very important to this company, return on invested capital was projected to exceed 30% this year, even when fully including the invested capital associated with the UBC acquisition in September 2010. 
Now this leads me to a discussion of our expected 2012 performance. This is an unusual year and that the Form S-4 recently filed by Express Scripts under the name Aristotle Holding Inc. on October 6, includes Medco forecast for 2011 through 2014 for net revenues, EBITDA and net income. You can find these forecasts on Page 123 of that document. The S-4 forecast do not include merger-related expenses or any other onetime costs that may be incurred. They are meant to reflect Medco's expected operating performance in a stand-alone basis. For those of you who don't have the S-4 handy, the 2011 forecast presented includes revenues of $68.951 billion, EBITDA of $3.113 billion and net income of $1.473 billion. This 2011 forecast should be viewed as a reflection of the midpoint of our recently narrowed guidance range or about $4.10 in diluted EPS, excluding all amortization and merger-related expenses. The amounts included in the S-4 for 2012 include revenues of $58.931 billion, EBITDA of $3.408 billion and net income of $1.626 billion. These 2012 amounts represent our internal operating plan. You should consider these forecasts as reflecting the high end of the 2012 guidance range with the 4% reduction representing the low end of the range, consistent with ranges provided the previous years. 
Revenue for 2012 is expected to decline by $10 billion or 14.5% from 2011. This decline includes the effect of clients that were required by competitors, were transitioned in the normal course of competitive activity, all as previously announced. It also includes the $6.5 billion generic affect discussed earlier, which decreases our revenues, and very importantly, increase the savings to clients and patients. 
The EBITDA growth from 2011 to 2012 using the forecast presented in the S-4, amounts to 9.5%. Our EBITDA growth from 2010 to 2011 amounts to 4.7%. As you can see, our 2012 EBITDA growth rate is expected to more than double by 2011 EBITDA growth rate. The 2012 growth rate reflects improved profitability, largely because 2012 is the peak year of the generic wave. In addition, we expect to yield efficiencies commensurate with what our business will now require. We have various alternative plans in place to yield these business efficiencies. And you must realize that the large majority of our cost and expense base is, in fact, variable and manageable. 
The 2012 net income growth of 10.4% follows the growth I explained for EBITDA. One statistic that becomes critical with these forecasted amounts being presented is the relationship with EBITDA to revenue, which for the S-4 would be 5% in 2011 and 5.8% in 2012. Recognizing from earlier comment, the 5.8% reflects the high end of the range, we may end up with a record EBITDA margin year in 2012. With EBITDA margin expansion, gross margin percentage and EBITDA per adjusted script expansion are also expected to follow. You will note that the S-4 disclosures do not include any EPS projections for Medco as our share count is uncertain due to the suspension of repurchases while the merger is pending. At this point, I do not expect to give any further guidance detail for 2012 beyond what I just provided. 
In conclusion, we delivered another strong quarter of operating results and EPS. We remain confident in our future prospects for continued growth well into the future and I do believe the value we can drive to clients and members will be even greater with a combined Medco and Express Scripts. Now Dave and I will like to open up the lines for questions. Andrea?"

So that beyond the financials, the questions they're asking is, what will the combined company look like? How will it operate? Will we still get the same services that we got from Medco as a stand-alone company? As George and I talked about what this combined company will look like, we have this concept of best-of-breed and best of both worlds. So my feeling is, our clients are likely to experience continued innovation, combinations of best-of-breed assets to get even better service and better options. And obviously, part of that is in execution, and we're still in integration planning process so we have a lot of work to do still, but conceptually, we do know where we want to end up. I think both companies know where they want to end up and I think it's safe to say both companies have the client and the clients' need squarely in their focus is the #1 priority. Because at the end of the day, we still want to delight and retain customers and win new customers. So I'm very comfortable that as we look at the capabilities of both companies, we will get to something we call best-of-breed between the 2. And I think that make a client comfortable.

Today, we are reporting strong third quarter 2011 earnings and narrowing the range of our full year 2011 earnings per share guidance to the high-end of previous guidance. GAAP diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2011 reached $0.90 or $0.96, excluding merger-related expenses incurred in the quarter, representing solid 12.9% growth over third quarter 2010. Even when including the merger-related expenses, our GAAP EPS is a record. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding all intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, reached a record $1.07, reflecting a 12.6% growth rate over third quarter 2010. Importantly, our gross margin percentage was consistent with third quarter 2010 at 6.9%, up meaningfully from the 6.5% in second quarter 2011. And our EBITDA per script, excluding the merger-related expenses, also reached a record level at $3.43. Our mail volumes continue to be strong at this stage of the year. We are now confident that we will meaningfully surpass the high-end of our previous mail volume guidance range of 108 million to 110 million script. 
Our Accredo business also delivered strong results with revenue growth of 16.7% and operating income growth of 33%, all at a 6.8% gross margin, consistent with third quarter 2010. The company is performing well across the board and we narrowed our a 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance excluding merger-related expenses and all intangible amortization to a range of $4.08 to $4.12, which represents 15% to 16% growth over 2010. Our previous guidance of $4.02 to $4.12 reflect the growth of 13% to 16% over 2010. 
For the 2011 selling season, our annualized new-named sales totaled $3.2 billion, up from the $3 billion we previously reported. We have completed 98% of our 2011 renewals amounting to $16 billion client-drove spend. Our 2012 annualized new-named sales currently stand at approximately $1.6 billion, double the $800 million reported last quarter as our clinically focused model continues to have strong appeal in the marketplace. 
Now, I would like to share some thoughts on the pending merger with Express Scripts. As you saw in the recently filed S-4, after an extensive review of numerous strategic alternatives through an exhaustive planning process, we determined that combining with Express Scripts was the best strategy to maximize value for our clients, members and shareholders. The merger is a solution to control escalating healthcare costs in America, costs that are undermining the U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. In 2010 alone, U.S. spending for prescription drugs reached $307.4 billion. Our aging population and an increased prevalence of chronic disease are projected to drive a 50% increase in prescription drug spending to well over $450 billion by 2019. 
At Medco, we have lowered the cost of prescription medications for our clients by enabling greater use of generics, driving a savings of $3.7 billion to Medco's clients in full year 2010, and $2.7 billion year-to-date in 2011. We have expertly managed the challenges associated with the rising costs of care, including specialty medications, and we have improved efficiencies my enabling clients to make effective use of the highest value channels of distribution, including mail-order delivery for chronic medication. The combined organization is well positioned to advance the quality and cost goals set forth in America's healthcare reform legislation by combining 2 innovative approaches, Medco's advanced clinical services that utilize an evidence-based protocols and Express Script Services which focus on behavioral science to increase medication adherence. As you can see from this year's performance and our projections included in the S-4, we are planning to merge from a position of strength. Combining forces with Express Scripts positions us to deliver what our nation needs now, high-quality care at even lower cost to our patients and clients. And we can do this much more effectively together. 
Many of you have asked where we are in the regulatory review process and what will be the likely outcome. As I have said previously, and most recently at a hearing in Washington DC, we would not have announced this combination if we were not confident in our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. As we stated when the deal was announced, we anticipated that the transaction will close in the first half of 2012, and we remain confident in that projection for a number of reasons. First, the opponents of this proposed mergers are not customers. Our proposed merger is receiving very positive reaction from our customers who understand that the combination of Medco and Express Scripts can mean to them and their members. This combination includes over $1 billion in savings as it's expected to be delivered to customers after closing. 
Second, the PBM marketplace is highly competitive and will remain highly competitive after the deal closes. There are at least 10 PBMs serving the largest employers in the Fortune 50 and over 15 serving the Fortune 500 alone. In addition, these and many other PBMs also serve large government accounts and health plan. In fact, today, our competitors include over 40 PBMs with household names like Aetna, CIGNA, CVS Caremark and others who may not be as well known, but continues to make major investments such as Prime Therapeutics, Catalyst and FXP. Additionally, in specialty drugs, hundreds of different firms compete including PBMs, pharmacy chains and independents, wholesalers, managed-care organizations, as well as stand-alone specialty pharmacies.  Also, and very importantly, UnitedHealth Group has announced its plans to bring in-house the 40 million lives previously served by Medco and combine that business with a substantial Medicare and other national employer lives it already directly services through its own PBM known as OptimRx. With this, United Health Group will be one of the nation's largest PBMs. 
The merger with Express Scripts provides us with the opportunity to reduce our acquisition costs for medications and pass on additional savings for our clients and patients. The SEC's concern is protecting consumers, not competitors. That means ensuring competition remains healthy in the marketplace and consumers are not harmed by price increases resulting from fewer competitors. We firmly believe that this combination will benefit consumers. 
To conclude my remarks on this topic, the proposed merger, in our view, embodies the spirit of the new healthcare reform legislation that promotes innovation to solve America's healthcare burden. As I have said previously, we are confident that this merger will receive SEC approval in the first half of 2012. We are an important part of the solution and we remain dedicated to providing our clients with quality care at the lowest possible cost. Not only does this merger promise to serve our clients well, it will create substantial value for our shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, who will cover the 2012 guidance more thoroughly, I would like to highlight a few observations for next year. First, as you saw in the S-4 and in our earnings release, revenue is expected to decrease to approximately $58.9 billion in 2012, equating to a $10 billion or 14.5% decline. This decline contains many moving parts, including clients that are transitioning from Medco due to acquisitions by competitors and other reasons. Also, contributing to the decline in revenues is the generic wave in 2012, which is projected to reduce our net revenues next year by approximately $6.5 billion. If you look at this from the other side of the ledger, this is value that accrues to clients and patients, a massive win to the consumer. 
The last point I will make on guidance is regarding our EBITDA, which at the high-end is expected to grow by as much as 9.5% in 2012 as a function of the generic wave and continuously improving business efficiencies. And looking at EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, what is known as EBITDA margin, we expect this measure to increase from approximately 4.5% in 2011 to as much as 5.8% at the high-end in 2012, which would represent a Medco record. We expect meaningful increases in our gross margin percentage and EBITDA per script for 2012 as well. Resulting not only from the generic wave and business efficiencies I just mentioned, but also from the fact that the large retail clients that will be transitioning in 2012 carries extraordinarily low profit margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rich Rubino, who will discuss additional third quarter 2011 financial performance details, and provide you with additional color regarding our 2012 guidance. Rich?"

As Dave mentioned, our third quarter EPS results were strong, with record GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90. The record gets even more impressive when you exclude the $0.06 of merger-related expenses, bringing that number to an equivalent of $0.96, a growth of 12.9% over third quarter last year. Diluted EPS, excluding all intangibles and merger-related expenses of $1.07 for this quarter is also a record, representing a 12.6% increase. This $1.07 is a meaningful $0.08 higher than our previous EPS record of $0.99 set in the fourth quarter of 2010. The merger-related expenses, which primarily include bankruptcies, legal fees and employee retention-related expenses, totaled $36.6 million or $0.06 per share. And that of course, was for the third quarter of 2011, with $35.6 million flowing to SG&A expense and the remaining $1 million flowing to cost of sales. We currently expect the fourth quarter 2011 amount of merger-related expenses to be slightly less than the third quarter at $0.05 per share, bringing full year 2011 estimated merger-related expenses to $0.11 per share. 
Total third quarter 2011 net revenues reached $17.0 billion, representing growth of 4.1% over  third quarter 2010. Our product revenues grew 3.4% over third quarter 2010 to $16.6 billion, reflecting our new business wins, as well as higher prices charged by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers, partially offset by a higher mix of lower-priced generics. On that generics point, our clients and members saved approximately $700 million this quarter compared to third quarter 2010 from increased utilization of generics.  For 2011, we expect these savings to total approximately $3.7 billion. If you look at how much Medco clients and members have saved from generic drug utilization since 2006, when the first blockbuster drug started losing their patents, it is a very substantial number, $16.7 billion. Add to that the expected record 2012 year for generic savings that Dave already mentioned, contributing another expected $6.5 billion in savings, and the cumulative savings since 2006 rose to over $23 billion. 
Service revenue continue to be a significant growth driver, increasing 46.9% over the third quarter 2010 to a record $379 million. This strong performance reflects the service revenue contribution from UBC, as well as growth in our client service offerings across the company. 
Turning to rebates, we earned $1.5 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 5.6% over the same period last year, even though we are dispensing fewer brand-name medications and more generics. This year-over-year growth is attributable to continuous improvements in formulary contract. Our third quarter 2011 rebate retention rate was 13.0%, consistent with the 12.8% in the third quarter 2010 as we continue to drive significant value to clients in a highly transparent manner. 
As Dave mentioned, mail-order volume remains strong as clients and members continue to choose this lower cost and clinically effective channel. In third quarter 2011, our total mail-order prescription volume is 27.4 million. Within this, generic prescription mail-order volumes increased 3.5% to 17.7 million, just 100,000 scripts shy of our record experienced last few quarter. Brand name prescription volumes decreased 4.9% to 9.7 million prescriptions. Mail-order volumes are on their way to exceeding the high end of the previous guidance we provided of 110 million scripts. We now expect 2011 mail-order volumes of approximately 112 million prescriptions. 
Our generic dispensing rate at mail increased 2 full percentage points from third quarter 2010 to a new record of 64.8%. The strong generic mail-order prescription volumes and our increased service gross margin drove our third quarter gross margin to a new record of $1.17 billion, a 4.3% increase over third quarter 2010. The total gross margin percentage of 6.9% is consistent with third quarter 2010, which you may recall was an important quarter for 2010, it reflected a significant gross margin percent recovery from where we were earlier in that year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for third quarter 2011 totaled $455.6 million. When reduced by the $35.6 million in merger-related expenses I explained earlier, SG&A expenses declined to $420 million. When adjusted further for the effective UBC, which was acquired on September 16, 2010, our SG&A increased only 1.7%. This reflects efficiencies across the enterprise while we continued to invest in our clinical and strategic programs and new technologies to drive even higher levels of service to our clients and members. 
The EBITDA and EBITDA per script performance I'm about to explain excludes the merger-related expenses. Our total EBITDA for the third quarter 2011 marks yet another record at $800.9 million, representing growth of 3.9% over third quarter 2010. EBITDA per adjusted prescription for the third quarter 2011 also represents a record, increasing 4.6% to $3.43 from the $3.28 in the third quarter of 2010, which was our previous record. Our intangible amortization of $73.2 million in third quarter 2011 increased 2.8% from $71.2 million in third quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the UBC intangible assets. Total net interest and other expense of $49.6 million for third quarter of 2011 increased $8.8 million from the $40.8 million in third quarter 2010, reflecting the new debt we added to finance the UBC acquisition last September. Third quarter 2011 effective tax rate was 39.6% compared to 39.3% in the third quarter 2010. 
Net income in the third quarter of 2011 of $355.4 million included $22.0 million in merger-related expenses. This essentially being the tax effective equivalent of the $36.6 million pretax number I described earlier. Excluding these expenses the results of net income of $377.4 million represents a 1.6% increase in the third quarter 2010. 
Moving on to share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2011, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $350 million at an average per share cost of $55.89 through our pre-authorized trading plan. This third quarter repurchase allotment under the pre-authorized plan was completed on July 15. Future repurchases have since been suspended as a result of the pending merger with Express Scripts. We have always viewed share repurchases as an effective tool in enhancing value to shareholders. On an inception-to-date basis, since we started our first share repurchase program in 2005, we have repurchased 285.5 million shares at a cost of $12.85 billion and an average per share cost of $45 even. 
Our year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.086 billion compared to $1.365 billion for the same period in 2010, with the largest driver being the approximately $200 million payment from the IRS in 2010 related to its tax receivable in prior years. Our inventories reached a record low of $788 million. You may recall that in June 2008, our inventory balance closed at nearly $2.1 billion. We have since then reduced inventory by over 60% to the lowest it has been since 1999, the year when our mail volume was about 60 million prescriptions.  All of that impacting patient service level. 
We closed the third quarter with a cash balance of $161.5 million, and we expect our quarterly cash balances to build for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012 due to the suspension of our share repurchase program. Our total debt for the third quarter has remained consistent since third quarter of 2010 at $5.0 billion. 
Turning to our specialty segment. Accredo achieved record revenues and operating income with growth of 16.7% and 33.0%, respectively, and sustained a strong margin of 6.8%. This strong performance reflects our clients preference to the Accredo service model, as well as, more generally, to grow the utilization of specialty drugs. To be more specific, the product categories driving the growth in specialty include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, immune disorders and oncology. With new drug introductions also driving growth in the hepatitis class. 
As Dave mentioned, we are narrowing our 2011 EPS guidance to the high end of the previous range. Our 2011 full year GAAP diluted EPS, including the merger-related expenses is expected in the range of $3.54 to $3.58. Excluding the merger-related expenses, 2011 guidance is $0.11 stronger as I discussed earlier. When adding back the $0.11, this guidance represents a range of $3.65 to $3.69 for a growth rate of 16% to 17% over 2010. Our full year 2011 diluted EPS guidance excluding all intangible amortization and merger-related expenses is now in the range of $4.08 to $4.12, reflecting growth of 15% to 16% over 2010. We essentially updated what was previously at $0.10 guidance range and narrowed it to the high end with a much tighter $0.04 spread, reflecting confidence in our strength for the remainder of the year. I'm not going to walk you line by line through 2011 guidance since our current expectations are consistent with what we have previously communicated. 
Our fourth quarter is expected to be the strongest quarter of 2011, as I have guided in the past. Included in the fourth quarter is an expected lift in the incremental EPS effect in new generics led by Lipitor, with an approximate $0.03 contribution. We also expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be lower, bringing the full year effective tax rate to the lower end of the previous guidance range or approximately 38.5%. 
You may recall that when I first gave guidance for 2011 on our third quarter 2010 earnings call, I pointed to an expectation for stability or possible expansion in gross margin percentage and EBITDA per script. Looking back to September 2011 year-to-date, excluding this year's merger-related expenses, gross margin is consistent at 6.5% through '11 and '10, and our EBITDA per adjusted script has, in fact, expanded to $3.16 in 2011 compared to $3.07 in 2010. Again, these are all year-to-date specific. Additionally, one measure that is very important to this company, return on invested capital was projected to exceed 30% this year, even when fully including the invested capital associated with the UBC acquisition in September 2010. 
Now this leads me to a discussion of our expected 2012 performance. This is an unusual year in that the Form S-4 recently filed by Express Scripts under the name Aristotle Holding Inc. on October 6, includes Medco forecast for 2011 through 2014 for net revenues, EBITDA and net income. You can find these forecasts on Page 123 of that document. The S-4 forecasts do not include merger-related expenses or any other onetime costs that may be incurred. They are meant to reflect Medco's expected operating performance on a stand-alone basis. For those of you who don't have the S-4 handy, the 2011 forecast presented includes revenues of $68.951 billion, EBITDA of $3.113 billion and net income of $1.473 billion. These 2011 forecasts should be viewed as a reflection of the midpoint of our recently narrowed guidance range or about $4.10 in diluted EPS, excluding all amortization and merger-related expenses. The amounts included in the S-4 for 2012 include revenues of $58.931 billion, EBITDA of $3.408 billion and net income of $1.626 billion. These 2012 amounts represent our internal operating plan. You should consider these forecasts as reflecting the high end of the 2012 guidance range with the 4% reduction representing the low end of the range, consistent with ranges provided the previous years. 
Revenue for 2012 is expected to decline by $10 billion or 14.5% from 2011. This decline includes the effect of clients that were required by competitors or transitioned in the normal course of competitive activity, all as previously announced. It also includes the $6.5 billion generic affect discussed earlier, which decreases our revenues, and very importantly, increase the savings to clients and patients. 
The EBITDA growth from 2011 to 2012 using the forecast presented in the S-4, amounts to 9.5%. Our EBITDA growth from 2010 to 2011 amounts to 4.7%. As you can see, our 2012 EBITDA growth rate is expected to more than double by 2011 EBITDA growth rate. The 2012 growth rate reflects improved profitability, largely because 2012 is the peak year of the generic wave. In addition, we expect to yield efficiencies commensurate with what our business will now require. We have various alternative plans in place to yield these business efficiencies. And you must realize that the large majority of our cost and expense base is, in fact, variable and manageable. 
The 2012 net income growth of 10.4% follows the growth I explained for EBITDA. One statistic that becomes critical with these forecasted amounts being presented is the relationship with EBITDA to revenue, which for the S-4, would be 5% in 2011 and 5.8% in 2012. Recognizing from earlier comments, the 5.8% reflects the high end of the range, we may end up with a record EBITDA margin year in 2012. With EBITDA margin expansion, gross margin percentage and EBITDA per adjusted script expansion are also expected to follow. You will note that the S-4 disclosures do not include any EPS projections for Medco as our share count is uncertain due to the suspension of repurchases while the merger is pending. At this point, I do not expect to give any further guidance detail for 2012 beyond what I just provided. 
In conclusion, we delivered another strong quarter of operating results and EPS. We remain confident in our future prospects for continued growth well into the future and I do believe the value we can drive to clients and members will be even greater with a combined Medco and Express Scripts. Now Dave and I will like to open up the lines for questions. Andrea?"

First of all, I'd love to point out the fact that just in our Systemed Group alone, they closed over 70 deals post-merger announcement and they're still extremely busy right now. From the point of view of a client, they understand how the combination creates better financials for them and it was just critically important. So that beyond the financials, the questions they're asking is, what will the combined company look like? How will it operate? Will we still get the same services that we got from Medco as a stand-alone company? As George and I talked about what this combined company will look like, we have this concept of best-of-breed and best of both worlds. So my feeling is, our clients are likely to experience continued innovation, combinations of best-of-breed assets to get even better service and better options. And obviously, part of that is in execution, and we're still in integration planning process so we have a lot of work to do still, but conceptually, we do know where we want to end up. I think both companies know where they want to end up and I think it's safe to say both companies have the client and the clients' need squarely in their focus is the #1 priority. Because at the end of the day, we still want to delight and retain customers and win new customers. So I'm very comfortable that as we look at the capabilities of both companies, we will get to something we call best-of-breed between the 2. And I think that makes clients comfortable. I think that's what they're looking for and obviously, they're going to watch that over time."
