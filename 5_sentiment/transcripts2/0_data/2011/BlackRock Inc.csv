This morning, we are reporting record as adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $3.42 and record full year earnings of $10.94. I'd also like to welcome to the call our new shareholders. In December, Bank of America and PNC sold about",1799,"Good morning, everyone. This morning, we are reporting record as adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $3.42 and record full year earnings of $10.94. I'd also like to welcome to the call our new shareholders. In December, Bank of America and PNC sold about 59 million shares or about 30% of our total shares outstanding into market. As a result of that transaction, now over 50% of our shares are owned by shareholders other than our three strategic investors.
Looking at our results, we had strong results. They reflect strong product performance, as well as strong markets. We're beginning 2011 with the merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us. Just a comment on that noise a little bit more, we do have $14 billion of merger-related outflows still sitting in the pipeline. The majority of those were in the prior pipeline. So what is reflected is more the timing of the withdrawals rather than the pipeline containing a lot of new notifications. We still have a handful of clients with known concentrations concerns. If those materialized, we'll call it out when they happen. 
But it's important to note the concentration issues, those outflows have been at very low single-digit at this point, so have not had a material effect on revenue. With respect to our quantitative product, the performance on the scientific asset equity product has turned positive and competitive since Ken Kroner [ph] took over the leadership of that product. It'll take some time to fully repair the medium and longer-term track records. So it'll just be noise we have to watch there as we repair that track record. 
The total pipeline stands at $73 billion. That includes $61 billion in long-dated assets and that is net of the merger-related item. The rest of my remarks I'm going to walk through the supplemental slides. And I'll be talking about as adjusted earnings. If you move to Slide 1, operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $962 million. That's up 31% compared to the third quarter. Net income was $670 million, and EPS was $3.42. Both of those are up 25% compared to the third quarter.
Moving on to the full year. Operating earnings of $3,167,000,000 and net income of $2.1 billion were both more than double 2009. EPS of $10.94 was up 53% compared to 2009. And if we look at the 2009 results, if the BGI transaction had taken place on January 1 and so on comparing them to pro forma results, our operating earnings were up 22%, and the net income was up 37%.
Moving on to the third slide and taking a look at our operating margin. The full year operating margin came in at 39.3%. That's up 1.1 points compared to a year ago. It's up 2.5 points compared to the pro forma 2009 results. The fourth quarter margin came in at 40.7%. That does reflect both the strong performance fees in the quarter, as well as the benefits of market flowing to our margin. I'm not showing on the page are compensation to revenue ratio came in at 34.8%. This is the low end of the range of what we've been running for the last several years with the one in the 35% zone. It is down almost half a point from our 2009 margin and really is consistent with our focus of really the benefit of Beta flowing through to our shareholders. 
As we begin 2011, we're very confident in the ability to grow the top line as well as our confidence in our margins. We plan to continue to speak efficiencies in our business and to realize the benefits of scale. At the same time, we plan to invest in growth opportunities. We've got a lot of strength the roadshow gave us the opportunity to get out and dialogue with our shareholders about the external environment and how our capabilities lined up with that environment to be able to really service our clients. With that, we are confident in our ability to grow iShares and retail platforms, Defined Contribution platforms, BlackRock Solutions, Asia, multi-asset class strategies and alternatives. 
On the next slide I'll talk about markets, which are also contributing to growth in margins. So moving on to Slide 4, you can see that our 2010 markets were up about 20% compared to average 2009 markets, 2010 year-end market actually were close the year about 10% higher than the average 2010 market. That means we've got positive tailwind coming into 2011, and that's before considering the positive markets we've seen so far in January.
Moving on to Slide 5. Our total earnings of $3.42 were composed of operating earnings of $3.35 and non-operating earnings of $0.07. The operating earnings improved $0.74 compared to the third quarter. The non-operating earnings included $45 million of positive mark on our co and feed investment portfolio. The level of those positive marks, however, was a little bit lower than the level of positive marks we've had in the third quarter. 
The full year as adjusted tax rate came in at 33%. That is down from the third quarter year-to-date tax rate of 33.5%. The half a point increase in the tax rate reflects some international tax benefit associated with the late December extension of U.S. legislation, which had been due to expire. The half point benefit resulted in about an $0.08 improvement in earnings compared to what we have had the 33.5% tax rate. We do expect the bulk of these benefits to carry into 2011. All other things being equal, we have the same mix of earnings, no other tax legislation changes, no big news on tax resolution. The 2011 tax rate will be likely a little bit higher than 2010 to in the same range.
Moving on to Slide 6. Total revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion. That was up 19% or $400 million from the third quarter. Important part of the increase came from performance fees, which were up $212 million from the third quarter. As with the stock, the fourth quarter is our primary quarter for loss even compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, performance fees are still up $73 million, reflecting improving performance across a number of our funds. The absolute level of performance fees was $326 million and included $128 million of fees really associated with relative performance, as well as $188 million of fees that we earned on our alternative products, reflecting strong absolute performance in those products, and that does include our really large hedge fund GMSP. I'll remind everyone that we have very few funds that have performance fees measurements in the first quarter.
I'm also going to talk about base fees later, so I just mentioned briefly the BRS revenues that came in at $132 million for the quarter. The increase of $32 million from the prior quarter reflects the completion of 20 advisory assignments. We've got a lot of active interest in our BlackRock Solutions the strongest interest that we've ever seen. We do have some interesting things in the pipeline, including the publicly noted assignment from the Central Bank of Ireland.
Moving on to Slide 7, which outlines our expenses. Expenses of $1.5 billion for the quarter were up 9% or $176 million from the third quarter. Just when we put that in the context of those revenue increase of 19% and that even with expense increases we saw those improvements in margins that I talked about earlier. Now about $80 million of the expense increase related to AUM revenues, the biggest single component there related to incentive comp, which closely links to revenue of course. We also had $96 million of increases in G&A expense. We did in the fourth quarter make a $20 million contribution to a charitable fund account for the first time. That's something we'd like to continue to do over time. Also in the fourth quarter, there was a onetime assessment to the U.K. asset management industry, our share of which was about $20 million. We did see some increases in marketing of about $17 million and professional fees of about $13 million, and the rest of the expenses are small movements across many items.
Moving on to base fees on Slide #8. Base fees came in at $1.951 billion. That was up 9% compared to the third quarter. We saw improved revenues across all of our long-dated asset classes and was in part driven by favorable markets. I would note that of our merger-related outflows, there was one outflow of $24 billion that was out about half a basis points, so very little effect on revenue. Whereas our $28 billion in net new long-dated assets came in at closer to our average basis point realization across our whole portfolio, so it contributed positively to revenue. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and non-operating results. Nonoperating results came in at $20 million. That is $45 million of investment gains on our co and fees that I mentioned earlier. Those were gains across all asset classes in the portfolio, offset partially by $25 million of interest expense on our debt that we put on associated with the BGI acquisition. The investment portfolio stands at about $1 billion. It's largely consistent with the third quarter. And just to remind everyone, we do not do any proprietary. Those are all going co and fees investment to be aligned with our clients. 
Moving on to Slide 10, we generate substantial cash flows. We used about $1 billion of our 2010 cash flow to repay short-term debt. In addition, we returned a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our dividend represented about a 38% payout of our earnings. In addition, we repurchased about 900 million shares. That brought our total payout to about 44%. We still have 4.2 million shares of authorization for repurchase. However, we've sort of paused for a little while, at least for now, on those repurchases since the sale by Bank of America and PNC. The reason it was paused is because we believe that we now meet all of the eligibility criteria to be included in the S&P 500 index. We think an important criterion within that is the degree of public flow, and we've just been protecting that public flow is important priority at this point in time. I just say we do always and regularly discuss our dividend policy with our board, and you can see our history of dividend across that slide.
With that, I'd just like to conclude that 2010 ended up with a very strong year. We're entering 2011 with again, those merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us and with strong momentum just both in terms of new business and markets. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And it is scheduled, again, for us to work with our board to come up with a 2011 dividend policy. And so that's one of the opportunities we have going forward in 2011.
First of all, let me welcome everybody. I need to apologize in advance. I may have a fit of coughing since I'm in the back end of a cold. It is no indication of my views of the future. So let me just begin and talk about Alpha. Our performance across most of our products were strong. Throughout our integration process, we needed to be assured that we're protecting our portfolio managers from the integration process. We needed to make sure our clients understood that, that our business with them is not going to change, that we are going to make first and foremost, our manufacturing platform or portfolio team to be uninvolved in all the issues around integration, and I think 2010, looking now backwards, was a success. 
Our teams had very strong performance across our equity, our fixed income and our alternatives product area. I do believe that performance now will continue to drive business in 2011. And most importantly, good performance drives good performance fees. And I think some of the messaging that we said in the past few quarters, the importance of good performance, the importance of alternative products truly is now starting to become more apparent in our earnings related to these phenomenon. 
I would like to go back to early '06 and parts of '07 where we had as much as 30% of our earnings being driven by performance fees. And obviously, the market setbacks of '08 changed all that. I'm not suggesting our earnings model will ever have that type of strength. But I do believe as clients begin to rerisk, and clients are looking to move from Beta products or even core fixed income products to other products, they're going to entail products that may have some form of performance-oriented fees. And with that, we are going to have hopefully large-based performance fees. So we look at this as a great indication of our evolution of our platform. We believe our success in performance fees in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter indicative of that performance and the repositioning of our firm, and it is our strongest intention in 2011 to continue to build out our alternative space, to continue to be working with our clients as our clients are driving more risk positions whether that may be in emerging market product or it may be just a credit product, clients are looking to move away from core fixed income strategies and are looking to move away from some Beta strategies. And I'll get into that a little later, but I think it's important to really focus on that and once again, remind everyone we are going to make this a continuation of our focus for 2011 to continue to build out these alternative products.
Let me also reflect on another component of our business, and that is scale. I think now looking backwards, we are now showing the investment world that scale is a virtue. It is a positive. We, obviously, have much negative noise related to concentration issues. As Ann Marie suggested, it is largely behind us, moving away from low-fee products into other types of products where we have greater ability to navigate with our client base. But most importantly, with our scale and as Ann Marie talked about our free cash flow, no investment firm is investing as much dollars as we are to build a bigger, stronger, more robust platform in which we could provide stronger base Alpha products for our clients and more solution-based relationship with our clients. And so some of the areas that we're really investing in, we're continuing to invest in our investment products, which we'll talk about a little later. We're expanding our platforms regionally in Asia and South America. We're continuing to build out in Europe. 
We talked about over the last few quarters the building out of our trading platform, which we believe will have huge benefits for our clients and already are built out of our capital market capabilities to win large assignments directly from issuers is very positive for us in terms of building out Alpha for our clients. 
I should also state very loud and clear as we build out these trading platforms and as we build out our capital markets capabilities, this is to enhance our connectivity with our clients. This is to find ways to get more product at higher net spreads to our investors. Our business model is not changing. 100% of our revenues will be client-centric business, and so we're building out this platform because we believe scale will be a virtue, and we believe throughout 2011, that will continue to differentiate us. 
And in scale, most importantly, we're building out our global footprint to provide more consistent and more varied Alpha and solution-based products. So over the course of 2011, we have a strong emphasis in building our products in Asia, both credit and in equities, emerging market equities. As I said earlier, we continue to build out our alternative products, and we believe that will be one of the drivers for us in 2012 and 2013. 
We continue to believe we are differentiated by our multi-asset class products, our products. Yesterday, we announced we hired Nancy Everett, who was a CEO of Promark, which was the General Motors pension plan. And prior to that, she was the Head of the Virginia retirement plan. She will be running our U.S. Fiduciary business, a part of this multi-asset category platform. And so we believe this will continue to be an area where we invest. 
Another area of real growth for us in 2010 that have already been validated in our pipeline and wins already and that's the defined contribution area where we believe more and more money will be moving away from defined benefits and defined contributions. I do believe over the course of 2011, as state, governments starting to tackle their tremendous deficit burdens, one of the outcomes will be most probably restructuring of their plans for new employees that will be predominantly Defined Contribution plans. And so we believe DC will become a larger and larger driver. We also believe because of the retrenchment of cost, many more public plans, maybe the smaller ones, will be looking to do more fiduciary outsourcing, which is why we have Nancy here. So we do believe there's going to be quite a bit of change as a result of public plans, public state plans, need to restructure because of the tremendous state burdens with their deficits. And we hope to be taking advantage at because of our scale, because of our multi-asset class product and capabilities, because of our Beta capabilities and our Alpha capabilities.
And so our theme for 2011 continues to be Alpha generation. But Alpha generated connected with a solution-based relationship with our clients as more and more clients are going to be looking for help. As good as the equity markets were in 2010, the problem for most public plans and private plans was their liabilities because of rates being lower in most cases, if not all cases, the deficits for many of these plans were actually increased because liabilities change more than even the nice asset growth that some of these plants experienced. And so needs for solution-based relationships is becoming more and more a necessity and having the breadth and the depth that BlackRock has is very important. 
Let me just touch on as we reflect in 2010, our merger integration, largely completed. We spent a great deal of time in the early part of the year in terms of evolving our culture, which is still a multiyear project that I think we've done a great job in that. In June, we refined our organizational structure, our governance model. And after we announced all that, I think it's no surprise to the leadership of BlackRock that's when we begin to see more and more momentum as you reflect backwards. And looking at our business opportunities we saw in the third quarter and most questionably the business opportunities we saw in the fourth quarter going into 2011, it has much to do with the enormity of restructuring the platform, of tackling the integration of our two great firms into one, building a strong unified culture worldwide, building that one BlackRock brand and culture. I think so much of that is behind us, and we're starting to see that in so many ways obviously, including in terms of our business momentum. 
I need to put a caveat on that. We still have one more year left in terms of technology integration. We still have many redundancies because we are still operating in many cases in multiple platforms. We are on track to finishing the technology integration by end of this year. So we feel very strong about the opportunities we have related out in 2012 in terms of margins, but we still have many more milestones this year to accomplish and making sure that the full integration in terms of our technology, our infrastructure is complete. And I would like to also say this remains to be a burden. We just completed an employee survey where our employees still want to have more connection and until we have the technology conversion completed, having as much connection, multi-product connection across products, across regions is still not where we want it to take it. And so the employees are listening. This is going to be a big milestone as we finish our technology conversion, and we'll have much greater connectivity amongst all our businesses and regions when we do that.
One other thing I'd like to talk about because it's been an irritant to say the least and that is how so many of our competitors possibly some publications have talked about turnover at BlackRock over 2010. And I want to say change has been great. We are a far better firm today than we were six months ago and most importantly, a year ago. The team in place is as powerful as any team we've ever had. We are very excited about the leadership teams. We are very excited about our product teams, our portfolio teams. And I do believe those changes has been predominantly very strong changes. 
I'd like to add one other thing that most people don't focus on. What differentiated BlackRock when we did the Merrill Lynch merger and certainly what's differentiating BlackRock with our BGI merger is we do not do mergers for massive cost take outs, although we've had huge margin increases from the pro forma of last year, we actually added over 1,000 employees this past year on top of the merger. So we are not a firm in which we are looking to do a dramatic downsizing of people for accretion purposes. I look backwards and talking about the merger for revenue opportunities. And if you go back and reflect that where we thought we were going to be when we announced the merger in June '09 to where we ended up, when we talked about we thought we could earn in 2010, we exceeded our expectations in the entire market in terms of revenues, in terms of net income. On top of hiring another 1,000 employees to build the platform. And so I just want to address change has been very positive. We've added many people. Overall, as a firm, we had about 6% turnover, which is below industry statistics, and so this is a very important issue that finally I wanted to be public about, but it's very hard to do that when the articles are trying to hurt us, not help us.
I would like to talk about branding for a minute. Branding will continue to be a major priority as we expect a larger segment of revenues will be generated from our U.S. and international Mutual Fund business and our iShare business. So we believe our mix of business as our platform grows as our brand recognition continues to grow will be from the retail and iShares platforms worldwide. And we need to continue to build out that brand and that brand recognition. And importantly, as we continue to build out our platform in Defined Contribution, it is very important in that space too, in that theoretical institutional space that we drive our brand, and this will be a very big priority for us. 
And just touching briefly on our flows in retail. I just would like to highlight a few things. Our U.S. Mutual Fund business grew by $25 billion last year. Our international Mutual Fund business grew by $6.3 billion. Our iShares business grew by $43 billion. Our retail platform and iShares grew by $74 billion last year. I don't think we get enough attention about the power of our global platform in this space, and I want to congratulate all our teams, our iShares team and our global retail, global mutual fund teams worldwide in having an extraordinary performance. 
Let me just highlight a few things about iShares. Our business in Asia-Pacific grew by 33%. Our business in EMEA grew by 16%. Our U.S. business grew by 7%. So this is a Global business. This will continue to grow. We are emphasizing this business worldwide. We believe we have the leadership position. We will continue to have the leadership position, and we expect still very robust competition and some of it, in some cases, our competition's going to beat us. In many cases, we're going to beat our competition. The ETF business will continue to be a strong growth business worldwide, and we believe, especially if the SEC changes the model of the FA business and the investment counselor business to a fiduciary model, it's going to have dramatic impact on the ETF business. It may put a drag on some mutual fund business, but I believe BlackRock will be very protected, and BlackRock will be more than enough differentiated even if the model change happens with the distribution channels.
So let me just talk about some of our equity and fixed income and alternative products. We are seeing clients rerisk. I would like to just note that we, as a firm, have been more right than most firms in the prognostication of where the markets were going to go in 2010. We never believed in the ""new normal."" We were always caught talking about a market, a U.S. economy growing three-plus. It did. We were positioned for that, and we have very strong performance in many of our equity products. Our equity dividend product as more and more people are looking to buy equity dividend products, as fixed income rates are still low. Global Opportunities, Dennis Stattman and his team, that crossed the $75 billion mark. We are confident the team is ready for a bigger and larger future. 
Our European equity team has gone from strength to strength, bringing in the lion's share of flows internationally in Europe in terms of the equity mutual fund space and our U.K. team's across the board had a lights out year. Our fixed income team had a great year and performance with over 75% of our products outperforming their benchmark. We're seeing strong flows in credit. We had to go anywhere, do anything, mutual fund that we launched mid-last year. It's over $1.2 billion and growing very rapidly with extraordinary good performance but I think we are the single number one performer in that fixed income category.
And also I would just like to highlight our strong performance in fixed income, our strong performance in equities created good performance fees. So once again, there is a linkage between performance and performance fees, and performance fees are just a great indication of performance. Second of all, our alternative products where we continue to grow our fixed income alternative products, our equity performance products, our Global Allocation products, global really extraordinary years and we continue to start seeing some real good flows into all those products. 
Let me just highlight BlackRock Solutions, which I cited in the third quarter as a business that is continue to grow. We announced in the fourth quarter we had 20 new assignments. Actually, that's a record for any quarter. It has been highlighted by our recently announced engagement by the Central Bank of Ireland. This actually is the biggest assignment that we've ever received from any government. This is bigger than AIG with the Federal Reserve. This is bigger than we did with the Bear Stearns. This is a gigantic assignment. We have teams in Dublin. It is a validation more than ever before that our product, our BlackRock Solutions space is world-class, and we are in conversations with other governments with other opportunities right now and helping them navigate the credit crisis and the crisis that we are seeing in the sovereign credit world of Europe.
One highlight that I'd like to note also is a major milestone for Aladdin. We crossed the $10 trillion mark in terms of assets that we're analyzing. So if you add the $3.5 trillion of assets that we manage on behalf of clients and the $10 trillion of assets that we are advising on risk management, it is a $13.5 trillion platform.
And we spoke about flows. Our pipeline is a good indication of where we believe our business is going. I'm very pleased with the mix of business going forward and the types of flows that we're seeing with the large preponderance of elongated flows. We continue to believe short range will reign low and so we're going to have a messy and mixed flows in cash. But one day, rates will go higher. I'm not suggesting any time soon and that business will become even more robust.
So let me just talk about margins real quickly. Ann Marie mentioned margins of 40.7 in the fourth quarter. This is something that we talked about over the last few quarters and especially in terms of our equity roadshow that we expected never to expense all data that our shareholders going to benefit as Beta increases in terms of our margins. We show that in our margins, we show that in our comp ratios, which I believe is a huge differentiator versus so many financial institutions that have top ratios way in excess of 40%. 
We are trying to differentiate ourselves on that component too. Regulatory reform is still in front of us. The Federal Reserve will have commentary periods related to systemically important institutions. It may encompass us. It may not encompass us. Whether we are determined a systemically important institution will not change our business model. We are at this moment, still one of the most regulated investment managers in the world by being regulated by the OCC, by the Federal Reserve, by the SEC, by the FSA. So whether we are designated as a systemically important institution or not does not change our business model, does not change our business mix, does not change who and what we are. However, I look forward to if the regulators determine BlackRock and other investment firms should be considered systemically important, we believe that's what we need to do in our financial system, we welcome it. So it's something that we'll see over the next quarter. And so I just wanted to highlight that because that will be something that will probably be in the marketplace over the next quarter.
Lastly, we remain constructive on equity markets. We believe confidence is growing. We believe people or CEOs are beginning to spend their huge backlog of cash. We need to see over the course of the first two quarters if that spend is in the form of hiring, if that spend is in the form of factories and plants and not in the form of stock repurchases and not in the form of mergers or investing outside the United States. Those are going to be important validators in terms of looking at our economy for 2011. We do believe Europe remains to be an area that's going to be in the news as Europe tries to manage their banks and the sovereign credit issue, which I do believe is totally linked as we saw in Ireland, and I believe it'll be linked in other countries too. 
BlackRock's in a great position to take advantage of the changes in the marketplace. We are in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities on the global basis, and I welcome, in a very positive way, 2011. I want to thank all the employees for all the hard work. It is 2010 looking backwards was a really difficult year and yet the hard work and the perseverance and the teamwork really translated into a really phenomenal quarter, a phenomenal year and a great momentum into 2011. 
Let me open it up for questions."

It's not just where equity markets are going and other products as a function of where will be their liabilities at the end of the year in terms of where average 10-year corporate rate is. So there is a bias worldwide. These clients, in my mind, are overweighted in fixed income, overweighted in cash and in many cases, clients have an systematically under invested in equity like products. I believe there is greater and greater comfort clients are going to start rerisking. But that rerisking could be in the form of some type of multi-asset class strategy that encompasses some data, some alternatives. It may encompass utilization of maybe some of our global iShares product and it may be some hedge fund products, and it may be a combination of all that overlaying our Solutions and Aladdin products.

I don't think clients are necessarily confused as much as -- it's not just the asset side they're struggling with. They're also struggling with are they getting funding from their corporation? Are they getting funding from their state? How much is there a drawdown? So one of our clients we finally saw earlier this week. They have a 12% or 13% increase in their plan, but their state did not fund them. And because of demographics, they had more outflows than they had in terms of performance and participant contribution. So the corporate actually shrunk.

These are serious issues, and so I think it's going to be very individualistic depending on the issue related to their funding sources as to how they are going to restructure their balance sheet, their assets. So it's not just uncertainty around the global confident market, it is also the uncertainty around their funding sources."

This morning, we are reporting record as adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $3.42 and record full year earnings of $10.94. I'd also like to welcome to the call our new shareholders. In December, Bank of America and PNC sold about 59 million shares or about 30% of our total shares outstanding into market. As a result of that transaction, now over 50% of our shares are owned by shareholders other than our three strategic investors.
Looking at our results, we had strong results. They reflect strong product performance, as well as strong markets. We're beginning 2011 with the merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us. Just a comment on that noise a little bit more, we do have $14 billion of merger-related outflows still sitting in the pipeline. The majority of those were in the prior pipeline. So what is reflected is more the timing of the withdrawals rather than the pipeline containing a lot of new notification. We still have a handful of clients with known concentrations concerns. If those materialized, we'll call it out when they happen. 
But it's important to note of the concentration issues, those outflows have been at very low single-digit basis point, so have not had a material effect on revenue. With respect to our quantitative product, the performance on the scientific asset equity products have turned positive and competitive since Ken Kroner [ph] took over the leadership of that product. It'll take some time to fully repair the medium and longer-term track records. So it'll just be noise we have to watch there as we repair that track records. 
The total pipeline stands at $73 billion. That includes $61 billion in long-dated assets and that is net of the merger-related item. The rest of my remarks I'm going to walk through the supplemental slides. And I'll be talking that as adjusted earnings. If you move to Slide 1, operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $962 million. That's up 31% compared to the third quarter. Net income was $670 million, and EPS was $3.42. Both of those are up 25% compared to the third quarter.
Moving on to the full year, operating earnings of $3,167,000,000 and net income of $2.1 billion were both more than doubly 2009. EPS of $10.94 was up 53% compared to 2009. And if we look at the 2009 results and if the BGI transaction had taken place on January 1 and so on comparing them to pro forma results, our operating earnings were up 22%, and the net income was up 37%.
Moving on to the third slide and taking a look at our operating margin. The full year operating margin came in at 39.3%. That's up 1.1 points compared to a year ago. It's up 2.5 points compared to the pro forma 2009 results. The fourth quarter margin came in at 40.7%. That does reflect both the strong performance fees in the quarter, as well as the benefits of market flowing through and to our margin. Not showing on the page are compensation to revenue ratio came in at 34.8%. This is the low end of the range of what we've been running for the last several years with the money in the 35% zone. It is down almost a half a point from our 2009 margin and really is consistent with our focus of really the benefit of Beta flowing through to our shareholder. 
As we begin 2011, we were very confident in the ability to grow the top line as well as our confidence in our margins. We plan to continue to speak efficiencies in our business and to realize the benefits of scale. At the same time, we plan to invest in growth opportunities. We've got a lot of strength the roadshow gave us the opportunity to get out and dialogue with our shareholders about the external environment and how our capabilities lined up with that environment to be able to really service our clients. With that, we are confident in our ability to grow iShares and retail platforms, Defined Contribution platforms, BlackRock Solutions, Asia, multi-asset class strategies and alternatives. 
On the next slide I'll talk about markets, which are also contributing to growth in margins. So moving on to Slide 4, you can see that our 2010 markets were up about 20% compared to average 2009 markets, 2010 year-end market actually were close the year about 10% higher than the average 2010 market. That means we've got positive tailwind coming into 2011, and that's before considering the positive markets we've seen so far in January.
Moving on to Slide 5. Our total earnings of $3.42 were composed of operating earnings of $3.35 and non-operating earnings of $0.07. The operating earnings improved $0.74 compared to the third quarter. The non-operating earnings included $45 million of positive mark on our co and seed investment portfolio. The level of those positive marks, however, was a little bit lower than the level of positive marks we've had in the third quarter. 
The full year as adjusted tax rate came in at 33%. That is down from the third quarter year-to-date tax rate of 33.5%. The half a point decrease in the tax rate reflects some international tax benefit associated with the late December extension of U.S. legislation, which had been due to expire. The half point benefit resulted in about an $0.08 improvement in earnings compared to what we have had the 33.5% tax rate. We do expect the bulk of these benefits to carry into 2011. All other things being equal, we have the same mix of earnings, no other tax legislation changes, no big news on tax resolution. The 2011 tax rate will be likely a little bit higher than 2010 to in the same range.
Moving on to Slide 6. Total revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion. That was up 19% or $400 million from the third quarter. Important part of the increase came from performance fees, which were up $212 million from the third quarter. As with the stock, the fourth quarter is our primary quarter for loss even comparing to the fourth quarter of 2009, performance fees are still up $73 million, reflecting improving performance across a number of our funds. 
The absolute level of performance fees was $326 million and included a $128 million of fees really associated with relative performance, as well as $188 million of fees that we earned on our alternative products, reflecting strong absolute performance in those products, and that does include our really large hedge fund GMSP. I'll remind everyone that we have very few funds that have performance fee measurements in the first quarter.
I'm going to talk about base fees later, so I just mentioned briefly on the BRS revenues that came in at $132 million for the quarter. The increase of $32 million from the prior quarter reflects the completion of 20 advisory assignments. We've got a lot of active interest in our BlackRock Solutions, the strongest interest that we've ever seen. We do have some interesting things in the pipeline, including the publicly noted assignment from the Central Bank of Ireland.
Moving on to Slide 7, which outlines our expenses. Expenses of $1.5 billion for the quarter were up 9% or $176 million from the third quarter. Just when we put that in the context of those revenue increase of 19% and that even with expense increases we saw those improvements in margins that I talked about earlier. Now about $80 million of the expense increase related to AUM revenues, the biggest single component there related to incentive comp, which closely links to revenue of course. We also had $96 million of increases in G&A expense. We did in the fourth quarter make a $20 million contribution to a charitable fund account for the first time. That's something we'd like to continue to do over time. 
Also in the fourth quarter, there was a one time assessment to the U.K. asset management industry, our share of which was about $20 million. We did see some increases in marketing of about $17 million and professional fees of about $13 million, and the rest of the expenses are small movements across many items.
Moving on to base fees on Slide #8. Base fees came in at $1.951 billion. That was up 9% compared to the third quarter. We saw improved revenues across all of our long-dated asset classes and was in part driven by favorable markets. I would note that of our merger-related outflows, there was one outflow of $24 billion that was out about a half a basis point, so it had very little effect on revenue. Whereas our $28 billion in net new long-dated assets came in at closer to our average basis point realization across our whole portfolio, so it contributed positively to revenue. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and non-operating results. Non-operating results came in at $20 million. That is $45 million of investment gains on our co and seed that I mentioned earlier. Those were gains across all asset classes in the portfolio, offset partially by $25 million of interest expense on our debt that we put on associated with the BGI acquisition. The investment portfolio stands at about $1 billion. It's largely consistent with the third quarter. And just to remind everyone, we do not do any proprietary vesting. Those are all co and seed investment to be aligned with our clients. 
Moving on to Slide 10, we generate substantial cash flow. We used about $1 billion of our 2010 cash flow to repay short-term debt. In addition, we returned a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our dividend represented about a 38% payout of our earnings. In addition, we repurchased about 900 million shares. That brought our total payout to about 44%. We still have 4.2 million shares of authorization for repurchase. However, we've sort of paused for a little while, at least for now, on those repurchases since the sale by Bank of America and PNC. The reason it was paused is we believe that we now meet all of the eligibility criteria to be included in the S&P 500 index. We think an important criterion within that is the degree of public flow, and we've just been protecting that public flow is an important priority at this point in time. I just say we do always and regularly discuss our dividend policy with our board, and you can see our history of dividend across that slide.
With that, I'd just like to conclude that 2010 ended up with a very strong year. We're entering 2011 with again, those merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us and with strong momentum just both in terms of new business and markets.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And it is scheduled, again, for us to work with our board to come up with a 2011 dividend policy. And so that's one of the opportunities we have going forward in 2011.
First of all, let me welcome everybody. I need to apologize in advance. I may have a fit of coughing since I'm in the back end of a cold. It is no indication of my views of the future. So let me just begin and talk about Alpha. Our performance across most of our products were strong. Throughout our integration process, we needed to be assured that we're protecting our portfolio managers from the integration process. We needed to make sure our clients understood that, that our business with them is not going to change, that we are going to make first and foremost, our manufacturing platform or portfolio team to be uninvolved in all the issues around integration, and I think 2010, looking now backwards, was a success. 
Our teams had very strong performance across our equity, our fixed income and our alternatives product area. I do believe that performance now will continue to drive business in 2011. And most importantly, good performance drives good performance fees. And I think some of the messaging that we said in the past few quarters, the importance of good performance, the importance of alternative products truly is now starting to become more apparent in our earnings related to these phenomenon. 
I would like to go back to early '06 and parts of '07 where we had as much as 30% of our earnings being driven by performance fees. And obviously, the market setbacks of '08 changed all that. I'm not suggesting our earnings model will ever have that type of strength. But I do believe as clients begin to rerisk, and clients are looking to move from Beta products or even core fixed income products to other products, they're going to entail products that may have some form of performance-oriented fees. And with that, we are going to have hopefully large-based performance fees. So we look at this as a great indication of our evolution of our platform. We believe our success in performance fees in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter indicative of that performance and the repositioning of our firm, and it is our strongest intention in 2011 to continue to build out our alternative space, to continue to be working with our clients as our clients are driving more risk positions whether that may be in emerging market product or it may be just a credit product, clients are looking to move away from core fixed income strategies and are looking to move away from some Beta strategies. And I'll get into that a little later, but I think it's important to really focus on that and once again, remind everyone we are going to make this a continuation of our focus for 2011 to continue to build out these alternative products.
Let me also reflect on another component of our business, and that is scale. I think now looking backwards, we are now showing the investment world that scale is a virtue. It is a positive. We, obviously, have a much negative noise related to concentration issues. As Ann Marie suggested, it is largely behind us, moving away from low-fee products into other types of products where we have greater ability to navigate with our client base. 
But most importantly, with our scale and as Ann Marie talked about our free cash flow, no investment firm is investing as much dollars as we are to build a bigger, stronger, more robust platform in which we could provide stronger base Alpha products for our clients and more solution-based relationship with our clients. And so some of the areas that we're really investing in, we're continuing to invest in our investment products, which we'll talk about a little later. We're expanding our platforms regionally in Asia and South America. We're continuing to build out in Europe. 
We talked about over the last few quarters the building out of our trading platform, which we believe will have huge benefits for our clients and already are built out of our capital market capabilities to win large assignments directly from issuers is very positive for us in terms of building out Alpha for our clients. 
I should also state very loud and clear as we build out these trading platforms and as we build out our capital markets capabilities, this is to enhance our connectivity with our clients. This is to find ways to get more product at higher net spreads to our investors. Our business model is not changing. 100% of our revenues will be client-centric business, and so we're building out this platform because we believe scale will be a virtue, and we believe throughout 2011, that will continue to differentiate us. 
And in scale, most importantly, we're building out our global footprint to provide more consistent and more varied Alpha and solution-based products. So over the course of 2011, we have a strong emphasis in building our products in Asia, both credit and in equities, emerging market equities. As I said earlier, we continue to build out our alternative products, and we believe that will be one of the drivers for us in 2012 and 2013. 
We continue to believe we are differentiated by our multi-asset class products, our BMAX products. Yesterday, we announced we hired Nancy Everett, who was a CEO of Promark, which was the General Motors pension plan. And prior to that, she was the Head of the Virginia retirement plan. She will be running our U.S. Fiduciary business, a part of this multi-asset category platform. And so we believe this will continue to be an area where we invest. 
Another area of real growth for us in 2010 that is already been validated in our pipeline and wins already and that's the defined contribution area where we believe more and more money will be moving away from defined benefits and defined contributions. I do believe over the course of 2011, as state, governments starting to tackle their tremendous deficit burdens, one of the outcomes will be most probably restructuring of their plans for new employees that will be predominantly Defined Contribution plans. And so we believe DC will become a larger and larger driver. 
We also believe because of the retrenchment of cost, many more public plans, maybe the smaller ones, will be looking to do more fiduciary outsourcing, which is why we have Nancy here. So we do believe there's going to be quite a bit of change as a result of public plans, public state plans, need to restructure because of the tremendous state burdens with their deficits. And we hope to be taking advantage at because of our scale, because of our multi-asset class product and capabilities, because of our Beta capabilities and our Alpha capabilities.
And so our theme for 2011 continues to be Alpha generation. But Alpha generated connected with a solution-based relationship with our clients as more and more clients are going to be looking for help. As good as the equity markets were in 2010, the problem for most public plans and private plans was their liabilities because of rates being lower in most cases, if not all cases, the deficits for many of these plans were actually increased because liabilities change more than even the nice asset growth that so many plans experienced. And so needs for solution-based relationships is becoming more and more a necessity and having the breadth and the depth that BlackRock has is very important. 
Let me just touch on as we reflect in 2010, the merger integration largely completed. We spent a great deal of time in the early part of the year in terms of evolving our culture, which is still a multiyear project that I think we've done a great job in that. 
In June, we refined our organizational structure, our governance model. And after we announced all that, I think it's no surprise to the leadership of BlackRock that's when we begin to see more and more momentum as you reflect backwards. And looking at our business opportunities, we saw in the third quarter and most questionably the business opportunities we saw in the fourth quarter going into 2011, it has much to do with the enormity of restructuring the platform, of tackling the integration of our two great firms into one, building a strong unified culture worldwide, building that one BlackRock brand and culture. I think so much of that is behind us, and we're starting to see that in so many ways obviously, including in terms of our business momentum. 
I need to put a caveat on. We still have one more year left in terms of technology integration. We still have many redundancies because we are still operating in many cases in multiple platforms. We are on track to finishing the technology integration by end of this year. So we feel very strong about the opportunities we have related out in 2012 in terms of margins, but we still have many more milestones this year to accomplish and making sure that the full integration in terms of our technology, our infrastructure is complete. And I would like to also say this remains to be a burden. 
We just completed an employee survey where our employees still want to have more connection and until we have the technology conversion completed, having as much connection, multi-product connection across products, across regions is still not where we want it to take it. And so the employees are listening. This is going to be a big milestone as we finish our technology conversion, and we'll have much greater connectivity amongst all our businesses and regions when we do that.
One other thing I'd like to talk about because it's been an irritant to say the least and that is how so many of our competitors possibly some publications have talked about turnover at BlackRock over 2010, and I want to say change has been great. We are a far better firm today than we were six months ago and most importantly, a year ago. The team in place is as powerful as any team we've ever had. We are very excited about the leadership teams. We are very excited about our product teams, our portfolio teams. And I do believe those changes has been predominantly very strong changes. 
I'd like to add one other thing that most people don't focus on. What differentiated BlackRock when we did the Merrill Lynch merger and certainly what's differentiating BlackRock with our BGI merger is we do not do mergers for massive cost take outs, although we've had huge margin increases from the pro forma of last year, we actually added over 1,000 employees this past year on top of the merger. So we are not a firm in which we are looking to do a dramatic downsizing of people for accretion purposes. I look backwards and talking about the merger for revenue opportunities. And if you go back and reflect that where we thought we were going to be when we announced the merger in June '09 to where we ended up, when we talked about what we thought we could earn in 2010, we exceeded our expectations in the entire market in terms of revenues, in terms of net income. On top of hiring another 1,000 employees to build the platform. And so I just want to address change has been very positive. We've added many people. Overall, as a firm, we had about 6% turnover, which is below industry statistics, and so this is a very important issue that finally I wanted to be public about, but it's very hard to do that when the articles are trying to hurt us, not help us.
I would like to talk about branding for a minute. Branding will continue to be a major priority as we expect a larger segment of revenues will be generated from our U.S. and international Mutual Fund business and our iShare business. So we believe our mix of business as our platform grows, as our brand recognition continues to grow, will be from the retail and iShares platforms worldwide. And we need to continue to build out that brand and that brand recognition. And importantly, as we continue to build out our platform in Defined Contribution, it is very important in that space too, in that theoretical institutional space that we drive our brand, and this will be a very big priority for us. 
And just touching briefly on our flows in retail. I just would like to highlight a few things. Our U.S. Mutual Fund business grew by $25 billion last year. Our international Mutual Fund business grew by $6.3 billion. Our iShares business grew by $43 billion. Our retail platform and iShares grew by $74 billion last year. I don't think we get enough attention about the power of our global platform in this space, and I want to congratulate all our teams, our iShares team and our global retail, global mutual fund teams worldwide in having an extraordinary performance. 
Let me just highlight a few things about iShares. Our business in Asia-Pacific grew by 33%. Our business in EMEA grew by 16%. Our U.S. business grew by 7%. So this is a Global business. This will continue to grow. We are emphasizing this business worldwide. We believe we have the leadership position. We will continue to have the leadership position, and we expect still very robust competition and some of it, in some cases, our competition's going to beat us. In many cases, we're going to beat our competition. The ETF business will continue to be a strong growth business worldwide, and we believe, especially if the SEC changes the model of the FA business and the Investment Counselor business to a fiduciary model, it's going to have dramatic impact on the ETF business. It may put a drag on some Mutual Fund business, but I believe BlackRock will be very protected, and BlackRock will be more than enough differentiated even if the model change happens with the distribution channels.
So let me just talk about some of our equity and fixed income and alternative products. We are seeing clients rerisk. I would like to just note that we, as a firm, have been more right than most firms in the prognostication of where the markets were going to go in 2010. We never believed in the ""new normal."" We were always caught talking about a market, a U.S. economy growing three-plus. It did. We were positioned for that, and we have very strong performance in many of our equity products. Our equity dividend product as more and more people are looking to buy equity dividend products, as fixed income rates are still low. Global Opportunities, Dennis Stattman and his team, that crossed the $75 billion mark. We are confident the team is ready for a bigger and larger future. 
Our European equity team has gone from strength to strength, bringing in the lion's share of flows internationally in Europe in terms of in the equity mutual fund space and our U.K. team's across the board had a lights out year. Our fixed income team had a great year and performance with over 75% of our products outperforming their benchmark. We're seeing strong flows in credit. We had to go anywhere, do anything, mutual fund that we launched mid-last year. It's over $1.2 billion and growing very rapidly with extraordinary good performance but I think we are the single number one performer in that fixed income category.
And also I would just like to highlight our strong performance in fixed income, our strong performance in equities created good performance fees. So once again, there is a linkage between performance and performance fees, and performance fees are just a great indication of performance. Second of all, our alternative products where we continue to grow our fixed income alternative products, our equity performance products, our Global Allocation products, global really extraordinary years and we continue to start seeing some real good flows into all those products. 
Let me just highlight BlackRock Solutions, which I cited in the third quarter as a business that is continue to grow. We announced in the fourth quarter we had 20 new assignments. I think that's a record for any quarter. It has been highlighted by our recently announced engagement by the Central Bank of Ireland. This actually is the biggest assignment that we've ever received from any government. This is bigger than AIG, with the Federal Reserve. This is bigger than we did with the Bear Stearns. This is a gigantic assignment. We have teams in Dublin. It is a validation more than ever before that our product, our BlackRock Solutions space is world-class, and we are in conversations with other governments with other opportunities right now and helping them navigate the credit crisis and the crisis that we are seeing in the sovereign credit world of Europe.
One highlight that I'd like to note also is a major milestone for Aladdin. We crossed the $10 trillion mark in terms of assets that we're analyzing. So if you add the $3.5 trillion of assets that we manage on behalf of clients and the $10 trillion of assets that we are advising on risk management, it is a $13.5 trillion platform.
And we spoke about flows. Our pipeline is a good indication of where we believe our business is going. I'm very pleased with the mix of business going forward and the types of flows that we're seeing with the large preponderance of elongated flows. We continue to believe short range will reign low and so we're going to have a messy and mixed flows in cash. But one day, rates will go higher. I'm not suggesting any time soon and that business will become even more robust.
So let me just talk about margins real quickly. Ann Marie mentioned margins of 40.7 in the fourth quarter. This is something that we talked about over the last few quarters and especially in terms of our equity roadshow that we expected never to expense all Beta that our shareholders are going to benefit as Beta increases in terms of our margins. We showed that in our margins, we showed that in our comp ratios, which I believe is a huge differentiator versus so many financial institutions that have top ratios way in excess of 40%.  We are trying to differentiate ourselves on that component too. 
Regulatory reform is still in front of us. The Federal Reserve will have commentary periods related to systemically important institutions. It may encompass us. It may not encompass us. Whether we are determined a systemically important institution will not change our business model. We are at this moment, still one of the most regulated investment managers in the world by being regulated by the OCC, by the Federal Reserve, by the SEC, by the FSA. So whether we are designated as a systemically important institution or not does not change our business model, does not change our business mix, does not change who and what we are. However, I look forward to if the regulators determine BlackRock and other investment firms should be considered systemically important, we believe that's what we need to do in our financial system, we welcome it. So it's something that we'll see over the next quarter. And so I just wanted to highlight that because that will be something that will probably be in the marketplace over the next quarter.
Lastly, we remain constructive on equity markets. We believe confidence is growing. We believe people or CEOs are beginning to spend their huge backlog of cash. We need to see over the course of the first two quarters if that spend is in the form of hiring, if that spend is in the form of factories and plants and not in the form of stock repurchases and not in the form of mergers or investing outside the United States. Those are going to be important validators in terms of looking at our economy for 2011. We do believe Europe remains to be an area that's going to be in the news as Europe tries to manage their banks and the sovereign credit issue, which I do believe is totally linked as we saw in Ireland, and I believe it'll be linked in other countries too. 
BlackRock's in a great position to take advantage of the changes in the marketplace. We are in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities on the global basis, and I welcome, in a very positive way, 2011. I want to thank all the employees for all the hard work. It is 2010 looking backwards was a really difficult year and yet the hard work and the perseverance and the teamwork really translated into a really phenomenal quarter, a phenomenal year and a great momentum into 2011.

We need to see the competitive pressure related to comp and employment and keeping people. So margins to me are a function that we need to pay attention to obviously, and we do believe there is upward bias to our margin, but I need to look at it in a complete way related to compensation and connecting that with our need for investing, investing in Asia, investing in other areas.

There is no question clients -- the real issue is where will interest rates be in 12 months. That's going to be an important component as to how clients think about rerisking. With rates being this low, clients and with where liabilities are that's why where interest rates are, that changes their liability, it changes their forecasting in terms of how much rerisking are they going to do, and so I think it's pretty complex to understand it. It's not just where equity markets are going and other products as a function of where will be their liabilities at the end of the year in terms of where average 10-year corporate rate is. So there is a bias worldwide. These clients, in my mind, are overweighted in fixed income, overweighted in cash and in many cases, clients have a systematically under invested in equity like products. I believe there is greater and greater comfort clients are going to start rerisking. But that rerisking could be in the form of some type of multi-asset class strategy that encompasses some Beta but some alternatives. It may encompass utilization of maybe some of our global iShares product and it may be some hedge fund products, and it may be a combination of all that overlaying our Solutions and Aladdin products. So I don't think there's one strategy, and I don't think there's one solution. It really is a function of each client risk needs versus their liabilities."

We still believe credit is going to be a good place to be. We actually love mortgages at this level. And so there's many opportunities to make, better returns in treasuries, in fixed income. So whether -- so it really is a function of how much capabilities these institutions have in rerisking. Some rerisking maybe just moving from treasuries to credit. Some of them may be moving from maybe Beta strategies to more fundamental active strategies, and many of them will be a combination of all of that plus probably a greater investing in alternatives and more investing outside the United States."

We're doing a number of roadshows, seeing our U.S. clients and trying to talk to them. I saw our largest institutional state plan last week. And as they think about what they're planning to do in 2011 later this week, I'm seeing two of the largest state plans. Again, we're trying to get in front of our clients. I'm spending more time with our institutional clients here in the states to find out what they're trying to do. I don't think clients are necessarily confused as much as -- it's not just the asset side they're struggling with. They're also struggling with are they getting funding from their corporation? Are they getting funding from their state? How much is there a drawdown? So one of our clients we finally saw earlier this week. They have a 12% or 13% increase in their plan, but their state did not fund them. And because of demographics, they had more outflows than they had in terms of performance and participant contribution. So the corporate actually shrunk. And so this is the dilemma that we think we're going to see more and more of. This is one of the reasons why these plans are going to have to say should we be rerisking now or should we -- how do we address this issue of a depleting corpos. These are serious issues, and so I think it's going to be very individualistic depending on the issue related to their funding sources as to how they are going to restructure their balance sheet, their assets. So it's not just uncertainty around the global confident market, it is also the uncertainty around their funding sources."

This morning, we are reporting record as adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $3.42 and record full year earnings of $10.94. I'd also like to welcome to the call our new shareholders. In December, Bank of America and PNC sold about",1808,"Good morning, everyone. This morning, we are reporting record as adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $3.42 and record full year earnings of $10.94. I'd also like to welcome to the call our new shareholders. In December, Bank of America and PNC sold about 59 million shares or about 30% of our total shares outstanding into market. As a result of that transaction, now over 50% of our shares are owned by shareholders other than our three strategic investors.
Looking at our results, we had strong results. They reflect strong product performance, as well as strong markets. We're beginning 2011 with the merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us. Just a comment on that noise a little bit more, we do have $14 billion of merger-related outflows still sitting in the pipeline. The majority of those were in the prior pipeline. So what is reflected is more the timing of the withdrawals rather than the pipeline containing a lot of new notification. We still have a handful of clients with known concentrations concerns. If those materialized, we'll call it out when they happen. 
But it's important to note of the concentration issues, those outflows have been at very low single-digit basis point, so have not had a material effect on revenue. With respect to our quantitative product, the performance on the scientific asset equity products have turned positive and competitive since Ken Kroner [ph] took over the leadership of that product. It'll take some time to fully repair the medium and longer-term track records. So it'll just be noise we have to watch there as we repair that track records. 
The total pipeline stands at $73 billion. That includes $61 billion in long-dated assets and that is net of the merger-related item. The rest of my remarks I'm going to walk through the supplemental slides. And I'll be talking that as adjusted earnings. If you move to Slide 1, operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $962 million. That's up 31% compared to the third quarter. Net income was $670 million, and EPS was $3.42. Both of those are up 25% compared to the third quarter.
Moving on to the full year, operating earnings of $3,167,000,000 and net income of $2.1 billion were both more than doubly 2009. EPS of $10.94 was up 53% compared to 2009. And if we look at the 2009 results and if the BGI transaction had taken place on January 1 and so on comparing them to pro forma results, our operating earnings were up 22%, and the net income was up 37%.
Moving on to the third slide and taking a look at our operating margin. The full year operating margin came in at 39.3%. That's up 1.1 points compared to a year ago. It's up 2.5 points compared to the pro forma 2009 results. The fourth quarter margin came in at 40.7%. That does reflect both the strong performance fees in the quarter, as well as the benefits of market flowing through and to our margin. Not showing on the page are compensation to revenue ratio came in at 34.8%. This is the low end of the range of what we've been running for the last several years with the money in the 35% zone. It is down almost a half a point from our 2009 margin and really is consistent with our focus of really the benefit of Beta flowing through to our shareholder. 
As we begin 2011, we were very confident in the ability to grow the top line as well as our confidence in our margins. We plan to continue to speak efficiencies in our business and to realize the benefits of scale. At the same time, we plan to invest in growth opportunities. We've got a lot of strength the roadshow gave us the opportunity to get out and dialogue with our shareholders about the external environment and how our capabilities lined up with that environment to be able to really service our clients. With that, we are confident in our ability to grow iShares and retail platforms, Defined Contribution platforms, BlackRock Solutions, Asia, multi-asset class strategies and alternatives. 
On the next slide I'll talk about markets, which are also contributing to growth in margins. So moving on to Slide 4, you can see that our 2010 markets were up about 20% compared to average 2009 markets, 2010 year-end market actually were close the year about 10% higher than the average 2010 market. That means we've got positive tailwind coming into 2011, and that's before considering the positive markets we've seen so far in January.
Moving on to Slide 5. Our total earnings of $3.42 were composed of operating earnings of $3.35 and non-operating earnings of $0.07. The operating earnings improved $0.74 compared to the third quarter. The non-operating earnings included $45 million of positive mark on our co and seed investment portfolio. The level of those positive marks, however, was a little bit lower than the level of positive marks we've had in the third quarter. 
The full year as adjusted tax rate came in at 33%. That is down from the third quarter year-to-date tax rate of 33.5%. The half a point decrease in the tax rate reflects some international tax benefit associated with the late December extension of U.S. legislation, which had been due to expire. The half point benefit resulted in about an $0.08 improvement in earnings compared to what we have had the 33.5% tax rate. We do expect the bulk of these benefits to carry into 2011. All other things being equal, we have the same mix of earnings, no other tax legislation changes, no big news on tax resolution. The 2011 tax rate will be likely a little bit higher than 2010 to in the same range.
Moving on to Slide 6. Total revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion. That was up 19% or $400 million from the third quarter. Important part of the increase came from performance fees, which were up $212 million from the third quarter. As with the stock, the fourth quarter is our primary quarter for loss even comparing to the fourth quarter of 2009, performance fees are still up $73 million, reflecting improving performance across a number of our funds. 
The absolute level of performance fees was $326 million and included a $128 million of fees really associated with relative performance, as well as $188 million of fees that we earned on our alternative products, reflecting strong absolute performance in those products, and that does include our really large hedge fund GMSP. I'll remind everyone that we have very few funds that have performance fee measurements in the first quarter.
I'm going to talk about base fees later, so I just mentioned briefly on the BRS revenues that came in at $132 million for the quarter. The increase of $32 million from the prior quarter reflects the completion of 20 advisory assignments. We've got a lot of active interest in our BlackRock Solutions, the strongest interest that we've ever seen. We do have some interesting things in the pipeline, including the publicly noted assignment from the Central Bank of Ireland.
Moving on to Slide 7, which outlines our expenses. Expenses of $1.5 billion for the quarter were up 9% or $176 million from the third quarter. Just when we put that in the context of those revenue increase of 19% and that even with expense increases we saw those improvements in margins that I talked about earlier. Now about $80 million of the expense increase related to AUM revenues, the biggest single component there related to incentive comp, which closely links to revenue of course. We also had $96 million of increases in G&A expense. We did in the fourth quarter make a $20 million contribution to a charitable fund account for the first time. That's something we'd like to continue to do over time. 
Also in the fourth quarter, there was a one time assessment to the U.K. asset management industry, our share of which was about $20 million. We did see some increases in marketing of about $17 million and professional fees of about $13 million, and the rest of the expenses are small movements across many items.
Moving on to base fees on Slide #8. Base fees came in at $1.951 billion. That was up 9% compared to the third quarter. We saw improved revenues across all of our long-dated asset classes and was in part driven by favorable markets. I would note that of our merger-related outflows, there was one outflow of $24 billion that was out about a half a basis point, so it had very little effect on revenue. Whereas our $28 billion in net new long-dated assets came in at closer to our average basis point realization across our whole portfolio, so it contributed positively to revenue. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and non-operating results. Non-operating results came in at $20 million. That is $45 million of investment gains on our co and seed that I mentioned earlier. Those were gains across all asset classes in the portfolio, offset partially by $25 million of interest expense on our debt that we put on associated with the BGI acquisition. The investment portfolio stands at about $1 billion. It's largely consistent with the third quarter. And just to remind everyone, we do not do any proprietary vesting. Those are all co and seed investment to be aligned with our clients. 
Moving on to Slide 10, we generate substantial cash flow. We used about $1 billion of our 2010 cash flow to repay short-term debt. In addition, we returned a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our dividend represented about a 38% payout of our earnings. In addition, we repurchased about 900 million shares. That brought our total payout to about 44%. We still have 4.2 million shares of authorization for repurchase. However, we've sort of paused for a little while, at least for now, on those repurchases since the sale by Bank of America and PNC. The reason it was paused is we believe that we now meet all of the eligibility criteria to be included in the S&P 500 index. We think an important criterion within that is the degree of public flow, and we've just been protecting that public flow is an important priority at this point in time. I just say we do always and regularly discuss our dividend policy with our board, and you can see our history of dividend across that slide.
With that, I'd just like to conclude that 2010 ended up with a very strong year. We're entering 2011 with again, those merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us and with strong momentum just both in terms of new business and markets.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And it is scheduled, again, for us to work with our board to come up with a 2011 dividend policy. And so that's one of the opportunities we have going forward in 2011.
First of all, let me welcome everybody. I need to apologize in advance. I may have a fit of coughing since I'm in the back end of a cold. It is no indication of my views of the future. So let me just begin and talk about Alpha. Our performance across most of our products were strong. Throughout our integration process, we needed to be assured that we're protecting our portfolio managers from the integration process. We needed to make sure our clients understood that, that our business with them is not going to change, that we are going to make first and foremost, our manufacturing platform or portfolio team to be uninvolved in all the issues around integration, and I think 2010, looking now backwards, was a success. 
Our teams had very strong performance across our equity, our fixed income and our alternatives product area. I do believe that performance now will continue to drive business in 2011. And most importantly, good performance drives good performance fees. And I think some of the messaging that we said in the past few quarters, the importance of good performance, the importance of alternative products truly is now starting to become more apparent in our earnings related to these phenomenon. 
I would like to go back to early '06 and parts of '07 where we had as much as 30% of our earnings being driven by performance fees. And obviously, the market setbacks of '08 changed all that. I'm not suggesting our earnings model will ever have that type of strength. But I do believe as clients begin to rerisk, and clients are looking to move from Beta products or even core fixed income products to other products, they're going to entail products that may have some form of performance-oriented fees. And with that, we are going to have hopefully large-based performance fees. So we look at this as a great indication of our evolution of our platform. We believe our success in performance fees in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter indicative of that performance and the repositioning of our firm, and it is our strongest intention in 2011 to continue to build out our alternative space, to continue to be working with our clients as our clients are driving more risk positions whether that may be in emerging market product or it may be just a credit product, clients are looking to move away from core fixed income strategies and are looking to move away from some Beta strategies. And I'll get into that a little later, but I think it's important to really focus on that and once again, remind everyone we are going to make this a continuation of our focus for 2011 to continue to build out these alternative products.
Let me also reflect on another component of our business, and that is scale. I think now looking backwards, we are now showing the investment world that scale is a virtue. It is a positive. We, obviously, have a much negative noise related to concentration issues. As Ann Marie suggested, it is largely behind us, moving away from low-fee products into other types of products where we have greater ability to navigate with our client base. 
But most importantly, with our scale and as Ann Marie talked about our free cash flow, no investment firm is investing as much dollars as we are to build a bigger, stronger, more robust platform in which we could provide stronger base Alpha products for our clients and more solution-based relationship with our clients. And so some of the areas that we're really investing in, we're continuing to invest in our investment products, which we'll talk about a little later. We're expanding our platforms regionally in Asia and South America. We're continuing to build out in Europe. 
We talked about over the last few quarters the building out of our trading platform, which we believe will have huge benefits for our clients and already are built out of our capital market capabilities to win large assignments directly from issuers is very positive for us in terms of building out Alpha for our clients. 
I should also state very loud and clear as we build out these trading platforms and as we build out our capital markets capabilities, this is to enhance our connectivity with our clients. This is to find ways to get more product at higher net spreads to our investors. Our business model is not changing. 100% of our revenues will be client-centric business, and so we're building out this platform because we believe scale will be a virtue, and we believe throughout 2011, that will continue to differentiate us. 
And in scale, most importantly, we're building out our global footprint to provide more consistent and more varied Alpha and solution-based products. So over the course of 2011, we have a strong emphasis in building our products in Asia, both credit and in equities, emerging market equities. As I said earlier, we continue to build out our alternative products, and we believe that will be one of the drivers for us in 2012 and 2013. 
We continue to believe we are differentiated by our multi-asset class products, our BMAX products. Yesterday, we announced we hired Nancy Everett, who was a CEO of Promark, which was the General Motors pension plan. And prior to that, she was the Head of the Virginia retirement plan. She will be running our U.S. Fiduciary business, a part of this multi-asset category platform. And so we believe this will continue to be an area where we invest. 
Another area of real growth for us in 2010 that is already been validated in our pipeline and wins already and that's the defined contribution area where we believe more and more money will be moving away from defined benefits and defined contributions. I do believe over the course of 2011, as state, governments starting to tackle their tremendous deficit burdens, one of the outcomes will be most probably restructuring of their plans for new employees that will be predominantly Defined Contribution plans. And so we believe DC will become a larger and larger driver. 
We also believe because of the retrenchment of cost, many more public plans, maybe the smaller ones, will be looking to do more fiduciary outsourcing, which is why we have Nancy here. So we do believe there's going to be quite a bit of change as a result of public plans, public state plans, need to restructure because of the tremendous state burdens with their deficits. And we hope to be taking advantage at because of our scale, because of our multi-asset class product and capabilities, because of our Beta capabilities and our Alpha capabilities.
And so our theme for 2011 continues to be Alpha generation. But Alpha generated connected with a solution-based relationship with our clients as more and more clients are going to be looking for help. As good as the equity markets were in 2010, the problem for most public plans and private plans was their liabilities because of rates being lower in most cases, if not all cases, the deficits for many of these plans were actually increased because liabilities change more than even the nice asset growth that so many plans experienced. And so needs for solution-based relationships is becoming more and more a necessity and having the breadth and the depth that BlackRock has is very important. 
Let me just touch on as we reflect in 2010, the merger integration largely completed. We spent a great deal of time in the early part of the year in terms of evolving our culture, which is still a multiyear project that I think we've done a great job in that. 
In June, we refined our organizational structure, our governance model. And after we announced all that, I think it's no surprise to the leadership of BlackRock that's when we begin to see more and more momentum as you reflect backwards. And looking at our business opportunities, we saw in the third quarter and most questionably the business opportunities we saw in the fourth quarter going into 2011, it has much to do with the enormity of restructuring the platform, of tackling the integration of our two great firms into one, building a strong unified culture worldwide, building that one BlackRock brand and culture. I think so much of that is behind us, and we're starting to see that in so many ways obviously, including in terms of our business momentum. 
I need to put a caveat on. We still have one more year left in terms of technology integration. We still have many redundancies because we are still operating in many cases in multiple platforms. We are on track to finishing the technology integration by end of this year. So we feel very strong about the opportunities we have related out in 2012 in terms of margins, but we still have many more milestones this year to accomplish and making sure that the full integration in terms of our technology, our infrastructure is complete. And I would like to also say this remains to be a burden. 
We just completed an employee survey where our employees still want to have more connection and until we have the technology conversion completed, having as much connection, multi-product connection across products, across regions is still not where we want it to take it. And so the employees are listening. This is going to be a big milestone as we finish our technology conversion, and we'll have much greater connectivity amongst all our businesses and regions when we do that.
One other thing I'd like to talk about because it's been an irritant to say the least and that is how so many of our competitors possibly some publications have talked about turnover at BlackRock over 2010, and I want to say change has been great. We are a far better firm today than we were six months ago and most importantly, a year ago. The team in place is as powerful as any team we've ever had. We are very excited about the leadership teams. We are very excited about our product teams, our portfolio teams. And I do believe those changes has been predominantly very strong changes. 
I'd like to add one other thing that most people don't focus on. What differentiated BlackRock when we did the Merrill Lynch merger and certainly what's differentiating BlackRock with our BGI merger is we do not do mergers for massive cost take outs, although we've had huge margin increases from the pro forma of last year, we actually added over 1,000 employees this past year on top of the merger. So we are not a firm in which we are looking to do a dramatic downsizing of people for accretion purposes. I look backwards and talking about the merger for revenue opportunities. And if you go back and reflect that where we thought we were going to be when we announced the merger in June '09 to where we ended up, when we talked about what we thought we could earn in 2010, we exceeded our expectations in the entire market in terms of revenues, in terms of net income. On top of hiring another 1,000 employees to build the platform. And so I just want to address change has been very positive. We've added many people. Overall, as a firm, we had about 6% turnover, which is below industry statistics, and so this is a very important issue that finally I wanted to be public about, but it's very hard to do that when the articles are trying to hurt us, not help us.
I would like to talk about branding for a minute. Branding will continue to be a major priority as we expect a larger segment of revenues will be generated from our U.S. and international Mutual Fund business and our iShare business. So we believe our mix of business as our platform grows, as our brand recognition continues to grow, will be from the retail and iShares platforms worldwide. And we need to continue to build out that brand and that brand recognition. And importantly, as we continue to build out our platform in Defined Contribution, it is very important in that space too, in that theoretical institutional space that we drive our brand, and this will be a very big priority for us. 
And just touching briefly on our flows in retail. I just would like to highlight a few things. Our U.S. Mutual Fund business grew by $25 billion last year. Our international Mutual Fund business grew by $6.3 billion. Our iShares business grew by $43 billion. Our retail platform and iShares grew by $74 billion last year. I don't think we get enough attention about the power of our global platform in this space, and I want to congratulate all our teams, our iShares team and our global retail, global mutual fund teams worldwide in having an extraordinary performance. 
Let me just highlight a few things about iShares. Our business in Asia-Pacific grew by 33%. Our business in EMEA grew by 16%. Our U.S. business grew by 7%. So this is a Global business. This will continue to grow. We are emphasizing this business worldwide. We believe we have the leadership position. We will continue to have the leadership position, and we expect still very robust competition and some of it, in some cases, our competition's going to beat us. In many cases, we're going to beat our competition. The ETF business will continue to be a strong growth business worldwide, and we believe, especially if the SEC changes the model of the FA business and the Investment Counselor business to a fiduciary model, it's going to have dramatic impact on the ETF business. It may put a drag on some Mutual Fund business, but I believe BlackRock will be very protected, and BlackRock will be more than enough differentiated even if the model change happens with the distribution channels.
So let me just talk about some of our equity and fixed income and alternative products. We are seeing clients rerisk. I would like to just note that we, as a firm, have been more right than most firms in the prognostication of where the markets were going to go in 2010. We never believed in the ""new normal."" We were always caught talking about a market, a U.S. economy growing three-plus. It did. We were positioned for that, and we have very strong performance in many of our equity products. Our equity dividend product as more and more people are looking to buy equity dividend products, as fixed income rates are still low. Global Opportunities, Dennis Stattman and his team, that crossed the $75 billion mark. We are confident the team is ready for a bigger and larger future. 
Our European equity team has gone from strength to strength, bringing in the lion's share of flows internationally in Europe in terms of in the equity mutual fund space and our U.K. team's across the board had a lights out year. Our fixed income team had a great year and performance with over 75% of our products outperforming their benchmark. We're seeing strong flows in credit. We had to go anywhere, do anything, mutual fund that we launched mid-last year. It's over $1.2 billion and growing very rapidly with extraordinary good performance but I think we are the single number one performer in that fixed income category.
And also I would just like to highlight our strong performance in fixed income, our strong performance in equities created good performance fees. So once again, there is a linkage between performance and performance fees, and performance fees are just a great indication of performance. Second of all, our alternative products where we continue to grow our fixed income alternative products, our equity performance products, our Global Allocation products, global really extraordinary years and we continue to start seeing some real good flows into all those products. 
Let me just highlight BlackRock Solutions, which I cited in the third quarter as a business that is continue to grow. We announced in the fourth quarter we had 20 new assignments. I think that's a record for any quarter. It has been highlighted by our recently announced engagement by the Central Bank of Ireland. This actually is the biggest assignment that we've ever received from any government. This is bigger than AIG, with the Federal Reserve. This is bigger than we did with the Bear Stearns. This is a gigantic assignment. We have teams in Dublin. It is a validation more than ever before that our product, our BlackRock Solutions space is world-class, and we are in conversations with other governments with other opportunities right now and helping them navigate the credit crisis and the crisis that we are seeing in the sovereign credit world of Europe.
One highlight that I'd like to note also is a major milestone for Aladdin. We crossed the $10 trillion mark in terms of assets that we're analyzing. So if you add the $3.5 trillion of assets that we manage on behalf of clients and the $10 trillion of assets that we are advising on risk management, it is a $13.5 trillion platform.
And we spoke about flows. Our pipeline is a good indication of where we believe our business is going. I'm very pleased with the mix of business going forward and the types of flows that we're seeing with the large preponderance of elongated flows. We continue to believe short range will reign low and so we're going to have a messy and mixed flows in cash. But one day, rates will go higher. I'm not suggesting any time soon and that business will become even more robust.
So let me just talk about margins real quickly. Ann Marie mentioned margins of 40.7 in the fourth quarter. This is something that we talked about over the last few quarters and especially in terms of our equity roadshow that we expected never to expense all Beta that our shareholders are going to benefit as Beta increases in terms of our margins. We showed that in our margins, we showed that in our comp ratios, which I believe is a huge differentiator versus so many financial institutions that have top ratios way in excess of 40%.  We are trying to differentiate ourselves on that component too. 
Regulatory reform is still in front of us. The Federal Reserve will have commentary periods related to systemically important institutions. It may encompass us. It may not encompass us. Whether we are determined a systemically important institution will not change our business model. We are at this moment, still one of the most regulated investment managers in the world by being regulated by the OCC, by the Federal Reserve, by the SEC, by the FSA. So whether we are designated as a systemically important institution or not does not change our business model, does not change our business mix, does not change who and what we are. However, I look forward to if the regulators determine BlackRock and other investment firms should be considered systemically important, we believe that's what we need to do in our financial system, we welcome it. So it's something that we'll see over the next quarter. And so I just wanted to highlight that because that will be something that will probably be in the marketplace over the next quarter.
Lastly, we remain constructive on equity markets. We believe confidence is growing. We believe people or CEOs are beginning to spend their huge backlog of cash. We need to see over the course of the first two quarters if that spend is in the form of hiring, if that spend is in the form of factories and plants and not in the form of stock repurchases and not in the form of mergers or investing outside the United States. Those are going to be important validators in terms of looking at our economy for 2011. We do believe Europe remains to be an area that's going to be in the news as Europe tries to manage their banks and the sovereign credit issue, which I do believe is totally linked as we saw in Ireland, and I believe it'll be linked in other countries too. 
BlackRock's in a great position to take advantage of the changes in the marketplace. We are in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities on the global basis, and I welcome, in a very positive way, 2011. I want to thank all the employees for all the hard work.

With rates being this low, clients and with where liabilities are that's why where interest rates are, that changes their liability, it changes their forecasting in terms of how much rerisking are they going to do, and so I think it's pretty complex to understand it. It's not just where equity markets are going and other products as a function of where will be their liabilities at the end of the year in terms of where average 10-year corporate rate is. So there is a bias worldwide. These clients, in my mind, are overweighted in fixed income, overweighted in cash and in many cases, clients have a systematically under invested in equity like products. I believe there is greater and greater comfort clients are going to start rerisking. But that rerisking could be in the form of some type of multi-asset class strategy that encompasses some Beta but some alternatives. It may encompass utilization of maybe some of our global iShares product and it may be some hedge fund products, and it may be a combination of all that overlaying our Solutions and Aladdin products. So I don't think there's one strategy, and I don't think there's one solution. It really is a function of each client risk needs versus their liabilities."

We still believe credit is going to be a good place to be. We actually love mortgages at this level. And so there's many opportunities to make, better returns in treasuries, in fixed income. So whether -- so it really is a function of how much capabilities these institutions have in rerisking. Some rerisking maybe just moving from treasuries to credit. Some of them may be moving from maybe Beta strategies to more fundamental active strategies, and many of them will be a combination of all of that plus probably a greater investing in alternatives and more investing outside the United States."

We did not benefit like some of our great competitors did in the fixed income flows. And it was a disappointment, and obviously, our performance in 2008 was a chief cause of that. But in the last two years, our performance has been very strong, beating most of our competitors. And so I don't believe if there was a dramatic turnaround out of fixed income into equities would be damaging. We have a much stronger presence in the mutual fund space in our equity products. And so I believe we'd be a net benefit if that happened."

And as they think about what they're planning to do in 2011 later this week, I'm seeing two of the largest state plans. Again, we're trying to get in front of our clients. I'm spending more time with our institutional clients here in the states to find out what they're trying to do. I don't think clients are necessarily confused as much as -- it's not just the asset side they're struggling with. They're also struggling with are they getting funding from their corporation? Are they getting funding from their state? How much is there a drawdown? So one of our clients we finally saw earlier this week. They have a 12% or 13% increase in their plan, but their state did not fund them. And because of demographics, they had more outflows than they had in terms of performance and participant contribution. So the corporate actually shrunk. And so this is the dilemma that we think we're going to see more and more of. This is one of the reasons why these plans are going to have to say should we be rerisking now or should we -- how do we address this issue of a depleting corpos. These are serious issues, and so I think it's going to be very individualistic depending on the issue related to their funding sources as to how they are going to restructure their balance sheet, their assets. So it's not just uncertainty around the global confident market, it is also the uncertainty around their funding sources."

This morning, we are reporting record as-adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $3.42 and record full-year earnings of $10.94. I'd also like to welcome to the call our new shareholders. In December, Bank of America and PNC sold about 59 million shares or about 30% of our total shares outstanding into market. As a result of that transaction, now over 50% of our shares are owned by shareholders other than our three strategic investors.
Looking at our results, we had strong results. They reflect strong product performance, as well as strong markets. We're beginning 2011 with the merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us. Just a comment on that noise a little bit more, we do have $14 billion of merger-related outflows still sitting in the pipeline. The majority of those were in the prior pipeline. So what is reflected is more the timing of the withdrawals rather than the pipeline containing a lot of new notifications. We still have a handful of clients with known concentrations concerns. If those materialize, we'll call them out when they happen. 
But it's important to note of the concentration issues, those outflows have been at very low single-digit basis points, so have not had a material effect on revenue. With respect to our quantitative product, the performance on the scientific asset equity products have turned positive and competitive since Ken Kroner [ph] took over the leadership of that product. It'll take some time to fully repair the medium and longer-term track records. So it'll just be noise we have to watch there as we repair that track record. 
The total pipeline stands at $73 billion. That includes $61 billion in long-dated assets and that is net of the merger-related items. The rest of my remarks I'm going to walk through the supplemental slides. And I'll be talking about as-adjusted earnings. If you move to Slide 1, operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $962 million. That's up 31% compared to the third quarter. Net income was $670 million, and EPS was $3.42. Both of those are up 25% compared to the third quarter.
Moving on to the full year, operating earnings of $3,167,000,000 and net income of $2.1 billion were both more than double 2009. EPS of $10.94 was up 53% compared to 2009. And if we look at the 2009 results and if the BGI transaction had taken place on January 1 and so on comparing them to pro forma results, our operating earnings were up 22%, and the net income was up 37%.
Moving on to the third slide and taking a look at our operating margin. The full-year operating margin came in at 39.3%. That's up 1.1 points compared to a year ago. It's up 2.5 points compared to the pro forma 2009 results. The fourth quarter margin came in at 40.7%. That does reflect both the strong performance fees in the quarter, as well as the benefits of market flowing through into our margin. Not shown on the page, our compensation-to-revenue ratio came in at 34.8%. This is the low end of the range of what we've been running for the last several years with the money in the 35% zone. It is down almost a half a point from our 2009 margin and really is consistent with our focus of really the benefits of Beta flowing through to our shareholder. 
As we begin 2011, we were very confident in the ability to grow the top line as well as our confidence in our margins. We plan to continue to speak efficiencies in our business and to realize the benefits of scale. At the same time, we plan to invest in growth opportunities. We've got a lot of strength; the roadshow gave us the opportunity to get out and dialogue with our shareholders about the external environment and how our capabilities lined up with that environment to be able to really service our clients. With that, we are confident in our ability to grow iShares and retail platforms, Defined Contribution platforms, BlackRock Solutions, Asia, multi-asset class strategy and alternatives. 
On the next slide I'll talk about markets, which are also contributing to growth in margins. So moving on to Slide 4, you can see that average 2010 markets were up about 20% compared to average 2009 markets. 2010 year-end market actually were -- closed the year about 10% higher than the average 2010 market. That means we've got positive tailwind coming into 2011, and that's before considering the positive markets we've seen so far in January.
Moving on to Slide 5. Our total earnings of $3.42 were composed of operating earnings of $3.35 and non-operating earnings of $0.07. The operating earnings improved $0.74 compared to the third quarter. The non-operating earnings included $45 million of positive marks on our co and seed investment portfolio. The level of those positive marks, however, was a little bit lower than the level of positive marks we had in the third quarter. 
The full year as-adjusted tax rate came in at 33%. That is down from the third quarter year-to-date tax rate of 33.5%. The half a point decrease in the tax rate reflects some international tax benefit associated with the late December extension of U.S. legislation, which had been due to expire. The half point benefit resulted in about an $0.08 improvement in earnings compared to if we had, had the 33.5% tax rate. We do expect the bulk of these benefits to carry into 2011. All other things being equal, that means we have the same mix of earnings, no other tax legislation changes and no big news on tax resolution. The 2011 tax rate will be likely a little bit higher than 2010 to in the same range.
Moving on to Slide 6. Total revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion. That was up 19% or $400 million from the third quarter. Important part of the increase came from performance fees, which were up $212 million from the third quarter. As with the stock, the fourth quarter is our primary quarter for loss even comparing to the fourth quarter of 2009, performance fees are still up $73 million, reflecting improving performance across a number of our funds. 
The absolute level of performance fees was $326 million and included a $128 million of fees really associated with relative performance, as well as $188 million of fees that we earned on our alternative products, reflecting strong absolute performance in those products, and that does include our really large hedge fund GMSP. I'll remind everyone that we have very few funds that have performance fee measurements in the first quarter.
I'm going to talk about base fees later, so just to  mention briefly on the BRS revenues that came in at $132 million for the quarter. The increase of $32 million from the prior quarter reflects the completion of 20 advisory assignments. We've got a lot of active interest in our BlackRock Solutions, the strongest interest that we've ever seen. We do have some interesting things in the pipeline, including the publicly noted assignment from the Central Bank of Ireland.
Moving on to Slide 7, which outlines our expenses. Expenses of $1.5 billion for the quarter were up 9% or $176 million from the third quarter. Just want to put that in the context of the revenue increase of 19% and that’s even with expense increases we saw those improvements in margins that I talked about earlier. Now about $80 million of the expense increase related to AUM in revenues, the biggest single component there related to incentive comp, which closely links to revenue of course. We also had $96 million of increases in G&A expense. We did in the fourth quarter make a $20 million contribution to a charitable fund account for the first time. That's something we'd like to continue to do over time. 
Also in the fourth quarter, there was a one-time assessment to the U.K. asset management industry, our share of which was about $20 million. We did see some increases in marketing of about $17 million and professional fees of about $13 million, and the rest of the expenses are small movements across many items.
Moving on to base fees on Slide #8. Base fees came in at $1.951 billion. That was up 9% compared to the third quarter. We saw improved revenues across all of our long-dated asset classes and was part driven by favorable markets. I would note that of our merger-related outflows, there was one outflow of $24 billion that was out about a half a basis point, so had very little effect on revenue. Whereas our $28 billion in net new, long-dated assets came in at closer to our average basis point realization across our whole portfolio, so it contributed positively to revenue. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and non-operating results. Non-operating results came in at $20 million. That is $45 million of investment gains on our co and seed that I mentioned earlier. Those were gains across all asset classes in the portfolio, offset partially by $25 million of interest expense on our debt that we put on associated with the BGI acquisition. The investment portfolio stands about at $1 billion. It's largely consistent with the third quarter. And just to remind everyone, we do not do any proprietary vesting. Those are all co and seed investment to be aligned with our clients. 
Moving on to Slide 10, we generate substantial cash flow. We used about $1 billion of our 2010 cash flow to repay short-term debt. In addition, we returned a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our dividend represented about a 38% payout of our earnings. In addition, we repurchased about 900 million shares. That brought our total payout to about 44%. We still have 4.2 million shares of authorization for repurchase. However, we've sort of paused for a little while, at least for now, on those repurchases since the sale by Bank of America and PNC. The reason we’ve paused is we believe that we now meet all of the eligibility criteria to be included in the S&P 500 index. We think an important criterion within that is the degree of public float, and we just think protecting that public float is a important priority at this point in time. I just say we do always and regularly discuss our dividend policy with our board, and you can see our history of dividend across that slide.
With that, I'd just like to conclude that 2010 ended up with a very strong year. We're entering 2011 with, again, those merger-related issues and outflows largely behind us and with strong momentum just both in terms of new business and markets.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And it is scheduled, again, for us to work with our board to come up with a 2011 dividend policy. And so that's one of the opportunities we have going forward in 2011.
First of all, let me welcome everybody. I need to apologize in advance. I may have a fit of coughing since I'm in the back end of a cold. It is no indication of my views of the future. So let me just begin and talk about Alpha. Our performance across most of our products were strong. Throughout our integration process, we needed to be assured that we're protecting our portfolio managers from the integration process. We needed to make sure our clients understood that, that our business with them is not going to change, that we are going to make first and foremost, our manufacturing platform or portfolio teams to be uninvolved in all the issues around integration, and I think 2010, looking now backwards, was a success. 
Our teams had very strong performance across our equity, our fixed income and our alternatives product area. I do believe that performance now will continue to drive business in 2011. And most importantly, good performance drives good performance fees. And I think some of the messaging that we said in the past few quarters, the importance of good performance, the importance of alternative products truly is now starting to become more apparent in our earnings related to these phenomenons. 
I would like to go back to early '06 and parts of '07 where we had as much as 30% of our earnings being driven by performance fees. And obviously, the market setbacks of '08 changed all that. I'm not suggesting our earnings model will ever have that type of strength. But I do believe as clients begin to re-risk, and clients are looking to move from Beta products or even core fixed income products to other products, they're going to entail products that may have some form of performance-oriented fees. And with that, we are going to have, hopefully, large-based performance fees. So we look at this as a great indication of our evolution of our platform. We believe our success in performance fees in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter indicative of that performance and the repositioning of our firm, and it is our strongest intention in 2011 to continue to build out our alternative space, to continue to be working with our clients as our clients are driving more risk positions whether that may be in emerging market product or it may be just a credit product, clients are looking to move away from core fixed income strategies and are looking to move away from some Beta strategies. And I'll get into that a little later, but I think it's important to really focus on that and once again, remind everyone we are going to make this a continuation of our focus for 2011 to continue to build out these alternative products.
Let me also reflect on another component of our business, and that is scale. I think now looking backwards, we are now showing the investment world that scale is a virtue. It is a positive. We, obviously, have much negative noise related to concentration issues. As Ann Marie suggested, that is largely behind us, moving away from low-fee products into other types of products where we have greater ability to navigate with our client base. 
But most importantly, with our scale and as Ann Marie talked about our free cash flow, no investment firm is investing as much dollars as we are to build a bigger, stronger, more robust platform in which we could provide stronger based Alpha products for our clients and more solution-based relationship with our clients. And so some of the areas that we're really investing in, we're continuing to invest in our investment products, which we'll talk about a little later. We're expanding our platforms regionally in Asia and South America. We're continuing to build out in Europe. 
We talked about over the last few quarters the building out of our trading platform, which we believe will have huge benefits for our clients and already our build-out of our capital markets capabilities to win large assignments directly from issuers is very positive for us in terms of building out Alpha for our clients. 
I should also state very loud and clear as we build out these trading platforms and as we build out our capital markets capabilities, this is to enhance our connectivity with our clients. This is to find ways to get more product at higher net spreads to our investors. Our business model is not changing. 100% of our revenues will be client-centric business, and so we're building out this platform because we believe scale will be a virtue, and we believe throughout 2011, that will continue to differentiate us. 
And in scale, most importantly, we're building out our global footprint to provide more consistent and more varied Alpha and solution-based products. So over the course of 2011, we have a strong emphasis in building our products in Asia, both credit and in equities, emerging market equities. As I said earlier, we continue to build out our alternative products, and we believe that will be one of the drivers for us in 2012 and 2013. 
We continue to believe we are differentiated by our multi-asset class products, our BMAX products. Yesterday, we announced we hired Nancy Everett, who was a CEO of Promark, which was the General Motors pension plan. And prior to that, she was the Head of the Virginia retirement plan. She will be running our U.S. fiduciary business, a part of this multi-asset category platform. And so we believe this will continue to be an area where we invest. 
Another area of real growth for us in 2010 that is already been validated in our pipeline and wins already and that's the defined contribution area where we believe more and more money will be moving away from defined benefits and defined contributions. I do believe over the course of 2011, as state governments starting to tackle their tremendous deficit burdens, one of the outcomes will be most probably the restructuring of their plans for new employees that will be predominantly Defined Contribution plans. And so we believe DC will become a larger and larger driver. 
We also believe because of the retrenchment of costs, many more public plans, maybe the smaller ones, will be looking to do more fiduciary outsourcing, which is why we have Nancy here. So we do believe there's going to be quite a bit of changes as a result of public plas, public state plan, need to restructure because of the tremendous state burdens with their deficits. And we hope to be taking advantage of that because of our scale, because of our multi-asset class product and capabilities, because of our Beta capabilities and our Alpha capabilities.
And so our theme for 2011 continues to be Alpha generation. But Alpha generated connected with a solution-based relationship with our clients as more and more clients are going to be looking for help. As good as the equity markets were in 2010, the problem for most public plans and private plans was their liabilities because of rates being lower in most cases, if not all cases, the deficits for many of these plans were actually increased because liabilities changed more than even the nice asset growth that so many plans experienced. And so needs for solution-based relationships is becoming more and more a necessity and having the breadth and the depth that BlackRock has is very important. 
Let me just touch on as I reflect in 2010, the merger integration, largely completed. We spent a great deal of time in the early part of the year and in terms of evolving our culture, which is still a multiyear project but I think we've done a great job in that. 
In June, we refined our organizational structure, our governance model. And after we announced all that, I think it's no surprise to the leadership of BlackRock that's when we begin to see more and more momentum as you reflect backwards. And looking at our business opportunities we saw in the third quarter and most questionably the business opportunities we saw in the fourth quarter going into 2011, it has much to do with the enormity of restructuring the platform, of tackling the integration of our two great firms into one, building a strong unified culture worldwide, building that one BlackRock brand and culture. I think so much of that is behind us, and we're starting to see that in so many ways obviously, including in terms of our business momentum. 
I need to put a caveat on. We still have one more year left in terms of technology integration. We still have many redundancies because we are still operating in many cases in multiple platforms. We are on track to finishing the technology integration by end of this year. So we feel very strong about the opportunities we have related out in 2012 in terms of margins, but we still have many more milestones this year to accomplish and making sure that the full integration in terms of our technology, our infrastructure is complete. And I would like to also say this remains to be a burden. 
We just completed an employee survey where our employees still want to have more connection and until we have the technology conversion completed, having as much connection, multi-product connection across products, across regions is still not where we wanted to take it. And so the employees are listening. This is going to be a big milestone as we finish our technology conversion, and we'll have much greater connectivity amongst all our businesses and regions when we do that.
One other thing I'd like to talk about because it's been an irritant to say the least and that is how so many of our competitors, possibly, some publications have talked about turnover at BlackRock over 2010, and I want to say change has been great. We are far better firm today than we were six months ago and most importantly, a year ago. The team in place is as powerful as any team we've ever had. We are very excited about the leadership teams. We are very excited about our product teams, our portfolio teams. And I do believe those changes has been predominantly very strong changes. 
I'd like to add one other thing that most people don't focus on. What differentiated BlackRock when we did the Merrill Lynch merger and certainly what's differentiating BlackRock with our BGI merger is we do not do mergers for massive cost take-outs, although we've had huge margin increases from the pro forma of last year, we actually added over 1,000 employees this past year on top of the merger. So we are not a firm in which we are looking to do a dramatic downsizing of people for accretion purposes. I look backwards and talking about the merger for revenue opportunities. And if you go back and reflect on where we thought we were going to be when we announced the merger in June '09 to where we ended up, when we talked about what we thought we could earn in 2010, we exceeded our expectations in the entire market in terms of revenues, in terms of net income. On top of hiring another 1,000 employees to build the platform. And so I just want to address change has been very positive. We've added many people. Overall, as a firm, we had about 6% turnover, which is below industry statistics, and so this is a very important issue that finally I wanted to be public about, but it's very hard to do that when the articles are trying to hurt us, not help us.
I would like to talk about branding for a minute. Branding will continue to be a major priority as we expect a larger segment of revenues will be generated from our U.S. and international Mutual Fund business and our iShare business. So we believe our mix of business as our platform grows, as our brand recognition continues to grow, will be from the retail and iShares platforms worldwide. And we need to continue to build out that brand and that brand recognition. And importantly, as we continue to build out our platform in Defined Contribution, it is very important in that space too, in that theoretical institutional space that we drive our brand and this will be a very big priority for us. 
And just touching briefly on our flows in retail. I just like to highlight a few things. Our U.S. Mutual Fund business grew by $25 billion last year. Our international Mutual Fund business grew by $6.3 billion. Our iShares business grew by $43 billion. Our retail platform and iShares grew by $74 billion last year. I don't think we get enough attention about the power of our global platform in this space, and I want to congratulate all our teams, our iShares team and our global retail, global mutual fund teams worldwide in having an extraordinary performance. 
Let me just highlight a few things about iShares. Our business in Asia-Pacific grew by 33%. Our business in EMEA grew by 16%. Our U.S. business grew by 7%. So this is a Global business. This will continue to grow. We are emphasizing this business worldwide. We believe we have the leadership position. We will continue to have the leadership position, and we expect still very robust competition and some of it, in some cases, our competition's going to beat us. In many cases, we're going to beat our competition. The ETF business will continue to be a strong growth business worldwide, and we believe, especially if the SEC changes the model of the FA business and the Investment Counselor business to a fiduciary model, it's going to have a dramatic impact on the ETF business. It may put a drag on some Mutual Fund business, but I believe BlackRock will be very protected, and BlackRock will be more than enough differentiated even if the model change happens with the distribution channels.
So let me just talk about some of our equity and fixed income in alternative products. We are seeing clients re-risk. I would like to just note that we, as a firm, have been more right than most firms in the prognostication of where the markets were going to go in 2010. We never believed in the ""new normal."" We were always caught talking about a market, a U.S. economy growing three-plus. It did. We were positioned for that, and we had very strong performance in many of our equity products. Our equity dividend product, as more and more people are looking to buy equity dividend products, as fixed income rates are so low. Global Opportunities, Dennis Stattman and team, that crossed the $75 billion mark. We are confident the team is ready for a bigger and larger future. 
Our European equity team has gone from strength to strength, bringing in the lion's share of flows internationally in Europe in terms of in the equity mutual fund space and our U.K. teams across the board had a lights-out year. Our fixed income team had a great year and performance with over 75% of our products outperforming their benchmarks. We're seeing strong flows in credit. We had to go anywhere, do anything, mutual fund that we launched mid-last year. It's over $1.2 billion and growing very rapidly with extraordinary good performance -- I think we are the single number one performer in that category.
And also I would just like to highlight our strong performance in fixed income, our strong performance in equities, created good performance fees. So once again, there is a linkage between performance and performance fees, and performance fees are just a great indication of performance. Second of all, our alternative products where we continue to grow our fixed income alternative products, our equity performance products, our Global Allocation products, Global Asset had really extraordinary years and we continue to start seeing some real good flows into all those products. 
Let me just highlight BlackRock Solutions, which I cited in the third quarter as a business that is continuing to grow. We announced in the fourth quarter we had 20 new assignments. I think that's a record for any quarter. It has been highlighted by our recently announced engagement by the Central Bank of Ireland. This actually is the biggest assignment that we've ever received from any governmental. This is bigger than AIG with the Federal Reserve. This is bigger than what we did with the Bear Stearns. This is a gigantic assignment. We have teams in Dublin. It is a validation more than ever before that our product, our BlackRock Solutions space is world-class, and we are in conversations with other governments with other opportunities right now and helping them navigate the credit crisis and the crisises that we are seeing in the sovereign credit world of Europe.
One highlight that I'd like to note also is a major milestone for Aladdin. We crossed the $10 trillion mark in terms of assets that we're analyzing. So if you add the $3.5 trillion of assets that we manage on behalf of clients and the $10 trillion of assets that we are advising on risk management, it is a $13.5 trillion platform.
Ann Marie spoke about flows. Our pipeline is a good indication of where we believe our business is going. I'm very pleased with the mix of business going forward and the types of flows that we're seeing with the large preponderance of elongated flows. We continue to believe short-range will reign low and so we're going to have a messy and mixed flows in cash. But one day, rates will go higher. I'm not suggesting any time soon and that business will become even more robust.
So let me just talk about margins real quickly. Ann Marie mentioned margins of 40.7 in the fourth quarter. This is something that we talked about over the last few quarters and especially in terms of our equity roadshow that we expected never to expense all Beta and that our shareholders going to benefit as Beta increases in terms of our margins. We showed that in our margins, we showed that in our comp ratios, which I believe is a huge differentiator versus so many financial institutions that have top ratios way in excess of 40%.  We are trying to differentiate ourself on that component too. 
Regulatory reform is still in front of us. The Federal Reserve will have commentary periods related to systemically important institutions. It may encompass us, it may not encompass us. Whether we are determined a systemically important institution will not change our business model. We are at this moment, still one of the most regulated investment managers in the world by being regulated by the OCC, by the Federal Reserve, by the SEC, by the FSA. So whether we are designated as a systemically important institution or not does not change our business model, does not change our business mix, does not change who and what we are. However, I look forward to if the regulators determine BlackRock and other investment firms should be considered systemically important, we believe if that's what we need to do in our financial system, we welcome it. So it's something that we'll see over the next quarter. And so I just wanted to highlight that because that will be something that will probably be in the marketplace over the next quarter.
Lastly, we remain constructive on equity markets. We believe confidence is growing. We believe people or CEOs are beginning to spend their huge backlog of cash. We need to see over the course of the first two quarters if that spend is in the form of hiring, if that spend is in the form of factories and plants and not in the form of stock repurchases and not in the form of mergers or investing outside the United States. Those are going to be important validators in terms of looking at our economy for 2011. We do believe Europe remains to be an area that's going to be in the news as Europe tries to manage their banks and [indiscernible] the sovereign credit issue, which I do believe is totally linked as we saw in Ireland, and I believe that it'll be linked in other countries too. 
BlackRock's in a great position to take advantage of the changes in the marketplace. We’re in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities on the global basis, and I welcome, in a very positive way, 2011. I want to thank all the employees for all the hard work. It is -- 2010 looking backwards was a really difficult year and yet the hard work and the perseverance and the teamwork really translated into a really phenomenal quarter, a phenomenal year and a great momentum into 2011. 
Let me open it up for questions."

There is no question clients -- the real issue is where will interest rates be in 12 months. That's going to be an important component as to how clients think about re-risking. With rates being this low, clients and with where liabilities are that's why where interest rates are, that changes their liability, it changes their forecasting in terms of how much re-risking are they going to do, and so I think it's pretty complex to understand it. It's not just where equity markets are going and other products, it’s a function of where will be their liabilities at the end of the year in terms of where the average 10-year corporate rate is. So there is a bias worldwide. These clients, in my mind, are over-weighted in fixed income, over-weighted in cash and in many cases, clients have a systematically under-invested in equity-like products. I believe that there is greater and greater comfort clients are going to start re-risking. But that re-risking could be in the form of some type of multi-asset class strategy that encompasses some Beta but some alternatives. It may encompass utilization of maybe some of our global iShares product and it may be some hedge fund products, and it may be a combination of all that overlaying our Solutions and Aladdin products. So I don't think there's one strategy, and I don't think there's one solution. It really is a function of each client risk needs versus their liabilities."

We still believe credit is going to be a good place to be. We actually love mortgages at this level. And so there's many opportunities to make, better returns in treasuries, in fixed income. So whether -- so it really is a function of how much capabilities these institutions have in re-risking. Some re-risking may be just moving from treasuries to credit. Some of them may be moving from maybe Beta strategies to more fundamental active strategies, and many of them will be a combination of all of that plus probably a greater investing in alternatives and more investing outside the United States."

We're doing a number of roadshows, seeing our U.S. clients and trying to talk to them. I saw our largest institutional state plans last week. And as they think about what they're planning to do in 2011 later this week, I'm seeing two of the largest state plans. Again, we're trying to get in front of our clients. I'm spending more time with our institutional clients here in the states to find out what they're trying to do. I don't think clients are necessarily confused as much as -- it's not just the asset side they're struggling with. They're also struggling with are they getting funding from their corporation? Are they getting funding from their state? How much is their drawdown? So one of the clients, the clients I saw earlier this week. They have a 12% or 13% increase in their plan, but their state did not fund them. And because of demographics, they had more outflows than they had in terms of performance and participant contribution. So the corpus actually shrunk. And so this is a dilemma that we think we're going to see more and more of. This is one of the reasons why these plans are going to have to say “should we be re-risking now or should we -- how do we address this issue of a depleting corpus?”. These are serious issues, and so I think it's going to be very individualistic depending on the issue related to their funding sources as to how they are going to restructure their balance sheet, their assets. So it's not just uncertainty around the global competent markets, it is also the uncertainty around their funding sources."

This morning, as we report first quarter earnings, we're delivering a top-line revenue story. Today, we announced earnings of $2.96. This is a 23% compared to a year ago and those earnings are being driven by top-line revenue growth of 14%. Our revenue growth is a combination of both market, but importantly strong organic growth. And we are seeing that organic growth, consistent with a number of the themes that we've been discussing. We saw strong revenue growth related to retail, close that both U.S. and internationally and reflects the strength of those markets, as well as our relative share of those markets improving. We saw good posts on our EPS business, iShares. And just a reminder that, that business in the first quarter is usually seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. We see good revenues in multi-asset products at clients are seeking people to solve their problems and help them manage risk, not just manage assets, and we are seeing good revenues from alternatives, both related to the performing and alternative and forward. And that's a trend as investors continued to separate Alpha from Beta. 
The first quarter was also a quarter of a number of important milestones. We increased our dividend by 37.5%. We increased our credit facility by $1 billion to $3.5 billion and extended the maturities for five years. While we have no plan to use the credit facility, we think it's an important source of long-term flexibility. 
Our merger-related concentration flows are at this point largely behind us. The first quarter is the lowest quarter since the merger. We have only $19 billion outflow that go with the low revenue from a single client remaining in the pipeline, we've got no other known concentration confirmed. 
With respect to our lone only quant product, the near-term performance is going to take time to work its way in the medium and longer term track record. With that in mind, we did budget for outflows in 2011, and we are seeing outflows in our U.S. and global products. At the same time, we're beginning to see inflows into regional quant products, where we have had good performance. And so we do believe quant is an opportunity going forward. And I wanted to see what our quant hedge funds which are performing well and attracting assets from our lone only quant. 
The pipeline is strong with a high-quality of revenue and Larry is going to talk much more about that. And finally, of note that on April 1, we were added to the S&P 500 index. And on the date of inclusion, we were the 75th largest company in that index.
I'm going to walk through a number of the slides starting with Slide 1. Our operating income which is shown on the left-hand side of the chart of $819 million was up 13% compared to a year ago, with net income and EPS both up 23%. 
With respect to margins shown on Slide 2 on far right-hand side, our margin came in 39.1%. That was up from the first quarter a year ago. And just the fourth quarter margin as a reminder reflected a peak period of performance fee loss. 
Our cost revenue ratio for the quarter was 35.4% consistent with where they've been for the very long time. We do remain confident in both top line growth combined with a good margin, as we continue to seek efficiencies and realize the benefits of scale. 
Just a couple of examples from the quarter. Late in the quarter, we've migrated a number of our data centers into loan, the facility in Washington state. We're going to benefit from doing this by lower cost power. 
Another example is we have been consolidating our operating functions into Centers of Excellence which will benefit from sale in following the sun. 
At the same time, we're investing in the firm bringing some great new style and capability, something that Larry is going to spend time talking about. 
On Slide 3 which shown markets. And all in all, we continue to benefit from improving market. On Slide 4, on the far right-hand side, it was laid out that the key components of our earnings per share. Earnings per share of $2.96 included operating earnings of $2.93. That's $2.79, That's $2.79 included $0.06 associated with the successful launch of a $1 billion closed end funds investing in commodities and energy. We have a tax adjustment of $0.12 that was related to resolution of certain tax matters and $0.05 of nonoperating earnings. 
If you take the $2.96 and you exclude the closed end, as well as the tax adjustment, we still have a earnings of $2.90 in the quarter. 
Compared to the fourth quarter -- compared to the first quarter a year ago, you can see the business grew across all dimensions. And compared to the fourth quarter, we have growth in the Base business, fewer one-time cost, offset by a period to which fewer performance fee loss. 
The first quarter as adjusted tax rate was 33% before considering the $9.4 million tax adjustment. That was the quarterly rate down to 30.1%. 
Speaking of revenues now, as shown on Page 6. Year-over-year revenues were 14%. And then when we talk about base fees in a minute by really starting with performance fees, performance fees in the quarter came in strong at $83 million. That reflected both strong relative performance in a number of equity accounts, as well as the strength of our alternative platforms. We have good performance across our single strategy hedge funds. And also of note at this point, over 2/3 of our hedge funds of funds are above the high watermark that compares to about 20% a year ago. 
We had strong BRS revenues of $128 million. We continue to grow the days and line business. We continue to win and implement new advisory assignments. We're beginning to see the run-off of some of the long-term liquidation assignments. This reflects the opportunity for holders to benefit from improved valuations and liquidity on the underlying assets and if the trend that we expect to continue. Included in the AUM Priceline is $15 billion in you long-term disposition assignment and is there is active interest across the board on the life so we feel great about the BRS opportunity going forward. Moving onto beasties and as shown on Slide 8, really base these improved 13% year-over-year across all long dated asset classes. Compared to fourth quarter as shown on Slide 9, we had a $33 million or 2% increase in base these and that is the size that Jack gave few fewer days in the quarter which is about $40 million. I'm a talk about detail in U.S. and international strength that will come through and $27 million of revenue associated with active equity product. You can also see the growth in alternative and multi- asset that he mentioned. With respect to EPS, we are seeing trends inflows which reflects both location equity, both patient video product in we are seeing strong global growth. And that reflects international clients both come into U.S. product as well as domestic products. Just for transparency's sake and thinking about our institutional index assets, those assets can be high velocity assets. Cry yes sometimes an index while they decide what they're doing longer-term. That can result in high-volume inflows as well as high-volume outflows which have relatively low revenue impact. So beginning in the fourth quarter, we've separated this out clearly in the press release we issued, we really see the impact of those revenues inflow. Moving to expenses which are shown on Slide 10 and 11, compared to a year ago, expenses are up $195 million, about 15% and consistent with the growth in the Base business. G&A is up $85 million, nearly 30. By nine cost of $90 million that I talked about earlier, $20 million of assets under management and $28 million of marketing and travel expense. Compared to the fourth quarter, expenses are down $68 million or about 4%. Compensation costs were relatively stable at about $800 million where we've had lower direct incentives and bonus offset by the fact that we had more people. First quarter was at peak payroll taxes associated with our bonus payout and we are beginning to reflect the new stock awards into our expense. G&A was down $69 million. Despite the $19 million closing cost, we didn't repeat a number of the unique cost that we experienced in the fourth quarter. A couple of weeks you'll recall which was really at the establishment of credible funds and the onetime regulatory fee to the asset management you pay industry both of which were about $20 million. Nonoperating income which is shown on Slide 12 was $14 million of which $43 million of the investment gain across all asset classes partially offset by net interest expense of $29 million. The value of our investment portfolio is stable at about $1 billion or $940 million excluding headwind related items. Really, again in the portfolio were offset by net distribution down to portfolio to the value the investment are about stable and in these investments as you know, were pro- investments alongside with our clients are sitting at the new products so everything that we're doing here is aligned with our clients interest. With respect to cash flow, we are generating substantial cash flow and return a meaningful portion of that cash to shareholders. As shown on Slide 13, we did increase the dividend from $4 annualized to $5.50 to 35.5% by mentioned earlier ended the quarter, that resulted in a 48% payout. We still have repurchase authority of 42.4 million shares. would get into any repurchases in the first quarter but we've had given notice with the mark convertible debt which is likely the result in those investors converting those shares and, and increasing our flow by a small amount. We are still very conscious about our flow included in the S&P 500. We want to continue to meet the criteria which is not included. At the same time, we would like to begin repurchasing shares at a minimum of anti-dilutive and we're going to seek opportunities to buyback shares in the way that won't materially disturb our flows. 
We don't have any plans for material M&A or investments that will be planted believe me, we don't want to have items that's under balance sheet as extended period of time. 
So wrapping up in the first quarter is indeed the growth story. We entered 2011, delivering double-digit earnings growth, fueled by top-line revenue growth. We delivered a healthy margin, generated substantial cash flow and returned a large portion of that cash flow to our shareholders. We feel great about our business model. We feel very strongly that we are well-positioned strategically, relative to the global plan, and that is already reflected in our pipeline and gives us great confidence in our future growth opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,129813992,116291,"BlackRock, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. As we reflect on our first quarter, it became very evident to me that BlackRock has come together as one firm. Cultural and business integration from our BGI merger is still behind us in a successful the past",2598,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. As we reflect on our first quarter, it became very evident to me that BlackRock has come together as one firm. Cultural and business integration from our BGI merger is still behind us in a successful the past quarter. And at the beginning of the second quarter, demonstrates that our business momentum is accelerating. BlackRock's broad range of products, our worldwide good business footprint of our solutions and risk management approach to our clients' needs have allowed BlackRock to serve our clients with more opportunities and large and enhanced our client relationships. 
As BlackRock feels more comprehensive relationships with our clients, we are expanding our product offerings, both in Beta and Alpha and more investment solutions. Our relationships are becoming larger and more substantial with many, many of our clients worldwide. 
As Ann Marie stated, our earnings were $2.96, up 24% year-over-year, driven by organic funded asset growth, beta obviously. But more importantly, by our expanding product mix. And also as we said at the end of last year, by what we are seeing more frequently re-risking by our clients moving into equities and moving into alternatives. And BlackRock is playing a larger role in that Than we've ever done before. And this is leading to revenue growth of 14% year-to-year. 
And I should note unlike so many other financial institutions who are recording, our earnings growth is fueled by revenue growth. A 100% of our revenues is driven by client business and Marie talked about that. Our business model is not going to change. We'll use our balance sheet only to go investment. We are not using our balance sheet to compete and importantly, we intend to use all asset cash flows in the form of dividends and as Ann-Marie spoke about, we buyback shares when it's especially the shares that are being created for employee plan. And as Ann Marie spoke about, we didn't raise our standby credit facility. If there's any events that need us to take advantage of opportunities and repurchasing shares. 
Let me review our quarter. Our headline in AUM is $3.648 trillion. This has been led principally by our multi-asset class product growth which grew by about $22.4 billion, of which $6.8 billion of it is in our fiduciary assignments and $16.8 billion of growth in our Defined Contribution business, principally through our LifePath products. And we continue to have more and more opportunities working with our clients in these products, whether it is LDI, and/or just complex relationships, and having Beta and Alpha. And as I said, in increasingly product mix, that is global allows to have a much more comprehensive relationship, in terms of asset allocation, mixes of products, how does one look at risk and how should one design a portfolio run-on liabilities. 
One of our most important jobs for the future is going to be the continuation of building our brand. We need to continue to build our brand recognition worldwide. This is going to be a big and aggressive campaign over the next five years. We believe this will demonstrate the growth of the platform and will allow us to continue to grow worldwide. I have to emphasize worldwide growth, although we are still seeing tremendous growth in the United States. But as the world continues to grow faster outside of the United States and parts of Asia and South America, we continue to build out that platform. It has to be away from dollar-based assets so it has to be more in local currencies. And in doing so, we need to continue to build out that brand and the brand recognition, as we expand our footprint worldwide. 
A good indication of how our brand recognition is being enhanced, and also a good indication of the ability to grow in multiple channels, I'd like to highlight our retail channels in the first quarter. 
In terms of long-term asset growth, our U.S. retail platform and long-term assets grew by $7.4 billion.
Our international retail channels and long-dated assets grew by $6.3 billion, so total of close to $14 billion, in terms of assets in the first quarter. 
I should also note that fixed income long-term assets grew $8.5 billion. And equities getting back to the re-risking, grew by $10.5 billion in the first quarter. 
In our iShares products, we continue to see very good momentum. And if you look at a year-over-year type of growth for the fourth quarter, generally is sometimes low to no growth after expanding growth in the fourth quarter. And if you add our growth in April and our growth April to date and our growth in the first quarter, it's over $12 billion. That includes the iPAQ products. We are growing in every product in our iShares platform, except in our emerging equity markets ETF. This is where we actually had bad tracking error last year. I'm pleased to say that it has been fixed. We put a lot of emphasis on it. And in the last few weeks, we have begun to see a reversal from outflows to multibillion-dollar inflows in that product. 
So the first quarter for our iShares product was drawn and we continue to believe there could be more and more opportunity. What's interesting to note and we said this in the fourth quarter, but we're seeing it even more so in the first quarter, I do believe ETF flows is a good forward indicator of where asset allocation is going and we began to see a shift out of fixed income into equities at the beginning of the third quarter last year but that's accelerating and we are seeing actually more growth now in equity EPS than we did in fixed income. So this is another example to us that clients are re-risking and why, I think I've been probably talking about why we believe equity will continue to rally. 
Long-term flows, as Ann Marie stated grew by close to $35 billion. This has been offset by an outflow of $24 billion in our Cash Management business. Our flows are representative of the industry. With the shortage of short-term treasuries, we see rates below five basis points. This is a business that will continue to flounder during these low rate environments. We are constructive about it. We are actually in the first quarter so positive flows in the institutional side and we saw very large negative flows more in the retail side. And so we are building our market share, in terms of institutional and it's not representative go with our growth of $25 billion that growth in cash, but we are building market share institutionally and we are certainly seeing some substantial line downs in the retail side. And much as this is because in many cases, the retail platforms are migrating from money market funds to bank deposits. Bank deposits are higher in yield in money market funds, even at a time that banks are having a little success, in terms of C&I loans. They may be using deposit for buying short-term treasuries or more securities, but they're willing to pay more than money markets can afford. So that trend is not going to change anytime soon. And so this is going to be an area that will have a drag on our flows, albeit this is low fee business and what I'm trying to stress is the revenue from the very, very height of fee businesses that we are demonstrating. 
In addition, as Ann Marie suggested, in our BlackRock advisory business, BlackRock Solutions, we are paying to our clients the principal paybacks in interest. And so as you witnessed now in the last few quarters, about the key advisory, this is a little over $4.5 billion a quarter. And once again, this is what we expect will continue and yet in our pipeline, which I'll talk about in a minute where there's a big win in the advisory business. 
I should talk about merger-related outflows, as Ann Marie suggested, it slowed a little more than $18 billion. We are not going to report merger-related activity again. We believe this is principally over. We are forecasting and telling you that there is in our pipeline another $9 billion. But this reporting is over. It will all be net. We believe we can look forward to growth now and we don't see any of the concentration issues that we had before. 
Let me just talk about our pipeline. $82.4 billion of pipeline wins. This represents also the netting of the $9 billion of outflows in it. So this is a net number in our pipeline. 
I'd like to really emphasize one important characteristic about our pipeline, $60.7 billion of that pipeline is long dated. I'm also pretty pleased to say that 65% is in Beta products and 45% is in active Alpha products. So very strong pipeline of wind and long dated the products. $6.2 billion was money that was left last quarter in the last two days in our money market funds. It went back to money market fund and we did win $50.5 billion advisory assignment in our BlackRock Solutions business. 
Over the last few quarters, we said we're going to be expanding our product mix, especially in alternatives. We have been very active in the first quarter. We brought in a team from NTR from alternative energy. We are adding more single strategy alternative products. And importantly, we saw over $2 billion of flows in the first quarter and in the first week of April.
Now I am pleased to say that our total assets in alternatives is $115 billion. We are witnessing even more and more demand for alternative products, as clients are looking to continue to re-risk. Some guys are re-risking through our biting using some data products. And in some cases using less maybe standard active equity strategy and are moving towards more what we would call a more evolved, our higher return active alternative products. So the growth continues in that space and we're continuing to make large investments in teams and in our platform in the alternative space. 
Ann Marie spoke about the scientific active equity team. I am pleased to say that in almost 80% of our products, we are witnessing positive returns. We still have some negative returns in our U.S. platform, but we are working tirelessly to rebuild the entire platform. We are seeing flows in our SAE business outside the U.S. and we believe this is going to be a much stronger product in the future as much money right away from our products not just other firms and we believe that opportunity that product continues. 
We are going to continue to build out our investment teams. That's a big characteristic for the future. We have many -- we've talked in many people, in terms of building out fundamental equity teams and our fundamental fixed income teams. We continue to believe that global credit will become a very large component and we are very active, in terms of rebuilding those teams. So despite our success, we are aggressively believing that we need to continue to build out our global footprint, not just in distribution, not just working with clients, but our entire manufacturing platform. 
BlackRock Solutions had a very, very strong first quarter, The momentum continues in the second quarter. 12 new assignments, revenues were strong $128 million. We have a large pipeline of opportunities. I should note that we received a lot of attention and I do believe we did an exceptional job in working with the Central Bank of Ireland in helping them understand that the significance of their banking system and the team who worked tirelessly in working with our clients of Central Bank of Ireland, but importantly with many other regulatory regimes that are involved. 
So we are building a stronger future. We are very constructive on the platform of Blackrock. I believe the first quarter was a very strong one that helped us validate our business model of multiproduct strategies. Our continued and relentless approach to making sure that Alpha is the most prominent issue that we face everyday and the production of Alpha, that does not change with growth. That does not change with our scale. But importantly, as we build that Alpha, we are going to continue to build out our manufacturing teams. 
We do believe worldwide, clients need a more solution based answers. We believe the political and economic issues around the world are only raising more questions as to how the clients should think about their portfolio. And we believe we are the best suited firm in the world in asset management to work with our clients, in terms of solving these complex issues. 
Let me just add a few more things as an indicator of the strength and conviction that we have on our platform. We were very aggressive in building out our leadership team in the first quarter. We hired a new head of institutional client service in the U.S. We are aggressively building out our Blackrock Institute. This is a very important issue for us because as we grow our global footprint, as we grow our products worldwide, we need to make sure that we are connecting this information and then redistributing this information to our portfolio teams and importantly to our clients. And so we believe this is going to be one of the core cornerstones of BlackRock in the future. Having the Blackrock Institute become the area which we bring all those information together. Understand what all the information that we are seeing mean. It should lead to better Alpha production. But importantly, it should lead us to have more complex relationships with our clients and helping our clients, in terms of understanding the dynamics of the world. 
We announced this week a new head of our real estate platform. We are very excited about this. This is an area where we were embarrassed in 2008, where we actually add this performance in 2010, and we continue to add this performance in 2011. And we are going to build this out, it is a great asset class and we are very proud of the changes we're making there. 
We're adding anymore people into our alternative teams. I mentioned NTR. And I mentioned earlier, we are going to be aggressive in community build out our equity, fundamental equity and fundamental fixed income teams. 
So in closing, BlackRock is building a stronger global footprint. We're adding products. We see more opportunities. We are very, very pleased with the position we have with our clients worldwide now, and we're very excited about the future for BlackRock. 
I just want to thank all the employees for a really good quarter. And especially in terms with all the noise in the world economies and the world political themes. We do believe that regulatory issues are going to be -- will still be with us for many months and years ahead of us and global uncertainty and global volatility is going to be probably more prevalent than we've seen in many years ahead. And having a global footprint, a global platform will allow us to navigate probably a little better than many other people. 
And I would like to just thank all of our new shareholders who came on board with an offering in November. And I believe your first two quarters of ownership have proven to be successful. And with that, thank you. let's open it up for questions."

And when you look at whether his international distribution, you guys announced relationship would zero.  You mentioned the DC opportunity and you see more and more DB plan shifting. I guess when you look in some of those opportunities and where you are today versus what's still out there? Is there any way you can gauge or size that up, in terms of whether it's market share who just how can you continue to sustain the growth?

We believe on the retail side, on the defined contribution side to name two areas. We have enormous opportunities in the future. I would say only a few years ago we did not have a brand that was well understood and recognized in the retail channels. Each year, we're expanding. And as I said earlier, we need to really invest in that brand to continue to build out those channels to make it easier. We are seeing worldwide a distribution platforms limiting the amount of manufacturers that they have. There are one or two big events that is going to happen from international distributors. They're going to reduce the amount of fee manufacturers that are going to be working with. We believe we are a part of that in those cases. So we see actually some of that crowding out effect that's going to be happening in the manufacturing space. And what I'm trying to suggest is the large multiproduct platforms are going to grow probably significantly faster than a signal-strategy platforms. And so for me to give you a size, Mike, I believe we have just enormous opportunities in those areas. As you said, money is moving out of DB into DC. I think I said this at the end of the first quarter, we believe that trend will accelerate and the public funds are struggling with the defined benefit funds and they're going to probably shift new employees in two defined contribution plans away from the benefit plans. So that trend will continue and I do believe we will be a big beneficiary of all that. And the whole impact of re-risking as I said publicly many times in the last two quarters investors are overweighted in fixed income investors. underweighted in equities and we believe having our Beta products and the expanding Alpha products in equities will allow us to have more opportunities with more clients. So, do you want to add anything?"

This morning, as we report first quarter earnings, we're delivering a top line revenue story. Today, we announced earnings of $2.96. This is a 23% compared to a year ago, and those earnings are being driven by top line revenue growth of 14%. Our revenue growth is a combination of both market, but importantly strong organic growth. And we are seeing that organic growth, consistent with a number of the themes we've been discussing. We saw strong revenue growth related to retail close that both U.S. and internationally, and reflects the strength of those markets, as well as our relative share of those markets improving. 
We saw good close in our EPS business, iShares. And just a reminder that, that business, in the first quarter, is usually seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. We see good revenues in multi-asset products as clients are seeking people to solve their problems and help them manage risk, not just manage assets. And we are seeing good revenues from alternatives, both related to the performing and the alternative, and forward into alternative. And that's a trend that investors continue to separate alpha from beta. 
The first quarter was also a quarter of a number of important milestones. We increased our dividend by 37.5%. We increased our credit facility by $1 billion to $3.5 billion, and extended the maturities for five years. While we have no plans to use the credit facility, we think it's an important source of long-term flexibility. Our merger-related concentration flows are, at this point, largely behind us. The first quarter is the lowest quarter since the merger. We have only one $9 billion outflow, that's relatively low revenue from a single client remaining in the pipeline, and we've got no other known concentration confirmed. 
With respect to our long-only quant [quantitative] product, the near-term performance is going to take time to work its way into the medium and longer term track record. With that in mind, we did budget for outflows in 2011, and we are seeing outflows in our U.S. and global products. At the same time, we're beginning to see inflows into regional quant products, where we have had good performance. And so we do believe, quant, is an opportunity going forward. And I wanted to see what our quant hedge funds which are performing well and attracting assets from our long-only quant. The pipeline is strong with a high-quality of revenue and Larry is going to talk much more about that. 
And finally, of note that on April 1, we were added to the S&P 500 index. And on the date of inclusion, we were the 75th largest company in the index. 
I'm going to walk through a number of the slides starting with Slide 1. Our operating income which is shown in the left-hand side of the chart of $819 million was up 13% compared to a year ago, with net income and EPS both up 23%. With respect to margins shown on Slide 2, on the far right-hand side. Our margin came in 39.1%. That was up from the first quarter a year ago. And just the fourth quarter margin as a reminder reflected a peak period of performance fee loss. 
Our comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 35.4% consistent with where we've been landing for a very long time. We do remain confident in both top line growth combined with a good margin, as we continue to seek efficiencies and realize the benefits of scale. Just a couple of examples from the quarter, late in the first quarter, we migrated a number of our data centers in Snohomish facility in Washington state. We're going to benefit from doing this by lower cost power. 
Another example is, we have been consolidating our operating functions into Centers of Excellence which will benefit from scale and following the sun. At the same time, we're investing in the firm bringing in some great new talents and capability, something Larry is going to spend time talking about. 
On Slide 3, with strong markets and all in all, we continue to benefit from improving market. On Slide 4, on the far right-hand side, it was laid out the key components of our earnings per share. Earnings per share of $2.96 included operating earnings of $2.93. That's $2.79. That $2.79 included $0.06 associated with the successful launch of a $1 billion closed-end funds investing in commodities and energy. We have a tax adjustment of $0.12 that was related to resolution of certain tax matters and $0.05 of nonoperating earnings. If you take the $2.96 and you exclude the closed end, as well as the tax adjustment, we still had earnings of $2.90 in the quarter. 
Compared to the fourth quarter -- compared to the first quarter a year ago, you can see the business grew across all dimensions. And compared to the fourth quarter, we had growth in the base business, fewer onetime cost, offset by a period with fewer performance fee loss. The first quarter as adjusted tax rate was 33% before considering the $24 million tax adjustment. That was the quarterly rate down to 30.1%. 
Speaking of revenues now, as shown on Page 6. Year-over-year revenues were 14%. I'm going to talk about base fees in a minute by really starting with performance fees. Performance fees in the quarter came in strong at $83 million. That reflected both strong relative performance on a number of equity accounts, as well as the strength of our alternative platforms. We have good performance across our single strategy hedge funds. And also of note, at this point, over 2/3 of our hedge funds of funds are above the high watermark that compares to about 20% a year ago. 
We had strong BRS revenues of $128 million. We continue to grow the base Aladdin business. We continue to win and implement new advisory assignments. We're beginning to see the run-off of some of our long-term liquidation assignments. This reflects the opportunity for holders to benefit from improved valuations and liquidity on the underlying assets, and it's a trend we expect to continue. Included in the AUM price line is $15 billion in new long-term disposition assignment. And there is active interest across-the-board on Aladdin, so we feel great about the BRS opportunity going forward. 
Moving on to base fees. And I'm showing on Slide 8, really, base fees improved 13% year-over-year across all long dated asset classes. Compared to fourth quarter, as shown on Slide 9, we had a $33 million or 2% increase in base fees, and that is despite the drag of two fewer days in the quarter worth about $40 million. When I talk about retail and U.S. and international strength that comes through in the $27 million of revenue associated with active equity product. You can also see the growth in alternatives and multi-asset that I mentioned. 
With respect to EPS, we are seeing trends inflows which reflects the rotation into equity. Rotation into yield products. We are seeing strong global growth. And that reflects international clients both coming into U.S. products, as well as domestic products. Just for transparency's sake and thinking about our institutional index assets, those assets can be high-velocity assets. Clients sometimes just parks their money in an index while they decide what they're doing longer-term. That can result in high-volume inflows as well as high-volume outflows which have relatively low revenue impact. So beginning in the fourth quarter, we've separated this out clearly in the press release so we can really see the impact of those revenues inflow. 
Moving on to expenses which are shown on Slide 10 and 11. Compared to a year ago, expenses are up $195 million, about 15% up consistent with the growth in the Base business. G&A is up $85 million, really, three key drivers from one cost of $90 million that I talked about earlier, $20 million of asset measurement and $28 million of marketing and travel expense. Compared to the fourth quarter, expenses are down $68 million or about 4%. Compensation costs were relatively stable at about $800 million, where we had lower direct incentives and bonus, offset by the fact that we hired more people. First quarter was at peak payroll taxes associated with our bonus payout and we are beginning to reflect the new stock awards into our expense. 
G&A was down $69 million. Despite the $19 million close and one cost, we didn't repeat a number of the unique cost that we experienced in the fourth quarter. A couple of what you'll recall, which was really the establishment of a charitable fund and the onetime regulatory fee to the asset management you pay in the industry, both of which were about $20 million. 
Nonoperating income which is shown on Slide 12 was $14 million, that which $43 million of investment gain across all asset classes, partially offset by net interest expense of $29 million. The value of our investment portfolio is stable at about $1 billion or $940 million excluding headwind-related items. Really, the gains in the portfolio were offset by net distribution down to the portfolios to the values of the investment are about stable. And these investments, as you know, were a pro-investments alongside our clients or seeding of new products to everything we're doing here is aligned with our clients interest. 
With respect to cash flow, we're generating substantial cash flow and returning a meaningful portion of that cash to shareholders. As shown on Slide 13, we did increase the dividend from $4 annualized to $5.50 to 37.5% I mentioned earlier. And in the quarter, that resulted in a 48% payout. We still have repurchase authority of 4.2 million shares. We didn't do any repurchases in the first quarter but we have given notice to redeem our convertible debt, which is likely to result in those investors converting those shares in common and increasing our flows by a small amount. 
We are still very conscious about flows since we've been included in the S&P 500. We want to continue to meet the criteria which got us included. And at the same time, we would like to begin repurchasing shares at a minimum of our anti-dilutive, and we're going to seek the opportunity to buyback shares in ways that won't materially disturb our flows. We don't have any plans for material M&A or investments that would be dragged. And believe me, we don't want to have idle assets on our balance sheet over extended period of time. 
So wrapping up, the first quarter is indeed the growth story. We entered 2011, delivering double-digit earnings growth, fueled by top line revenue growth. We delivered a healthy margin generated substantial cash flow and returned a large portion of that cash flow to shareholders. We feel great about our business model. We feel very strongly that we are well-positioned strategically, relative to the global plan, and that is already reflected in our pipeline and gives us great confidence in our future growth opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,129813992,116480,"BlackRock, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. As we reflect on our first quarter, it became very evident to me that BlackRock has come together as one firm. Cultural and business integration from our BGI merger is totally behind us and the success this pa",2629,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. As we reflect on our first quarter, it became very evident to me that BlackRock has come together as one firm. Cultural and business integration from our BGI merger is totally behind us and the success this past quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, demonstrates that our business momentum is accelerating. BlackRock's broad range of products, our worldwide business footprint, our solutions in risk management approach to our clients' needs, have allowed BlackRock to serve our clients with more opportunities in large and enhanced our client relationships. 
As BlackRock feels more comprehensive relationships with our clients, we are expanding our product offerings, both in Beta and Alpha and more investment solutions. Our relationships are becoming larger and more substantial with many, many of our clients worldwide. 
As Ann Marie stated, our earnings were $2.96, up 24% year-to-year driven by organic long-dated asset growth, beta obviously. But more importantly, by our expanding product mix. And also as we said at the end of last year, by what we are seeing more frequently re-risking by our clients moving into equities and moving into alternatives. And BlackRock is playing a larger role in that than we've ever done before. And this is leading to revenue growth of 14% year-to-year. 
And I should note, unlike so many other financial institutions who are recording, our earnings growth is fueled by revenue growth. A 100% of our revenues is driven by client business and Marie spoke about that. Our business model is not going to change. We'll use our balance sheet only to co-investment with our clients and seed products. We are not using our balance sheet to compete. And importantly, we intend to use all excess cash flows, in the form of dividends, and as Ann-Marie spoke about, to buyback shares when it's -- especially the shares that are being created for employee plan. And as Ann Marie spoke about, we didn't raise our standby credit facility. If there's any events that need us to take advantage of opportunities and repurchasing shares. 
Let me review our quarter. Our headline at AUM is $3,648,000,000,000. This has been led principally by our multi-asset class product growth, which grew by about $22.4 billion. Which $6.8 billion of it is in our fiduciary assignments and $16.8 billion of growth in our Defined Contribution business, principally through our LifePath products. And we continue to have more and more opportunities working with our clients in these products whether it is LDI, and/or just more complex relationships and having beta and alpha. And as I said, it is increasing product mix that isn't global -- that is global allows us to have a much more comprehensive relationship in terms of asset allocation, mixes of products, how does one look at the risk and how should one design a portfolio run-on liabilities. 
One of our most important jobs for the future is going to be a continuation of building our brand. We need to continue build our brand recognition worldwide. This is going to be a big and aggressive campaign over the next five years. We believe this will demonstrate the growth of the platform and it will allow us to continue to grow worldwide. I have to emphasize worldwide growth although we are still seeing tremendous growth in the United States but as the world continues to grow faster outside the United States in parts of Asia and South America, we continue to build our best platform. It has to be away from dollar-based assets, so there has to be more in local currencies. And in doing so, we need to continue to build out that brand and the brand recognition as we expand our footprint worldwide. 
A good indication of how our brand recognition is being enhanced and also a good indication of the ability to grow in multiple channels, I'd like to highlight our retail channels in the first quarter. In terms of long-term asset growth, our U.S. retail platform and long-term assets grew by $7.4 billion.  Our international retail channels and long-dated assets grew by $6.3 billion, so a total of close to $14 billion in terms of assets in the first quarter. I should also note, fixed income long-term assets grew $8.5 billion and equities, getting back to the be re-risking, grew by $10.5 billion in the first quarter. 
In our iShares products, we continue to see very good momentum. And if you look at a year-over-year type of growth to the fourth quarter, generally is a sometimes low to no grow, after expanding growth in the fourth quarter. And if you add our growth in April and our growth April to date and our growth in the first quarter, it's over $12 billion. And it includes the iPath products. We are growing in every product in our iShares platform, except our emerging equity markets ETF. This is where we actually had bad tracking error last year. I am pleased to say that it has been fixed. We put a lot of emphasis on it. And in the last few weeks, we have begun to see a reversal from outflows to a multibillion-dollar inflows in that product. 
So the first quarter for our iShares product was strong and we continue to believe there's going to be more and more opportunity. What's interesting to note and we said this in the fourth quarter, but we're seeing it even more so in the first quarter, I do believe ETF flows is a good forward indicator of where asset allocation is going. And we began to see a shift out of fixed income into equities at the beginning -- in the third quarter last year, but that's accelerating. And we are seeing actually more growth now in equity ETF than we did in fixed income. So this is another example to us that clients are re-risking and why, I think I've been probably talking about why we believe equities will continue to rally. 
Long-term flows, as Ann Marie stated, grew by close to $35 billion. This has been offset by an outflow of $24 billion in our Cash Management business. Our flows are representative of the industry. With the shortage of short-term treasuries, we see rates below 5 basis points. This is a business that will continue to flounder during these low rate environments. We are constructive about it. We, actually, in the first quarter of those soft flows -- positive flows in the institutional side and we saw very large negative flows more in the retail side. 
And so we are building our market share in terms of institutional and it's not representative with our growth of $24 billion in our outflows in cash. But we are building market share institutionally and we are certainly seeing some substantial line downs in the retail side. And much of this is because in many cases, the retail platforms are migrating from money market funds to bank deposits. Bank deposits are higher in yield in money market funds, even at a time that banks are having a little success in terms of C&I loans, they're may be using the deposit for buying short-term treasuries or mortgage securities, but they're willing to pay more than money markets can afford. 
So that trend is not going to change anytime soon. And so this is going to be an area that we'll have a drag on our flows, albeit this is low-fee business, and what I'm trying to stress is the revenue from the very, very high-fee businesses that we are demonstrating. 
In addition, as Ann Marie suggested, in our BlackRock Advisory business, BlackRock Solutions, we are paying to our clients the principal paybacks in interest. And so as you witnessed now in the last few quarters, the K in the advisory, this is a little over $4.5 billion a quarter. And once again, this is what we expect will continue. And yet in our pipeline, which I'll talk about in a minute where there is a big win in the Advisory business. 
I should talk about merger-related outflows, as Ann Marie suggested, it slowed a little more than $18 billion. We are not going to report merger-related activity again. We believe this is principally over. We are forecasting and telling you that there is, in our pipeline, another $9 billion. But this reporting is over. It will all be net. We believe we can look forward to growth now and we don't see any of the concentration issues that we had before. 
Let me just talk about our pipeline. $82.4 billion of pipeline wins. This represents also the netting of the $9 billion of outflows in it. So this is a net number in our pipeline. I'd like to really emphasize one important characteristic about our pipeline, $60.7 billion of that pipeline is long dated. I'm also pretty pleased to say 55% is in beta products and 45% is in active alpha products. So a very strong pipeline of wind in the long-dated products. $6.2 billion was money that left last quarter in the last few days in our money market funds, then it went back into money market funds. And then we did win a $15.5 billion advisory assignment in our BlackRock Solutions business. 
Over the last few quarters, we said we're going to be expanding our product mix, especially in alternatives. We have been very active in the first quarter. We brought in a team from NTR for alternative energy. We are adding more single-strategy alternative products. And importantly, we saw over $2 billion of flows in the first quarter in the first week of April. And now I'm pleased to say our total assets in alternative is $115 billion. We are witnessing even more and more demand for alternative products, as clients are looking to continue to re-risk. Some clients are re-risking through bar belling using some beta products. And in some cases using less, maybe, standard active equity strategy and are moving towards more what we would call a more evolved, more higher return active alternative products. So we -- growth continues in that space and we're continuing to make large investments in teams and in our platform in the alternative space. 
Ann Marie spoke about the scientific active equity team. I am pleased to say, in almost 80% of our products, we are witnessing positive returns. We still have some negative returns in our U.S. platform, but we are working tirelessly to rebuild the entire platform. We are seeing flows in our SAE business outside the U.S. and we believe this is going to be a much stronger product in the future as so much money as run away in this product, not just from us, from other firms, and we believe the opportunity in that product continues. 
We are going to continue to build out our investment teams. That's a big characteristic for the future. We have many -- we've talked to many people, in terms of building out fundamental equity teams and our fundamental fixed income teams. We continue to believe that global credit will become a very large component and we are very active in terms of rebuilding those teams. So despite our success, we are aggressively believing that we need to continue to build out our global footprint, not just in distribution, not just working with clients, but our entire manufacturing platform. 
BlackRock Solutions had a very, very strong first quarter. The momentum continues in the second quarter. 12 new assignments. Revenues were strong, a $128 million. We have a large pipeline of opportunities. I should note that we received a lot of attention, and I do believe we did an exceptional job in working with the Central Bank of Ireland in helping them understand the significance of their banking system, and the team who worked tirelessly in working with many -- with our client, the Central Bank of Ireland. But importantly with many other regulatory regimes that are involved. 
So we are building a stronger future. We are very constructive on the platform of Blackrock. I believe the first quarter was a very strong one that helped us validate our business model of multiproduct strategies. Our continued and relentless approach to making sure that alpha is the most prominent issue that we're faced everyday and the production of alpha, that does not change with growth. That does not change with our scale. But importantly, as we build that alpha, we are going to continue to build out our manufacturing teams. We do believe worldwide, clients are in need of more solution-based answers. We believe the political and economic issues around the world are only raising more questions as to how the clients should think about their portfolio. And we believe we are the best-suited firm in the world in asset management to work with our clients, in terms of solving these complex issues. 
Let me just add a few more things as an indicator of the strength and conviction that we have on our platform. We were very aggressive in building out our leadership team in the first quarter. We hired a new head of institutional client service in the U.S. We are aggressively building out our Blackrock Institute. This is a very important issue for us because as we grow our global footprint, as we grow our products worldwide, we need to make sure that we are connecting all this information and then redistributing this information to our portfolio teams, and importantly to our clients. And so we believe this is going to be one of the core cornerstones of BlackRock in the future. Having the Blackrock Institute become the area in which we bring all those information together. Understand when all the information that we are seeing mean, it should lead to better alpha production. But importantly, it should lead us to have more complex relationships with our client and helping our clients, in terms of understanding the dynamics of the world. 
We announced this week a new head of our real estate platform. We are very excited about this. This is an area that we were embarrassed in 2008, where we actually add this performance in 2010, and we continue to add this performance in 2011. And we are going to build this out, as we believe it is a great asset class, and we are very proud of the changes we're making there. We're adding many more people in our alternatives teams, I mentioned NTR. And I mentioned earlier, we are going to be aggressive and continue to build out our equity, fundamental equity and fundamental fixed income teams. 
So in closing, BlackRock is building a stronger global footprint. We're adding products. We see more opportunities. We're very pleased with the position we have with our clients worldwide now. And we're very excited about the future for BlackRock. I just want to thank all the employees for a really good quarter. And especially in terms of -- with all the noise in the world economies and the world political themes. We do believe that regulatory issues are going to be -- will still be with us for many months and years ahead of us and global uncertainty and global volatility is going to be probably more prevalent than we've seen in many years ahead. And having a global footprint, a global platform will allow us to navigate probably a little better than many other people.

We believe, on the retail side, on the defined contribution side, to name two areas we have enormous opportunities in the future. I would say only a few years ago we did not have a brand that was well understood or recognized in the retail channels. Each year, we're expanding. And as I said earlier, we need to really invest in that brand to continue to build out those channels to make it easier. We are seeing, worldwide, a distribution platforms limiting the amount of manufacturers that they have. There are 1 or 2 big events that is going to happen with some international distributors are going to reduce the amount of fee. Manufacturers, they're going to be working with, we believe, we'll be a part of that in those cases. So we see actually some of it are crowding out effect that's going to be happening in the manufacturing space. And what I'm trying to suggest is the large multiproduct platforms are going to grow probably significantly faster than a single-strategy platform. And so for me to give you a size, Mike, I believe we have just enormous opportunities in those areas. As you said, money is moving out of DB into DC. I think I said this at the end of the first quarter, we believe that trend will accelerate as the public funds are struggling with their defined benefit plans, and they're going to probably shift new employees into defined contribution plans away from the defined benefit plans. So that trend will continue, and I do believe we will be a big beneficiary of all that. And the whole impact of re-risking, as I said publicly many times in the last two quarters, investors are overweighted in fixed income because of fear. Underweighted in equities. And we believe having our beta products and our expanding alpha products in equities, we'll allow us to have more opportunities with more clients. Sue, do you want to add anything?"

This morning, as we report first quarter earnings, we're delivering a top line revenue story. Today, we announced earnings of $2.96. This is up 23% compared to a year ago, and those earnings are being driven by top line revenue growth of 14%. Our revenue growth is a combination of both market, but importantly strong organic growth. And we are seeing that organic growth, consistent with a number of the themes we've been discussing. We saw strong revenue growth related to retail close that both U.S. and internationally, and reflects the strength of those markets, as well as our relative share of those markets improving. 
We saw good close in our EPS business, iShares. And just a reminder that, that business, in the first quarter, is usually seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. We see good revenues in multi-asset products as clients are seeking people to solve their problems and help them manage risk, not just managed assets. And we are seeing good revenues from alternatives, both slated to the performance in alternatives, and forward into alternative. And that's a trend that investors continue to separate alpha from beta. 
The first quarter was also a quarter of a number of important milestones. We increased our dividend by 37.5%. We increased our credit facility by $1 billion to $3.5 billion, and extended the maturities for five years. While we have no plans to use the credit facility, we think it's an important source of long-term flexibility. Our merger-related concentration flows are, at this point, largely behind us. The first quarter is the lowest quarter since the merger. We have only one $9 billion outflow, that's relatively low revenue from a single client remaining in the pipeline, and we've got no other known concentration confirmed. 
With respect to our long-only quant [quantitative] product, the near-term performance is going to take time to work its way into the medium and longer term track record. With that in mind, we did budget for outflows in 2011, and we are seeing outflows in our U.S. and global products. At the same time, we're beginning to see inflows into regional quant products, where we have had good performance. And so we do believe, quant, is an opportunity going forward. And I wanted to see what our quant hedge funds which are performing well and attracting assets from our long-only quant. The pipeline is strong with a high-quality of revenue and Larry is going to talk much more about that. 
And finally, of note that on April 1, we were added to the S&P 500 index. And on the date of inclusion, we were the 75th largest company in the index. 
I'm going to walk through a number of the slides starting with Slide 1. Our operating income which is shown in the left-hand side of the chart of $819 million was up 13% compared to a year ago, with net income and EPS both up 23%. With respect to margins shown on Slide 2, on the far right-hand side. Our margin came in 39.1%. That was up from the first quarter a year ago. And just the fourth quarter margin as a reminder reflected a peak period of performance fee loss. 
Our comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 35.4% consistent with where we've been running for a very long time. We do remain confident in both top line growth combined with a good margin, as we continue to seek efficiencies and realize the benefits of scale. Just a couple of examples from the quarter, late in the first quarter, we migrated a number of our data centers in Snohomish facility in Washington state. We're going to benefit from doing this by lower cost power. 
Another example is, we have been consolidating our operating functions into Centers of Excellence which will benefit from scale and following the sun. At the same time, we're investing in the firm bringing in some great new talents and capability, something Larry is going to spend time talking about. 
On Slide 3, with strong markets and all in all, we continue to benefit from improving markets. On Slide 4, on the far right-hand side, it was laid out the key components of our earnings per share. Earnings per share of $2.96 included operating earnings of $2.93. That's $2.79. That $2.79 included $0.06 associated with the successful launch of a $1 billion closed-end funds investing in commodities and energy. We have a tax adjustment of $0.12 that was related to resolution of certain tax matters and $0.05 of nonoperating earnings. If you take the $2.96 and you exclude the closed end, as well as the tax adjustment, we still had earnings of $2.90 in the quarter. 
Compared to the fourth quarter -- compared to the first quarter a year ago, you can see the business grew across all dimensions. And compared to the fourth quarter, we had growth in the base business, fewer onetime costs, offset by a period with fewer performance fee loss. The first quarter as adjusted tax rate was 33% before considering the $24 million tax adjustment. That brought the quarterly rate down to 30.1%. 
Speaking of revenues now, as shown on Page 6. Year-over-year revenues were 14%. I'm going to talk about base fees in a minute by really starting with performance fees. Performance fees in the quarter came in strong at $83 million. That reflected both strong relative performance on a number of equity accounts, as well as the strength of our alternative platforms. We have good performance across our single strategy hedge funds. And also of note, at this point, over 2/3 of our hedge fund of funds are above the high watermark that compares to about 20% a year ago. 
We had strong BRS revenues of $128 million. We continue to grow the base Aladdin business. We continue to win and implement new advisory assignments. We're beginning to see the run-off of some of our long-term liquidation assignments. This reflects the opportunity for holders to benefit from improved valuations and liquidity on the underlying assets, and it's a trend we expect to continue. Included in the AUM price line is $15 billion in new long-term disposition assignment. And there is active interest across-the-board on Aladdin, so we feel great about the BRS opportunity going forward. 
Moving on to base fees. And as shown on Slide 8, really, base fees improved 13% year-over-year across all long dated asset classes. Compared to fourth quarter, as shown on Slide 9, we had a $33 million or 2% increase in base fees, and that is despite the drag of two fewer days in the quarter worth about $40 million. When I talk about retail and U.S. and international strength that comes through in the $27 million of revenue associated with active equity product. You can also see the growth in alternatives and multi-asset that I mentioned. 
With respect to EPS, we are seeing trends inflows which reflects the rotation into equity. Rotation into yield products. We are seeing strong global growth. And that reflects international clients both coming into U.S. products, as well as domestic products. Just for transparency's sake and thinking about our institutional index assets, those assets can be high-velocity assets. Clients sometimes just parks their money in an index while they decide what they're doing longer-term. That can result in high-volume inflows as well as high-volume outflows which have relatively low revenue impact. So beginning in the fourth quarter, we've separated this out clearly in the press release so you can really see the impact of those revenues and flows. 
Moving on to expenses which are shown on Slide 10 and 11. Compared to a year ago, expenses are up $195 million, about 15% up consistent with the growth in the Base business. G&A is up $85 million, really, three key drivers from one cost of $19 million that I talked about earlier, $20 million of asset-free measurement and $28 million of marketing and travel expense. Compared to the fourth quarter, expenses are down $68 million or about 4%. Compensation costs were relatively stable at about $800 million, where we had lower direct incentives and bonus, offset by the fact that we hired more people. First quarter was at peak payroll taxes associated with our bonus payout and we are beginning to reflect the new stock awards into our expense. 
G&A was down $69 million. Despite the $19 million closed-end one cost, we didn't repeat a number of the unique cost that we experienced in the fourth quarter. A couple of what you'll recall, which was really the establishment of a charitable fund and the onetime regulatory fee to the asset management you pay in the industry, both of which were about $20 million. 
Nonoperating income which is shown on Slide 12 was $14 million, that which $43 million of investment gain across all asset classes, partially offset by net interest expense of $29 million. The value of our investment portfolio is stable at about $1 billion or $940 million excluding headwind-related items. Really, the gains in the portfolio were offset by net distribution down to the portfolios to the values of the investment are about stable. And these investments, as you know, were a pro-investments alongside our clients or seeding of new products to everything we're doing here is aligned with our clients interest. 
With respect to cash flow, we're generating substantial cash flow and returning a meaningful portion of that cash to shareholders. As shown on Slide 13, we did increase the dividend from $4 annualized to $5.50 to 37.5% I mentioned earlier. And in the quarter, that resulted in a 48% payout. We still have repurchase authority of 4.2 million shares. We didn't do any repurchases in the first quarter but we have given notice to redeem our convertible debt, which is likely to result in those investors converting those shares in common and increasing our flows by a small amount. 
We are still very conscious about flows since we've been included in the S&P 500. We want to continue to meet the criteria which got us included. And at the same time, we would like to begin repurchasing shares at a minimum of our anti-dilutive, and we're going to seek the opportunity to buyback shares in ways that won't materially disturb our flows. We don't have any plans for material M&A or investments that would be dragged. And believe me, we don't want to have idle assets on our balance sheet over extended periods of time. 
So wrapping up, the first quarter is indeed the growth story. We entered 2011, delivering double-digit earnings growth, fueled by top line revenue growth. We delivered a healthy margin, generated substantial cash flow and returned a large portion of that cash flow to shareholders. We feel great about our business model. We feel very strongly that we are well-positioned strategically, relative to the global plan, and that is already reflected in our pipeline and gives us great confidence in our future growth opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,129813992,116572,"BlackRock, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. As we reflect on our first quarter, it became very evident to me that BlackRock has come together as one firm. Cultural and business integration from our BGI merger is totally behind us and our success this pa",2630,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. As we reflect on our first quarter, it became very evident to me that BlackRock has come together as one firm. Cultural and business integration from our BGI merger is totally behind us and our success this past quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, demonstrates that our business momentum is accelerating. BlackRock's broad range of products, our worldwide business footprint, our solutions in risk management approach to our clients' needs, have allowed BlackRock to serve our clients with more opportunities enlarge and enhance our client relationships. 
As BlackRock feels more comprehensive relationships with our clients, we are expanding our product offerings, both in Beta and Alpha and more investment solutions. Our relationships are becoming larger and more substantial with many, many of our clients worldwide. 
As Ann Marie stated, our earnings were $2.96, up 24% year-to-year strictly driven by organic long-dated asset growth, beta obviously. But more importantly, by our expanding product mix. And also as we said at the end of last year, by what we are seeing more frequently re-risking by our clients moving into equities and moving into alternatives. And BlackRock is playing a larger role in that than we've ever done before. And this is leading to revenue growth of 14% year-to-year. 
And I should note, unlike so many other financial institutions who are recording, our earnings growth is fueled by revenue growth. A 100% of our revenues is driven by client business Ann Marie spoke about that. Our business model is not going to change. We'll use our balance sheet only to co-investment with our clients and seed products. We are not using our balance sheet to compete. And importantly, we intend to use all excess cash flows, in the form of dividends, and as Ann-Marie spoke about, to buyback shares when it's -- especially the shares that are being created for employee plan. And as Ann Marie spoke about, we didn't raise our standby credit facility. If there's any events that need us to take advantage of opportunities and repurchasing shares. 
Let me review our quarter. Our headline at AUM is $3,648,000,000,000. This has been led principally by our multi-asset class product growth, which grew by about $22.4 billion. Which $6.8 billion of it is in our fiduciary assignments and $16.8 billion of growth in our Defined Contribution business, principally through our LifePath products. And we continue to have more and more opportunities working with our clients in these products whether it is LDI, and/or just more complex relationships and having beta and alpha. And as I said, it is increasing product mix that isn't global -- that is global allows us to have a much more comprehensive relationship in terms of asset allocation, mixes of products, how does one look at the risk and how should one design a portfolio run-on liabilities. 
One of our most important jobs for the future is going to be a continuation of building our brand. We need to continue to build our brand recognition worldwide. This is going to be a big and aggressive campaign over the next five years. We believe this will demonstrate the growth of the platform and it will allow us to continue to grow worldwide. I have to emphasize worldwide growth although we are still seeing tremendous growth in the United States but as the world continues to grow faster outside the United States in parts of Asia and South America, we continue to build up that platform. It has to be away from dollar-based assets, so there has to be more in local currencies. And in doing so, we need to continue to build out that brand and the brand recognition as we expand our footprint worldwide. 
A good indication of how our brand recognition is being enhanced and also a good indication of the ability to grow in multiple channels, I'd like to highlight our retail channels in the first quarter. In terms of long-term asset growth, our U.S. retail platform and long-term assets grew by $7.4 billion.  Our international retail channels and long-dated assets grew by $6.3 billion, so a total of close to $14 billion in terms of assets in the first quarter. I should also note, fixed income long-term assets grew $8.5 billion and equities, getting back to the  re-risking, grew by $10.5 billion in the first quarter. 
In our iShares products, we continue to see very good momentum. And if you look at a year-over-year type of growth to the fourth quarter, generally is a sometimes low to no growth, after expanding growth in the fourth quarter. And if you add our growth in April and our growth April to date and our growth in the first quarter, it's over $12 billion. And it includes the iPath products. We are growing in every product in our iShares platform, except our emerging equity markets ETF. This is where we actually had bad tracking error last year. I am pleased to say that it has been fixed. We put a lot of emphasis on it. And in the last few weeks, we have begun to see a reversal from outflows to a multibillion-dollar inflows in that product. 
So the first quarter for our iShares product was strong and we continue to believe there's going to be more and more opportunity. What's interesting to note and we said this in the fourth quarter, but we're seeing it even more so in the first quarter, I do believe ETF flows is a good forward indicator of where asset allocation is going. And we began to see a shift out of fixed income into equities at the beginning -- in the third quarter last year, but that's accelerating. And we are seeing actually more growth now in equity ETF than we did in fixed income. So this is another example to us that clients are re-risking and why, I think I've been probably talking about why we believe equities will continue to rally. 
Long-term flows, as Ann Marie stated, grew by close to $35 billion. This has been offset by an outflow of $24 billion in our Cash Management business. Our flows are representative of the industry. With the shortage of short-term treasuries, we see rates below five basis points. This is a business that will continue to flounder during these low rate environments. We are constructive about it. We, actually, in the first quarter of those soft flows -- positive flows in the institutional side and we saw very large negative flows more in the retail side. 
And so we are building our market share in terms of institutional and it's not representative with our growth of $24 billion in our outflows in cash. But we are building market share institutionally and we are certainly seeing some substantial line downs in the retail side. And much of this is because in many cases, the retail platforms are migrating from money market funds to bank deposits. Bank deposits are higher in yield in money market funds, even at a time when banks are having a little success in terms of C&I loans, they're may be using the deposit for buying short-term treasuries or mortgage securities, but they're willing to pay more than money markets can afford. 
So that trend is not going to change anytime soon. And so this is going to be an area that will have a drag on our flows, albeit this is low-fee business, and what I'm trying to stress is the revenue from the very, very high-fee businesses that we are demonstrating. 
In addition, as Ann Marie suggested, in our BlackRock Advisory business, BlackRock Solutions, we are paying to our clients the principal paybacks in interest. And so as you witnessed now in the last few quarters, a decay in the Advisory business, this is a little over $4.5  billion a quarter. And once again, this is what we expect will continue. And yet in our pipeline, which I'll talk about in a minute where there is a big win in the Advisory business. 
I should talk about merger-related outflows, as Ann Marie suggested, it slowed a little more than $18 billion. We are not going to report merger-related activity again. We believe this is principally over. We are forecasting and telling you that there is, in our pipeline, another $9 billion. But this reporting is over. It will all be net. We believe we can look forward to growth now and we don't see any of the concentration issues that we had before. 
Let me just talk about our pipeline. $82.4 billion of pipeline winds. This represents also the netting of the $9 billion of outflows in it. So this is a net number in our pipeline. I'd like to really emphasize one important characteristic about our pipeline, $60.7 billion of that pipeline is long dated. I'm also pretty pleased to say 55% is in beta products and 45% is in active alpha products. So a very strong pipeline of wind in the long-dated products. $6.2 billion was money that left last quarter in the last few days in our money market funds, then it went back into money market funds. And then we did win a $15.5 billion advisory assignment in our BlackRock Solutions business. 
Over the last few quarters, we said we're going to be expanding our product mix, especially in alternatives. We have been very active in the first quarter. We brought in a team from NTR for alternative energy. We are adding more single-strategy alternative products. And importantly, we saw over $2 billion of flows in the first quarter in the first week of April. And now I'm pleased to say our total assets in alternative is $115 billion. We are witnessing even more and more demand for alternative products, as clients are looking to continue to re-risk. Some clients are re-risking through bar billing using some beta products. And in some cases using less, maybe, standard active equity strategy and are moving towards more what we would call a more evolved, more higher return active alternative products. So we -- growth continues in that space and we're continuing to make large investments in teams and in our platform in the alternative space. 
Ann Marie spoke about the scientific active equity team. I am pleased to say, in almost 80% of our products, we are witnessing positive returns. We still have some negative returns in our U.S. platform, but we are working tirelessly to rebuild the entire platform. We are seeing flows in our SAE business outside the U.S. and we believe this is going to be a much stronger product in the future as so much money has run away in this product, not just from us, from other firms, and we believe the opportunity in that product continues. 
We are going to continue to build out our investment teams. That's a big characteristic for the future. We have many -- we've talked to many people, in terms of building out fundamental equity teams and our fundamental fixed income teams. We continue to believe that global credit will become a very large component and we are very active in terms of rebuilding those teams. So despite our success, we are aggressively believing that we need to continue to build out our global footprint, not just in distribution, not just working with clients, but our entire manufacturing platform. 
BlackRock Solutions had a very, very strong first quarter. The momentum continues in the second quarter. 12 new assignments. Revenues were strong, a $128 million. We have a large pipeline of opportunities. I should note that we received a lot of attention, and I do believe we did an exceptional job in working with the Central Bank of Ireland in helping them understand the significance of their banking system, and the team who worked tirelessly in working with many -- with our client, the Central Bank of Ireland. But importantly with many other regulatory regimes that are involved. 
So we are building a stronger future. We are very constructive on the platform of Blackrock. I believe the first quarter was a very strong one that helped us validate our business model of multiproduct strategies. Our continued and relentless approach to making sure that alpha is the most prominent issue that were faced everyday and the production of alpha, that does not change with growth. That does not change with our scale. But importantly, as we build that alpha, we are going to continue to build out our manufacturing teams. We do believe worldwide, clients are in need of more solution-based answers. We believe the political and economic issues around the world are only raising more questions as to how the clients should think about their portfolio. And we believe we are the best-suited firm in the world in asset management to work with our clients, in terms of solving these complex issues. 
Let me just add a few more things as an indicator of the strength and conviction that we have on our platform. We were very aggressive in building out our leadership team in the first quarter. We hired a new head of institutional client service in the U.S. We are aggressively building out our Blackrock Institute. This is a very important issue for us because as we grow our global footprint, as we grow our products worldwide, we need to make sure that we are connecting all this information and then redistributing this information to our portfolio teams, and importantly to our clients. And so we believe this is going to be one of the core cornerstones of BlackRock in the future. Having the Blackrock Institute become the area in which we bring all those information together. Understand what all the information that we are seeing means, it should lead to better alpha production. But importantly, it should lead us to have more complex relationships with our client and helping our clients, in terms of understanding the dynamics of the world. 
We announced this week a new head of our real estate platform. We are very excited about this. This is an area that we were embarrassed in 2008, where we actually add this performance in 2010, and we continue to add this performance in 2011. And we are going to build this out, as we believe it is a great asset class, and we are very proud of the changes we're making there. We're adding many more people in our alternatives teams, I mentioned NTR. And I mentioned earlier, we are going to be aggressive and continue to build out our equity, fundamental equity and fundamental fixed income teams. 
So in closing, BlackRock is building a stronger global footprint. We're adding products. We see more opportunities. We're very pleased with the position we have with our clients worldwide now. And we're very excited about the future for BlackRock. I just want to thank all the employees for a really good quarter. And especially in terms of -- with all the noise in the world economies and the world political themes. We do believe that regulatory issues are going to be -- will still be with us for many months and years ahead of us and global uncertainty and global volatility is going to be probably more prevalent than we've seen in many years ahead. And having a global footprint, a global platform will allow us to navigate probably a little better than many other people. 
And I would like to just thank all our new shareholders who came on board with their offering in November. And I believe your first two quarters of ownership have proven to be successful. And with that, thank you. let's open it up for questions."

And when you look at, whether it's the international distribution, you guys announced relationship with Mizuho, you mentioned the DC opportunity and you see more and more DB plan shifting. I guess when you look in some of those opportunities and where you are today versus what's still out there? Is there any way you can gauge or size that up, in terms of whether it's market share or -- just how you can continue to sustain the growth? It looks like that you're producing it but just so you can size any of those markets up?"

We believe, on the retail side, on the defined contribution side, to name two areas we have enormous opportunities in the future. I would say only a few years ago we did not have a brand that was well understood or recognized in the retail channels. Each year, we're expanding. And as I said earlier, we need to really invest in that brand to continue to build out those channels to make it easier. We are seeing, worldwide, a distribution platforms limiting the amount of manufacturers that they have. There are one or two big events that is going to happen with some international distributors are going to reduce the amount of fee. Manufacturers, they're going to be working with, we believe, we'll be a part of that in those cases. So we see actually somewhat of a crowding out effect that's going to be happening in the manufacturing space. And what I'm trying to suggest is the large multiproduct platforms are going to grow probably significantly faster than a single-strategy platforms. And so for me to give you a size, Mike, I believe we have just enormous opportunities in those areas. As you said, money is moving out of DB into DC. I think I said this at the end of the first quarter, we believe that trend will accelerate as the public funds are struggling with their defined benefit plans, and they're going to probably shift new employees into defined contribution plans away from the defined benefit plans. So that trend will continue, and I do believe we will be a big beneficiary of all that. And the whole impact of re-risking, as I said publicly many times in the last two quarters, investors are overweighted in fixed income because of fears. Underweighted in equities. And we believe having our beta products and our expanding alpha products in equities, we'll allow us to have more opportunities with more clients. Sue, do you want to add anything?"

And so, I think our numbers internationally are skewed by some of that. But we believe over the long run, and this is just an investment for the future as GDP grows, as savings grows, opportunities will prevail. And so you're right in asserting that we're still seeing more growth in the United States, that's a fact. We are witnessing more growth now in South America and the opportunities we have there.

That's a 27% compared to a year ago, driven by a 16% growth in revenue and by margin expansion. 
Second quarter demonstrated continued execution of our revenue growth story. With our global platform, broad set of products and risk capability, we are very well-positioned to work with our clients to what's proving to be a very uncertain times. During the second quarter, we continue to see volatility and persistent low interest rate. With that, we have claims coming to us seeking multi-assets and share Solutions, yield-oriented products and advice on dealing with uncertainty and risk return pay off. As a result, we generated a record level of base fees in the second quarter.
Also in the second quarter, we bought back remaining 13.6 million shares that Bank of America held for $2.5 billion. With this transaction completed, we're widely held for nearly 60% of the shares set with a broad diverse set of shareholders. We funded the transaction with $1.5 billion of long-term debt and $500 million of commercial paper and $500 million of cash, and at the same time, the rating agencies affirmed our strong credit-rating.
I'm going to referred to some of the slides and the supplement for the earnings release. And starting on Slide 1, you can see that operating income for the quarter was $883 million. That was up 19% from the year ago and 8% from the first quarter, really driving the growth in EPS. So the EPS story is an operating result story.
Looking at Page 2, you can see our operating margin, which I think demonstrates our focus on thoughtful investment. The operating margin came in at 39.7%, that's up from the second quarter margin by almost a full percentage point. It's also up from the full year 2010 margin of 39.3% and from the first quarter margin of 39.1%. Our cost to revenue ratio for the quarter came in at 34.4%, which is consistent with our long term range of 35%.
The second quarter is in the context of a marketing environment which adds really reflected in the S&P 500 and shown on Page 3, is up about 16% compared to a year ago. But 2011 has been a period of volatility, and through that volatility, average market in the first quarter are actually just about equal to average markets in the second quarter, which says that the earnings growth from first to second quarter is not coming from market.
The growth in EPS compared to 2010, as well as compared to the first quarter, was driven by operating results. You can see that on Page 5 of the deck. Earnings per share, which was $3, included $3.09 of operating earnings. Earning state benefit in the quarter, a partial quarter benefit of about $0.07 from the share repurchase. Nonoperating results were about, well, $0.09 of expense. So different thing from EPS. 
If you look at Page 11, it lays out the comparison relative to the first quarter where operating growth contributed $0.30 of EPS growth and was offset partially by lower gains on investments in the first quarter than in the first quarter, and also the non-recurrence of a 1x tax adjustment in the  first quarter that had contributed about $0.12.
The second quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32.4%, the GAAP tax rate was 26.2% and the GAAP tax rate reflected the noncash effect of legislative changes in New Jersey on the value of our deferred tax liability.
Looking at revenues, you can see total revenues on right-hand column of Page 7 at $2.3 billion. First quarter revenues were up 16% from 2010, primarily driven by base fees, and I'm going to talk about base fees in a second. Performance fees came in at $50 million, very consistent with performance fees a year ago, and were equally driven by strong relative performance of our equity product and by the strength of our alternative platform. 
BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues remained strong at $116 million, including growth in our Aladdin revenues, the continued, really, unwind or runoff of the liquidation assignments and continued good work on the advisory side that the uncertain environment is bringing opportunity.
Moving on to base fees on Slide 8. Base fees were $2.1 billion, and were up 17% from 2010 and 6% from the first quarter. When you look at the growth in base fees, you can see that it was across all long dated asset classes. It's partially offset by a decrease in revenues on cash products, claims continues to pull out the low yielding money market funds. 
And if you look at the top of the page, you can see that we have a well-diversified mix of revenues. And our mix of revenues is really reflective of the breadth of our product offering, where we can work with clients for Solutions, whether it's equity, fixed income, alternatives, multi-assets, active or passive, this diversity provide a diversity of revenues and diversity of Solutions for our clients.
The second quarter compared to the first quarter is laid out on Page 14. Second quarter base fee growth likewise was driven by AUM growth and shows growth across all long dated asset classes. Second quarter revenue on base fees included $134 million of sec lending revenues. Sec lending revenues are strongest in the second quarter due to the European dividends at this season. But also sec lending revenues were up 24% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting its margin it's more than just a seasonal effect. There's also some returns we're taking because we have higher AUM loan balances, as well as higher lending spread gecko.
Also, our revenue story is very stronger than the AUM story due to favorable mix of business. The basis points earned on business won was about 2 basis points higher than the business points on business lost. As a result, organic revenue growth is running about several organic AUM growth in the quarter. And further, if you exclude the seasonal effect of sec lending on our average basis points, average basis points have improved along dated assets every quarter since the BGI Transaction.
It's good at this point to be getting rid of some of the new [indiscernible] in that difference between AUM and revenue, in that our last merger-related outflows is now behind us, and have been enough pipeline for the last several quarters, and that is done. So those are done for good, and the 1 factor that will stay with us is the institutional index assets can have large flows in the AUM with relatively small revenue affect.
Moving on to expenses, which you can see on Page 9, expenses were $1.4 billion, that's up 13% from 2010. Remember that in that contracts of 16% growth in revenue, and they were exactly equal to the expenses in the first quarter. So those, that Expense Management again is what's contributing to the margin expansion. And we mentioned on previously that BlackRock had entered into new lease for office space in the City of London. It's about a 300,000 square-foot building, and it's going to allow us to really take the people that got spread across 2 different buildings, bringing them into a single, world-class asset management environment, which will going to be better able to serve our clients and really work much more effectively as a single[indiscernible]. The lending headquarters is actually going to be our largest single office, and earlier this month, we began occupancy of that office. We expect to relocate the majority of the people into the office sometime during the third quarter, and as a result of exiting our existing London location, we'll be considering a 1x acceleration of the remaining lease obligation sometime in the second half of the year. 
Given those are relatively short pieces left, we are making assumptions right now that we won't have a sublease on those, and depending on exactly when we exit and how much space we continue to use for what period of time, we're estimating a charge in the range of $75 million to $100 million.
Moving on to the nonoperating side of results, and you can see those on Page 17. We have nonoperating expenses of $27 million. It is actually reflected a $10 million gain on the investment portfolio, which included positive mark on our private equity co-investment, offset partially by negative marks on distressed credit where we saw the spreads on our product widen. 
Just as a reminder, that portfolio still stands about where it was in the second quarter, $1 billion, about $930 million after considering hedges, and all of those investments are either feed or co-investments. So there's no proprietary activity reflected in those results. 
Net interest expense came in at $37 million. That did include one month of interest expense associated with the new debt we put on with a share repurchase.
Slide 18, this business model continues to generate substantial cash flow. We're using that cash flow toward shareholders, that's reflected in our 44% dividend pay out ratio as well as the share repurchase we just completed. We still do have share repurchase authority of 4.2 million shares and we also, in the second quarter, completed the redemption of our convertible debt.
So just wrapping up my comment, yes, we're delivering double-digit earnings growth. The earnings growth is being fueled by top line revenue growth combined with margin expansion. So operating results are what's driving the business. And we feel, particularly in the time of uncertainty in the external environment, that we are especially well-positioned to deliver our business model to our clients to help them solve their problems and to continue to drive that top line growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

More than ever, the global political and economic issues investors are facing has created confusion, uncertainty and ultimate retrenchment.

More than ever, the global political and economic issues investors are facing has created confusion, uncertainty and ultimate retrenchment. Investors worldwide, Retail and Institutional, are seeking more advice. In many cases, more handholding and investment strategies and portfolio allocation. 
Investors in the last quarter, and I think more so going forward, are seeking more BlackRock advice. With the global platform, multi-products, a risk management and our thought leadership, BlackRock is very well-positioned to assist our clients worldwide. 
Some of our clients are actually derisking. I don't agree with them, but some of our clients are derisking, and are slowing down there invested investment decisions. Some other client of ours are looking at this as an opportunity, looking to take advantage of some capitulation from other investors. 
And what is driving much of this confusion and uncertainty is politics globally. I believe the private sector is doing a very good job, evident by growth in earnings, and yet what is the greatest inhibitor to the economic vitality right now of Europe and the United States is essentially politics. We are not -- we have to face this great uncertainty as politicians determine the outcomes of in the United States or for deficits, our debt ceiling, which puts greater uncertainty for businesses, that's greater uncertainty about job creation and we need to move beyond this. Nevertheless, it is very impressive for me to watch how corporate earnings continue to be driven. And importantly, this is why I believe those customers who are derisking, and there are many customers who are derisking because they're focusing on today's headline, I think it's a mistake. And we are discussing this with all our clients. 
In Europe, where I believe there is even greater problems ahead of ourselves, is the fact that external forces are forcing countries to change their behavior, changing their standard of living and are forcing these changes of standard of living without ever discussing the possibility of bondholders getting less than par. I don't look at that as a positive outcome. I don't believe that external parties can force the governments to devalue their standard of living, devalue their countries without everyone sharing in these losses and these restructuring. 
As we look at other restructuring of other countries, whether it is Argentina or Brazil or for that matter, Iceland, they have the ability to devalue their currencies and everyone shared, including the bondholders, in terms of the cost of the restructuring. And many of these countries have vibrant economies today. But when you place all of the positive restructuring on the back of the populace, in my opinion, it's going to lead to severe social unrest over the course of the years to come, and this is one of the things that I'm most nervous about. 
It is these issues, these political issues, that are creating such rate uncertainty, it is these issues that is creating opportunities. And I do believe BlackRock, with our platform, is helping our clients try to understand the ramifications. I do believe long term were able to overcome these issues, and I remain steadfastly bullish on opportunities in global equity markets.
Let me discuss BlackRock and how we performed over the quarter. As we discussed over the last few quarters, we are focused on building a stronger and broader relationship with our clients. Despite the volatility that I spoke about and the uncertainty in the marketplaces, our revenues and our product mix with our clients are increasing. This is what we are going to be focusing on in the future. We believe with this broad product mix that we have great opportunities to be increasing our revenues, and at times, which may mean reducing our AUM if that's what it takes. And so we are looking to have a more complete relationship with our clients, which will awfully drive revenues and profitability for BlackRock, and most importantly, will drive a more comprehensive relationship with our client. And that is our strategy, and our strategy has shown in the second quarter that it's working. 
Clients, because of these uncertainty are looking for more customized strategies. Some of our clients are [indiscernible] they're adding more beta strategies to answer their portfolio and higher return office of strategies. These strategies, along with multi-asset class products, we're building these relationships and revenues with our clients. And this is how we will continue to build out our relationship going forward. I believe more steadfastly than ever, our 1 BlackRock business model, a comprehensive platform worldwide intersecting products worldwide, intersecting a 1 BlackRock community is a strategy that will allow us to build those relationships through BlackRock. 
Clients are looking for our International intersecting focus. Even if we are doing only business in Japan with the yen-like products, they are looking to BlackRock, not to compete with local managers. They're looking for BlackRock to be additive in a global perspective, and that may lead us to having opportunities in investing in yen products. But most importantly, it will allow us to have a more comprehensive dialogue. And when our clients in Japan or China or Italy are looking for greater opportunities beyond their local community and local markets, they look to BlackRock to help with them. And I believe this 1 BlackRock platform is allowing this. We just completed a leadership retreat, bringing our community of our leaders together. And I have never been more proud of our leadership in terms of building this 1 BlackRock community.
At the end of the second quarter, AUM, $3.6 trillion. We had growth and long dated assets about $34 billion, of which $18 billion is new net assets. We saw some extreme outflows, which is industrywide in terms of cash. This is an industry issue related to 0 interest rates in the short end, and most importantly, the uncertainty about money market funds related to ownership in some European financial institutions and commercial paper. BlackRock is very well-positioned, our risk management team has done an incredible job in navigating this and we have been working with our client steadfastly in terms of helping them understand the portfolios of our cash management. Nevertheless, we are still, like the industry, seeing outflows there.
On the advisory side where we had more than normal outflows, that was related to clients returning some of the assets back into the marketplace. I can't get into the raw details. I think most people are aware of some of our clients who are visibly selling some of their products into the marketplace today. And so we are part of that. But our advisory business has never been robust. The opportunities we have in advisory, which we'll talk about in a minute, is very, very strong. 
1 area that I'd like everyone to focus on is our growth in our multi-asset category, where we have assets growing about 11% or about $23 billion. This is what I've been talking about. Our assets, our multi-asset is now $231 billion. AUM in fixed income grew nicely about $27 billion, 50% of it in index, 50% in active, some of the EPS, some of it is just indexed. 
In equities, we still have some outflows in our scientific active equity. However, I'll talk about in a minute, we see a dramatic turnaround in the future prospects of that business, which I'll talk about in a minute. 
And as Ann Marie discussed, we had the last of our merger-related outflows, and we believe as this is not going to be a component of our quarterly call ever again.
Pipeline, a robust $84.3 billion. What is impressive for me, $71 billion or 84% of it is long dated products. It highlights in my mind the strength of the platform and the opportunities ahead of us. 
Let me talk about 3 areas that I think are worth noting. The first one is iShares. We're seeing more and more flows worldwide moving into ETFs. Much of this, in my opinion, is related to the great global uncertainty clients are looking for more liquidity as they tactically allocate, and ETF are a great vehicle for liquid tactical allocation. And so as an industry, the ETF assets grew by $50 billion, up $10 billion from last year. At the same period, mutual fund flows year-to-year fell dramatic from the growth rates of 2010 to 2011. Now I don't believe those are good approximations of the dynamics of the business because so much of the ETF business is institutional. And as I said, tactical allocation purposes. But I do believe we are going to continue to see large-scale growth in global ETFs, and there's no other firm that is well-positioned in terms of global ETFs in country funds, in fixed income products, and we work on many other types of products in the ETF realm. 
And one other thing that I'd like to note, despite all the noise, despite all of all the article about active ETFs, and BlackRock will be joining and building many active ETFs, I should just put it, give everyone a good indicator, out of the $50 billion of net new business in ETF is an industry, only $800 million of it was active ETFs. 
So as you see more and more funds going into active ETFs, in the first few years, that means the industry is going to lose money in it. It will be very hard to make much money in active ETFs until you start seeing greater growth rates. I do believe the predominance of ETFs will always be the index base. And I also do believe you're going to see clients starting to understand us, regulatory rules change in the EPS space, that going to be a great differentiation between ETF and ETN. This is a big issue in Europe. Every regulator in Europe is very, very introspective as to how people look at ETFs and ETNs. And I think there's going to have much greater discipline disclosure and/or maybe restrictions in terms of ETNs. That will put BlackRock iShares in a great position, although if regulatory changes occur.
On our scientific model-driven equity business. As you know, we had very poor performance for almost 3 years. The industry had poor performance in the last 3 years. The industry saw dramatic outflows as a result of the underperformance. I am pleased to say, not only as BlackRock model driven team has done an extraordinary job, but the industry has done a good job too.  There has been a vast reversal in the business in terms of performance. Our domestic product, which was our laggard at BlackRock is outperformed by over 140 basis points this year, and our global and our Asian model-driven scientific equity is outperformed by hundreds and hundreds of basis points. I believe we're going to see a change in flows that could be dramatic. We're going in a pace of performance similar to the experiences of 2004, and that was the beginning of great inflows in that product. And so we are very pleased with our team and Ken Kroner, navigating and stabilizing performance, rebuilding the team, rebuilding the enthusiasm, and now over the course of the next 6 months to a year, hopefully, we could rebuild flows.
Multi-asset products continue to be an area where clients, both Retail and Institutional, are looking for. We believe this will continue, whether they're in equities and fixed income, and we believe we're very well-positioned as more and more money goes into these categories.
BlackRock Solutions, we won 10 net new assignments in the quarter. We had 3 new Aladdin assignments. Just yesterday, we won another very large Aladdin assignment. Much of this is being driven in Europe. The opportunities we have in Europe has never been greater. We have some very large proposals with our clients right now in the Aladdin space and in the fiduciary adviser space. As you know, all those noise in Europe is presenting great opportunity for BlackRock, and hopefully, similar to the work we did in Ireland that we could play a role in the working workout of the severe issues that Europe is facing.
As Ann Marie discussed, our margins grew to 39.7%. This is something that we focus on a great deal. And our margins grew in the last quarter. And yet, if you think about all the new businesses we're getting to, all the new hires we've made, we're investing more for tomorrow, we're investing it more today for future revenues than anytime in the history of BlackRock. 
In the last few quarters, we hired a new Head of real estate; we hired a new Head of the BlackRock Institute, which I'll talk about in a minute; a new Head of Communications and Branded; a new Head of Private Equity; Alternative Energy; Asia's fundamental equity leader. We are building a more robust team worldwide than we've ever done before. This is expensive. And yet, our margins are increasing. And we believe these investments are going to be very strong. So as I always said, when you look at margins, we always look at margins, we need to make sure our margins continue to grow as our business gross, but we need to make sure that we're building for a better future. And I think I could soundly tell you we're building for a better future with higher probabilities of greater revenues. And yet, we are increasing our margins. And this is one of the key elements that I believe is really important for BlackRock and BlackRock shareholders this year. 
As I mentioned, the BlackRock Institute, this is something that we believe BlackRock is becoming a leader on in terms of thought leadership. We created a sovereign credit index that receives a lot of notoriety. We just came out with a new piece on our use of China. This is our investment platform working together and coming on thought-provoking pieces. And I believe we will become more dominant in terms of trying to focus on issues and ideas related to the markets.
Just this week, as a help to our clients, we had over 1,200 clients on a phone call this week asking us questions related to the what if there's a default in U.S. Treasuries and what does that mean. And so we're seeing more and more clients looking to BlackRock to help them understand this global uncertainty.
As I said repeatedly, branding is going to become a more important component of what we're about. As I said earlier, we are going to spend a great deal of money in building out our brand over the next 5 years. I'm thrilled in the progress we've been making in terms of building a global brand. But this is just the beginning, and I believe our job in the future is to make sure that our end customer understands who and what BlackRock is. And so we're going to have not just a well-known brand institutionally, but a much sought after brand in the retail space.
And the last point I would like to make before we open it up for questions is the share repurchase. We're very happy that we are able to work it out with [indiscernible] very earlier in the second quarter. At this moment in time, we see no reason for any large purchases of shares without getting any details, I don't believe there's any large sellers of our shares at this moment. And I don't believe there should be any pressure for us. When and if there is a large seller with our shares, we would look to possibly purchase those shares, if that's in order. But it's clear to tell everyone, I don't see those opportunity in the short term at any time. And so I just wanted to got that clearly off the table. 
I believe our positioning into the second half of this year is very strong. Unfortunately, I do believe the uncertainty is going to be great, I believe volatility could be more extreme and it does lead to greater confusion, and at times, it's going to lead to more capitulation by more clients as they still have great memories of 2008, 2009. Our only job then is to help our clients navigate those fears, try to help them assess their issues. Most importantly, have them focus on their liabilities, not headlines. And if more clients focused on their liabilities and focused on the appropriate asset allocation for those liabilities, instead of focusing on daily volatility, daily headlines, I believe in the long run, our investors worldwide with will be better off. That is the positioning that we're trying to build upon at BlackRock, and I believe no other firm in the business is well-positioned with that type of dialogue. 
Once again, thank you everyone for your support. For all the BlackRock employees who are on the phone today, thank you for a really strong quarter. But most importantly, thank you for really building the momentum of this firm. With that, I'll open it up for questions."

Index equity business is more volatile than fundamental equity. You're seeing clients going in and out. They may go into an index strategy until they determine where they want to go in an active basis. So I believe there is -- the business has higher, more volatility. I think some of the vol that we are seeing, we are seeing some companies are looking to add more index business to their business and some are looking to in-source some of their indexation. So 1 large client did a large internalization of their index business last quarter. So I believe indexing will continue to become a larger component of clients businesses until there is less volatility, greater global uncertainty. So I believe it will continue to be a growth area. I continue to believe we'll be very volatile in that area. It's an area that we continue to invest in with our team. And it's an area where we continue to have dialogue with many of our clients. But clients use, even institutions use index business as a short-term strategy envision and they use that as they're confused, let me just go index until I determine where I want to go allocate. And I think this is 1 thing that we're living in with, and I think you, U.S., the analyst are focusing on us, you're witnessing it too. It is a more volatile business than what I would call fundamental equities. If you have it performance generally  in fundamental equities, you have more have consistently long periods of time of those assets. Now our core index business is very stable, as stable as any business. But on the margin, there are clients who use index as a short-term strategy.

Second quarter demonst",1655,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for calling in today. This morning, we announced second quarter earnings of $3 per share. That's up 27% compared to a year ago, driven by a 16% growth in revenue and by margin expansion. 
Second quarter demonstrated continued execution of our revenue growth story. With our global platform, broad set of products and our risk capability, we're very well positioned to work with our clients through what's proving to be very uncertain times. During the second quarter, we continue to see volatility and persistent low interest rates. With that, we have clients coming to us seeking multi-assets and produce share solutions, yield-oriented products and advice on dealing with uncertainty and risk returns paid off [ph]. As a result, we generated a record level of base fees in the second quarter.
Also in the second quarter, we bought back the remaining 13.6 million shares that Bank of America held for $2.5 billion. With this transaction completed, we're widely held firm nearly 60% of the shares set with a broad diverse set of shareholders. We funded the transaction with $1.5 billion of long-term debt and $0.5 billion of commercial paper and $0.5 billion of cash. And at the same time, the rating agencies affirmed our strong, singular [ph] credit rating.
I'm going to refer to some of the slides in the supplement for the earnings release. And starting on Slide 1, you can see that operating income for the quarter was $883 million. That was up 19% from a year ago and 8% from the first quarter, really driving the growth in EPS. So the EPS story is an operating result story.
Looking at Page 2, you can see our operating margin, which I think demonstrates our focus on thoughtful investment. The operating margin came in at 39.7%, that's up from the second quarter margin by almost a full percentage point. It's also up from the full year 2010 margin of 39.3% and from the first quarter margin of 39.1%. Our cost to revenue ratio for the quarter came in at 34.4%, which is consistent with our long term range of 35%.
The second quarter is in the context of a market environment, which adds really reflected in the S&P 500 and shown on Page 3, is up about 16% compared to a year ago. But 2011 has been a period of volatility, and through that volatility, average markets in the first quarter are actually just about equal to average markets in the second quarter, which states that the earnings growth from first to second quarter is not coming from markets.
The growth in EPS compared to 2010, as well as compared to the first quarter, was driven by operating results. You can see that on Page 5 of the deck. Earnings per share, which was $3, included $3.09 of operating earnings. The earning did benefit in the quarter, a partial quarter benefit of about $0.07 from the share repurchase. Nonoperating results were about, well, $0.09 of expense. So detracting from EPS. 
If you look at Page 11, it lays out the comparison relative to the first quarter where operating growth contributed $0.30 of EPS growth and was offset partially by lower gains on investments in the first quarter, and also the non-recurrence of a 1x tax adjustment in the first quarter that had contributed about $0.12.
The second quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32.4%, the GAAP tax rate was 26.2%, and the GAAP tax rate reflected the noncash effect of legislative changes in New Jersey on the value of our deferred tax liability.
Looking at revenues, you can see total revenues on right-hand column of Page 7 at $2.3 billion. First quarter revenues were up 16% from 2010, primarily driven by base fees. And I'm going to talk more about base fees in a second. Performance fees came in at $50 million were consistent with performance fees a year ago, and were equally driven by strong relative performance of our equity product and by the strength of our alternative platform. 
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory revenues remained strong at $116 million, including growth in our Aladdin revenues, the continued, really, unwind or runoff of the liquidation assignments and continued good work on the advisory side with the uncertain environment is bringing opportunity.
Moving on to base fees on Slide 8. Base fees were $2.1 billion, and were up 17% from 2010 and 6% from the first quarter. When you look at the growth in base fees, you can see that it was across all long dated asset classes. It's partially offset by a decrease in revenues on cash products, clients continued to pull out of low yielding money market funds. 
And if you look at the top of the page, you can see that we have a well-diversified mix of revenues. And our mix of revenues is really reflective of the breadth of our product offering, where we can work with clients for Solutions, whether it's equity, fixed income, alternatives, multi-assets, active or passive, this diversity provides the diversity of revenues and diversity of Solutions for clients.
The second quarter compared to the first quarter is laid out on Page 14. Second quarter base fee growth likewise was driven by AUM growth and shows growth across all long dated asset classes. Second quarter revenues on base fees included $134 million of sec lending revenues. Sec lending revenues are strongest in the second quarter due to the European dividends at this season. But also, sec lending revenues were up 24% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting it's more than just a seasonal effect. There's also some returns risk taking because we have higher on-loan balances, as well as higher lending spread.
Also, our revenue story is really stronger than the AUM story due to a favorable mix of business. The basis points earned on business won was about 2 basis points higher than the basis points on business lost. As a result, organic revenue growth is running about several organic AUM growths in the quarter. And further, if you exclude the seasonal effect of sec lending on our average basis points, average basis points have improved our long dated assets every quarter since the BGI Transaction.
It's good, at this point, to be getting rid of some of the new noise in that difference between AUM and revenue, in that our last merger-related outflow is now behind us. It had been in the pipeline for the last several quarters, and that is done. So those are done for good, and the one factor that will stay with us is that institutional indexed assets can have large flows in the AUM with relatively small revenue effect.
Moving on to expenses, which you can see on Page 9, expenses were $1.464 billion, that's up 13% from 2010. Remember that's in the context of a 16% growth in revenue, and they were exactly equal to the expenses in the first quarter. So those -- that Expense Management, again, is what's contributing to the margin expansion. And we mentioned previously that BlackRock had entered into a new lease for office space in the city of London. It's about a 300,000 square-foot building, and it's going to allow us to really take the people that we've got spread across 2 different buildings, bringing them into a single, world-class asset management environment, which we're going to be better able to serve our clients and really work much more effectively as a single cohesive team. The new lending headquarters is actually going to be our largest single office, and earlier this month, we began occupancy of that office. We expect to relocate the majority of the people into the office sometime during the third quarter. And as a result of exiting our existing London location, we'll be considering a 1x acceleration of the remaining lease obligation sometime in the second half of the year. 
Given those are relatively short leases left, we are making assumptions right now that we won't have a sublease on those. And depending on exactly when we exit and how much space we continue to use for what period of time, we're estimating a charge in the range of $75 million to $100 million.
Moving on to the nonoperating side of results, and you can see those on Page 17. We had nonoperating expenses of $27 million. Those actually reflected a $10 million gain on the investment portfolio, which included positive marks on our private equity co-investment, offset partially by negative marks on distressed credit where we saw the spreads on that product widen. 
Just as a reminder, the portfolio still stands about where it was in the second quarter, $1 billion, about $930 million after considering hedges. And all of those investments are either feed or co-investments. So there's no proprietary activity reflected in those results. 
Net interest expense came in at $37 million. That did include one month of interest expense associated with the new debt we put on associated with the share repurchase.
Slide 18, this business model continues to generate substantial cash flow. We're using that cash flow to reward shareholders, that's reflected in our 44% dividend pay out ratio, as well as the share repurchase we just completed. We still do have share repurchase authority of 4.2 million shares and we also, in the second quarter, completed the redemption of our convertible debt.
So just wrapping up my comment, we're delivering double-digit earnings growth. The earnings growth is being fueled by top line revenue growth combined with margin expansion. So operating results are what's driving the business. And we feel, particularly in this time of uncertainty in external environment, that we are especially well positioned to deliver our business model to our clients to help them solve their problems and to continue to drive that top line growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

More than ever, the global political and economic issues investors are facing has created confusion, uncertainty and ultimate retrenchment. Investors worldwide, Retail and Institutional, are seeki",2855,"Thank you, Ann Marie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. More than ever, the global political and economic issues investors are facing has created confusion, uncertainty and ultimate retrenchment. Investors worldwide, Retail and Institutional, are seeking more advice, in many cases, more handholding and investment strategies and portfolio allocation. 
Investors in the last quarter, and I think more so going forward, are seeking more BlackRock advice. With our global platform, multi-products, our risk management and our thought leadership, BlackRock is very well positioned to assist our clients worldwide. 
However, clients are actually de-risking. I don't agree with them, but some of our clients are de-risking and are slowing down their investment decisions. Some other client of ours are looking at this as an opportunity, looking to take advantage of some capitulation from other investors. 
And what is driving much of this confusion and uncertainty is politics globally. I believe the private sector is doing a very good job, evident by growth in earnings, and yet what is the greatest inhibitor to the economic vitality right now of Europe and the United States is essentially politics. We are not -- we have to face this great uncertainty as politicians determine the outcomes in the United States or for deficits, our debt ceiling, which puts greater uncertainty with businesses, it puts greater uncertainty about job creation and we need to move beyond this. Nevertheless, it is very impressive for me to watch how corporate earnings continue to be driven. And importantly, this is why I believe those customers who are de-risking, and there are many customers who are de-risking because they're focusing on today's headlines, I think it's a mistake. And we are discussing this with all of our clients. 
In Europe, where I believe there is even greater problems ahead of ourselves, is the fact that external forces are forcing countries to change their behavior, changing their standard of living. And they're forcing these changes of standard of living without ever discussing the possibility of bondholders getting less than par. I don't look at that as a positive outcome. I don't believe that external parties can force governments to devalue their standard of living, devalue their countries without everyone sharing in these losses and their restructuring. 
As we looked at other restructurings of other countries, whether it is Argentina or Brazil or for that matter, Iceland, they have the ability to devalue their currencies and everyone shared, including the bondholders, in terms of the cost of the restructuring and many of these countries have vibrant economies today. But when you place all of the positive restructuring on the backs of the populace, in my opinion, it's going to lead to some severe social unrest over the course of the years to come, and this is one of the things that I'm most nervous about. 
It is these issues, these political issues, that are creating such great uncertainty. It is these issues that is creating opportunities. And I do believe BlackRock, with our platform, is helping our clients try to understand the ramifications. I do believe, long term, we will be able to overcome these issues, and I remain steadfastly bullish on opportunities in global equity markets.
Let me discuss BlackRock and how we performed over the quarter. As we discussed over the last few quarters, we are focused on building a stronger and broader relationship with our clients. Despite the volatility that I spoke about and the uncertainty in the marketplaces, our revenues and our product mix with our clients are increasing. This is what we are going to be focusing on in the future. We believe with this broad product mix that we have great opportunities to be increasing our revenues, and at times, which may mean reducing our AUM if that's what it takes. And so we are looking to have a more complete relationship with our clients, which will hopefully drive revenues and profitability for BlackRock, and most importantly, will drive a more comprehensive relationship with our client. And that is our strategy, and our strategy has shown in the second quarter that it's working. 
Clients, because of this uncertainty, are looking for more customized strategies. Some of our clients are barbelling. They're adding more beta strategies to answer their portfolio and higher return office of strategies. These strategies, along with multi-asset class products, we're building these relationships and revenues with our clients. And this is how we will continue to build out our relationships going forward. I believe more steadfastly than ever, our one BlackRock business model, a comprehensive platform worldwide, intersecting products worldwide, intersecting a one BlackRock community is a strategy that will allow us to build those relationships with BlackRock. 
Clients are looking for our international focus. Even if we are doing only business in Japan with yen-like products, they are looking to BlackRock, not to compete with local managers. They're looking for BlackRock to be additive in a global perspective, and that may lead us to having opportunities in investing in yen products. But most importantly, it'll allow us to have a more comprehensive dialogue. And when our clients in Japan or China or Italy are looking for greater opportunities beyond their local community and local markets, they look to BlackRock to help with them. And I believe this one BlackRock platform is allowing this. We just completed a leadership retreat, bringing our community of our leaders together. And I have never been more proud of our leadership in terms of building this one BlackRock community.
At the end of the second quarter, AUM, $3.6 trillion. We had growth of long dated assets, about $34 billion, of which $18 billion is new net assets. We saw some extreme outflows, which is industry-wide in terms of cash. This is an industry issue related to 0 interest rates in the short end, and most importantly, the uncertainty about money market funds related to ownership in some European financial institutions and commercial paper. BlackRock is very well positioned. Our risk management team has done an incredible job in navigating this, and we have been working with our client steadfastly in terms of helping them understand the portfolios of our cash management. Nevertheless, we are still, like the industry, seeing outflows there.
On the advisory side where we had more than normal outflows, that was related to clients returning some of the assets back into the marketplace. I can't get into the raw details. I think most people are aware of some of our clients who are visibly selling some of their products into the marketplace today. And so we are part of that. But our advisory business has never been robust. The opportunities we have in Advisory, which we'll talk about in a minute, is very, very strong. 
One area that I'd like everyone to focus on is our growth in our multi-asset category, where we had assets growing about 11% or about $23 billion. This is what I've been talking about. Our multi-assets now are $231 billion. AUM in fixed income grew nicely, about $27 billion, 50% of it in index, 50% in active, some of it EPS, some of it is just indexed. 
In equities, we still have some outflows in our scientific active equity. However, I'll talk about in a minute, we see a dramatic turnaround in the future prospects of that business, which we'll talk about in a minute. 
And as Ann Marie discussed, we had the last of our merger-related outflows, and we believe this is not going to be a component of our quarterly calls ever again.
Pipeline, a robust $84.3 billion. What is impressive for me, $71 billion or 84% of it is long dated products. It highlights, in my mind, the strength of the platform and the opportunities ahead of us. 
Let me talk about 3 areas that I think are worth noting. The first one is iShares. We're seeing more and more flows worldwide moving into ETFs. Much of this, in my opinion, is related to the great global uncertainty clients are looking for more liquidity as they tactically allocate, and ETFs  are a great vehicle for liquid tactical allocation. And so as an industry, the ETF assets grew by $50 billion, up $10 billion from last year. At the same period, mutual fund flows year-to-year fell dramatic from the growth rates of 2010 to 2011. Now I don't believe those are good approximations of the dynamics of the business because so much of the ETF business is institutional, and as I said, tactical allocation purposes. But I do believe we are going to continue to see large-scale growth in global ETFs, and there's no other firm that is well positioned in terms of global ETFs in country funds, in fixed income products, and we are working on many other types of products in the ETF realm. 
The one other thing that I'd like to note, despite all the noise, despite all the article about active ETFs, and BlackRock will be joining and building many active ETFs, I should just put it -- give everyone a good indicator, out of the $50 billion of net new business in ETFs as an industry, only $800 million of it was active ETFs. 
So as you see more and more funds go into active ETFs, in the first few years, that means the industry is going to lose money in it. It'd be very hard to make much money in active ETFs until you start seeing greater growth rates. I do believe the predominance of ETFs will always be the indexed base. And I also do believe you're going to see clients starting to understand as regulatory rules change in the ETF space, that there's going to be a great differentiation between ETFs and ETNs. This is a big issue in Europe. Every regulator in Europe is very, very introspective as to how people look at ETFs and ETNs. And I think there's going to have be much greater disclosure and/or maybe restrictions in terms of ETNs. That will put BlackRock's iShares in a great position, although if regulatory changes occur.
On our scientific model-driven equity business. As you know, we had very poor performance for almost 3 years. The industry had poor performance in the last 3 years. The industry saw dramatic outflows as a result of the underperformance. I am pleased to say, not only has BlackRock model-driven team has done an extraordinary job, but the industry has done a good job, too. There has been a vast reversal in the business in terms of performance. Our domestic product, which was our laggard at BlackRock is outperformed by over 140 basis points this year. And our global and our Asian model-driven scientific equity is outperformed by hundreds and hundreds of basis points. I believe we're going to see a change in flows that could be dramatic. We're going in a pace of performance similar to the experiences of 2004, and that was the beginning of great inflows in that product. And so we are very pleased with our team and Ken Kroner, navigating and stabilizing performance, rebuilding the team, rebuilding the enthusiasm. And now, over the course of the next 6 months to a year, hopefully we could rebuild flows.
Multi-asset products continue to be an area where clients, both Retail and Institutional are looking for. We believe this will continue, whether it is in equities and fixed income, and we believe we're very well positioned as more and more money goes into these categories.
BlackRock Solutions, we won 10 net new assignments in the last quarter. We had 3 new Aladdin assignments. Just yesterday, we won another very large Aladdin assignment. Much of this is being driven in Europe. The opportunities we have in Europe has never been greater. We have some very large proposals with our clients right now in the Aladdin space and in the fiduciary advisory space. As you know, all this noise in Europe is presenting a great opportunity for BlackRock, and hopefully, similar to the work we did in Ireland that we could play a role in the workout of the severe issues that Europe is facing.
As Ann Marie discussed, our margins grew to 39.7%. This is something that we focus on a great deal. And our margins grew in the last quarter, and yet, if you think about all the new businesses we're getting into, all of the new hires we've made, we're investing more for tomorrow, we're investing it more today for future revenues than any time in the history of BlackRock. 
In the last few quarters, we hired a new Head of Real Estate; we hired a new Head of the BlackRock Institute, which we'll talk about in a minute; a new Head of Communications and Branding; new Head of Private Equity; Alternative Energy; Asia's fundamental equity leader. We are building a more robust team worldwide than we've ever done before. This is expensive, and yet, our margins are increasing. And we believe these investments are going to be very strong. So as I always said, when we look at margins, we always look at margins, we need to make sure our margins continue to grow as our business grows, but we need to make sure that we're building for a better future. And I think I could soundly tell you, we're building for a better future with higher probabilities of greater revenues. And yet, we are increasing our margins. And this is one of the key elements that I believe is really important for BlackRock and BlackRock shareholders this year. 
As I mentioned, the BlackRock Institute, this is something that we believe BlackRock is becoming a leader on in terms of thought leadership. We created a sovereign credit index that receives a lot of notoriety. We just came out with a new piece on our views of China. This is our investment platform working together and coming on thought-provoking pieces. And I believe we will become more dominant in terms of trying to focus on issues and ideas related to the markets.
Just this week, as a help to our clients, we had over 1,200 clients on a phone call this week asking us questions related to the what if there's a default in U.S. Treasuries and what does that mean. And so we're seeing more and more clients looking to BlackRock to help them understand this global uncertainty.
As I said repeatedly, branding is going to become a more important component of what we're about. As I said earlier, we are going to spend a great deal of money in building out our brand over the next 5 years. I'm thrilled in the progress we've been making in terms of building a global brand. But this is just the beginning. And I believe our job in the future is to make sure that our end customer understands who and what BlackRock is, and so we could have not just a well-known brand institutionally, but a much sought-after brand in the retail space.
And the last point I would like to make before we open it up for questions is the share repurchase. We were very happy that we were able to work it out with BofA earlier in the second quarter. At this moment in time, we see no reason for any large purchases of shares without getting any details. I don't believe there's any large sellers of our shares at this moment, and I don't believe there should be any pressure for us. When and if there is a large seller with our shares, we would look to possibly purchase those shares, if that's in order. But it's clear to tell everyone, I don't see those opportunity in the short run at any time. And so, just wanted to got that and clearly off the table. 
I believe our positioning into the second half of this year is very strong. Unfortunately, I do believe the uncertainty is going to be great, I believe volatility could be more extreme, and it does lead to greater confusion. And at times, it's going to lead to more capitulation by more clients as they still have great memories of 2008, 2009. Our only job then is to help our clients navigate those fears, try to help them assess their issues. Most importantly, have them focus on their liabilities, not headlines. And if more clients focus on their liabilities and focus on the appropriate asset allocation for those liabilities, instead of focusing on daily volatility, daily headlines, I believe, in the long run, our investors worldwide will be better off. That is the positioning that we're trying to build upon at BlackRock, and I believe no other firm in the business is this well positioned for that type of dialogue. 
Once again, thank you, everyone, for your support. For all the BlackRock employees who are on the phone today, thank you for a really strong quarter. But most importantly, thank you for really building the momentum of this firm. With that, I'll open it up for questions."

So those 2 sort of offset each other, but we will see a little bit of base comps from more people. And then marketing, we're going to continue to invest in the brand. But overall, I don't see anything where we're not going to continue to manage the expenses and the margin."

And we are big players in that. And if there is a capitulation in that, we will be part of that capitulation.

We're in dialogues right now with some very large institutions who are looking to externalize large proponents to their balance sheet. Let's see if we win any of them. But our dialogues with our clients are as robust as it's ever been. But once again, nevertheless, clients have capitulated.

And while you would clearly say the ETF businesses is in a secular growth period, how do you view the institutional index business, which again has been a little bit volatile? But is that still in a secular growth mode, would you say?
First of all, we are learning -- this is not a secular -- this is a consistent pattern. Index equity business is more volatile than fundamental equity. You're seeing clients going in and out. They may go into an indexed strategy until they determine where they want to go in an active basis. So I believe there is -- the business has higher, more volatility. I think some of the vol that we are seeing, we are seeing some companies are looking to add more indexed business to their business, and some are looking to in-source some of their indexation. So one large client did a large internalization of their index business in the last quarter. So, I believe indexing will continue to become a larger component of clients' businesses until there is less volatility, greater global certainty. And so I believe it will continue to be a growth area. I continue to believe we'll be very volatile area. It's an area that we continue to invest in with our team. And it's an area that we have continued to have dialogue with many of our clients. But clients use -- even institutions use index business as a short-term strategy more than we ever envisioned, and they use that as they -- they're confused, let me just go index until I determine where I want to go allocate. And I think this is one thing that we're living with, and I think you as the analyst are focusing on it, you're witnessing it too. And it is a more volatile business than what I would call fundamental equities. If you have good performance, generally in fundamental equities, you have more consistently long periods of time with those assets. Now, our core index business is very stable, as stable as any business. But on the margin, there are clients who use index as a short-term strategy. But I do believe, to answer your question, it is still going to be a net growth strategy."

And so we are now navigating -- we're now in dialogue with many of our clients of adding part of the Aladdin platform of the entire balance sheet equity and bond.

Thanks for calling in today. This morning we announced second quarter earnings of $3 per share. That's up 27% compared to a year ago, driven by a 16% growth in revenue and by margin expansion. Second quarter demonstr",1652,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for calling in today. This morning we announced second quarter earnings of $3 per share. That's up 27% compared to a year ago, driven by a 16% growth in revenue and by margin expansion. 
Second quarter demonstrated continued execution of our revenue growth story. With our global platform, broad set of products and our risk capability, we're very well positioned to work with our clients through what's proving to be very uncertain times. During the second quarter, we continue to see volatility and persistent low interest rates. With that, we have clients coming to us seeking multi-assets and produce share solutions, yield-oriented products and advice on dealing with uncertainty and risk-return tradeoffs.  As a result, we generated a record level of base fees in the second quarter.
Also in the second quarter, we bought back the remaining 13.6 million shares that Bank of America held for $2.5 billion. With this transaction completed, we're a widely held firm nearly 60% of the shares set with a broad diverse set of shareholders. We funded the transaction with $1.5 billion of long-term debt, $0.5 billion of commercial paper and $0.5 billion of cash. And at the same time, the rating agencies affirmed our strong, single A credit rating.
I'm going to refer to some of the slides in the supplement to the earnings release. And starting on Slide 1, you can see that operating income for the quarter was $883 million. That was up 19% from a year ago and 8% from the first quarter, really driving the growth in EPS. So the EPS story is an operating result story.
Looking at Page 2, you can see our operating margin, which I think demonstrates our focus on thoughtful investments. The operating margin came in at 39.7%, that's up from the second quarter margin by almost a full percentage point. It's also up from the full year 2010 margin of 39.3% and from the first quarter margin of 39.1%. Our cost-to-revenue ratio for the quarter came in at 34.4%, which is consistent with our long term range of 35%.
The second quarter is in the context of a market environment, which adds -- really reflected in the S&P 500 and shown on Page 3, is up about 16% compared to a year ago. But 2011 has been a period of volatility, and through that volatility, average markets in the first quarter are actually just about equal to average markets in the second quarter, which states that the earnings growth from first to second quarter is not coming from markets.
The growth in EPS compared to 2010, as well as compared to the first quarter, was driven by operating results. You can see that on Page 5 of the deck. Earnings per share, which was $3, included $3.09 of operating earnings. The earnings did benefit in the quarter, a partial quarter benefit of about $0.07 from the share repurchase. Nonoperating results were about, well, $0.09 of expense. So detracting from EPS. 
If you look at Page 11, it lays out the comparison relative to the first quarter where operating growth contributed $0.30 of EPS growth and was offset partially by lower gains on investments in the first quarter, and also the non-recurrence of a 1x tax adjustment in the first quarter that had contributed about $0.12.
The second quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32.4%, the GAAP tax rate was 26.2%, and the GAAP tax rate reflected the noncash effect of legislative changes in New Jersey on the value of our deferred tax liability.
Looking at revenues, you can see total revenues on right-hand column of Page 7 at $2.3 billion. First quarter revenues were up 16% from 2010, primarily driven by base fees. And I'm going to talk more about base fees in a second. Performance fees came in at $50 million, were consistent with performance fees a year ago and were equally driven by strong relative performance of our equity product and by the strength of our alternative platform. 
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory revenues remained strong at $116 million, including growth in our Aladdin revenues, the continued, really, unwind or runoff of the liquidation assignments and continued good work on the advisory side where the uncertain environment is bringing opportunity.
Moving on to base fees on Slide 8. Base fees were $2.1 billion, and were up 17% from 2010 and 6% from the first quarter. When you look at the growth in base fees, you can see that it was across all long dated asset classes. It's partially offset by a decrease in revenues on cash products as clients continued to pull out of low yielding money market funds. 
And if you look at the top of the page, you can see that we have a well-diversified mix of revenues. And our mix of revenues is really reflective of the breadth of our product offering, where we can work with clients for Solutions, whether it's equity, fixed income, alternatives, multi-assets, active or passive, this diversity provides the diversity of revenues and diversity of Solutions for clients.
The second quarter compared to the first quarter is laid out on Page 14. Second quarter base fee growth likewise was driven by AUM growth and shows growth across all long dated asset classes. Second quarter revenues on base fees included $134 million of sec lending revenues. Sec lending revenues are strongest in the second quarter due to the European dividends at this season. But also, sec lending revenues were up 24% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting it's more than just a seasonal effect. There's also some returns risk taking because we have higher on-loan balances, as well as higher lending spread.
Also, our revenue story is really stronger than the AUM story due to a favorable mix of business. The basis points earned on business won was about 2 basis points higher than the basis points on business lost. As a result, organic revenue growth is running about several organic AUM growths in the quarter. And further, if you exclude the seasonal effect of sec lending on our average basis points, average basis points have improved on long dated assets every quarter since the BGI Transaction.
It's good, at this point, to be getting rid of some of the new noise in that difference between AUM and revenue, in that our last merger-related outflow is now behind us. It had been in the pipeline for the last several quarters, and that is done. So those are done for good, and the one factor that will stay with us is that institutional indexed assets can have large flows in the AUM with relatively small revenue effect.
Moving on to expenses, which you can see on Page 9, expenses were $1.464 billion, that's up 13% from 2010. Remember that's in the context of a 16% growth in revenue, and they were exactly equal to the expenses in the first quarter. So those -- that Expense Management, again, is what's contributing to the margin expansion. And we mentioned previously that BlackRock had entered into a new lease for office space in the city of London. It's about a 300,000 square-foot building, and it's going to allow us to really take the people that we've got spread across 2 different buildings, bring them into a single, world-class asset management environment, which we're going to be better able to serve our clients and really work much more effectively as a single cohesive team. The new lending headquarters is actually going to be our largest single office, and earlier this month, we began occupancy of that office. We expect to relocate the majority of the people into the office sometime during the third quarter. And as a result of exiting our existing London location, we'll be considering a 1x acceleration of the remaining lease obligation sometime in the second half of the year. 
Given those are relatively short leases left, we are making assumptions right now that we won't have a sublease on those. And depending on exactly when we exit and how much space we continue to use for what period of time, we're estimating a charge in the range of $75 million to $100 million.
Moving on to the nonoperating side of results, and you can see those on Page 17. We had nonoperating expenses of $27 million. Those actually reflected a $10 million gain on the investment portfolio, which included positive marks on our private equity co-investment, offset partially by negative marks on distressed credit where we saw the spreads on that product widen. 
Just as a reminder, the portfolio still stands about where it was in the second quarter, $1 billion, about $930 million after considering hedges. And all of those investments are either feed or co-investments. So there's no proprietary activity reflected in those results. 
Net interest expense came in at $37 million. That did include one month of interest expense associated with the new debt we put on associated with the share repurchase.
Slide 18, this business model continues to generate substantial cash flow. We're using that cash flow to award shareholders, that's reflected in our 44% dividend pay out ratio, as well as the share repurchase we just completed. We still do have share repurchase authority of 4.2 million shares and we also, in the second quarter, completed the redemption of our convertible debt.
So just wrapping up my comment, we're delivering double-digit earnings growth. The earnings growth is being fueled by top line revenue growth combined with margin expansion. So operating results are what's driving the business. And we feel, particularly in this time of uncertainty in external environment, that we are especially well positioned to deliver our business model to our clients to help them solve their problems and to continue to drive that top line growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

More than ever, the global, political and economic issues investors are facing has created confusion, uncertainty and ultimate retrenchment. Investors worldwide, Retail and Institutional, are seek",2862,"Thank you, Ann Marie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. More than ever, the global, political and economic issues investors are facing has created confusion, uncertainty and ultimate retrenchment. Investors worldwide, Retail and Institutional, are seeking more advice, in many cases, more handholding and investment strategies and portfolio allocation. 
Investors in the last quarter, and I think more so going forward, are seeking more BlackRock advice. With our global platform, multi-products, our risk management and our thought leadership, BlackRock is very well positioned to assist our clients worldwide. 
However, clients are actually de-risking. I don't agree with them, but some of our clients are de-risking and are slowing down their investment decisions. Some other clients of ours are looking at this as an opportunity, looking to take advantage of some capitulation from other investors. 
And what is driving much of this confusion and uncertainty is politics globally. I believe the private sector is doing a very good job, evident by growth in earnings, and yet what is the greatest inhibitor to the economic vitality right now of Europe and the United States is essentially politics. We are not -- we have to face this great uncertainty as politicians determine the outcomes in the United States of our deficits, of our debt ceiling, which puts greater uncertainty with businesses, it puts greater uncertainty about job creation and we need to move beyond this. Nevertheless, it is very impressive for me to watch how corporate earnings continue to be driven. And importantly, this is why I believe those customers who are de-risking, and there are many customers who are de-risking because they're focusing on today's headlines, I think it's a mistake. And we are discussing this with all of our clients. 
In Europe, where I believe there is even greater problems ahead of ourselves, is the fact that external forces are forcing countries to change their behavior, changing their standard of living. And they're forcing these changes of standard of living without ever discussing the possibility of bondholders getting less than par. I don't look at that as a positive outcome. I don't believe that external parties can force governments to devalue their standard of living, devalue their countries without everyone sharing in these losses and their restructuring. 
As we looked at other restructurings of other countries, whether it is Argentina or Brazil or for that matter, Iceland, they have the ability to devalue their currencies and everyone shared, including the bondholders, in terms of the cost of the restructuring and many of these countries have vibrant economies today. But when you place all of the cost of the restructuring on the backs of the populace, in my opinion, it's going to lead to some severe social unrest over the course of the years to come, and this is one of the things that I'm most nervous about. 
It is these issues, these political issues, that are creating such great uncertainty. It is these issues that is creating opportunities. And I do believe BlackRock, with our platform, is helping our clients try to understand the ramifications. I do believe, long term, we will be able to overcome all these issues, and I remain steadfastly bullish on opportunities in global equity markets.
Let me discuss BlackRock and how we performed over the quarter. As we discussed over the last few quarters, we are focused on building a stronger and broader relationship with our clients. Despite the volatility that I spoke about and the uncertainty in the marketplaces, our revenues and our product mix with our clients are increasing. This is what we are going to be focusing on in the future. We believe with this broad product mix that we have great opportunities to be increasing our revenues, and at times, which may mean reducing our AUM if that's what it takes. And so we are looking to have a more complete relationship with our clients, which will ultimately drive revenues and profitability for BlackRock, and most importantly, will drive a more comprehensive relationship with our client. And that is our strategy, and our strategy has shown in the second quarter that it's working. 
Clients, because of this uncertainty, are looking for more customized strategies. Some of our clients are barbelling. They're adding more beta strategies to add to their portfolio and higher return office of strategies. These strategies, along with multi-asset class products, we're building these relationships and revenues with our clients. And this is how we will continue to build out our relationships going forward. I believe more steadfastly than ever, our one BlackRock business model, a comprehensive platform worldwide, intersecting products worldwide, intersecting a one BlackRock community is a strategy that will allow us to build those relationships with BlackRock. 
Clients are looking for our international focus. Even if we are doing only business in Japan with yen-like products, they are looking to BlackRock, not to compete with local managers. They're looking for BlackRock to be additive in a global perspective, and that may lead us to having opportunities in investing in yen products. But most importantly, it'll allow us to have a more comprehensive dialogue. And when our clients in Japan or China or Italy are looking for greater opportunities beyond their local community and local markets, they look to BlackRock to help with them. And I believe this one BlackRock platform is allowing this. We just completed a leadership retreat, bringing our community of our leaders together. And I have never been more proud of our leadership in terms of building this one BlackRock community.
At the end of the second quarter, AUM is $3.6 trillion. We had growth of long dated assets, about $34 billion, of which $18 billion is new net assets. We saw some extreme outflows, which is industry-wide in terms of cash. This is an industry issue related to 0 interest rates in the short end, and most importantly, the uncertainty about money market funds related to ownership in some European financial institutions and commercial paper. BlackRock is very well positioned. Our risk management team has done an incredible job in navigating this, and we have been working with our clients steadfastly in terms of helping them understand the portfolios of our cash management. Nevertheless, we are still, like the industry, seeing outflows there.
On the advisory side where we had more than normal outflows, that was related to clients returning some of the assets back into the marketplace. I can't get into the raw details. I think most people are aware of some of our clients who are visibly selling some of their products into the marketplace today. And so we are part of that. But our advisory business has never been robust. The opportunities we have in Advisory, which we'll talk about in a minute, is very, very strong. 
One area that I'd like everyone to focus on is our growth in our multi-asset category, where we had assets growing about 11% or about $23 billion. This is what I've been talking about. Our multi-assets now are $231 billion. AUM in fixed income grew nicely, about $27 billion, 50% of it in index, 50% in active, some of it EPS, some of it is just indexed. 
In equities, we still have some outflows in our scientific active equity. However, I'll talk about in a minute, we see a dramatic turnaround in the future prospects of that business, which we'll talk about in a minute. 
And as Ann Marie discussed, we had the last of our merger-related outflows, and we believe this is not going to be a component of our quarterly calls ever again.
Pipeline, a robust $84.3 billion. What is impressive for me, $71 billion or 84% of it is long dated products. It highlights, in my mind, the strength of the platform and the opportunities ahead of us. 
Let me talk about 3 areas that I think are worth noting. The first one is iShares. We're seeing more and more flows worldwide moving into ETFs. Much of this, in my opinion, is related to the great global uncertainty clients are looking for more liquidity as they tactically allocate, and ETFs  are a great vehicle for liquid tactical allocation. And so as an industry, the ETF assets grew by $50 billion, up $10 billion from last year. At the same period, mutual fund flows year-to-year fell dramatically from the growth rates of 2010 to 2011. Now I don't believe those are good approximations of the dynamics of the business because so much of the ETF business is institutional, and as I said, tactical allocation purposes. But I do believe we are going to continue to see large-scale growth in global ETFs, and there's no other firm that is well positioned in terms of global ETFs in country funds, in fixed income products, and we are working on many other types of products in the ETF realm. 
The one other thing that I'd like to note, despite all the noise, despite all the articles about active ETFs, and BlackRock will be joining and building many active ETFs, I should just put it -- give everyone a good indicator, out of the $50 billion of net new business in ETFs as an industry, only $800 million of it was active ETFs. 
So as you see, more and more funds go into active ETFs, in the first few years, that means the industry is going to lose money in it. It'd be very hard to make much money in active ETFs until you start seeing greater growth rates. I do believe the predominance of ETFs will always be the indexed base. And I also do believe you're going to see clients starting to understand as regulatory rules change in the ETF space, that there's going to be a great differentiation between ETFs and ETNs. This is a big issue in Europe. Every regulator in Europe is very, very introspective as to how people look at ETFs and ETNs. And I think there's going to have be much greater disclosure and there maybe restrictions in terms of ETNs. That will put BlackRock's iShares in a great position, although if regulatory changes occur.
On our scientific model-driven equity business. As you know, we had very poor performance for almost 3 years. The industry had poor performance in the last 3 years. The industry saw dramatic outflows as a result of the underperformance. I am pleased to say, not only has BlackRock model-driven team has done an extraordinary job, but the industry has done a good job, too. There has been a vast reversal in the business in terms of performance. Our domestic product, which was our laggard at BlackRock is outperformed by over 140 basis points this year. And our global and our Asian model-driven scientific equity is outperformed by hundreds and hundreds of basis points. I believe we're going to see a change in flows that could be dramatic. We're going at a pace of performance similar to the experiences of 2004, and that was the beginning of great inflows in that product. And so we are very pleased with our team and Ken Kroner, navigating and stabilizing performance, rebuilding the team, rebuilding the enthusiasm. And now, over the course of the next 6 months to a year, hopefully we could rebuild flows.
Multi-asset products continue to be an area where clients, both Retail and Institutional, are looking for. We believe this will continue, whether it is in equities and fixed income, and we believe we're very well positioned as more and more money goes into these categories.
BlackRock Solutions, we won 10 net new assignments in the last quarter. We had 3 new Aladdin assignments. Just yesterday, we won another very large Aladdin assignment. Much of this is being driven in Europe. The opportunities we have in Europe has never been greater. We have some very large proposals with our clients right now in the Aladdin space and in the fiduciary advisory space. As you know, all this noise in Europe is presenting a great opportunity for BlackRock, and hopefully, similar to the work we did in Ireland that we could play a role in the workout of the severe issues that Europe is facing.
As Ann Marie discussed, our margins grew to 39.7%. This is something that we focus on a great deal. And our margins grew in the last quarter, and yet, if you think about all the new businesses we're getting into, all of the new hires we've made, we're investing more for tomorrow, we're investing it more today for future revenues than any time in the history of BlackRock. 
In the last few quarters, we hired a new Head of Real Estate; we hired a new Head of the BlackRock Institute, which we'll talk about in a minute; a new Head of Communications and Branding; new Head of Private Equity; Alternative Energy; Asia's fundamental equity leader. We are building a more robust team worldwide than we've ever done before. This is expensive, and yet, our margins are increasing. And we believe these investments are going to be very strong. So as I always said, when we look at margins, we always look at margins, we need to make sure our margins continue to grow as our business grows, but we need to make sure that we're building for a better future. And I think I could soundly tell you, we're building for a better future with higher probabilities of greater revenues. And yet, we are increasing our margins. And this is one of the key elements that I believe is really important for BlackRock and BlackRock shareholders this year. 
As I mentioned, the BlackRock Institute, this is something that we believe BlackRock is becoming a leader on in terms of thought leadership. We created a sovereign credit index that receives a lot of notoriety. We just came out with a new piece on our views of China. This is our investment platform working together and coming on thought-provoking pieces. And I believe we will become more dominant in terms of trying to focus on issues and ideas related to the markets.
Just this week, as a help to our clients, we had over 1,200 clients on a phone call this week asking us questions related to the what if there's a default in U.S. Treasuries and what does that mean. And so we're seeing more and more clients looking to BlackRock to help them understand this global uncertainty.
As I said repeatedly, branding is going to become a more important component of what we're about. As I said earlier, we are going to spend a great deal of money in building out our brand over the next 5 years. I'm thrilled in the progress we've been making in terms of building a global brand. But this is just the beginning. And I believe our job in the future is to make sure that our end customer understands who and what BlackRock is, and so we could have not just a well-known brand institutionally, but a much sought-after brand in the retail space.
And the last point I would like to make before we open it up for questions is the share repurchase. We were very happy that we were able to work it out with BofA earlier in the second quarter. At this moment in time, we see no reason for any large purchases of shares without getting any details. I don't believe there's any large sellers of our shares at this moment, and I don't believe there should be any pressure for us. When and if there is a large seller with our shares, we would look to possibly purchase those shares, if that's in order. But it's clear to tell everyone, I don't see those opportunities in the short run at any time. And so, just wanted to got that and clearly off the table. 
I believe our positioning into the second half of this year is very strong. Unfortunately, I do believe the uncertainty is going to be great, I believe volatility could be more extreme, and it does lead to greater confusion. And at times, it's going to lead to more capitulation by more clients as they still have great memories of 2008, 2009. Our only job then is to help our clients navigate those fears, try to help them assess their issues. Most importantly, have them focus on their liabilities, not headlines. And if more clients focus on their liabilities and focus on the appropriate asset allocation for those liabilities, instead of focusing on daily volatility, daily headlines, I believe, in the long run, our investors worldwide will be better off. That is the positioning that we're trying to build upon at BlackRock, and I believe no other firm in the business is this well positioned for that type of dialogue. 
Once again, thank you, everyone, for your support. For all the BlackRock employees who are on the phone today, thank you for a really strong quarter. But most importantly, thank you for really building the momentum of this firm. With that, I'll open it up for questions."

And while you would clearly say the ETF businesses is in a secular growth period, how do you view the institutional index business, which again has been a little bit volatile? But is that still in a secular growth mode, would you say?
First of all, we are learning -- this is not a secular -- this is a consistent pattern. Index equity business is more volatile than fundamental equity. You're seeing clients going in and out. They may go into an indexed strategy until they determine where they want to go in an active basis. So I believe there is -- the business has higher, more volatility. I think some of the vol that we are seeing, we are seeing some companies are looking to add more indexed business to their business, and some are looking to in-source some of their indexation. So one large client did a large internalization of their index business in the last quarter. So, I believe indexing will continue to become a larger component of clients' businesses until there is less volatility, greater global certainty. And so I believe it will continue to be a growth area. I continue to believe it will be very volatile area. It's an area that we continue to invest in with our team. And it's an area that we have continued to have dialogue with many of our clients. But clients use -- even institutions use index business as a short-term strategy more than we ever envisioned, and they use that as a -- they're confused, let me just go index until I determine where I want to go allocate. And I think this is one thing that we're living with, and I think you as the analyst are focusing on it, you're witnessing it too. And it is a more volatile business than what I would call fundamental equities. If you have good performance, generally in fundamental equities, you have more consistently long periods of time with those assets. Now, our core index business is very stable, as stable as any business. But on the margin, there are clients who use index as a short-term strategy. But I do believe, to answer your question, it is still going to be a net growth strategy."

As I said in International Retail, in May and June, we saw more outflows in our equities. In the first quarter, we saw huge inflows in equities. In May and June, there is more inflows in fixed income and other participants participated in that. And so, I think the International equities, because of our strong presence, as I said earlier in gold funds and in commodity-like products, we had more volatility in that category. And we continue to see volatility in that quarter in July. But we're very well positioned there. We continue to see very strong growth in most of the regions in Continental Europe. We're working on closer and more robust alliances with a few of our large distribution partners. And so we're very positive about our positioning in our International Retail platform. We have great opportunities in the U.K., continued opportunities in Italy, we have a growing presence in Germany and France, so it continues. We are seeing more volatility in Taiwan, in Asia. And I would say, an area that we're starting see some real growth in our mutual fund platform is Japan for the first time in many, many years. I'm pleased to say that. And that has a lot to do with our joint venture relationship with Mizuho. We're starting to see flows there. One of the big initiatives we have, not just in our International Retail products, but our global mutual fund products are income-oriented strategies. This is going to be our real premise over the course of the next year, and really pushing income-oriented strategy.

It's not public who it is, but it's a large financial institution. And most importantly, which I did not say about these 2 contracts, it is multi-asset. So it is not just fixed income, it is now equity. And so we are now navigating -- we're now in dialogue with many of our clients of adding part of the Aladdin platform of the entire balance sheet equity and bond. And so this is where we believe the next leg in terms of growth. But nevertheless also, Aladdin used to be a heavily oriented U.S. business, and we have won, so far this year a large assignment in Japan, we've won multiple assignments in Europe, and we see great growth opportunities worldwide.

We're pleased to report that really despite an adverse and volatile market in recent months, BlackRock delivered strong results in the quarter. It's a confusing environment out there. Clients more than ever are looking",2184,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that really despite an adverse and volatile market in recent months, BlackRock delivered strong results in the quarter. It's a confusing environment out there. Clients more than ever are looking for advice and solutions in the face of uncertainty, and BlackRock's diverse mix of business leaves us well-positioned to meet their needs. BlackRock was able to provide full end products that were especially important to investors in this environment. 
We experienced large index flows in both our institutional ETF products. Though liquidity of these products allow clients to react rapidly to the environment and more efficiently move into or out of asset classes. We generated inflows into multi-asset class products across each of our channels. BlackRock is uniquely suited to meet the growing demand for these products. 
We also saw clients getting into income-oriented products in the face of the sustained low interest-rate environment. Of course, we're not immune to the effects of negative markets on AUM, flows, revenues. And while revenue was down from the second quarter, the diversity of our product set and clients allowed us to lessen the impact of the negative flow environment such that our flows were relatively flat in the quarter. 
The nature of our cost space meant we were able to maintain strong margin as we balance data-driven revenue effects with expense management. In combination, this resulted in cash flow generation of $1.7 billion year-to-date and allowed us to return a large amount of cash to shareholders. Larry is going to be talking a lot more about the environment, the flows we're seeing across our business and what we believe it means for our clients and for BlackRock. But first, I'm just going to focus on the results themselves.
As I said, it's a good story. And these, for me, the key takeaway is that our performance in the face of really tough global headwinds illustrates the strength of BlackRock's business model: Our diversified global platform, our broad mix of product and client capability. Now I'm going to be referring to the slides in the earnings supplement. You can find those on the website. And as I go through results, I'll be discussing primarily as adjusted results.
Let's start us out on Slide 1. You can see on Slide 1, on the right-hand side, our operating results of $849 million. This were up 15% year-over-year. And that's driven both by revenue growth and margin improvement. Third quarter EPS, which you can see on the right-hand side, came in at $2.83.
Moving on to, again, strong margin story, which you can see on Slide 2, our operating margin came in at 40.1% in the quarter. That showed improvement of over 1.5 points compared to the third quarter 2010. More importantly, as income come vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter, our year-to-date margin of 39.6% also showed improvement compared to full year 2010. While in the face of the lower revenue environment, our comp revenue ratio was 34.2% q, which is exactly consistent with the first and second quarters and is really well within the long term range we've been running of about 35%. We believe this highlights our financial discipline and the variable nature of our expense base.
Just pausing for a second on the environment and looking at Slide 3, you can see that S&P declined, everyone know 14% in the third quarter. But when you take a look at average markets compared to average markets in the second quarter, the decline was 7%. World markets stirred even worse driven by the European uncertainties. While recent volatility on market declines are affecting AUM investor sentiment, average markets in the third quarter were still 12% better than a year ago. 
We'll walk through a comparison of the results of this year compared to last year, and then I'll move on to sequential results. So I'm going to move ahead to Slide 5. And on Slide 5, you can see that operating EPS was up $0.51 year-over-year, and that's the green bar on the page. The growth in operating EPS reflected the 15% or $112 million growth in operating income that I mentioned earlier. The EPS in the quarter also benefited $0.16 from our June share repurchase. 
Earnings per share, which you can see on the right-hand side of $2.83, included 3/12 of operating earnings in the dark blue, offset by $0.29 of nonoperating expense. The third quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32.3%. The GAAP tax rate was 13.7%. The GAAP tax rate reflected changes in the value of our deferred tax liability, and those changes resulted from both U.K. tax legislative change and a U.S. state tax selection. These benefits, totaling $129 million, were noncash. We excluded them from as adjusted results.
I'm going to move ahead of revenues, which you can see on Slide 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion. That's up 6% from 2010, primarily driven by a 9% growth in base fees, and which is the large green bar on the slide, and helped by a 16% growth in BRS revenue. But before I get into base fees, it's really worth noting the benefits for our business model of our diverse revenue sources. 
This quarter, we generated $276 million of revenue or 12% of our total revenues from sources other than base fees. And sources other than base fees are also contributing meaningfully to our improvements in revenue. So if you take a look at year-to-date revenue increases compared to 2010, we've improved $33 million in BRS, $47 million in SEC lending, which is a part of base fees, and $10 million in performance fees. And while I just mentioned that year-to-date were up in performance fees, during the third quarter, performance fees came in $91 million, which were actually down $23 million compared to a year ago. 
Our performance fees in the quarter included $51 million of these related to alternative products and $40 million on long dated products, primarily based on relative performance. A majority of our performance fee eligible active equity products generated healthy performance over the measurement period. So as a result of that, performance fees generated based on relative performance were actually better than a year ago. At the same time, recent market turmoil negatively affected the level of fees generated on our absolute return product, with several of our large hedge funds now below high water marks. We do expect this affects negatively the level of fourth quarter performance fees compared to a year ago.
And then just BlackRock Solutions, our advisory revenues came in at the quarter at $117 million. That included continued growth in our core lending business. As clients are seeking tools to manage risks in the face of these uncertain environment. The growth in BRS revenues this year has come almost exclusively from ongoing core assignments, which will continue to benefit the revenue base in 2012 and beyond.
So now moving on to base fees, which came in at 1.9 and which achieved a key driver to revenue increases, up 9% from 2010 and laid out for you on Slide 8. We had revenue growth in all long dated asset classes. This was offset partially by the revenue effects of the exodus from low yielding cash products over the past year. The diversity of long dated offerings across active and passive products, serving multiple client types, is 1 of our core strength that has been key to the revenue growth. And you can really see that across all the green bars on the bottom left on Page 8.
Moving on to expenses on Slide 9, third quarter as adjusted expenses were $1.4 billion, that's up only 2% from 2010. And remember, put that back into perspective of the 9% growth in base fees we just talked about. And so that's disproportionate level of increases what's really contributing to the margin expansion.
As I mentioned on the last call, BlackRock entered into a lease to bring new office space in the City of London. Last week, Larry was in the London office, commemorating the opening. The office brings into a single location all of our London employees and really enhances our ability to work together and serve our clients. We're already seeing the benefits of being in a single space. As a result of the move to this new office, we recorded a $63 million one-time charge related to the acceleration of the remaining lease obligations on our prior London spaces. We have excluded discharge from as adjusted results. The charge was below the range I've had mentioned on the last call of $75 million to $100 million, and that was primarily due to the opportunity to sublease a portion of this space.
Now I'm going to move on to sequential results, and there's 3 primary factors I'd like to focus on as we get into sequential: Market effects on base fees, lower expenses and the market effects on our coinvestment. 
So within your slides, I'm going to move ahead to Slide 11. Our operating EPS this quarter improved $0.03 from the second quarter. Nonoperating expense increased $0.20. Increase in nonoperating reflected market-driven, noncash marks of our coinvestment. I'll discuss that more in a minute ago. We also point out that our share repurchase in June resulted to in $0.10 incremental benefit to EPS compared to the second quarter. 
On Slide 12, you can see that in the face of revenue increases of $122 million, we reduced expenses by $88 million.
And looking at Slide 13, you can see that base fees decreased compared to the prior quarter by about $150 million, we're the key driver to the revenue decrease. About 1/3 of that decrease in base fees related to SEC lending, which is seasonally strong in the second quarter, and the remaining related primarily to $0.10 to the effect of unfavorable markets equity AUM, which you can see on Slide 14, the bigger red bars are all about the markets effects on equity. 
Moving ahead to Slide 15, and at the same time, expenses decreased $88 million. And that's related primarily to the effect of lower AUM and revenue on compensation, on distribution and servicing and on direct fund expense. Management action led to lower G&A expense, and that primarily was lower marketing in a sense.
So moving ahead now to Slide 17, nonoperating expense for the quarter came in $79 million. That included $42 million of negative marks. Those were primarily on our coinvestment in distressed credit. The Spreads on those products went significantly during the quarter. It's worth noting that despite recent market declines, year-to-date markets marks on the investment portfolio are still positive $11 million. Net interest expense in the quarter was $37 million. The value of our investment portfolio was stable at about $1 billion or $930 million when you exclude hedges or items which are hedged. 
We see the 2 new retail products on this quarter, which offset the effect of lower markets on the value of the portfolio. Those 2 new products are for retail investors, 1 is hedge fund of funds in the U.S. and the other is a European absolute bond return fund in Europe. We believe these are both great opportunities that are strategically important for our retail clients. And I always like to remind everyone that we do not have any proprietary investments. Our business model is to act as fiduciary and to manage assets on behalf of our clients. We're not in business to make money from our balance sheet and our investments on the balance sheet are extremely small. The relative amount of investments we have are just alongside clients where seeding new products. And so when I think about the size of what we do for our clients, about $3 trillion, again that's less than $1 billion, sitting there that we are invested in.
Moving on to Slide 18, I'd like to end by discussing our free cash flow. I started out mentioning that in the beginning, we continue to generate substantial cash flow. About $1 billion this quarter. You can see on the slide, $1.7 billion year-to-date. That's up about $300 million from what we have produced year-to-date last year. And including on the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that including our recent repurchase of Bank of America's remaining stake, our payout is 150% including a 43% dividend payout. 
So really despite declining and volatile markets, we delivered a healthy margin, we generated substantial cash flow and we've returned a large amount of cash to shareholders. Overtime, our intention is to continue to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders, while also reinvesting for future growth. We are more confident than ever in our business model and our growth opportunities. Our broad-based, diversified platform allowed us to respond to client needs, especially in this uncertain, challenging environment. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Larry, who's going to discuss the market environment and what we're seeing with our clients. Larry?"

I'm sitting here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are -- at this time having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of question right now",4402,"Thanks, Ann Marie. Welcome, everybody. I'm sitting here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are -- at this time having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of question right now. This is a 2-day affair, and it's going quite well. But it's obviously very clear to all of us that the global market has been very challenging and it's producing some real stress with many of our clients. 
The witnessing record low yield, which changes the value of our liabilities. We are seeing declining equity markets and the gap between assets and liability. In some cases may be irretrievable. They may not be able to achieve their objectives. In most cases, I think that investors will do that and they'll find ways to make it, but they're looking for solutions. It's going to be solutions that are heavily based on advice by BlackRock, and I do believe we are probably the best positioned to provide that advice because we are agnostic related to their our clients as they are looking for passive strategies alongside out the strategies. Global strategies, domestic strategies with an overlay of risk management. There's no firm in the world that could provide that. And the information content that we're able to provide because of our footprint has been very helpful to our clients.
So as we reflect on the third quarter, as we help our clients digest all this, the third quarter was, obviously, very challenging. It's exasperated by governmental policies worldwide, not just here in the United States. Politics and government are playing a major role in market performance and market volatility. Our Long term investing have become more difficult as a result of this. 
When government focus on short term is on, when government focuses on blogs, when government is not focusing on how to best prepare an economy over a long cycle, it becomes really difficult for investors to focus on long term investing, too. And this is 1 of the greatest issues that we are trying to confront with our clients. How do you manage these short term issues, the extreme volatility. This enormous uncertainty, but focus on long term investing. This is not an easy answer because some clients, who may have 10, 15, 20 year liabilities, they may be judged by their shareholders or by their Board or by their pension fund committee by quarterly results. They may be judged by annual DAR, if you are an insurance company, and that's how your regulators look at you. And so there's an incredible mismatch, and it's, in my mind, severe portions right now how accounting is forcing unbelievable short-termism. So we have the problems of accounting and governmental policy that in my mind is causing this great disruption in our pension funds and great disruptions in our marketplace, as fewer and fewer people are able to cope with the long termism.
So with government not focusing on the long term and with governments, in many cases, just doing the wrong thing, we have many clients worldwide who are confused, frozen and looking for answers. But the markets are testing governments, and we saw that all throughout the third quarter, the market has tested the European situation continually. It's the incrementalism of the Europeans that really have tested the markets and the markets have resoundingly been pretty negative with this incrementalism of trying to fix the problems in Europe. Hopefully, this weekend, we will see something more than short termism, hopefully more than incrementalism but a grand solution. 
A good example of what I would call government's failure is the European stress test, where just 10 weeks ago, the government indicated in their stress test results that a bank like [indiscernible] a client of BlackRock's, has capital of 10%. They're at capital at 10%. Only to have that bank nationalized a few weeks ago. And its that sort of information and problems is really unsettling to the marketplace. I don't need to tell you that, but to me, this is just a glaring example of how government has really unsettled the marketplace. We just can't understand how they could have an institution that cited in the top 10 most capitalized banks in Europe, then weeks later nationalize it. It just doesn't feel right, and as a result, people are de-risking. And if you look at our flows, the most amount of de-risking and flows that we're seeing in our high fee business has been in our European mutual funds, which I'll talk about, whereas we have the greatest amount of outflows because of the fear in Europe because of the things like that have been most severe.
So worldwide, clients are de-risking. But I need to remind clients and I need to tell everyone this is not 2008 and 2009. This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis. There's trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in the sideline as we know that's why with asset flow rates. And if we can have a sensible, longer-term view beyond the next blog, we could have a sensible long term positioning in fixing these problems, these structural problems in Europe. And our budget deficit and growth issues and job issues of the United States, I do believe, investors would rush right back into the marketplaces and we would have a very strong markets, which would then, in my mind, would propel the economy to higher growth rates.
During the third quarter, we had substantial declines in the global equity markets, as Ann Marie discussed. S&P was down 14%. The European blue-chip index, the stocks was down 23%. The MSCI emerging market index was down 23%. The Hang Seng was down 21%. So if you think about that, investors who diversify their portfolio, thinking that was the right thing, it produces even worse returns, and those who stayed totally in the United States. 
As a result of market instability in this lack of confidence, clients worldwide have de-risked. They are delaying investment decisions, and that is what drove the negative flows of proxy across the globe. Clients are now asking questions about how should they be reviewing their liabilities in light of these large declines, and we expect renewed activity very shortly, and but we're not going to have what I would call normalized flows until we have clients have better understanding of their liabilities, and that will then determine how they then manage their assets and their duration. 
Let me talk about BlackRock. Ann Marie did a really great job in talking about our earnings and the texture of our earnings. As a report noted that we did had negative flows, much of it was related to -- totally unrelated to our merger -- we don't have any merger-related outflows. Once in a pipeline is a significant change was related to a client who in sourced $39 million of index business, basically. And so -- but what I think the quarter really showed, and which really gave the leadership team of BlackRock great encouragement is our business model has proven to be an incredible differentiator. We have growth businesses that we have not seen in a long time, the diversity of our business model has really produced what I would call a very good revenue flows. And importantly, a very good operating income ratios. 
So in these periods of uncertainty and volatility, we are written really well-positioned today to serve our clients. And I think this is 1 of the great feelings we have yesterday and today with our clients here, and we're seeing that repeatedly worldwide, as we are working with more and more clients related to what we can bring to them. And we are seeing, as the information showed in our third quarter, we're seeing a huge increase in request for BlackRock Solutions products, as clients are trying to truly understand how to navigate their risk on a global basis. 
But what impressed me related to our quarter, and what we're really pleased with is the diversified business model. We had growth in BlackRock Solutions, a growth in SEC lending, in transaction transition management, which is becoming a bigger business as clients are trying to reassert how they should position their portfolio. There's much more transitioning being done. And our BlackRock multi-asset class strategies, where clients are looking for much more comprehensive solution-based assignments. And so this is what's driving this 9% year-over-year increase in base fees.
Even with these really difficult market headwinds, we saw continued organic growth across global iShares. We saw actually growth at our U.S. Retail channel. We had growth in our defined contribution channel. And as I said, our multi-asset class offerings. In multiclass offerings, we had over $3 billion of inflows across almost every channel. We are expanding the product range now into our retail products, not just institutional products. And they came across in almost every category from alternatives, equities, fixed income. And clients are increasingly looking for strategies that rely on indexing or ETF products as a bar belling and multi-asset class strategies are what clients are looking for, and as I said earlier, no firm has that product mix. No one has the research in terms of how we can best position our clients for these complex, multi-asset class strategies.
So the other thing about the third quarter, we needed to make sure -- we needed to find ways of continuing to growth, as we see some great growth opportunities. But we needed to make sure that we are pretty disciplined. As we did in terms of the market setbacks of '08 and '09, we were very disciplined and ahead of the curve in terms of what we had to do. We remain to be very vigilant in terms of making sure where we spend our money, we spend it well. The areas that we continue to invest, even with our margins above 40, we were investing in retirement solutions, we invested more on alternatives, we invested more in ETFs and currently, we have been able to invest in some very high caliber professionals who will help fuel our future growth. A good example is [indiscernible] Homes, who is new head of Asia PAC, who will be joining us at the end of fourth quarter. 
Another great example of our investing to making it our better platform as Ann Marie discussed, our opening of our London new office. Since our merger, we were operating in 2 different offices. And we did move people around, but it was certainly not the best of circumstances to really grow 1 BlackRock. Everybody is in 1 common building today in London, and now our London office happens to be our largest city location in the world, bigger than our corporate headquarters in New York. And so things like this are obviously, a cost, but we expect these costs will really generate more continuity, hopefully better performance as our portfolio managers are altogether. But importantly, a better dialogue amongst our teams, which will produce better dialogues with our clients, that which would produce more opportunities for our business. 
As Ann Marie suggested, we continue to generate a lot of cash flow, $1.8 billion year-to-date. We have a long history of returning capital to our shareholders, and this year, we already increased our dividends. I need to remind everybody that 37.5%. We repurchased $2.5 billion of shares as recently as June. And I could tell everyone today we will continue to take appropriate steps to be well-positioned to capture opportunities. I am here to tell you I don't know any opportunities at this moment, so I'm not here to suggest and I'm not trying to forewarn that I know of anything going on. But we will be well-positioned if their opportunity to do things. And obviously, when it is not into the first quarter of the new year, where the Board of Directors would look at our dividend policy. 
So let me go over some of the business is in the texture of the industry and in BlackRock. Let me start off with retail. Our U.S. Retail business had positive flows, which was unusual in our business. And while Europe and Asia saw de-risking, for a reference point, U.S. mutual funds, ETS had $48 million as an industry in outflows in the third quarter. BlackRock had $1.8 billion of inflows globally, but we had long term flows of $3.5 billion. Our U.S. retail saw positive long term flows in the third quarter about $2.6 billion, really concentrating at some of our unique products: Global Allocation, our equity dividend, our high yield funds. And this is where we actually believe more and more growth will go. We're seeing more and more people questioning core fixed income, where fixed income is only producing 2-ish plus percent of returns, and what is the future of rates going forward. So clients are asking for solutions, whether that might be more high yield solutions. There could be in other types of credit solutions, dividend as a solutions preferred and these are some things that we're really trying to position BlackRock to handle our clients needs.
Cross-border or the European flows as an industry, had $28 billion of outflows and we had, as a firm, about $6 billion of outflows. And as I said, that's where the great de-risking was worldwide and especially in the mutual funds arena. Despite the $6 billion, we actually picked up market share though. So we lost less than the industry as a whole.
So the third quarter, despite all this noise, has told me we are picking up market share. We continue to position ourselves and we're continuing to be innovative in terms of creating products that our clients need in this new paradigm. Let me talk about global iShares.
We had, in the quarter, $10.8  million in net new business. We had really positive flows in Europe, end flows in the U.S. As an industry, we saw about $28 billion outflows as an industry. But I should give a little more texture. Flows are significantly in July, and industry did see significant slowdown in flows in August and September. As you're seeing, that capitulation and that uncertainty even in the iShares product.
In EMEA, we had $10.8 billion of global flows. I'm sorry. In total, the EMEA was $6.5 billion of flows. Investors are looking for safety in the region, particularly in Germany. And importantly, we are as well-positioned in Europe as we ever have been in our ETF space. There is great amount of consternation and confusion in Europe related to ETNs, or exchange traded notes, which are derivative based products. There are some regulatory review of these types of products. There are many platforms, distribution platforms, that are now for bidding these sales of ETNs. And as the largest provider of ETFs in Europe, we have been a huge beneficiary. I don't expect these market shares to persist. But in the third quarter, we picked up 80% of the net new business in Europe in the third quarter. 
We do believe though in the United States, in Europe, we are going to see substantial regulatory review of these products. We have been very assertive in our statements that clients need to understand what they're buying. There needs to be better transparency. There's a big difference between a physical ETF and a derivative based ETN. And derivative based ETN, you have credit exposure with that issuer. Some of these issues may be very fine credits, but the disclosure of what you're buying, what is the underlying product is pretty opaque. And we are suggesting to the SEC and to other regulators as they think about ETFs in the future that we have much greater transparency, much greater clarity in terms of the product. 
We have always been pretty rigorous in terms of making sure that clients understand that ETS should be physically based. Obviously, in some cases, they're going to have some hedges or some derivatives based around it, but we need to have even some of our products that we already have, 80% physical and some derivative based that we need to have much more clarity.
So there's no -- as ETFs have grown and no different than we saw in the mortgage market in the 80s are better than 90s and in this decade, a suitable product morphed into something that is very complex and risks were contained in these products that may be investors did not know. That was the failure of the mortgage market. As 1 of the founders of the mortgage market in the 70s, eighties and watching the failure of disclosure, and that market occur, we need to be very assertive as a firm and outspoken that we will not allow at BlackRock the lack of disclosure of these products. We believe these products can have a huge future, and we need to be a lot more assertive in making sure that risks and complexity is understood by all investors. So we are trying to bring down the risk of ETFs. There is great amount of noise about it. There's a hearing today in Washington about ETFs, and we are trying to take a very large position in terms of making sure these products grow, this industry grows, and I would love for some of my peers to be as assertive as BlackRock in making sure we have a great industry and a great product going forward.
In the Americas, we had $4.6 billion of inflows. We saw investors shift to fixed income in the U.S., offset by some outflows and equity ETFs. We're not happy with our U.S. results. And we are addressing it. We put in place a new global leadership team under Mark Whitman, stepping up as the global head of iShares in September, and this is consistent with the steps we took to address the performance problems we have in SAE or scientific active equity, which is now paying off, which is actually 1 of our highest performing products this year as we reinvested in that product, as we believe in it. Obviously, we are building a bigger, finer, great team, we're adding more teams to our ETF platform and we believe with Mark's and all our great leaders of the ETF platform, we will once again reassert our market share in the United States.
We continue to innovate in the ETF platform. We launched a few commodity and fixed income products in Europe, a tactical allocation ETF product is garnering a lot of attention. We believe more and more tactical allocation products are going to become larger and larger, as we witnessed from our Global Allocation mutual fund as 1 of the fastest growing mutual funds.
Institutional, the picture is mixed. We saw clients de-risking, while others took advantage of the steep market declines, and we're forced to rebalance. It really depends on some of our clients needs. If a client need an LDI in 2003 and they're sitting with 6% long dated bonds, they are less stressed than those companies that were under invested in fixed income in terms of having their core interest rate that they are looking for. And now, with the reduction in interest rates are sitting with some big gaps in terms of their income needs. 
Total long dated the outflows for BlackRock was $17 billion, driven by a single outflow in a passive fixed income strategy with a particularly plan for liquidity needs. It had a de minimis revenue impact for us. And we continue to see modest outflows at our SAE, but we are -- we have enormous amount of dialogue now, and we believe, because of the performance over the last year and our investment in our SAE teams, we're going to start seeing a new inflows. Quite frankly, with many of our peers got out of this business, and we're 1 of the few organizations that have stayed into it, reinvested in it. And as I said, we stabilized it, we're seeing sales some modest outflows, but with the conversations now we are having now with clients it's me a good feeling about the future in terms of the inflows there.
As I said earlier, our clients are really struggling with the low interest-rate environment and the declines in the equity markets. So we are seeing very unusual behavior by our clients. Clients are looking for help, and that's what we're trying to do. 
Our performance, as I said earlier, in Quanta and multi-asset products were strong, and I'm very encouraged in our equity performance in these positions well for the future. As I said earlier, low interest rates is going to have, most probably, some structural changes in fixed income in the next few years as an industry. It's very hard to see how interest rates going to continue to go lower to produce more than the 2.5% returns that we see in the market today. And so what we expect clients to start relooking at within fixed income, this is a lot of trim business, because it's going to go moving from maybe core types of fixed income strategies to credit strategies. They're going to go into a go anywhere strategy in fixed income. Some of them may go into preferreds and other types securities. We expect out of the European situation, we hope to see large amount of preferreds been issued by banks as a means to recapitalize. And although at this moment prefer to not consider Tier 1 capital in Europe. Hopefully that will change as banks are trying to lobby their regulators as they are going through their stress tests again, as they're trying to achieve 9% Tier 1 capital charge at this low equity rates. It would be very powerful if the regulators would allow preferreds to be Tier 1, perpetual preferreds, I must say. Not perpetual preferreds to be Tier 1. I believe there'll be billions and billions and billions of dollars of interest in the world for that as bond investors need coupons or in this case, dividends. 
The pipeline was confusing. We had this big outflow, Ann Marie talked about, I mentioned it earlier, a very large client of ours is internalizing a 30-plus billion dollars mandate. They're doing it for cost-containment, and so this is something that will probably happen mid next year, but we are giving you an advanced word. So this is not going to happen in this quarter may not even happen in the first quarter, but we've been told, this will happen sometime mid next year. But despite that, we've seen some pretty good flows, and what I'm also personally excited about, we are seeing good flows in what I would call long dated products or higher fee paying products. We are continuing to see some real opportunities in our alternative space. We did have outflows in our currency type of products. And that's related to the big swings in dollar or in euro. But we did have to offset that $1 billion inflows of our commodity products would totally offset these currency types of outflows that we saw in the third quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions. I just can't say enough of how this is helping us in the positioning in the new paradigm. During the quarter, we were hired by the National Bank of Greece, so we're inside working with the regulators of Europe and Greece to try to help them understand and ascertain the situation there. This is a similar assignment that we won, and I meant earlier in the year. We are working with more European banks than we've ever done in our platform. We have more opportunities in the Middle East, more opportunities in Asia better than we've ever had before. 
In the quarter, as we noted, we have 13 new assignments. These are offsetting a lot of the 1 type of assignments that we had. This is totally offsetting the consistent reduction in our outstanding of advisory business as some of our clients are bringing down some of the troubled assets. And so, this has been an extraordinary year so far for us. And more importantly, we are starting to see much more stickier revenues in our solution business, as we are winning more and more Aladdin-like assignments. We continue to have dialogue with a few substantial Aladdin assignments. And the last thing I would say about Aladdin, we are implementing our first Aladdin assignment, that is not just fixed income, but it is now equity and fixed income. This what we believe will become a cornerstone of our growth as our equity modules are as industry first-class as our fixed income modules in our risk management. 
And lastly, as I said earlier, we continue to invest in our platform. I mentioned hiring Mark McCombs in Asia, but we hired Mark [indiscernible] in our BlackRock multi-asset class strategy. And we are very excited about the individuals that we are seeing, who are looking to join our firm. We have never enjoyed such a position in which we could hire industry leaders to help us build this platform. This is across regions and across products.
So in summary, I know I've been talking a long time, we are really uniquely positioned for this environment. I think better positioned than any organization that I know of in the industry. With the persistence of volatility in our marketplaces, with low interest rates, a low growth environment, our investors are reevaluating their investment strategies and asset allocation decisions. We hope we're in that position to help our clients. That is our #1 job. Our job has to be an ally, we have to be there working alongside with our clients. We have a challenging world of demands, a better and a more robust range of solutions. We have higher demands that we provide value-added advice, better risk management tools. And so the demands on our time are growing. And that's why we have to continue to invest.  
So in summary, we're pretty well-positioned here. I would like to thank all the employees for working with our clients, helping our clients and producing the results that we did in the third quarter. I'll open it up for questions."

The Basel III as banks are going to be required to have much more capital, the utilization of their balance sheet is going to affect everybody. Bid/ask spreads are going to be widening because these institutions are going to need to make some form of profit for putting their balance sheet in front of you. This is1  of the reasons why we have been very rigorous in spending a lot of money, building the trading platform, to cross trades to our clients. This is 1 of the actions that we are doing and we continue to do that and we're continuing to build it. And so what we are trying to use that scale of ours to differentiate us with our clients cross trade and hopefully to reduce that friction cost that we're going to see in the marketplace. And so this is something that we are quite sensitive on. In terms of our interaction with our regulators, we're actually having some very good dialogues with our regulators. We are trying to be above the line with them and really working with them in terms of trying to help them understand the difference between asset management and organizations that work on their own balance sheet. We are trying to make sure that in our conversations related to ETFs, they understand the difference between ETFs and ETNs. We have been very rigorous in terms of -- and an outlier in the industry in the money market fund industry suggesting that the capital should be put in place to NAV declines. And we do believe regulators are going to begin to focus on the money market fund industry because I do believe from every regulator I speak to, they believe money market funds do present risk in the system, and there's going to have to be some ways of protecting the system. So we are trying to work with regulators in terms of understanding the type of risk that's presented and how best to effectuate and minimize that risk. In terms of everyday business, until we really get more dialogue in terms of -- and more certainty of how they're going to implement some of these strategies, it's hard for us to say how that will further impact BlackRock or how we work with our clients. But it's a moving dialogue, and I could promise you we are involved in the dialogues with the regulators when they want to hear our opinions, we are offering them as loud as possible. We have, I think as you know, we do have an office now in Washington working alongside with our regulators. It happens to be 1 of our biggest business is now working in Washington. It's a core competency that have to work with our regulators and work with our politicians to help our investors. So 1 thing I said to our investors at our conference, we are 1 of the loan sheet working with Washington in trying to protect investor interest and investor rights."

As they said, you don't believe interest rates have that's much further to go down over the next few years, your only earning a few hundred basis points of return and so we're going to start seeing -- we're going to see clients looking to use beta as a bigger flow, you saw that in the ETF flows over the last quarter. So we continue to expect that to continue. We are seeing more and more inquiry in high yield and more and more inquiries in the higher yielding fixed income products, whether it's in Europe or the U.S. So once again, it's more bar belling. So indexing obviously, is a lower fee, higher margin result and the credit and the other types of products are going to be higher fees, in many cases, lower margin business. I think we're going to be probably be as best positioned to handle that and take that in. I should remind everybody indexation, even institutional indexation of fixed income, is not like indexation of the S&P. There are thousands of bonds in the Barclays index or other fixed income type of indexes. You have to have a lot more technology to replicate the movements of fixed income to get close to an index. So it's much harder for institutions to internalize fixed income indexing. So we look at that as even if institutions went that way, we would expect to be a huge beneficiary of that. The second thing, in terms of equities, we're going to continue to see more bar belling. As you saw the flows, people were derisking in core type of products. They were going into more specialty type of product. They're going into more alternatives and they're using as their baseline a foundation they're going into index. So it really depends on each client's issues, whether there are liability, what is their horizons and -- but I think it's very clear across-the-board, investors are looking for some form of advice."

We're pleased to report that really despite an adverse and volatile market in recent months, BlackRock delivered strong results in the quarter. It's a confusing environment out there. Clients, more than ever, are looking for advice and solutions in the face of uncertainty, and BlackRock's diverse mix of business leaves us well-positioned to meet their needs. BlackRock was able to provide full end products that were especially important to investors in this environment. 
We experienced large index flows in both our institutional ETF products, though liquidity of these products allowed clients to react rapidly to the environment and more efficiently move into or out of asset classes. We generated inflows into multi-asset class products across each of our channels. BlackRock is uniquely suited to meet the growing demand for these products. 
We also saw clients getting into income-oriented products in the face of the sustained low interest rate environment. Of course, we're not immune to the effects of negative markets on AUM, flows, revenues. And while revenue was down from the second quarter, the diversity of our product set and clients allowed us to lessen the impact of the negative flow environment, such that our flows were relatively flat in the quarter. 
The nature of our cost space meant we were able to maintain strong margin as we balance beta-driven revenue effects with expense management. In combination, this resulted in cash flow generation of $1.7 billion year-to-date and allowed us to return a large amount of cash to shareholders. Larry is going to be talking a lot more about the environment, the flows we're seeing across our business and what we believe it means for our clients and for BlackRock. But first, I'm just going to focus on the results themselves.
As I said, it's a good story. And these, for me, key takeaway is that our performance in the face of really tough global headwinds illustrates the strength of BlackRock's business model: our diversified global platform, our broad mix of product and client capability. Now I'm going to be referring to the slides in the earnings supplement. You can find those on the website. And as I go through results, I'll be discussing primarily as adjusted results.
We're going to start this out on Slide 1. You can see on Slide 1, on the right-hand side, our operating results of $849 million. These were up 15% year-over-year, and that's driven both by revenue growth and margin improvement. Third quarter EPS, which you can see on the right-hand side, came in at $2.83.
Moving on to, again, the strong margin story, which you can see on Slide 2, our operating margin came in at 41 -- 40.1% in the quarter. That showed improvement of over 1.5 points compared to the third quarter 2010. More importantly, as margin can vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter, our year-to-date margin of 39.6% also showed improvement compared to full-year 2010. And in the face of the lower revenue environment, our comp revenue ratio was 34.2%, which is exactly consistent with the first and second quarters and is really well within the long-term range we've been running of about 35%. We believe this highlights our financial discipline and the variable nature of our expense base.
Just pausing for a second on the environment and looking at Slide 3, you can see that S&P declined, everyone know there's 14% in the third quarter. But when you take a look at average markets compared to average markets in the second quarter, the decline was 7%. World markets fared even worse, driven by the European uncertainties. While recent volatility on market declines are affecting AUM and investor sentiment, average markets in the third quarter were still 12% better than a year ago. 
And then we'll walk through a comparison of the results of this year compared to last year, and then I'll move on to sequential results. So I'm going to move ahead to Slide 5. And on Slide 5, you can see that operating EPS was up $0.51 year-over-year, and that's the green bar on the page. The growth in operating EPS reflected the 15% or $112 million growth in operating income that I mentioned earlier. The EPS in the quarter also benefited $0.16 from our June share repurchase. Earnings per share, which you can see on the right-hand side of $2.83, included 3/12 of operating earnings in the dark blue, offset by $0.29 of non-operating expense. 
Our third quarter, as adjusted tax rate, was 32.3%. The GAAP tax rate was 13.7%. The GAAP tax rate reflected changes in the value of our deferred tax liability, and those changes resulted from both U.K. tax legislative change and a U.S. state tax selection. These benefits, totaling $129 million, were noncash. We excluded them from as adjusted results.
I'm going to move ahead to revenues, which you can see on Slide 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion. That's up 6% from 2010, primarily driven by a 9% growth in base fees, which is the large green bar on the slide, and helped by a 16% growth in BRS revenue. But before I get into base fees, it's really worth noting the benefits for our business model of our diverse revenue sources. 
This quarter, we generated $276 million of revenue or 12% of our total revenues from sources other than base fees. And sources other than base fees are also contributing meaningfully to our improvements in revenue. So if you take a look at year-to-date revenue increases compared to 2010, we've improved $33 million in BRS, $47 million in SEC lending, which is a part of base fees, and $10 million in performance fees. And while I just mentioned that year-to-date were up in performance fees, during the third quarter, performance fees came in $91 million, which were actually down $23 million compared to a year ago. 
Our performance fees in the quarter included $51 million of fees related to alternative products and $40 million on long-dated products, primarily based on relative performance. A majority of our performance fee eligible active equity products generated healthy performance over the measurement period. So as a result of that, performance fees generated based on relative performance were actually better than a year ago. At the same time, recent market turmoil negatively affected the level of fees generated on our absolute return product, with several of our large hedge funds now below high water marks. We do expect this to affect negatively the level of fourth quarter performance fees compared to a year ago.
And then just BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues came in at the quarter at $117 million. That included continued growth in our core Latin [ph] business, as clients are seeking tools to manage risks in the face of this crazy, uncertain environment. The growth in BRS revenues this year has come almost exclusively from ongoing core assignments, which will continue to benefit the revenue base in 2012 and beyond.
So now moving on to base fees, which came in at $1.9 billion and with a key driver to revenue increases, up 9% from 2010 and laid out for you on Slide 8. We had revenue growth in all long-dated asset classes. This was offset partially by the revenue effect of the exodus from low-yielding cash products over the past year. The diversity of long-dated offerings across active and passive products, serving multiple client types, is one of our core strengths that has been key to the revenue growth. And you can really see that across all the green bars on the bottom left of Page 8.
Moving on to expenses on Slide 9, third quarter as adjusted expenses were $1.4 billion, up only 2% from 2010. And remember, we'll put that back into perspective of the 9% growth in base fees we just talked about. And so that's disproportionate level of increases what's really contributing to the margin expansion.
As I mentioned in the last call, BlackRock entered into a lease to bring new office space in the City of London. Last week, Larry was in the London office, commemorating the opening. The office brings into a single location all of our London employees and really enhances our ability to work together and serve our clients. We're already seeing the benefits of being in a single space. As a result of the move to this new office, we recorded a $63 million onetime charge related to the acceleration of the remaining lease obligations on our prior London spaces. We have excluded discharge from as adjusted results. The charge was below the range I had mentioned on the last call of $75 million to $100 million, and that was primarily due to the opportunity to sublease a portion of this space.
Now I'm going to move on to sequential results, and there's 3 primary factors I'd like to focus on as we get into sequential: market effects on base fees, lower expenses and the market effects on our co-investment. 
So within your slides, I'm going to move ahead to Slide 11. Our operating EPS this quarter improved $0.03 from the second quarter. Non-operating expense increased $0.20. Increase in non-operating expense reflected market-driven, noncash marks of our co-investment. I'll discuss that more in a minute. I'll also point out that our share repurchase in June resulted in $0.10 incremental benefit to EPS compared to the second quarter. 
On Slide 12, you can see that in the face of revenue decreases of $122 million, we reduced expenses by $88 million.
And looking at Slide 13, you can see that base fees decreased compared to the prior quarter by about $150 million, where the key driver to the revenue decreased. About 1/3 of that decrease in base fees is related to SEC lending, which is seasonally strong in the second quarter, and the remaining related primarily to the effect of unfavorable markets on equity AUM, which you can see on Slide 14, the bigger red bars are all about the markets effects on equity. 
So moving ahead to Slide 15, and at the same time, expenses decreased $88 million. And that's related primarily to the effects of lower AUM and revenue on compensation, on distribution, servicing and on direct fund expense. Management action led to lower G&A expense, and that primarily was lower marketing in a sense.
So moving ahead now to Slide 17. Non-operating expense for the quarter came in $79 million. That included $42 million of negative marks. Those were primarily on our co-investments in distressed credit. Spreads on those products whined significantly during the quarter. It's worth noting that despite recent market declines, year-to-date market marks on the investment portfolio are still positive $11 million. Net interest expense in the quarter was $37 million. The value of our investment portfolio was stable at about $1 billion or $930 million when you exclude hedges or items which are hedged. 
We see the 2 new retail products this quarter, which offset the effect of lower markets on the value of the portfolio. Those 2 new products are for retail investors, one is hedge fund of fund in the U.S. and the other is a European absolute bond return fund in Europe. We believe these are both great opportunities that are strategically important for our retail clients. And I always like to remind everyone that we do not have any proprietary investments. Our business model is to act as fiduciaries and to manage assets on behalf of our clients. We're not in business to make money from our balance sheet, and our investments on the balance sheet are extremely small. The relative amount of investments we have are just alongside clients who are seeding new products. So when we think of the size of what we do for our clients of over $3 trillion, again, there's less than $1 billion sitting there that we are invested in.
Moving on to Slide 18, I'd like to end by discussing our free cash flow. I started out mentioning that in the beginning, we continue to generate substantial cash flow, about $1 billion this quarter. You can see on the slide, $1.7 billion year-to-date. That's up about $300 million from what we have produced year-to-date last year. And including on the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that including our recent repurchase of Bank of America's remaining stake, our payout is 150%, including a 43% dividend payout. 
So, really, despite declining and volatile markets, we delivered a healthy margin, we generated substantial cash flow and we've returned a large amount of cash to shareholders. Over time, our intention is to continue to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders, while also reinvesting for future growth. We are more confident than ever in our business model and our growth opportunities. Our broad-based, diversified platform allows us to respond to client needs, especially in this uncertain, challenging environment. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Larry, who's going to discuss the market environment and what we're seeing with our clients."

I'm sitting here at The Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are, at this time, having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of questions right now",4409,"Thanks, Ann Marie. Welcome, everybody. I'm sitting here at The Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are, at this time, having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of questions right now. This is a 2-day affair, and it's going quite well. But it's obviously very clear to all of us that the global markets have been very challenging, and it's producing some real stress with many of our clients. 
You're witnessing a record low yield, which changes the value of the liabilities. We are seeing declining equity markets and their gap between their assets and liability. In some cases, may be irretrievable, they may not be able to ever achieve their objectives. 
In most cases, I think that investors will do that, and they'll find ways to make it. But they're looking for solutions. It's going to be solutions that are heavily based on advice by BlackRock, and I do believe we are probably the best positioned to provide that advice because we are agnostic related to our clients if they are looking for passive strategies, alongside alpha strategies, global strategies, domestic strategies with an overlay of risk management. There's no firm in the world that could provide that, and the information content that we're able to provide because of our footprint has been very helpful to our clients.
So as we reflect on the third quarter, as we help our clients digest all this, the third quarter was obviously very challenging. It's exasperated by governmental policies worldwide, not just here in the United States. Politics and government are playing a major role in market performance and market volatility. Our long-term investing have become more difficult as a result of this. 
When government focus on short-termism, when government focuses on blogs, when government is not focusing on how to best prepare an economy over a long cycle, it becomes really difficult for investors to focus on long-term investing, too. And this is one of the greatest issues that we are trying to confront with our clients. How do you manage these short-term issues, the extreme volatility, this enormous uncertainty but focused on long-term investing? This is not an easy answer because some clients, who may have 10-, 15-, 20-year liabilities, they may be judged by their shareholders or by their Board or by their pension fund committee by quarterly results. They may be judged by annual VAR if you are an insurance company, and that's how your regulators look at you. 
And so there's an incredible mismatch, and it's set, in my mind, severe portions right now how accounting is forcing unbelievable short-termism. So we have the problems of accounting and governmental policy that, in my mind, is causing this great disruption in our pension funds and great disruptions in our marketplace, as fewer and fewer people are able to cope with the long-termism.
So with governments not focusing on our long term and with governments, in many cases, just doing the wrong thing, we have many clients worldwide who are confused, frozen and looking for answers. But the markets are testing governments, and that we see that -- we saw that all throughout the third quarter, other market has tested the European situation continually. It's the incrementalism of the Europeans that really have tested the market, and the markets have resoundingly been pretty negative with this incrementalism of trying to fix the problems in Europe. Hopefully, this weekend, we will see something more than short-termism, hopefully more than incrementalism but a grand solution. 
A good example of what I would call government's failure is the European stress test, where just 10 weeks ago, the governments indicated in their stress test results that a bank like Dexia, a client of BlackRock's, has capital of 10%. They're on capital at 10%, only to have that bank nationalized a few weeks ago. And it's that sort of information and problems is really unsettling to the marketplace. I don't need to tell you that, but to me, this is just a glaring example of how government has really unsettled to the marketplace. We just can't understand how they could have an institution that's cited in the top 10 most capitalized banks in Europe, then weeks later, nationalize it. It just doesn't feel right, and as a result, people are de-risking. And if you look at our flows, the most amount of de-risking and flows that we've seen in our high-fee business has been in our European mutual funds, which I'll talk about, where we saw the greatest amount of outflows because of fear in Europe, because of things like that have been the most severe.
So worldwide, clients are de-risking. But I need to remind clients and I need to tell everyone, this is not 2008 and 2009. This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis. There's trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in the sideline, as we know, that's why we have such low rates. And if we can have a sensible, longer-term view beyond the next blog, we can have a sensible long-term positioning in fixing these problems, these structural problems in Europe. And our budget deficit and growth issues and job issues of the United States, I do believe investors would rush right back into the marketplaces, and we would have a very strong markets, which would then, in my mind, would propel the economy to higher growth rates.
During the third quarter, we had substantial declines in the global equity markets, as Ann Marie discussed. S&P was down 14%. The European blue-chip index, the stocks was down 23%. The MSCI emerging market index was down 23%. The Hang Seng was down 21%. So if you think about that, investors who diversify their portfolio, thinking that was the right thing, it produced even worse returns, and those who stayed totally in the United States. 
As a result of market instability in this lack of confidence, clients worldwide have de-risked. They are delaying investment decisions, and that is what drove the negative flows across the industry and across the globe. Clients are now asking questions about how should they be reviewing their liabilities in light of these large declines, and we expect renewed activity very shortly. And -- but we're not going to have what I would call normalized flows until we have -- the clients have better understanding of their liabilities, and that will then determine how they then manage their assets and their duration. 
Let me talk about BlackRock. Ann Marie really did a great job in talking about our earnings and the texture of our earnings. As a report noted that we did have negative flows, much of it was related to -- totally unrelated to our merger. We don't have any merger-related outflows. One, in our pipeline, a significant change was related to a client who in-sourced $30-odd billion of index business, basically. And so -- but what I think the quarter really showed, and which really gave the leadership team of BlackRock great encouragement is our business model has proven to be an incredible differentiator. We have growth businesses that we have not seen in a long time. The diversity of our business model has really produced what I would call very good revenue flows and, importantly, a very good operating income ratios. 
So in these periods of uncertainty and volatility, we are really well-positioned today to serve our clients. And I think this is one of the great feelings we have yesterday and today with our clients here, and we're seeing that repeatedly worldwide, as we are working with more and more clients related to what we can bring to them. And we are seeing, as the information showed in our third quarter, we're seeing a huge increase in request for BlackRock Solutions products, as clients are trying to truly understand how to navigate their risk on a global basis. 
But what impressed me related to our quarter, and what we're really pleased with is that diversified business model. We had growth in BlackRock Solutions, a growth in SEC lending, in transition management, which is becoming a bigger business as clients are trying to reassert how they should position their portfolio. There's much more transitioning being done. And our BlackRock multi-asset class strategies, where clients are looking for much more comprehensive solution-based assignments. And so this is what's driving this 9% year-over-year increase in base fees.
Even with these really difficult market headwinds, we saw continued organic growth across global iShares. We saw actually growth at our U.S. retail channel. We had growth in our defined contribution channel and, as I said, in our multi-asset class offerings. In multi-class offerings, we had over $3 billion of inflows across almost every channel. We are expanding the product range now into our retail products, not just institutional products. And they came across in almost every category, from alternatives, equities, fixed income. And clients are increasingly looking for strategies that rely on indexing or ETF products, as bar belling and multi-asset class strategies are what clients are looking for. And as I said earlier, no firm has that product mix. No one has the research in terms of how we can best position our clients for these complex, multi-asset class strategies.
So the other thing about the third quarter, we needed to make sure -- we needed to find ways of continuing the growth, as we see some great growth opportunities. But we needed to make sure that we are pretty disciplined. As we did in terms of the market setbacks of '08 and '09, we were very disciplined and ahead of the curve in terms of what we had to do. We remain to be very vigilant in terms of making sure where we spend our money, we spend it well. The areas that we continue to invest, even with our margins above 40%, we were investing in our retirement solutions, we invested more in alternatives, we invested more in ETFs and currently, we have been able to invest in some very high-caliber professionals, who will help fuel our future growth. A good example is Mark McCombe, who is the new Head of Asia PAC, who will be joining us at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Another great example of our investing to making it our better platform, as Ann Marie discussed, are opening of our London new office. Since our merger, we were operating in 2 different offices, and we did move people around. But it was certainly not the best of circumstances to really grow one BlackRock. Everybody is in one common building today in London, and now our London office happens to be our largest city location in the world, bigger than our corporate headquarters in New York. And so things like this are, obviously, a cost, but we expect these costs will really generate more continuity, hopefully better performance as our portfolio managers are all together, but importantly, a better dialogue amongst our teams, which will produce better dialogues with our clients, that which would produce more opportunities for our business. 
As Ann Marie suggested, we continue to generate a lot of cash flow, $1.8 billion year-to-date. We have a long history of returning capital to our shareholders, and this year, we already increased our dividends. I need to remind everybody at 37.5%, we've repurchased $2.5 billion of shares as recently as June. And I could tell everyone today, we will continue to take appropriate steps to be well-positioned to capture opportunities. I am here to tell you, I don't know many opportunities at this moment, so I'm not here to suggest and I'm not trying to forewarn that I know of anything going on. But we will be well-positioned if there are opportunities to do things and, obviously, when it is not until the first quarter of the new year where the Board of Directors would look at our dividend policy. 
So let me go over some of the businesses in the texture of the industry and in BlackRock. Let me start off with retail. Our U.S. retail business had positive flows, which was unusual in our business. And while Europe and Asia saw de-risking, for a reference point, U.S. mutual funds, x ETS had $48 billion as an industry in outflows in the third quarter. BlackRock had $1.8 billion of inflows globally, but we had long-term flows of $3.5 billion. Our U.S. retail saw positive long-term flows in the third quarter of about $2.6 billion, really concentrating at some of our unique products: Global Allocation, our equity dividend, our high-yield funds. And this is where we actually believe more and more growth will go. 
We're seeing more and more people questioning core fixed income, where fixed income is only producing 2-ish-plus percent returns, and what is the future of rates going forward. So clients are asking for solutions, whether that might be in more high-yield solutions. There could be in other types of credit solutions, dividends as a solution preferreds, and these are some of the things that we're trying to really position BlackRock to handle our clients' needs.
Cross-border or the European flows as an industry had $28 billion of outflows, and we had, as a firm, about $6 billion of outflows. And as I said, that's where the great de-risking was worldwide and especially in the mutual funds arena. Despite the $6 billion of outflows, we actually picked up market share, though. So we lost less than the industry as a whole.
So the third quarter, despite all this noise, has told me we are picking up market share. We continue to position ourselves, and we're continuing to be innovative in terms of creating products that our clients need in this new paradigm. Let me talk about global iShares.
We had, in the quarter, $10.8 billion of net new business. We had really positive flows in Europe, end flows in the U.S. As an industry, we saw about $28 billion of flows as an industry. But I should give a little more texture. Flows are significantly in July, and the industry did see significant slowdown in flows in August and September, as you're seeing that capitulation and that uncertainty even in the iShares product.
In EMEA, we had $10.8 billion of global flows -- I'm sorry, in total. But EMEA was $6.5 billion of flows. Investors are looking for safety in the region, particularly in Germany. And importantly, we are as well-positioned in Europe as we ever have been in our ETF space. There is great amount of consternation and confusion in Europe related to ETNs or exchange traded notes, which are derivative-based products. There are some regulatory review of these types of products. There are many platforms, distribution platforms, that are now forbidding these sales of ETNs. And as the largest provider of ETFs in Europe, we have been a huge beneficiary. I don't expect these market shares to persist, but in the third quarter, we picked up 80% of the net new business in Europe in the third quarter. 
We do believe, though, in the United States, in Europe, we are going to see substantial regulatory review of these products. We have been very assertive in our statements that clients need to understand what they're buying. There needs to be greater transparency. There's a big difference between a physical ETF and a derivative-based ETN. And derivative-based ETN, you have credit exposure with that issuer. Some of these issues may be very fine credits, but the disclosure of what you're buying, what is the underlying product, is pretty opaque. And we are suggesting to the SEC and to other regulators, as they think about ETFs in the future, that we have much greater transparency, much greater clarity in terms of the product. 
We have always been pretty rigorous in terms of making sure that clients understand that ETS should be physically-based. Obviously, in some cases, they're going to have some hedges or some derivative based around it, but we need to have -- even some of our products that we already have, 80% physical and some derivative base that we need to have much more clarity.
So there's no -- as ETFs have grown, no different than we saw in the mortgage market in the '80s and then in the '90s and then in this decade, a suitable product morphed into something that was very complex, and risks were contained in these products that maybe investors did not know. That was the failure of the mortgage market. As one of the founders of the mortgage market in the '70s, '80s and watching the failure of disclosure, and that market occur, we need to be very assertive as a firm and outspoken that we will not allow at BlackRock the lack of disclosure on these products. We believe these products can have a huge future, and we need to be a lot more assertive in making sure that risk and complexity is understood by all investors. 
So we are trying to bring down the risk of ETFs. There is great amount of noise about it. There's a hearing today in Washington about ETFs, and we are trying to take a very large position in terms of making sure these products grow, this industry grows, and I would love for some of my peers to be as assertive as BlackRock in making sure we have a great industry and a great product going forward.
In the Americas, we had $4.6 billion of inflows. We saw investors shift to fixed income in the U.S., offset by some outflows and equity ETFs. We're not happy with our U.S. results, and we are addressing it. We put in place a new global leadership team under Mark Wiedman, stepping up as the Global Head of iShares in September, and this is consistent with the steps we took to address the performance problems we had in SAE or scientific active equity, which is now paying off, which is actually one of our highest performing products this year as we reinvested in that product because we believe in it. Obviously, we are building a bigger, finer, great team. We're adding more teams to our ETF platform, and we believe with Mark's and all our great leaders of our ETF platform, we will once again reassert our market share in the United States.
We continue to innovate in the ETF platform. We launched a few commodity and fixed income products in Europe. A tactical allocation ETF product is garnering a lot of attention. We believe more and more tactical allocation products are going to become larger and larger, as we witnessed from our Global Allocation mutual fund as one of the fastest-growing mutual funds.
Institutional, the picture is mixed. We saw clients de-risking, while others took advantage of the steep market declines, and we're forced to rebalance. It really depends on some of our clients' needs. If a client did an LDI in 2003, and they're sitting with 6% long-dated bonds, they were less stressed than those companies that were under investment in fixed income in terms of having their core interest rate that they are looking for. And now, with the reduction in interest rates, they're sitting with some big gaps in terms of their income needs. 
Total long-dated outflows for BlackRock was $17 billion, driven by a single outflow in a passive fixed income strategy for a particularly planned liquidity needs. It had a de minimis revenue impact for us. And we continue to see modest outflows in our SAE, but we are -- we have enormous amount of dialogue now. And we believe, because of the performance over the last year and our investment in our SAE teams, we're going to start seeing new inflows. Quite frankly, many of our peers got out of this business, and we're one of the few organizations that have stayed into it, reinvested in it. And as I said, we stabilized it, we are seeing still some modest outflows. But with the conversations we're having now with clients gives me a good feeling about the future in terms of the inflows there.
As I said earlier, our institutional clients are really struggling with the low interest rate environment and the declines in the equity markets. So we are seeing very unusual behavior by our clients. Clients are looking for help, and that's what we're trying to do. 
Our performance, as I said earlier, in quant and multi-asset products was strong, and I'm very encouraged by our equity performance in these positions well for the future. As I said earlier, low interest rates is going to have, most probably, some structural changes in fixed income in the next few years as an industry. It's very hard to see how interest rates going to continue to go lower to produce more than the 2.5% returns that we see -- as we see in the market today. And so what we expect clients to start relooking at within fixed income, this is a lot of trim business because they're going to go moving from maybe core types of fixed income strategies to credit strategies, they're going to go into a go-anywhere strategy in fixed income. Some of them may go into preferreds and other types securities. We expect out of the European situation, we hope to see large amount of preferreds being issued by banks as a means to recapitalize, and although at this moment preferred to not consider Tier 1 capital in Europe. Hopefully, that will change as banks are trying to lobby their regulators as they are going through their stress tests again, as they're trying to achieve a 9% Tier 1 capital charge. At these low equity rates, it would be very powerful if the regulators would allow preferreds to be Tier 1, perpetual preferreds, I must say, not perpetual preferreds to be Tier 1. I believe there will be billions and billions and billions of dollars of interest in the world for that as bond investors need coupon or, in this case, dividends. 
The pipeline was confusing. We had this big outflow that Ann Marie talked about. I mentioned it earlier, where a client -- a very large client of ours is internalizing a $30-plus billion mandate. They're doing it for cost containment, and so this is something that will probably happen mid next year. But we are giving you an advanced word. So this is not going to happen any -- in this quarter, may not even happen in the first quarter, but we've been told this will happen some time mid next year. But despite that, we've seen some very good flows, and what I'm also personally excited about, that we are seeing good flows in what I would call long-dated products, higher fee-paying products. We are continuing to see some real opportunities in our alternative space. We did have outflows in our currency type of products, and that's related to the big swings in dollar or in euro. But we did have to offset that. $1 billion inflows of our commodity products would totally offset these currency types of outflows that we saw in the third quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions. I just can't say enough of how this is helping us in the positioning in the new paradigm. During the quarter, we were hired by the National Bank of Greece, so we're inside working with the regulators of Europe and Greece to try to help them understand and ascertain the situation there. This is a similar assignment that we won in Ireland earlier in the year. We are working with more European banks than we've ever done in our platform. We have more opportunities in the Middle East, more opportunities in Asia than we've ever had before. 
In the quarter, as we noted, we have 13 new assignments. These are offsetting a lot of the 1 type of assignments that we had. This is totally offsetting the consistent reduction in our outstanding of advisory business as some of our clients are bringing down some of their troubled assets. And so this has been an extraordinary year so far for us. And more importantly, we are starting to see much more stickier revenues in our solution business, as we are winning more and more Aladdin-like assignments. We continue to have dialogue with a few substantial Aladdin assignments. And the last thing I would say about Aladdin, we did -- we are implementing our first Aladdin assignment. That is not just fixed income, but it is now equity and fixed income. This what we believe will become a cornerstone of our growth as our equity modules are as industry first-class as our fixed income modules in our risk management. 
And lastly, as I said earlier, we continue to invest in our platform. I mentioned hiring Mark McCombe in Asia, but we hired Mark Taborsky in our BlackRock multi-asset class strategy. And we are very excited about the individuals that we are seeing who are looking to join our firm. We have never enjoyed such a position in which we could hire industry leaders to help us build this platform. This is across region and across product.
So, in summary, I know I've been talking a long time, we are really uniquely positioned for this environment, I think better positioned than any organization that I know of in the industry. With the persistence of volatility in our marketplaces, with low interest rates, a low growth environment, all our investors are reevaluating their investment strategies and asset allocation decisions. We hope we're in that position to help our clients. That is our #1 job. Our job has to be an ally. We have to be there working alongside with our clients. We have a challenging world of demands, a better and a more robust range of solutions. We have higher demands that we provide value-added advice, better risk management tools. And so the demands on our time are growing. And that's why we have to continue to invest.  
So, in summary, we're pretty well-positioned here. I just -- I would like to thank all the employees for working with our clients, helping our clients and producing the results that we did in the third quarter. 
I'll open it up for questions."

The Basel III, as banks are going to be required to have much more capital, the utilization of their balance sheet is going to affect everybody. Bid-ask spreads are going to be widening because these institutions are going to need to make some form of profit for putting their balance sheet in front of you. This is one of the reasons why we have been very rigorous in spending a lot of money, building the trading platform, to cross trades for our clients. This is one of the actions that we are doing, and we continue to do that. And we're continuing to build it. And so what we are trying to use that scale of ours to differentiate us with our clients and hopefully to reduce that friction cost that we're going to see in the marketplace, and so this is something that we are quite sensitive on. In terms of our interaction with our regulators, well, we are actually having some very good dialogues with our regulators. We are trying to be above the line with them and really working with them in terms of trying to help them understand the difference between asset management and organizations that work on their own balance sheet. We are trying to make sure that in our conversations related to ETFs, they understand the difference between ETFs and ETNs. We have been very rigorous in terms of -- and an outlier in the industry in the money market fund industry suggesting that capital should be put in place to offer NAV declines. And we do believe regulators are going to begin to focus on the money market fund industry, because I do believe from every regulator I speak to, they believe money market funds do present risk in the system. And there's going to have to be some ways of protecting the system. And so we are trying to work with regulators in terms of understanding the type of risk that's presented and how best to effectuate and minimize that risk. In terms of everyday business, until we really get more dialogue and in terms of -- and more certainty of how they're going to implement some of these strategies, it's hard for us to say how that will further impact BlackRock or how we work with our clients. But it's a moving dialogue, and I could promise you, we are involved in the dialogues with the regulators. When they want to hear our opinions, we are offering them as loud as possible. We have -- I think as you know, we do have an office now in Washington, working alongside with our regulators. It happens to be one of our biggest businesses now working in Washington. It's a core competency that we have to work with our regulators and working with our politicians to help our investors. So one thing I said to our investors at our conference, we are one of the lone sheep working with Washington in trying to protect investor interest and investor rights."

As I said, if you don't believe interest rates have that much further to go down over the next few years, you're only earning a few hundred basis points of return. And so we're going to start seeing other -- we're going to see clients looking to use beta as a bigger flow. You saw that in the ETF flows over the last quarter. So we continue to expect that to continue. We are seeing more and more inquiry in high yield and more and more inquiries in the higher-yielding fixed income products, whether it's in Europe or the U.S. So, once again, it's more bar belling. So indexing, obviously, is a lower fee, higher margin result, and the credit and the other types of products are going to be higher fees, in many cases, lower margin business. So I think we're going to be probably be as best positioned to handle that and take that in. I should remind everybody, indexation, even institutional indexation of fixed income, is not like indexation of the S&P. There are thousands of bonds in the Barclays index or other fixed income type of indexes. You have to have a lot more technology to replicate the movements of fixed income to get close to an index. So it's much harder for institutions to internalize fixed income indexing. So we look at that as -- even if institutions went that way, we would expect to be a huge beneficiary of that. The second thing, in terms of equities, we're going to continue to see more bar belling. As you saw the flows, people were de-risking in core type of products. They were going into more specialty type of products. They're going into more alternatives, and they are using as a baseline a foundation they're going into index. So it really depends on each client's issues, whether they are liability, whether they are horizons and -- but I think it's very clear across the board, investors are looking for some form of advice."

We're pleased to report that really despite an adverse and volatile market in recent months, BlackRock delivered strong results in the quarter. It's a confusing environment out there. Clients, more than ever, are looking for advice and solutions in the face of uncertainty, and BlackRock's diverse mix of business leaves us well-positioned to meet their needs. BlackRock was able to provide pooled end products that were especially important to investors in this environment. 
We experienced large index flows in both our institutional ETF products, though liquidity of these products allowed clients to react rapidly to the environment and more efficiently move into or out of asset classes. We generated inflows into multi-asset class products across each of our channels. BlackRock is uniquely suited to meet the growing demand for these products. 
We also saw clients getting into income-oriented products in the face of the sustained low interest rate environment. Of course, we're not immune to the effects of negative markets on AUM, flows, revenues. And while revenue was down from the second quarter, the diversity of our product set and clients allowed us to lessen the impact of the negative flow environment, such that our flows were relatively flat in the quarter. 
The nature of our cost space meant we were able to maintain strong margins as we balance beta-driven revenue effects with expense management. In combination, this resulted in cash flow generation of $1.7 billion year-to-date and allowed us to return a large amount of cash to shareholders. Larry is going to be talking a lot more about the environment, the flows we're seeing across our business and what we believe it means for our clients and for BlackRock. But first, I'm just going to focus on the results themselves.
As I said, it's a good story. And these, for me, key takeaway is that our performance in the face of really tough global headwinds illustrates the strength of BlackRock's business model: our diversified global platform, our broad mix of product and client capability. Now I'm going to be referring to the slides in the earnings supplement. You can find those on the website. And as I go through results, I'll be discussing primarily as adjusted results.
We're going to start us out on Slide 1. You can see on Slide 1, on the right-hand side, our operating results of $849 million. These were up 15% year-over-year, and that's driven both by revenue growth and margin improvement. Third quarter EPS, which you can see on the right-hand side, came in at $2.83.
Moving on to, again, the strong margin story, which you can see on Slide 2, our operating margin came in at 41 -- 40.1% in the quarter. That showed improvement of over 1.5 points compared to the third quarter 2010. More importantly, as margin can vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter, our year-to-date margin of 39.6% also showed improvement compared to full-year 2010. And in the face of the lower revenue environment, our comped revenue ratio was 34.2%, which is exactly consistent with the first and second quarters and is really well within the long-term range we've been running of about 35%. We believe this highlights our financial discipline and the variable nature of our expense base.
Just pausing for a second on the environment and looking at Slide 3, you can see that S&P declined, everyone knows there's 14% in the third quarter. But when you take a look at average markets compared to average markets in the second quarter, the decline was 7%. World markets fared even worse, driven by the European uncertainties. While recent volatility on market declines are affecting AUM investor sentiment, average markets in the third quarter were still 12% better than a year ago. 
And then we'll walk through a comparison of the results of this year compared to last year, and then I'll move on to sequential results. So I'm going to move ahead to Slide 5. And on Slide 5, you can see that operating EPS was up $0.51 year-over-year, and that's the green bar on the page. The growth in operating EPS reflected the 15% or $112 million growth in operating income that I mentioned earlier. The EPS in the quarter also benefited $0.16 from our June share repurchase. Earnings per share, which you can see on the right-hand side of $2.83, included 3/12 of operating earnings in the dark blue, offset by $0.29 of non-operating expense. 
Our third quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32.3%. The GAAP tax rate was 13.7%. The GAAP tax rate reflected changes in the value of our deferred tax liability, and those changes resulted from both U.K. tax legislative change and a U.S. state tax selection. These benefits, totaling $129 million, were noncash. We excluded them from as adjusted results.
I'm going to move ahead to revenues, which you can see on Slide 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion. That's up 6% from 2010, primarily driven by a 9% growth in base fees, which is the large green bar on the slide, and helped by a 16% growth in BRS revenue. But before I get into base fees, it's really worth noting the benefits for our business model of our diverse revenue sources. 
This quarter, we generated $276 million of revenue or 12% of our total revenues from sources other than base fees. And sources other than base fees are also contributing meaningfully to our improvements in revenue. So if you take a look at year-to-date revenue increases compared to 2010, we've improved $33 million in BRS, $47 million in SEC lending, which is a part of base fees, and $10 million in performance fees. And while I just mentioned that year-to-date were up in performance fees, during the third quarter, performance fees came in $91 million, which were actually down $23 million compared to a year ago. 
Our performance fees in the quarter included $51 million of fees related to alternative products and $40 million on long-dated products, primarily based on relative performance. A majority of our performance fee eligible active equity products generated healthy performance over the measurement period. So as a result of that, performance fees generated based on relative performance were actually better than a year ago. At the same time, recent market turmoil negatively affected the level of fees generated on our absolute return product, with several of our large hedge funds now below high water marks. We do expect this to affect negatively the level of fourth quarter performance fees compared to a year ago.
And then just BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues came in at the quarter at $117 million. That included continued growth in our core Latin [ph] business, as clients are seeking tools to manage risks in the face of this crazy, uncertain environment. The growth in BRS revenues this year has come almost exclusively from ongoing core assignments, which will continue to benefit the revenue base in 2012 and beyond.
So now moving on to base fees, which came in at $1.9 billion and with a key driver to revenue increases, up 9% from 2010 and laid out for you on Slide 8. We had revenue growth in all long-dated asset classes. This was offset partially by the revenue effect of the exodus from low-yielding cash products over the past year. The diversity of long-dated offerings across active and passive products, serving multiple client types, is one of our core strengths that has been key to the revenue growth. And you can really see that across all the green bars on the bottom left of Page 8.
Moving on to expenses on Slide 9, third quarter as adjusted expenses were $1.4 billion, up only 2% from 2010. And remember, to put that back into perspective of the 9% growth in base fees we just talked about. And so that disproportionate level of increases what's really contributing to the margin expansion.
As I mentioned in the last call, BlackRock entered into a lease to bring new office space in the City of London. Last week, Larry was in the London office, commemorating the opening. The office brings into a single location all of our London employees and really enhances our ability to work together and serve our clients. We're already seeing the benefits of being in a single space. As a result of the move to this new office, we reported a $63 million onetime charge related to the acceleration of the remaining lease obligations on our prior London spaces. We have excluded this charge from as adjusted results. The charge was below the range I had mentioned on the last call of $75 million to $100 million, and that was primarily due to the opportunity to sublease a portion of this space.
Now I'm going to move on to sequential results, and there's 3 primary factors I'd like to focus on as we get into sequential: market effects on base fees, lower expenses and the market effects on our co-investment. 
So within your slides, I'm going to move ahead to Slide 11. Our operating EPS this quarter improved $0.03 from the second quarter. Non-operating expense increased $0.20. Increase in non-operating expense reflected market-driven, noncash marks of our co-investment. I'll discuss that more in a minute. I'll also point out that our share repurchase in June resulted in $0.10 incremental benefit to EPS compared to the second quarter. 
On Slide 12, you can see that in the face of revenue decreases of $122 million, we reduced expenses by $88 million.
And looking at Slide 13, you can see that base fees decreased compared to the prior quarter by about $150 million, where the key driver to the revenue decreased. About 1/3 of that decrease in base fees is related to SEC lending, which is seasonally strong in the second quarter, and the remaining related primarily to the effect of unfavorable markets on equity AUM, which you can see on Slide 14, the bigger red bars are all about the markets effects on equity. 
So moving ahead to Slide 15, and at the same time, expenses decreased $88 million. And that's related primarily to the effects of lower AUM and revenue on compensation, on distribution and servicing and on direct fund expense. Management action led to lower G&A expense, and that primarily was lower marketing in a sense.
So moving ahead now to Slide 17. Non-operating expense for the quarter came in $79 million. That included $42 million of negative marks. Those were primarily on our co-investments in distressed credit. Spreads on those products whined[ph] significantly during the quarter. It's worth noting that despite recent market declines, year-to-date market marks on the investment portfolio are still positive $11 million. Net interest expense in the quarter was $37 million. The value of our investment portfolio was stable at about $1 billion or $930 million when you exclude hedges or items which are hedged. 
We see the 2 new retail products this quarter, which offset the effect of lower markets on the value of the portfolio. Those 2 new products are for retail investors, one is hedge fund of fund in the U.S. and the other is a European absolute bond return fund in Europe. We believe these are both great opportunities that are strategically important for our retail clients. And I always like to remind everyone that we do not have any proprietary investments. Our business model is to act as fiduciaries and to manage assets on behalf of our clients. We're not in business to make money from our balance sheet, and our investments on the balance sheet are extremely small. The relative amount of investments we have are just alongside clients who are seeding new products. But when we think of the size of what we do for our clients of over $3 trillion, again, there's less than $1 billion sitting there that we are invested in.
Moving on to Slide 18, I'd like to end by discussing our free cash flow. I started out mentioning that in the beginning, we continue to generate substantial cash flow, about $1 billion this quarter. You can see on the slide, $1.7 billion year-to-date. That's up about $300 million from what we have produced year-to-date last year. And including on the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that including our recent repurchase of Bank of America's remaining stake, our payout is 150%, including a 43% dividend payout. 
So, really, despite declining and volatile markets, we delivered a healthy margin, we generated substantial cash flow and we've returned a large amount of cash to shareholders. Overtime, our intention is to continue to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders, while also reinvesting for future growth. We are more confident than ever in our business model and our growth opportunities. Our broad-based, diversified platform allows us to respond to client needs, especially in this uncertain, challenging environment. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Larry, who's going to discuss the market environment and what we're seeing with our clients."

I'm sitting here at The Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are, at this time, having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of questions right now",4409,"Thanks, Ann Marie. Welcome, everybody. I'm sitting here at The Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are, at this time, having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of questions right now. This is a 2-day affair, and it's going quite well. But it's obviously very clear to all of us that the global markets have been very challenging, and it's producing some real stress with many of our clients. 
You're witnessing a record low yield, which changes the value of their liabilities. We are seeing declining equity markets and their gap between their assets and liability. In some cases, may be irretrievable, they may not be able to ever achieve their objectives. 
In most cases, I think that investors will do that, and they'll find ways to make it. But they're looking for solutions. It's going to be solutions that are heavily based on advice by BlackRock, and I do believe we are probably the best positioned to provide that advice because we are agnostic-related to our clients if they are looking for passive strategies, alongside alpha strategies, global strategies, domestic strategies with an overlay of risk management. There's no firm in the world that could provide that, and the information content that we're able to provide because of our footprint has been very helpful to our clients.
So as we reflect on the third quarter, as we help our clients digest all this, the third quarter was obviously very challenging. It's exasperated by governmental policies worldwide, not just here in the United States. Politics and government are playing a major role in market performance and market volatility. Long-term investing have become more difficult as a result of this. 
When government focus on short-termism, when government focuses on blogs, when government is not focusing on how to best prepare an economy over a long cycle, it becomes really difficult for investors to focus on long-term investing, too. And this is one of the greatest issues that we are trying to confront with our clients. How do you manage these short-term issues, the extreme volatility, this enormous uncertainty but focus on long-term investing? This is not an easy answer because some clients, who may have 10-, 15-, 20-year liabilities, they may be judged by their shareholders or by their Board or by their pension fund committee by quarterly results. They may be judged by annual VAR if you are an insurance company, and that's how your regulators look at you. 
And so there's an incredible mismatch, and it's at, in my mind, severe preportions right now how accounting is forcing unbelievable short-termism. So we have the problems of accounting and governmental policy that, in my mind, is causing this great disruption in our pension funds and great disruptions in our marketplace, as fewer and fewer people are able to cope with the long-termism.
So with governments not focusing on our long term and with governments, in many cases, just doing the wrong thing, we have many clients worldwide who are confused, frozen and looking for answers. But the markets are testing governments, and that we see that -- we saw that all throughout the third quarter, other [ph]  market has tested the European situation continually. It's the incrementalism of the Europeans that really have tested the market, and the markets have resoundingly been pretty negative with this incrementalism of trying to fix the problems in Europe. Hopefully, this weekend, we will see something more than short-termism, hopefully more than incrementalism but a grand solution. 
A good example of what I would call government's failure is the European stress test, where just 10 weeks ago, the governments indicated in their stress test results that a bank like Dexia, a client of BlackRock's, has capital of 10%. They're on capital at 10%, only to have that bank nationalized a few weeks ago. And it's that sort of information and problems is really unsettling to the marketplace. I don't need to tell you that, but to me, this is just a glaring example of how government has really unsettled the marketplace. We just can't understand how they could have an institution that's cited in the top 10 most capitalized banks in Europe, then weeks later, nationalize it. It just doesn't feel right, and as a result, people are de-risking. And if you look at our flows, the most amount of de-risking and flows that we've seen in our high-fee business has been in our European mutual funds, which I'll talk about, where we saw the greatest amount of outflows because of fear in Europe, because of things like that have been the most severe.
So worldwide, clients are de-risking. But I need to remind clients and I need to tell everyone, this is not 2008 and 2009. This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis. There's trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in the sideline, as we know, that's why we have such low rates. And if we can have a sensible, longer-term view beyond the next blog, we can have a sensible long-term positioning in fixing these problems, these structural problems in Europe. And our budget deficit and growth issues and job issues of the United States, I do believe investors would rush right back into the marketplaces, and we would have a very strong markets, which would then, in my mind, would propel the economy to higher growth rates.
During the third quarter, we had substantial declines in the global equity markets, as Ann Marie discussed. S&P was down 14%. The European blue-chip index, the stocks was down 23%. The MSCI emerging market index was down 23%. The Hang Seng was down 21%. So if you think about that, investors who diversify their portfolio, thinking that was the right thing, it produced even worse returns, than those who stayed totally in the United States. 
As a result of market instability and this lack of confidence, clients worldwide have de-risked. They are delaying investment decisions, and that is what drove the negative flows across the industry and across the globe. Clients are now asking questions about how should they be reviewing their liabilities in light of these large declines, and we expect renewed activity very shortly. And -- but we're not going to have what I would call normalized flows until we have -- our clients have better understanding of their liabilities, and that will then determine how they then manage their assets and their duration. 
Let me talk about BlackRock. Ann Marie really did a great job in talking about our earnings and the texture of our earnings. As a report noted that we did have negative flows, much of it was related to -- totally unrelated to our merger. We don't have any merger-related outflows. One, in our pipeline, a significant change was related to a client who in-sourced $30-odd billion of index business, basically. And so -- but what I think the quarter really showed, and which really gave the leadership team of BlackRock great encouragement is our business model has proven to be an incredible differentiator. We have growth businesses that we have not seen in a long time. The diversity of our business model has really produced what I would call very good revenue flows and, importantly, a very good operating income ratios. 
So in these periods of uncertainty and volatility, we are really well-positioned today to serve our clients. And I think this is one of the great feelings we have yesterday and today with our clients here, and we're seeing that repeatedly worldwide, as we are working with more and more clients related to what we can bring to them. And we are seeing, as the information showed in our third quarter, we're seeing a huge increase in request for BlackRock Solutions products, as clients are trying to truly understand how to navigate their risk on a global basis. 
But what impressed me related to our quarter, and what we're really pleased with is that diversified business model. We had growth in BlackRock Solutions, a growth in SEC lending, in transition management, which is becoming a bigger business as clients are trying to reassert how they should position their portfolio. There's much more transitioning being done. And our BlackRock multi-asset class strategies, where clients are looking for much more comprehensive solution-based assignments. And so this is what's driving this 9% year-over-year increase in base fees.
Even with these really difficult market headwinds, we saw continued organic growth across global iShares. We saw actually growth at our U.S. retail channel. We had growth in our defined contribution channel and, as I said, in our multi-asset class offerings. In multi-class offerings, we had over $3 billion of inflows across almost every channel. We are expanding the product range now into our retail products, not just institutional products. And they came across in almost every category, from alternatives, equities, fixed income. And clients are increasingly looking for strategies that rely on indexing or ETF products, as bar belling and multi-asset class strategies are what clients are looking for. And as I said earlier, no firm has that product mix. No one has the research in terms of how we can best position our clients for these complex, multi-asset class strategies.
So the other thing about the third quarter, we needed to make sure -- we needed to find ways of continuing the growth, as we see some great growth opportunities. But we needed to make sure that we are pretty disciplined. As we did in terms of the market setbacks of '08 and '09, we were very disciplined and ahead of the curve in terms of what we had to do. We remain to be very vigilant in terms of making sure where we spend our money, we spent it well. The areas that we continue to invest, even with our margins above 40%, we were investing in our retirement solutions, we invested more in alternatives, we invested more in ETFs and currently [ph] , we have been able to invest in some very high-caliber professionals, who will help fuel our future growth. A good example is Mark McCombe, who is the new Head of Asia PAC, who will be joining us at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Another great example of our investing to making it our better platform, as Ann Marie discussed, our opening of our London new office. Since our merger, we were operating in 2 different offices, and we did move people around. But it was certainly not the best of circumstances to really grow one BlackRock. Everybody is in one common building today in London, and now our London office happens to be our largest city location in the world, bigger than our corporate headquarters in New York. And so things like this are, obviously, a cost, but we expect these costs will really generate more continuity, hopefully better performance as our portfolio managers are all together, but importantly, a better dialogue amongst our teams, which will produce better dialogues with our clients, that which would produce more opportunities for our business. 
As Ann Marie suggested, we continue to generate a lot of cash flow, $1.8 billion year-to-date. We have a long history of returning capital to our shareholders, and this year, we already increased our dividends. I need to remind everybody at 37.5%, we've repurchased $2.5 billion of shares as recently as June. And I could tell everyone today, we will continue to take appropriate steps to be well-positioned to capture opportunities. I am here to tell you, I don't know many opportunities at this moment, so I'm not here to suggest and I'm not trying to forewarn that I know of anything going on. But we will be well-positioned if there are opportunities to do things and, obviously, when it is not until the first quarter of the new year where the Board of Directors would look at our dividend policy. 
So let me go over some of the businesses in the texture of the industry and in BlackRock. Let me start off with retail. Our U.S. retail business had positive flows, which was unusual in our business. And while Europe and Asia saw de-risking, for a reference point, U.S. mutual funds, x ETS had $48 billion as an industry in outflows in the third quarter. BlackRock had $1.8 billion of inflows globally, but we had long-term flows of $3.5 billion. Our U.S. retail saw positive long-term flows in the third quarter of about $2.6 billion, really concentrating at some of our unique products: Global Allocation, our equity dividend, our high-yield funds. And this is where we actually believe more and more growth will go. 
We're seeing more and more people questioning core fixed income, where fixed income is only producing 2-ish-plus percent returns, and what is the future of rates going forward. So clients are asking for solutions, whether that might be in more high-yield solutions. There could be in other types of credit solutions, dividends as a solution preferreds, and these are some of the things that we're trying to really position BlackRock to handle our clients' needs.
Cross-border or the European flows as an industry had $28 billion of outflows, and we had, as a firm, about $6 billion of outflows. And as I said, that's where the great de-risking was worldwide and especially in the mutual funds arena. Despite the $6 billion of outflows, we actually picked up market share, though. So we lost less than the industry as a whole.
So the third quarter, despite all this noise, has told me we are picking up market share. We continue to position ourselves, and we're continuing to be innovative in terms of creating products that our clients need in this new paradigm. Let me talk about global iShares.
We had, in the quarter, $10.8 billion of net new business. We had really positive flows in Europe, end flows in the U.S. As an industry, we saw about $28 billion of flows as an industry. But I should give a little more texture. Flows are significantly in July, and the industry did see significant slowdown in flows in August and September, as you're seeing that capitulation and that uncertainty even in the iShares product.
In EMEA, we had $10.8 billion of global flows -- I'm sorry, in total. But EMEA was $6.5 billion of flows. Investors are looking for safety in the region, particularly in Germany. And importantly, we are as well-positioned in Europe as we ever have been in our ETF space. There is great amount of consternation and confusion in Europe related to ETNs or exchange traded notes, which are derivative-based products. There are some regulatory review of these types of products. There are many platforms, distribution platforms, that are now forbidding these sales of ETNs. And as the largest provider of ETFs in Europe, we have been a huge beneficiary. I don't expect these market shares to persist, but in the third quarter, we picked up 80% of the net new business in Europe in the third quarter. 
We do believe, though, in the United States, in Europe, we are going to see substantial regulatory review of these products. We have been very assertive in our statements that clients need to understand what they're buying. There needs to be greater transparency. There's a big difference between a physical ETF and a derivative-based ETN. And derivative-based ETN, you have credit exposure with that issuer. Some of these issues may be very fine credits, but the disclosure of what you're buying, what is the underlying product, is pretty opaque. And we are suggesting to the SEC and to other regulators, as they think about ETFs in the future, that we have much greater transparency, much greater clarity in terms of the product. 
We have always been pretty rigorous in terms of making sure that clients understand that ETFs should be physically-based. Obviously, in some cases, they're going to have some hedges or some derivative based around it, but we need to have -- even some of our products that we already have, 80% physical and some derivative base that we need to have much more clarity.
So there's no -- as ETFs have grown, no different than we saw in the mortgage market in the '80s and then in the '90s and then in this decade, a simple product morphed into something that was very complex, and risks were contained in these products that maybe investors did not know. That was the failure of the mortgage market. As one of the founders of the mortgage market in the '70s, '80s and watching the failure of disclosure in that market occur, we need to be very assertive as a firm and outspoken that we will not allow at BlackRock the lack of disclosure on these products. We believe these products can have a huge future, and we need to be a lot more assertive in making sure that risk and complexity is understood by all investors. 
So we are trying to bring down the risk of ETFs. There is great amount of noise about it. There's a hearing today in Washington about ETFs, and we are trying to take a very large position in terms of making sure these products grow, this industry grows, and I would love for some of my peers to be as assertive as BlackRock in making sure we have a great industry and a great product going forward.
In the Americas, we had $4.6 billion of inflows. We saw investors shift to fixed income in the U.S., offset by some outflows and equity ETFs. We're not happy with our U.S. results, and we are addressing it. We put in place a new global leadership team under Mark Wiedman, stepping up as the Global Head of iShares in September, and this is consistent with the steps we took to address the performance problems we had in SAE or scientific active equity, which is now paying off, which is actually one of our highest performing products this year as we reinvested in that product because we believed in it. Obviously, we are building a bigger, finer, great team. We're adding more teams to our ETF platform, and we believe with Mark's and all our great leaders of our ETF platform, we will once again reassert our market share in the United States.
We continue to innovate in the ETF platform. We launched a few commodity and fixed income products in Europe. A tactical allocation ETF product is garnering a lot of attention. We believe more and more tactical allocation products are going to become larger and larger, as we witnessed from our Global Allocation mutual fund as one of the fastest-growing mutual funds.
Institutional, the picture is mixed. We saw clients de-risking, while others took advantage of the steep market declines, and we're forced to rebalance. It really depends on some of our clients' needs. If a client did an LDI in 2003, and they're sitting with 6% long-dated bonds, they were less stressed than those companies that were under invested in fixed income in terms of having their core interest rate that they are looking for. And now, with the reduction in interest rates, they're sitting with some big gaps in terms of their income needs. 
Total long-dated outflows for BlackRock was $17 billion, driven by a single outflow in a passive fixed income strategy for a particularly planned liquidity needs. It had a de minimis revenue impact for us. And we continue to see modest outflows in our SAE, but we are -- we have enormous amount of dialogue now. And we believe, because of the performance over the last year and our investment in our SAE teams, we're going to start seeing new inflows. Quite frankly, many of our peers got out of this business, and we're one of the few organizations that have stayed into it, reinvested in it. And as I said, we stabilized it, we are seeing still some modest outflows. But the conversations we're having now with clients gives me a good feeling about the future in terms of the inflows there.
As I said earlier, our institutional clients are really struggling with the low interest rate environment and the declines in the equity markets. So we are seeing very unusual behavior by our clients. Clients are looking for help, and that's what we're trying to do. 
Our performance, as I said earlier, in quant and multi-asset products was strong, and I'm very encouraged by our equity performance in its' positions well for the future. As I said earlier, low interest rates is going to have, most probably, some structural changes in fixed income in the next few years as an industry. It's very hard to see how interest rates going to continue to go lower to produce more than the 2.5% returns that we see -- as we see in the market today. And so what we expect clients to start relooking at within fixed income, this is a lot of trim business because they're going to go moving from maybe core types of fixed income strategies to credit strategies, they're going to go into a go-anywhere strategy in fixed income. Some of them may go into preferreds and other type securities. We expect out of the European situation, we hope to see a large amount of preferreds being issued by banks as a means to recapitalize, and although at this moment preferred to not consider Tier 1 capital in Europe. Hopefully, that will change as banks are trying to lobby their regulators as they are going through their stress tests again, as they're trying to achieve a 9% Tier 1 capital charge. At these low equity rates, it would be very powerful if the regulators would allow preferreds to be Tier 1, perpetual preferreds, I must say, not perpetual preferreds to be Tier 1. I believe there will be billions and billions and billions of dollars of interest in the world for that as bond investors need coupon or, in this case, dividends. 
The pipeline was confusing. We had this big outflow that Ann Marie talked about. I mentioned it earlier, where a client -- a very large client of ours is internalizing a $30-plus billion mandate. They're doing it for cost containment, and so this is something that will probably happen mid next year. But we are giving you an advanced word. So this is not going to happen any -- in this quarter, may not even happen in the first quarter, but we've been told this will happen some time mid next year. But despite that, we've seen some very good flows, and what I'm also personally excited about, that we are seeing good flows in what I would call long-dated products, higher fee-paying products. We are continuing to see some real opportunities in our alternative space. We did have outflows in our currency type of products, and that's related to the big swings in dollar or in euro. But we did have to offset that. $1 billion inflows of our commodity products would totally offset these currency types of outflows that we saw in the third quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions. I just can't say enough of how this is helping us in the positioning in the new paradigm. During the quarter, we were hired by the National Bank of Greece, so we're inside working with the regulators of Europe and Greece to try to help them understand and ascertain the situation there. This is a similar assignment that we won in Ireland earlier in the year. We are working with more European banks than we've ever done in our platform. We have more opportunities in the Middle East, more opportunities in Asia than we've ever had before. 
In the quarter, as we noted, we have 13 new assignments. These are offsetting a lot of the 1 type of assignments that we had. This is totally offsetting the consistent reduction in our outstanding of advisory business as some of our clients are bringing down some of their troubled assets. And so this has been an extraordinary year so far for us. And more importantly, we are starting to see much more stickier revenues in our solution business, as we are winning more and more Aladdin-like assignments. We continue to have dialogue with a few substantial Aladdin assignments. And the last thing I would say about Aladdin, we did -- we are implementing our first Aladdin assignment that is not just fixed income, but it is now equity and fixed income. This what we believe will become a cornerstone of our growth as our equity modules are as industry first-class as our fixed income modules in our risk management. 
And lastly, as I said earlier, we continue to invest in our platform. I mentioned hiring Mark McCombes in Asia, but we hired Mark Taborsky in our BlackRock multi-asset class strategy. And we are very excited about the individuals that we are seeing who are looking to join our firm. We have never enjoyed such a position in which we could hire industry leaders to help us build this platform. This is across region and across product.
So, in summary, I know I've been talking a long time, we are really uniquely positioned for this environment, I think better positioned than any organization that I know of in the industry. With the persistence of volatility in our marketplaces, with low interest rates, a low growth environment, all our investors are reevaluating their investment strategies and asset allocation decisions. We hope we're in that position to help our clients. That is our #1 job. Our job has to be an ally. We have to be there working alongside with our clients. We have a challenging world of demands, a better and a more robust range of solutions. We have higher demands that we provide value-added advice, better risk management tools. And so the demands on our time are growing. And that's why we have to continue to invest.  
So, in summary, we're pretty well-positioned here. I just -- I would like to thank all the employees for working with our clients, helping our clients and producing the results that we did in the third quarter. 
I'll open it up for questions."

The Basel III, as banks are going to be required to have much more capital, the utilization of their balance sheet is going to affect everybody. Bid-ask spreads are going to be widening because these institutions are going to need to make some form of profit for putting their balance sheet in front of you. This is one of the reasons why we have been very rigorous in spending a lot of money, building the trading platform, to cross trades for our clients. This is one of the actions that we are doing, and we continue to do that. And we're continuing to build it. And so what we are trying to use that scale of ours to differentiate us with our clients and hopefully to reduce that friction cost that we're going to see in the marketplace, and so this is something that we are quite sensitive on. In terms of our interaction with our regulators, well, we are actually having some very good dialogues with our regulators. We are trying to be above the line with them and really working with them in terms of trying to help them understand the difference between asset management and organizations that work on their own balance sheet. We are trying to make sure that in our conversations related to ETFs, they understand the difference between ETFs and ETNs. We have been very rigorous in terms of -- and an outlier in the industry in the money market fund industry suggesting that capital should be put in place to offer NAV declines. And we do believe regulators are going to begin to focus on the money market fund industry, because I do believe from every regulator I speak to, they believe money market funds do present risk in the system. And there's going to have to be some ways of protecting the system. And so we are trying to work with regulators in terms of understanding the type of risk that's presented and how best to effectuate and minimize that risk. In terms of everyday business, until we really get more dialogue and in terms of -- and more certainty of how they're going to implement some of these strategies, it's hard for us to say how that will further impact BlackRock or how we work with our clients. But it's a moving dialogue, and I could promise you, we are involved in the dialogues with the regulators. When they want to hear our opinions, we are offering them as loud as possible. We have -- I think as you know, we do have an office now in Washington, working alongside with our regulators. It happens to be one of our biggest businesses now working in Washington. It's a core competency that we have to work with our regulators and working with our politicians to help our investors. So one thing I said to our investors at our conference, we are one of the lone sheep working with Washington in trying to protect investors' interests and investor rights."

And so we're going to start seeing other -- we're going to see clients looking to use beta as a bigger flow. You saw that in the ETF flows over the last quarter. So we continue to expect that to continue. We are seeing more and more inquiry in high yield and more and more inquiries in the higher-yielding fixed income products, whether it's in Europe or the U.S. So, once again, it's more bar belling. So indexing, obviously, is a lower fee, higher margin result, and the credit and the other types of products are going to be higher fees, in many cases, lower margin business. So I think we're going to be probably be as best positioned to handle that and take that in. I should remind everybody, indexation, even institutional indexation of fixed income, is not like indexation of the S&P. There are thousands of bonds in the Barclays index or other fixed income type of indexes. You have to have a lot more technology to replicate the movements of fixed income to get close to an index. So it's much harder for institutions to internalize fixed income indexing. So we look at that as -- even if institutions went that way, we would expect to be a huge beneficiary of that. The second thing, in terms of equities, we're going to continue to see more bar belling. As you saw the flows, people were de-risking in core type of products. They were going into more specialty type of products. They're going into more alternatives, and they are using as a baseline a foundation they're going into index. So it really depends on each client's issues, where they are with their liability, whether they are horizons and -- but I think it's very clear across the board, investors are looking for some form of advice."

Clients, more than ever, are looki",2186,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that really despite an adverse and volatile market in recent months, BlackRock delivered strong results in the quarter. It's a confusing environment out there. Clients, more than ever, are looking for advice and solutions in the face of uncertainty, and BlackRock's diverse mix of business leaves us well-positioned to meet their needs. BlackRock was able to provide pooled end products that were especially important to investors in this environment. 
We experienced large index flows in both our institutional ETF products, though liquidity of these products allowed clients to react rapidly to the environment and more efficiently move into or out of asset classes. We generated inflows into multi-asset class products across each of our channels. BlackRock is uniquely suited to meet the growing demand for these products. 
We also saw clients getting into income-oriented products in the face of the sustained low interest rate environment. Of course, we're not immune to the effects of negative markets on AUM, flows, revenues. And while revenue was down from the second quarter, the diversity of our product set and clients allowed us to lessen the impact of the negative flow environment, such that our flows were relatively flat in the quarter. 
The nature of our cost space meant we were able to maintain strong margins as we balance beta-driven revenue effects with expense management. In combination, this resulted in cash flow generation of $1.7 billion year-to-date and allowed us to return a large amount of cash to shareholders. Larry is going to be talking a lot more about the environment, the flows we're seeing across our business and what we believe it means for our clients and for BlackRock. But first, I'm just going to focus on the results themselves.
As I said, it's a good story. And these, for me, key takeaway is that our performance in the face of really tough global headwinds illustrates the strength of BlackRock's business model: our diversified global platform, our broad mix of product and client capability. Now I'm going to be referring to the slides in the earnings supplement. You can find those on the website. And as I go through results, I'll be discussing primarily as adjusted results.
We're going to start us out on Slide 1. You can see on Slide 1, on the right-hand side, our operating results of $849 million. These were up 15% year-over-year, and that's driven both by revenue growth and margin improvement. Third quarter EPS, which you can see on the right-hand side, came in at $2.83.
Moving on to, again, the strong margin story, which you can see on Slide 2, our operating margin came in at 41 -- 40.1% in the quarter. That showed improvement of over 1.5 points compared to the third quarter 2010. More importantly, as margin can vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter, our year-to-date margin of 39.6% also showed improvement compared to full-year 2010. And in the face of the lower revenue environment, our comped revenue ratio was 34.2%, which is exactly consistent with the first and second quarters and is really well within the long-term range we've been running of about 35%. We believe this highlights our financial discipline and the variable nature of our expense base.
Just pausing for a second on the environment and looking at Slide 3, you can see that S&P declined, everyone knows there's 14% in the third quarter. But when you take a look at average markets compared to average markets in the second quarter, the decline was 7%. World markets fared even worse, driven by the European uncertainties. While recent volatility on market declines are affecting AUM investor sentiment, average markets in the third quarter were still 12% better than a year ago. 
And then we'll walk through a comparison of the results of this year compared to last year, and then I'll move on to sequential results. So I'm going to move ahead to Slide 5. And on Slide 5, you can see that operating EPS was up $0.51 year-over-year, and that's the green bar on the page. The growth in operating EPS reflected the 15% or $112 million growth in operating income that I mentioned earlier. The EPS in the quarter also benefited $0.16 from our June share repurchase. Earnings per share, which you can see on the right-hand side of $2.83, included 3/12 of operating earnings in the dark blue, offset by $0.29 of non-operating expense. 
Our third quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32.3%. The GAAP tax rate was 13.7%. The GAAP tax rate reflected changes in the value of our deferred tax liability, and those changes resulted from both U.K. tax legislative change and a U.S. state tax selection. These benefits, totaling $129 million, were noncash. We excluded them from as adjusted results.
I'm going to move ahead to revenues, which you can see on Slide 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion. That's up 6% from 2010, primarily driven by a 9% growth in base fees, which is the large green bar on the slide, and helped by a 16% growth in BRS revenue. But before I get into base fees, it's really worth noting the benefits for our business model of our diverse revenue sources. 
This quarter, we generated $276 million of revenue or 12% of our total revenues from sources other than base fees. And sources other than base fees are also contributing meaningfully to our improvements in revenue. So if you take a look at year-to-date revenue increases compared to 2010, we've improved $33 million in BRS, $47 million in SEC lending, which is a part of base fees, and $10 million in performance fees. And while I just mentioned that year-to-date were up in performance fees, during the third quarter, performance fees came in $91 million, which were actually down $23 million compared to a year ago. 
Our performance fees in the quarter included $51 million of fees related to alternative products and $40 million on long-dated products, primarily based on relative performance. A majority of our performance fee eligible active equity products generated healthy performance over the measurement period. So as a result of that, performance fees generated based on relative performance were actually better than a year ago. At the same time, recent market turmoil negatively affected the level of fees generated on our absolute return product, with several of our large hedge funds now below high water marks. We do expect this to affect negatively the level of fourth quarter performance fees compared to a year ago.
And then just BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues came in at the quarter at $117 million. That included continued growth in our core Latin [ph] business, as clients are seeking tools to manage risks in the face of this crazy, uncertain environment. The growth in BRS revenues this year has come almost exclusively from ongoing core assignments, which will continue to benefit the revenue base in 2012 and beyond.
So now moving on to base fees, which came in at $1.9 billion and with a key driver to revenue increases, up 9% from 2010 and laid out for you on Slide 8. We had revenue growth in all long-dated asset classes. This was offset partially by the revenue effect of the exodus from low-yielding cash products over the past year. The diversity of long-dated offerings across active and passive products, serving multiple client types, is one of our core strengths that has been key to the revenue growth. And you can really see that across all the green bars on the bottom left of Page 8.
Moving on to expenses on Slide 9, third quarter as adjusted expenses were $1.4 billion, up only 2% from 2010. And remember, to put that back into perspective of the 9% growth in base fees we just talked about. And so that disproportionate level of increases what's really contributing to the margin expansion.
As I mentioned in the last call, BlackRock entered into a lease to bring new office space in the City of London. Last week, Larry was in the London office, commemorating the opening. The office brings into a single location all of our London employees and really enhances our ability to work together and serve our clients. We're already seeing the benefits of being in a single space. As a result of the move to this new office, we reported a $63 million onetime charge related to the acceleration of the remaining lease obligations on our prior London spaces. We have excluded this charge from as adjusted results. The charge was below the range I had mentioned on the last call of $75 million to $100 million, and that was primarily due to the opportunity to sublease a portion of this space.
Now I'm going to move on to sequential results, and there's 3 primary factors I'd like to focus on as we get into sequential: market effects on base fees, lower expenses and the market effects on our co-investment. 
So within your slides, I'm going to move ahead to Slide 11. Our operating EPS this quarter improved $0.03 from the second quarter. Non-operating expense increased $0.20. Increase in non-operating expense reflected market-driven, noncash marks of our co-investment. I'll discuss that more in a minute. I'll also point out that our share repurchase in June resulted in $0.10 incremental benefit to EPS compared to the second quarter. 
On Slide 12, you can see that in the face of revenue decreases of $122 million, we reduced expenses by $88 million.
And looking at Slide 13, you can see that base fees decreased compared to the prior quarter by about $150 million, where the key driver to the revenue decreased. About 1/3 of that decrease in base fees is related to SEC lending, which is seasonally strong in the second quarter, and the remaining related primarily to the effect of unfavorable markets on equity AUM, which you can see on Slide 14, the bigger red bars are all about the markets effects on equity. 
So moving ahead to Slide 15, and at the same time, expenses decreased $88 million. And that's related primarily to the effects of lower AUM and revenue on compensation, on distribution and servicing and on direct fund expense. Management action led to lower G&A expense, and that primarily was lower marketing in a sense.
So moving ahead now to Slide 17. Non-operating expense for the quarter came in $79 million. That included $42 million of negative marks. Those were primarily on our co-investments in distressed credit. Spreads on those products whined[ph] significantly during the quarter. It's worth noting that despite recent market declines, year-to-date market marks on the investment portfolio are still positive $11 million. Net interest expense in the quarter was $37 million. The value of our investment portfolio was stable at about $1 billion or $930 million when you exclude hedges or items which are hedged. 
We see the 2 new retail products this quarter, which offset the effect of lower markets on the value of the portfolio. Those 2 new products are for retail investors, one is hedge fund of fund in the U.S. and the other is a European absolute bond return fund in Europe. We believe these are both great opportunities that are strategically important for our retail clients. And I always like to remind everyone that we do not have any proprietary investments. Our business model is to act as fiduciaries and to manage assets on behalf of our clients. We're not in business to make money from our balance sheet, and our investments on the balance sheet are extremely small. The relative amount of investments we have are just alongside clients who are seeding new products. But when we think of the size of what we do for our clients of over $3 trillion, again, there's less than $1 billion sitting there that we are invested in.
Moving on to Slide 18, I'd like to end by discussing our free cash flow. I started out mentioning that in the beginning, we continue to generate substantial cash flow, about $1 billion this quarter. You can see on the slide, $1.7 billion year-to-date. That's up about $300 million from what we have produced year-to-date last year. And including on the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that including our recent repurchase of Bank of America's remaining stake, our payout is 150%, including a 43% dividend payout. 
So, really, despite declining and volatile markets, we delivered a healthy margin, we generated substantial cash flow and we've returned a large amount of cash to shareholders. Overtime, our intention is to continue to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders, while also reinvesting for future growth. We are more confident than ever in our business model and our growth opportunities. Our broad-based, diversified platform allows us to respond to client needs, especially in this uncertain, challenging environment. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Larry, who's going to discuss the market environment and what we're seeing with our clients."

I'm sitting here at The Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are, at this time, having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of questions right now",4408,"Thanks, Ann Marie. Welcome, everybody. I'm sitting here at The Plaza Hotel in New York City. We are, at this time, having a conference with over 250 of our clients. Our clients are confused. Our clients are really asking quite a bit of questions right now. This is a 2-day affair, and it's going quite well. But it's obviously very clear to all of us that the global markets have been very challenging, and it's producing some real stress with many of our clients. 
You're witnessing a record low yield, which changes the value of their liabilities. We are seeing declining equity markets and their gap between their assets and liability. In some cases, may be irretrievable, they may not be able to ever achieve their objectives. 
In most cases, I think that investors will do that, and they'll find ways to make it. But they're looking for solutions. It's going to be solutions that are heavily based on advice by BlackRock, and I do believe we are probably the best positioned to provide that advice because we are agnostic-related to our clients if they are looking for passive strategies, alongside alpha strategies, global strategies, domestic strategies with an overlay of risk management. There's no firm in the world that could provide that, and the information content that we're able to provide because of our footprint has been very helpful to our clients.
So as we reflect on the third quarter, as we help our clients digest all this, the third quarter was obviously very challenging. It's exasperated by governmental policies worldwide, not just here in the United States. Politics and government are playing a major role in market performance and market volatility. Long-term investing have become more difficult as a result of this. 
When government focus on short-termism, when government focuses on blogs, when government is not focusing on how to best prepare an economy over a long cycle, it becomes really difficult for investors to focus on long-term investing, too. And this is one of the greatest issues that we are trying to confront with our clients. How do you manage these short-term issues, the extreme volatility, this enormous uncertainty but focus on long-term investing? This is not an easy answer because some clients, who may have 10-, 15-, 20-year liabilities, they may be judged by their shareholders or by their Board or by their pension fund committee by quarterly results. They may be judged by annual VAR if you are an insurance company, and that's how your regulators look at you. 
And so there's an incredible mismatch, and it's at, in my mind, severe preportions right now how accounting is forcing unbelievable short-termism. So we have the problems of accounting and governmental policy that, in my mind, is causing this great disruption in our pension funds and great disruptions in our marketplace, as fewer and fewer people are able to cope with the long-termism.
So with governments not focusing on our long term and with governments, in many cases, just doing the wrong thing, we have many clients worldwide who are confused, frozen and looking for answers. But the markets are testing governments, and that we see that -- we saw that all throughout the third quarter, other [ph]  market has tested the European situation continually. It's the incrementalism of the Europeans that really have tested the market, and the markets have resoundingly been pretty negative with this incrementalism of trying to fix the problems in Europe. Hopefully, this weekend, we will see something more than short-termism, hopefully more than incrementalism but a grand solution. 
A good example of what I would call government's failure is the European stress test, where just 10 weeks ago, the governments indicated in their stress test results that a bank like Dexia, a client of BlackRock's, has capital of 10%. They're on capital at 10%, only to have that bank nationalized a few weeks ago. And it's that sort of information and problems is really unsettling to the marketplace. I don't need to tell you that, but to me, this is just a glaring example of how government has really unsettled the marketplace. We just can't understand how they could have an institution that's cited in the top 10 most capitalized banks in Europe, then weeks later, nationalize it. It just doesn't feel right, and as a result, people are de-risking. And if you look at our flows, the most amount of de-risking and flows that we've seen in our high-fee business has been in our European mutual funds, which I'll talk about, where we saw the greatest amount of outflows because of fear in Europe, because of things like that have been the most severe.
So worldwide, clients are de-risking. But I need to remind clients and I need to tell everyone, this is not 2008 and 2009. This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis. There's trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in the sideline, as we know, that's why we have such low rates. And if we can have a sensible, longer-term view beyond the next blog, we can have a sensible long-term positioning in fixing these problems, these structural problems in Europe. And our budget deficit and growth issues and job issues of the United States, I do believe investors would rush right back into the marketplaces, and we would have a very strong markets, which would then, in my mind, would propel the economy to higher growth rates.
During the third quarter, we had substantial declines in the global equity markets, as Ann Marie discussed. S&P was down 14%. The European blue-chip index, the stocks was down 23%. The MSCI emerging market index was down 23%. The Hang Seng was down 21%. So if you think about that, investors who diversify their portfolio, thinking that was the right thing, it produced even worse returns, than those who stayed totally in the United States. 
As a result of market instability and this lack of confidence, clients worldwide have de-risked. They are delaying investment decisions, and that is what drove the negative flows across the industry and across the globe. Clients are now asking questions about how should they be reviewing their liabilities in light of these large declines, and we expect renewed activity very shortly. And -- but we're not going to have what I would call normalized flows until we have -- our clients have better understanding of their liabilities, and that will then determine how they then manage their assets and their duration. 
Let me talk about BlackRock. Ann Marie really did a great job in talking about our earnings and the texture of our earnings. As a report noted that we did have negative flows, much of it was related to -- totally unrelated to our merger. We don't have any merger-related outflows. One, in our pipeline, a significant change was related to a client who in-sourced $30-odd billion of index business, basically. And so -- but what I think the quarter really showed, and which really gave the leadership team of BlackRock great encouragement is our business model has proven to be an incredible differentiator. We have growth businesses that we have not seen in a long time. The diversity of our business model has really produced what I would call very good revenue flows and, importantly, a very good operating income ratios. 
So in these periods of uncertainty and volatility, we are really well-positioned today to serve our clients. And I think this is one of the great feelings we have yesterday and today with our clients here, and we're seeing that repeatedly worldwide, as we are working with more and more clients related to what we can bring to them. And we are seeing, as the information showed in our third quarter, we're seeing a huge increase in request for BlackRock Solutions products, as clients are trying to truly understand how to navigate their risk on a global basis. 
But what impressed me related to our quarter, and what we're really pleased with is that diversified business model. We had growth in BlackRock Solutions, a growth in SEC lending, in transition management, which is becoming a bigger business as clients are trying to reassert how they should position their portfolio. There's much more transitioning being done. And our BlackRock multi-asset class strategies, where clients are looking for much more comprehensive solution-based assignments. And so this is what's driving this 9% year-over-year increase in base fees.
Even with these really difficult market headwinds, we saw continued organic growth across global iShares. We saw actually growth at our U.S. retail channel. We had growth in our defined contribution channel and, as I said, in our multi-asset class offerings. In multi-class offerings, we had over $3 billion of inflows across almost every channel. We are expanding the product range now into our retail products, not just institutional products. And they came across in almost every category, from alternatives, equities, fixed income. And clients are increasingly looking for strategies that rely on indexing or ETF products, as bar belling and multi-asset class strategies are what clients are looking for. And as I said earlier, no firm has that product mix. No one has the research in terms of how we can best position our clients for these complex, multi-asset class strategies.
So the other thing about the third quarter, we needed to make sure -- we needed to find ways of continuing the growth, as we see some great growth opportunities. But we needed to make sure that we are pretty disciplined. As we did in terms of the market setbacks of '08 and '09, we were very disciplined and ahead of the curve in terms of what we had to do. We remain to be very vigilant in terms of making sure where we spend our money, we spent it well. The areas that we continue to invest, even with our margins above 40%, we were investing in our retirement solutions, we invested more in alternatives, we invested more in ETFs and currently [ph] , we have been able to invest in some very high-caliber professionals, who will help fuel our future growth. A good example is Mark McCombe, who is the new Head of Asia PAC, who will be joining us at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Another great example of our investing to making it our better platform, as Ann Marie discussed, our opening of our London new office. Since our merger, we were operating in 2 different offices, and we did move people around. But it was certainly not the best of circumstances to really grow one BlackRock. Everybody is in one common building today in London, and now our London office happens to be our largest city location in the world, bigger than our corporate headquarters in New York. And so things like this are, obviously, a cost, but we expect these costs will really generate more continuity, hopefully better performance as our portfolio managers are all together, but importantly, a better dialogue amongst our teams, which will produce better dialogues with our clients, that which would produce more opportunities for our business. 
As Ann Marie suggested, we continue to generate a lot of cash flow, $1.8 billion year-to-date. We have a long history of returning capital to our shareholders, and this year, we already increased our dividends. I need to remind everybody at 37.5%, we've repurchased $2.5 billion of shares as recently as June. And I could tell everyone today, we will continue to take appropriate steps to be well-positioned to capture opportunities. I am here to tell you, I don't know many opportunities at this moment, so I'm not here to suggest and I'm not trying to forewarn that I know of anything going on. But we will be well-positioned if there are opportunities to do things and, obviously, when it is not until the first quarter of the new year where the Board of Directors would look at our dividend policy. 
So let me go over some of the businesses in the texture of the industry and in BlackRock. Let me start off with retail. Our U.S. retail business had positive flows, which was unusual in our business. And while Europe and Asia saw de-risking, for a reference point, U.S. mutual funds, x ETS had $48 billion as an industry in outflows in the third quarter. BlackRock had $1.8 billion of inflows globally, but we had long-term flows of $3.5 billion. Our U.S. retail saw positive long-term flows in the third quarter of about $2.6 billion, really concentrating at some of our unique products: Global Allocation, our equity dividend, our high-yield funds. And this is where we actually believe more and more growth will go. 
We're seeing more and more people questioning core fixed income, where fixed income is only producing 2-ish-plus percent returns, and what is the future of rates going forward. So clients are asking for solutions, whether that might be in more high-yield solutions. There could be in other types of credit solutions, dividends as a solution preferreds, and these are some of the things that we're trying to really position BlackRock to handle our clients' needs.
Cross-border or the European flows as an industry had $28 billion of outflows, and we had, as a firm, about $6 billion of outflows. And as I said, that's where the great de-risking was worldwide and especially in the mutual funds arena. Despite the $6 billion of outflows, we actually picked up market share, though. So we lost less than the industry as a whole.
So the third quarter, despite all this noise, has told me we are picking up market share. We continue to position ourselves, and we're continuing to be innovative in terms of creating products that our clients need in this new paradigm. Let me talk about global iShares.
We had, in the quarter, $10.8 billion of net new business. We had really positive flows in Europe, end flows in the U.S. As an industry, we saw about $28 billion of flows as an industry. But I should give a little more texture. Flows are significantly in July, and the industry did see significant slowdown in flows in August and September, as you're seeing that capitulation and that uncertainty even in the iShares product.
In EMEA, we had $10.8 billion of global flows -- I'm sorry, in total. But EMEA was $6.5 billion of flows. Investors are looking for safety in the region, particularly in Germany. And importantly, we are as well-positioned in Europe as we ever have been in our ETF space. There is great amount of consternation and confusion in Europe related to ETNs or exchange traded notes, which are derivative-based products. There are some regulatory review of these types of products. There are many platforms, distribution platforms, that are now forbidding these sales of ETNs. And as the largest provider of ETFs in Europe, we have been a huge beneficiary. I don't expect these market shares to persist, but in the third quarter, we picked up 80% of the net new business in Europe in the third quarter. 
We do believe, though, in the United States, in Europe, we are going to see substantial regulatory review of these products. We have been very assertive in our statements that clients need to understand what they're buying. There needs to be greater transparency. There's a big difference between a physical ETF and a derivative-based ETN. And derivative-based ETN, you have credit exposure with that issuer. Some of these issues may be very fine credits, but the disclosure of what you're buying, what is the underlying product, is pretty opaque. And we are suggesting to the SEC and to other regulators, as they think about ETFs in the future, that we have much greater transparency, much greater clarity in terms of the product. 
We have always been pretty rigorous in terms of making sure that clients understand that ETFs should be physically-based. Obviously, in some cases, they're going to have some hedges or some derivative based around it, but we need to have -- even some of our products that we already have, 80% physical and some derivative base that we need to have much more clarity.
So there's no -- as ETFs have grown, no different than we saw in the mortgage market in the '80s and then in the '90s and then in this decade, a simple product morphed into something that was very complex, and risks were contained in these products that maybe investors did not know. That was the failure of the mortgage market. As one of the founders of the mortgage market in the '70s, '80s and watching the failure of disclosure in that market occur, we need to be very assertive as a firm and outspoken that we will not allow at BlackRock the lack of disclosure on these products. We believe these products can have a huge future, and we need to be a lot more assertive in making sure that risk and complexity is understood by all investors. 
So we are trying to bring down the risk of ETFs. There is great amount of noise about it. There's a hearing today in Washington about ETFs, and we are trying to take a very large position in terms of making sure these products grow, this industry grows, and I would love for some of my peers to be as assertive as BlackRock in making sure we have a great industry and a great product going forward.
In the Americas, we had $4.6 billion of inflows. We saw investors shift to fixed income in the U.S., offset by some outflows and equity ETFs. We're not happy with our U.S. results, and we are addressing it. We put in place a new global leadership team under Mark Wiedman, stepping up as the Global Head of iShares in September, and this is consistent with the steps we took to address the performance problems we had in SAE or scientific active equity, which is now paying off, which is actually one of our highest performing products this year as we reinvested in that product because we believed in it. Obviously, we are building a bigger, finer, great team. We're adding more teams to our ETF platform, and we believe with Mark's and all our great leaders of our ETF platform, we will once again reassert our market share in the United States.
We continue to innovate in the ETF platform. We launched a few commodity and fixed income products in Europe. A tactical allocation ETF product is garnering a lot of attention. We believe more and more tactical allocation products are going to become larger and larger, as we witnessed from our Global Allocation mutual fund as one of the fastest-growing mutual funds.
Institutional, the picture is mixed. We saw clients de-risking, while others took advantage of the steep market declines, and we're forced to rebalance. It really depends on some of our clients' needs. If a client did an LDI in 2003, and they're sitting with 6% long-dated bonds, they were less stressed than those companies that were under invested in fixed income in terms of having their core interest rate that they are looking for. And now, with the reduction in interest rates, they're sitting with some big gaps in terms of their income needs. 
Total long-dated outflows for BlackRock was $17 billion, driven by a single outflow in a passive fixed income strategy for a particularly planned liquidity needs. It had a de minimis revenue impact for us. And we continue to see modest outflows in our SAE, but we are -- we have enormous amount of dialogue now. And we believe, because of the performance over the last year and our investment in our SAE teams, we're going to start seeing new inflows. Quite frankly, many of our peers got out of this business, and we're one of the few organizations that have stayed into it, reinvested in it. And as I said, we stabilized it, we are seeing still some modest outflows. But the conversations we're having now with clients gives me a good feeling about the future in terms of the inflows there.
As I said earlier, our institutional clients are really struggling with the low interest rate environment and the declines in the equity markets. So we are seeing very unusual behavior by our clients. Clients are looking for help, and that's what we're trying to do. 
Our performance, as I said earlier, in quant and multi-asset products was strong, and I'm very encouraged by our equity performance in its' positions well for the future. As I said earlier, low interest rates is going to have, most probably, some structural changes in fixed income in the next few years as an industry. It's very hard to see how interest rates going to continue to go lower to produce more than the 2.5% returns that we see -- as we see in the market today. And so what we expect clients to start relooking at within fixed income, this is a lot of trim business because they're going to go moving from maybe core types of fixed income strategies to credit strategies, they're going to go into a go-anywhere strategy in fixed income. Some of them may go into preferreds and other type securities. We expect out of the European situation, we hope to see a large amount of preferreds being issued by banks as a means to recapitalize, and although at this moment preferred to not consider Tier 1 capital in Europe. Hopefully, that will change as banks are trying to lobby their regulators as they are going through their stress tests again, as they're trying to achieve a 9% Tier 1 capital charge. At these low equity rates, it would be very powerful if the regulators would allow preferreds to be Tier 1, perpetual preferreds, I must say, not perpetual preferreds to be Tier 1. I believe there will be billions and billions and billions of dollars of interest in the world for that as bond investors need coupon or, in this case, dividends. 
The pipeline was confusing. We had this big outflow that Ann Marie talked about. I mentioned it earlier, where a client -- a very large client of ours is internalizing a $30-plus billion mandate. They're doing it for cost containment, and so this is something that will probably happen mid next year. But we are giving you an advanced word. So this is not going to happen any -- in this quarter, may not even happen in the first quarter, but we've been told this will happen sometime mid next year. But despite that, we've seen some very good flows, and what I'm also personally excited about, that we are seeing good flows in what I would call long-dated products, higher fee-paying products. We are continuing to see some real opportunities in our alternative space. We did have outflows in our currency type of products, and that's related to the big swings in dollar or in euro. But we did have to offset that. $1 billion inflows of our commodity products would totally offset these currency types of outflows that we saw in the third quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions. I just can't say enough of how this is helping us in the positioning in the new paradigm. During the quarter, we were hired by the National Bank of Greece, so we're inside working with the regulators of Europe and Greece to try to help them understand and ascertain the situation there. This is a similar assignment that we won in Ireland earlier in the year. We are working with more European banks than we've ever done in our platform. We have more opportunities in the Middle East, more opportunities in Asia than we've ever had before. 
In the quarter, as we noted, we have 13 new assignments. These are offsetting a lot of the 1 type of assignments that we had. This is totally offsetting the consistent reduction in our outstanding of advisory business as some of our clients are bringing down some of their troubled assets. And so this has been an extraordinary year so far for us. And more importantly, we are starting to see much more stickier revenues in our solution business, as we are winning more and more Aladdin-like assignments. We continue to have dialogue with a few substantial Aladdin assignments. And the last thing I would say about Aladdin, we did -- we are implementing our first Aladdin assignment that is not just fixed income, but it is now equity and fixed income. This what we believe will become a cornerstone of our growth as our equity modules are as industry first-class as our fixed income modules in our risk management. 
And lastly, as I said earlier, we continue to invest in our platform. I mentioned hiring Mark McCombes in Asia, but we hired Mark Taborsky in our BlackRock multi-asset class strategy. And we are very excited about the individuals that we are seeing who are looking to join our firm. We have never enjoyed such a position in which we could hire industry leaders to help us build this platform. This is across region and across product.
So, in summary, I know I've been talking a long time, we are really uniquely positioned for this environment, I think better positioned than any organization that I know of in the industry. With the persistence of volatility in our marketplaces, with low interest rates, a low growth environment, all our investors are reevaluating their investment strategies and asset allocation decisions. We hope we're in that position to help our clients. That is our #1 job. Our job has to be an ally. We have to be there working alongside with our clients. We have a challenging world of demands, a better and a more robust range of solutions. We have higher demands that we provide value-added advice, better risk management tools. And so the demands on our time are growing. And that's why we have to continue to invest.  
So, in summary, we're pretty well-positioned here. I just -- I would like to thank all the employees for working with our clients, helping our clients and producing the results that we did in the third quarter. 
I'll open it up for questions."

The Basel III, as banks are going to be required to have much more capital, the utilization of their balance sheet is going to affect everybody. Bid-ask spreads are going to be widening because these institutions are going to need to make some form of profit for putting their balance sheet in front of you. This is one of the reasons why we have been very rigorous in spending a lot of money, building the trading platform, to cross trades for our clients. This is one of the actions that we are doing, and we continue to do that. And we're continuing to build it. And so what we are trying to use that scale of ours to differentiate us with our clients and hopefully to reduce that friction cost that we're going to see in the marketplace, and so this is something that we are quite sensitive on. In terms of our interaction with our regulators, well, we are actually having some very good dialogues with our regulators. We are trying to be above the line with them and really working with them in terms of trying to help them understand the difference between asset management and organizations that work on their own balance sheet. We are trying to make sure that in our conversations related to ETFs, they understand the difference between ETFs and ETNs. We have been very rigorous in terms of -- and an outlier in the industry in the money market fund industry suggesting that capital should be put in place to offer NAV declines. And we do believe regulators are going to begin to focus on the money market fund industry, because I do believe from every regulator I speak to, they believe money market funds do present risk in the system. And there's going to have to be some ways of protecting the system. And so we are trying to work with regulators in terms of understanding the type of risk that's presented and how best to effectuate and minimize that risk. In terms of everyday business, until we really get more dialogue and in terms of -- and more certainty of how they're going to implement some of these strategies, it's hard for us to say how that will further impact BlackRock or how we work with our clients. But it's a moving dialogue, and I could promise you, we are involved in the dialogues with the regulators. When they want to hear our opinions, we are offering them as loud as possible. We have -- I think as you know, we do have an office now in Washington, working alongside with our regulators. It happens to be one of our biggest businesses now working in Washington. It's a core competency that we have to work with our regulators and working with our politicians to help our investors. So one thing I said to our investors at our conference, we are one of the lone sheep working with Washington in trying to protect investors' interests and investor rights."

And so we're going to start seeing other -- we're going to see clients looking to use beta as a bigger flow. You saw that in the ETF flows over the last quarter. So we continue to expect that to continue. We are seeing more and more inquiry in high yield and more and more inquiries in the higher-yielding fixed income products, whether it's in Europe or the U.S. So, once again, it's more bar belling. So indexing, obviously, is a lower fee, higher margin result, and the credit and the other types of products are going to be higher fees, in many cases, lower margin business. So I think we're going to be probably be as best positioned to handle that and take that in. I should remind everybody, indexation, even institutional indexation of fixed income, is not like indexation of the S&P. There are thousands of bonds in the Barclays index or other fixed income type of indexes. You have to have a lot more technology to replicate the movements of fixed income to get close to an index. So it's much harder for institutions to internalize fixed income indexing. So we look at that as -- even if institutions went that way, we would expect to be a huge beneficiary of that. The second thing, in terms of equities, we're going to continue to see more bar belling. As you saw the flows, people were de-risking in core type of products. They were going into more specialty type of products. They're going into more alternatives, and they are using as a baseline a foundation they're going into index. So it really depends on each client's issues, where they are with their liability, whether they are horizons and -- but I think it's very clear across the board, investors are looking for some form of advice."
