If you let me just start up by saying we finished 2010 with a strong quarter. Earnings were almost $0.60, almost 3x what they were in the fourth quarter last year. It's really backed of solid volume and price plus",804,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. If you let me just start up by saying we finished 2010 with a strong quarter. Earnings were almost $0.60, almost 3x what they were in the fourth quarter last year. It's really backed of solid volume and price plus performance. Margins is important, it expand 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and we had very strong earnings in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Moving to the next slide and put this in context. The fourth quarter for International Paper was the strongest fourth quarter that we had in over 10 years. I don't say that to suggest that we're anywhere near our peak, we think we've got quite a bit of run rate ahead of us as we go to 2011, which we'll talk about in the call.
So turning to full year results for a minute, the strong fourth quarter rapped up a very good 2010. We really had International Paper a V-shaped recovery while the economy in the U.S. at least was recovering in more of a U-shaped. Our low tide mark was the first quarter where we earned $0.05, and we came out of the year with a lot of momentum with third quarter and fourth quarter performance. 
Earnings for the year were more than twice than they were last year, just over $2 compared to $0.88. Free cash flow of $1.7 billion, margin expansion of 110 basis points. So we kind of ended the year with more margin expansion than we have for the full year, which is a good jumping off point for 2011.
And significant return on investment improvement, which we'll talk about. More debt reduction and pension funding and two increases in the dividend of one earlier in the year and one late in the year now restored the dividend back to $0.75 from the $0.10 it was coming into the year. 
2010 headlines. Sales up 8%, again both volume and price, strong free cash flow even with higher levels of capital spending in 2010 compared to 2009. And sales growth was also took -- that capital took about $800 million of cash. And we still had a strong free cash flow. Less than $9 billion in debt, $4 billion reduction in debt over the last several years as we completed the warehouse acquisition, that's close to over 40% reduction in our debt and a healthy cash balance of just over $2 billion. And I think this all demonstrates that International Paper can generate very healthy cash flow and still what I would characterize as a recovering, not yet fully recovered economy.
Just the next slide shows you where the revenue growth is coming from. I think it's important because it underscores the global balance is becoming more and more part of International Paper. In our North American business has performed well and sales growth was up 6%. Outside North America, sales growth was doubled what it was during North America, 13% and in our Ilim joint venture, our revenue growth and volume the price of 33%. So we included Ilim in the whole package of it, our revenue growth outside North America was 3x what it was inside North America.
And again that's both volume and price. And turning to the waterfall chart that shows you the EPS comparison of 2009 and 2010. The big lever that stand out here price, volume, cost and Ilim. And the one negative and it was a substantial negative, but we're able to overcome it during the year and still expand our markets we had input cost pressure, primarily Wood and OCC of over $1 a share. 
So International Paper is a cash flow story and continues to be a cash flow story. Post-transformation plan in International Paper, and build a step change capability in our free cash flow and this slide here shows that. We've more than doubled our free cash flow, pre-transformation from an average of about $900 million a year to $1.9 billion, if you look at the last three years. And this has obviously flow-through through our ability to improve our return on investment, which is a key metric for International Paper. We come out of 2010 going into 2011 with our returns as we see in the cost of capital zone. Our run rate, ROI, third and fourth quarter was about 8%, that's twice its low point of 4% in the middle of the recession in 2009. 
And from a macro perspective, I think I would characterize 2010 as a transition year, not nearly a mid-recycle year because when we look at our Industrial Packaging business, our Container Board business, xpedx are three big businesses in North America. We don't see demand yet back to pre-recession levels, eventually they will get there.
So Tim, I'll turn over to you."
61036,117811230,98623,"International Paper Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 12. So I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and go through a few more of the details. And you can see on this slide sales growth year-over-year of 9%. Also look at the EBITDA, we had in the t",2240,"Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 12. So I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and go through a few more of the details. And you can see on this slide sales growth year-over-year of 9%. Also look at the EBITDA, we had in the third quarter over $1 billion of EBITDA, but we also had the land sell and it was a fairly light outage quarter. So what I feel really good about looking at third quarter to fourth quarter, if you adjust for the land sale and you adjust for outages, we would have been about $960 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and a very solid $870 million in the fourth quarter. Another good quarter of cash flow, as John mentioned and in that cash flow number of $600 million, there's $130 million of incremental CapEx spending in the quarter. So a really strong way to finish the year.
If you look at the next slide, just going from third quarter to fourth quarter, I think you look at and say the momentum continues. We had more outages in the quarter. It seasonally slower volume quarter, and we did have a few operational issues late in the quarter while we ran very well in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, as the season changed and cold weather has some impact, we had a few one-off items in some of the mills, which we've now recovered from. But we'll probably last around $50 million on the table from the items that we had. 
Price was another good story. In a lot of the businesses, Box was up, export pricing was up. Consumer Packaging business at price increase through the fourth quarter, as well as our European Paper business. And if you look at volume year-on-year, we were up in our Packaging businesses, PNC was down, which we would have expect in North America and Brazil continues to perform very strong. 
The one item on tax that I do want to call out, our tax rate in the fourth quarter dropped to 28%. And I think the way to think about that is there was legislation in the fourth quarter in the Extenders Bill that we could not book as we would have normally booked throughout the course of the year and so it was a catch-up in the fourth quarter, and that's basically for the R&D tax credit that we received as well as how some of the offshore interviews are treated from U.S. tax perspective. 
So in summary, it's a good quarter, volume was where we expected it to be. Prices were up. Operations were good. But could have been better and inputs were trending slightly higher. So if you go to the next page, I've got a breakout on input cost. And the thing that I take away from this is good performance with inputs going out, more than half of inputs were in our North American business and more than half of the input increases were in Industrial Packaging. So OCC, up $17 million quarter-on-quarter. We did see wood fiber continue to improve and really for the first time, we saw chemical start to jump up as well. 
So that, let me turn to the businesses and I'll start with Industrial Packaging. Solid quarter, we had much higher maintenance outages in the quarter and some of the operational issues that I've mentioned earlier showed up in IPG. And as I said, it's now been resolved. Volume was down seasonally, but up 2.8% year-over-year and box prices moved up $4 and we continue to see export pricing increasing. So when you turn to the next slide. We've shown you this slide before on margins. We saw our fourth quarter margins in line with the highest margins in the industry. And I think a really important point, as we exit 2010 fourth quarter, EBITDA margins that are 240 basis points, better than the full year average for 2010.
We also saw earnings improved not only in North America but in our European business, our two largest Industrial Packaging businesses that had improved performance since 2010. Specifically in North America, we had to work through a pretty significant input cost increase. The bulk of that being OCC. But with close to $400 million of increase inputs, we still improve the business by $100 million. And we ran in the second half of the year at an average margin of 19.5% versus the 12% in the first half as we were dealing with the input cost. 
International container had a great year. In Europe, volume was better by $20 million and our cost was better, largely due to the Etienne mill shutdown, but good performance across all of the business units there. If you turn to printing papers. I thought printing papers had a very good quarter. Operationally, we ran, well in North America we had a couple of issues outside North America, but the step down in performance on us was right in line with our expectations around moving from a warmer season to a colder season.
As I mentioned, price in Europe was up. We were stable in the U.S. We did have about $11 million of green energy credits that did not come through. This is in our Poland mill and it's just the timing issues, so we should pick those up in the first quarter. So overall, our printing papers had a solid quarter and a really good year. If you look at Slide 19, you can see the margin improvement across all of the businesses starting with North America, very stable performance moving from 19% EBITDA margins to 20%. Just a huge amount of improvement in Europe. And it came from demand recovering in a strong way and prices moving up throughout the year and also good operations throughout the year.
And Brazil did a very good job managing its export price. On average, prices through the year were up about $150 a ton. If I turn to the Consumer Packaging business, it ran very well in the quarter also. And if you adjust for the outages basically had a similar level of earnings in the fourth quarter than it had in the third quarter. Backlogs continued to be strong in our food and paper business. We continue to have backlogs that go out about four weeks. That's about a week better than what we have last year and our year-over-year volume in the fourth quarter was up 9% versus 2009. We also as I mentioned earlier, got about $15 a ton more in price than the third quarter. So all in all, a really solid quarter for the Consumer Packaging business.
If you look at the next slide, I'm showing you what happened through the course of the year. And the low margin level in the first half was really a result of what happened with the wood shortage and the fiber cost increases that happened at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010. But a great job recovering from that and also realizing the announced price increases throughout the year and improving us. We've had a couple of mills where we had operational issues for a number of years and second, third and fourth quarter just showed sequential improvements in mill operations for the business. So the business exits 2010 in the fourth quarter 230 basis points better than the full year average.
By turning to xpedx, a lower number than expectations but for a couple of reasons and I'll go through those. The good news is the business is continuing to recover. And in the fourth quarter, we had our strongest revenue quarter. If you look at average daily sales for the whole year. So first half of the year was 10% lower than how we ended up in the second half of the year on revenue. And total year EBIT move from $55 million in 2009 up to $78 million in 2010. Part of the reason for the lower earnings number in the fourth quarter is that the business has been undergoing a strategic review of business improvement opportunities. And after having completed most of the work, decided to take some charges for business segments that will be exiting in the retail and printing equipment segments specifically. And we're completing the work this quarter. So we'll have a lot more to talk to you about the earnings improvement run rate when we release first quarter earnings.
If I turn to the Ilim joint venture, another good quarter building on the third quarter's results. And if you remember, we report Ilim on a one quarter lag. So what you're seeing is our fourth quarter number for Ilim's third quarter. And we have to go back and think about what was happening with pulp prices in the second quarter of this year. We did see a step down in pulp price from the second quarter to the third quarter and then it began recovering during the third quarter but did not fully make up the decline for the quarter. That continues into the fourth quarter. And so we expect Ilim's performance to continue moving up. They had good operations and also the $31 million results that we booked as equity earnings included a $12 million charge for an asset write-off related to a vacant office building that they're no longer using. So that was a one-time item that impacted their third quarter, our fourth quarter. 
When you look at the three-year history of the Ilim joint venture, we finished 2010 EPS accretive than we have record earnings for 2010. And over the three-year period, after having a good year, the first year of the joint venture and then being hurt by the economic crisis in the second bounce back and we're now at earnings levels that are above the pre-crisis level. We've also, since the time of investment received $152 million in cash dividend and the projects, the strategic investment projects are currently underway and on track.
Before I shift from the businesses to other corporate items, let me just touch on Europe for a moment. Europe, as we exited the year for the company, we were approaching cost to capital, Europe was at cost in capital all year long. And had a really strong performance across all of the businesses. Our Russian Paper business, Western European Paper businesses and our Container business, which is in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And ended the year with an ROI of 16%, basically on good demand recovery, good operations and really good price momentum.
So with that, I'll switch to debt. And on Slide 26, you can see where we were at the end of 2008 with $12 billion of balance sheet debt and a $3 billion pension gap. And you see the waterfall to our results at the end of 2010 with $8.7 billion of balance sheet debt and $1.5 billion pension gap. That pension gap is made up of about $1.1 billion gap in our qualified plan and a $400 million gap in the non-qualified plan. So when we look at this, we say, hey, we've made a lot of progress on debt reduction, but we're just getting to the threshold of the targets that we had set for ourselves.
On a capital spending front, we're estimating that in 2011 we will spent somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on capital. That's after averaging $650 million on capital for the 2009-2010 period. And it's going to really come from the results of higher maintenance and higher regulatory. You can see that on the chart, which is primarily related to the boiler mac requirements. But we're also increasing spending on cost reduction projects and strategic projects. The cost reduction projects, where we're going to spend about $200 million more incrementally than we did in 2010 are primarily around consumption reduction projects and lowering our cost base. The strategic and the biggest one is really the Sun joint venture, our coated board machine that we announced last year, which there'll be a fair amount of spending on that this year.
So with that, we're higher in this year the average that we set over the cycle, but we're still right in line with the billion-dollar target of spending on average across the cycle. And we're still committed to that target. So let me end up on Slide 28. And I think this is a good example of what we mean by cost reduction capital. If you look at our energy efficiency progress since 2000, we've reduced our dependence on fossil fuels purchased energy by 45%. Currently, we spend $1 million-plus on purchased energy a year and the capital projects that we have pursued over the past decade are not very large project. In fact, if you look at the 10-year period, we've completed close to 1,000 project over 10 years. So they tend to be smaller, smaller dollars, quicker to implement and quicker payback. The one area of opportunity that we think we still have in our legacy mills, we have more opportunity to reduce consumption of purchased energy. But we have a bigger opportunity of the warehouse our mills, where we just started implementing some of these projects. So with that, I'll wrap it up and turn it back over to John."

I think the slide here and I'm looking at Slide 29 says it all. It was a good end to 2010. Again, I think we had a V-shaped recovery in our earnings performance and cash flow performance and kind of a U-shaped economic environment certainly North America. 
If we turn to the first quarter outlook, I guess I'd say it's January. It's seasonally slow like it's always is in January from a demand standpoint. You think the first quarter kind of looks like the fourth quarter. On all fronts, things are more or less stable with the exception of fiber and energy, where we see some increase in cost, and we do see some improvement in the Ilim joint venture because we're in that one quarter lag. But by and large, kind of a stable and seasonally slow economic environment is in the first quarter. No surprises there.
The 2011 outlook, I think is quite positive. It's for a full-year basis, we're quite positive, secret momentum. We think about 2011 as a breakout year. 2010 was a transition year coming out of the worst recession we've had in 70 years. In our view is strong earnings improvement. ROI improvement and cost of capital zone and strong free cash flow to go with it and global balance with all parts of the world contributing to International Paper. I think we'll stop right here, Tom, and take questions."

Although I would say that in January, our actual January volume on a year-over-year basis continues to trend up on the same pattern that we see. December date is out now and December was up 3.5%. So we would continue see modest year-over-year growth on U.S. packaging demand. Relative to export, export demand is still remains still solid. If you look at all economic indicators, there's global growth in all regions, and we continue to participate in that and that's a strategic segment for us. I think it has been publicly acknowledged there has been some downward pressure on expert pricing in the fourth quarter due to some seasonal supply that became available. But I can't speculate on future pricing. But my outlook for supply demand is that as the U.S. hits the seasonal strong second quarter, married up with strong maintenance outages, that the seasonal balance will get tighter. But overall, I think things are in very good balance with inventories, demand and pricing right now."

If you'll let me just start off by saying we finished 2010 with a strong quarter. Earnings were almost at $0.68, almost 3x what they were in the fourth quarter last year. It's really on the back of solid volume, o",813,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. If you'll let me just start off by saying we finished 2010 with a strong quarter. Earnings were almost at $0.68, almost 3x what they were in the fourth quarter last year. It's really on the back of solid volume, our price and cost performance. Margins, as it is important, expanded 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and we had very strong earnings in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Moving to the next slide, and put this in context. The fourth quarter for International Paper was the strongest fourth quarter that we've had in over 10 years. I don't say that to suggest that we're anywhere near our peak. We think we've got quite a bit of runway ahead of us as we go through 2011, which we'll talk about in the call.
So just turning to full year results for a minute. The strong fourth quarter wrapped up a very good 2010. We really had International Paper a V-shaped recovery while the economy in the U.S. at least was recovering in more of a U-shape. Our low tide mark was the first quarter where we earned $0.05, and we came out of the year with a lot of momentum, with third quarter and fourth quarter performance. 
Earnings for the year were more than twice than they were last year at just over $2 compared to $0.88, free cash flow of $1.7 billion, margin expansion of 110 basis points. So we kind of ended the year with more margin expansion than we have for the full year, which is a good jumping off point for 2011.
And significant return on investment improvement, which we'll talk about. More debt reduction and pension funding, and two increases in the dividend, one early in the year and one late in the year, now restored the dividend back to $0.75 from the $0.10 it was coming into the year. 
2010 headlines. Sales up 8%, again, both volume and price; strong free cash flow even with higher levels of capital spending in 2010 compared to 2009. And sales growth was also took -- that and capital took about $800 million of cash, and we still had strong free cash flow. Less than $9 billion of debt, a $4 billion reduction in debt over the last several years since we completed the warehouse acquisition, that's over -- close to a 40% reduction in our debt and a healthy cash balance of just over $2 billion. And I think this all demonstrates that International Paper can generate very healthy cash flow and still what is I would characterize recovering, not yet fully recovered economy.
Just the next slide shows you where the revenue growth is coming from. And I think it's important because it underscores the global balance is becoming more and more part of International Paper. Our North American business has performed well, and sales growth was up 6%. Outside North America, sales growth was double what it was in North America, 13%. And in our Ilim joint venture, our revenue growth, that's volume and prices, up 33%. So we include Ilim in the whole package for a minute, our revenue growth outside North America was 3x what it was inside North America. And again, that's both volume and price. 
Turning to the waterfall chart that shows you the EPS comparison of 2009 and 2010. The big lever standout here: Price, volume, cost and Ilim. And the one negative, and it was a substantial negative, but we were able to overcome it during the year and still expand our margins, we had input cost pressure, primarily wood and OCC of over $1 a share. 
So International Paper is a cash flow story and continues to be a cash flow story. Post-transformation plan in International Paper, we built a step change capability in our free cash flow, and this slide here shows that. We've more than doubled our free cash flow pre-transformation from an average of about $900 million a year to $1.9 billion, if you look at the last three years. And this has obviously flowed through to our ability to improve our return on investment, which is a key metric for International Paper. We come out of 2010 going into 2011 with our returns, as we say, in the cost of capital zone. Our run rate, ROI for third and fourth quarter was about 8%. That's twice its low point of 4% in the middle of the recession in 2009. 
And from a macro perspective, I think I would characterize 2010 as a transition year, not nearly a mid-recycle year, because when we look at our Industrial Packaging business, our Coated Board business and xpedx are three big businesses in North America. We don't see demand yet back to pre-recession levels. Eventually, they will get there.
So Tim, I'll turn over to you."
61036,117811230,98808,"International Paper Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 12. So I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and go through a few more of the details. And you can see on this slide, sales growth year-over-year of 9%. Also, look at the EBITDA, we had in the",2246,"Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 12. So I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and go through a few more of the details. And you can see on this slide, sales growth year-over-year of 9%. Also, look at the EBITDA, we had in the third quarter over $1 billion of EBITDA, but we also had the land sale, and it was a fairly light outage quarter. 
So what I feel really good about looking at third quarter to fourth quarter, if you adjust for the land sale and you adjust for outages, we would have been at about $960 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and a very solid $870 million in the fourth quarter. Another good quarter of cash flow, as John mentioned, and in that cash flow number of $600 million, there's $130 million of incremental CapEx spending in the quarter. So a really strong way to finish the year.
If you look at the next slide, just going from third quarter to fourth quarter, I think you'd look at and say the momentum continues. We had more outages in the quarter. It's seasonally a slower volume quarter, and we did have a few operational issues late in the quarter, while we ran very well in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, as the season changed and cold weather had some impact, and we had a few one-off items in some of the mills, which we've now recovered from, but we probably left around $15 million on the table from the items that we had. 
Price was another good story. In a lot of the businesses, box was up. Export pricing was up. Consumer Packaging business had a price increase through the quarter, as well as our European Paper business. And if you look at the volume year-on-year, we were up in our Packaging businesses. PNC was down, which we would have expect in North America, and Brazil continue to perform very strong. 
The one item on tax that I do want to call out, our tax rate in the fourth quarter dropped to 28%, and I think the way to think about that is there was legislation in the fourth quarter in the Extenders Bill that we could not book as we would have normally booked throughout the course of the year, and so it was a catch-up in the fourth quarter. And that's basically for the R&D tax credit that we received, as well as how some of the offshore entities are treated from U.S. tax perspective. 
So in summary, it's a good quarter. Volume was where we expected it to be. Prices were up. Operations were good, but could have been better, and inputs were trending slightly higher. So if you go to the next page, I've got a breakout on input cost. And the thing that I take away from this is good performance with inputs going out. More than half of inputs were in our North American business, and more than half of the input increases were in Industrial Packaging. So OCC, up $17 million quarter-on-quarter. We did see wood fiber continue to improve, and really for the first time, we saw chemical start to jump up as well. 
So with that, let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging. Solid quarter. We had much higher maintenance outages in the quarter, and some of the operational issues that I've mentioned earlier showed up in IPG. And as I said, it's now been resolved. Volume was down seasonally, but up 2.8% year-over-year, and box prices moved up $4, and we continue to see export pricing increasing. 
So when you turn to the next slide, we've shown you this slide before on margins. We saw fourth quarter margins in line with the highest margins in the industry. And I think a really important point, as we exit 2010 fourth quarter, EBITDA margins that are 240 basis points better than the full year average for 2010.
We also saw earnings improved, not only in North America, but in our European business. So our two largest Industrial Packaging businesses had improved performance in 2010. Specifically in North America, we had to work through a pretty significant input cost increase. The bulk of that being OCC, but with close to $400 million of increased inputs, we still improved the business by $100 million. And we ran in the second half of the year at an average margin of 19.5% versus the 12% in the first half as we were dealing with the input cost squeeze. 
International Container had a great year. In Europe, volume was better by $20 million, and our cost was better, largely due to the Etienne mill shutdown, but good performance across all of the business units there. If you turn to Printing Papers. I thought Printing Papers had a very good quarter. Operationally, we ran well in North America. We had a couple of issues outside North America, but the stepdown in performance on us was right in line with our expectations around moving from a warmer season to a colder season.
As I mentioned, price in Europe was up. We were stable in the U.S. We did have about $11 million of green energy credits that did not come through. This is in our Poland mill, and it's just a timing issues, so we should pick those up in the first quarter. So overall, Printing Papers had a solid quarter and a really good year. If you look at Slide 19, you can see the margin improvement across all of the businesses. Starting with North America, very stable performance moving from 19% EBITDA margins to 20%. Just a huge amount of improvement in Europe, and it came from demand recovering in a strong way and prices moving up throughout the year, and also good operations throughout the year. And Brazil did a very good job managing its export price. On average, prices through the year were up about $150 a ton. 
If I turn to the Consumer Packaging business, it ran very well in the quarter also. And if you adjust for the outages, basically had a similar level of earnings in the fourth quarter than it had in the third quarter. Backlogs continue to be strong in our Coated Paper business. We continue to have backlogs that go out about four weeks. That's about a week better than what we have last year, and our year-over-year volume in the fourth quarter was up 9% versus 2009. We also, as I mentioned earlier, got about $15 a ton more in price than the third quarter. So all in all, a really solid quarter for the Consumer Packaging business.
If you look at the next slide, I'm showing you what happened through the course of the year. And the low margin level in the first half was really a result of what happened with the wood shortage and the fiber cost increases that happened at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, but a great job recovering from that and also realizing the announced price increases throughout the year and improving ops. We've had a couple of mills where we've had operational issues for a number of years. And second, third and fourth quarter just showed sequential improvements in mill operations for the business. So the business exit 2010 in the fourth quarter 230 basis points better than the full year average.
By turning to xpedx, a lower number than expectations, but for a couple of reasons, and I'll go through those. The good news is the business is continuing to recover. And in the fourth quarter, we had our strongest revenue quarter, if you look at average daily sales for the whole year. So first half of the year was 10% lower than how we ended up in the second half of the year on revenue. And total year EBIT moved from $55 million in 2009 up to $78 million in 2010. Part of the reason for the lower earnings number in the fourth quarter is that the business has been undergoing a strategic review of business improvement opportunities, and after having completed most of the work, decided to take some charges for business segments that they'll be exiting in the retail and printing equipment segments specifically. And we're completing the work this quarter, so we'll have a lot more to talk to you about the earnings improvement runway when we release first quarter earnings.
If I turn to the Ilim joint venture, another good quarter building on the third quarter's results. And if you remember, we report Ilim on a one quarter lag. So what you're seeing is our fourth quarter number for Ilim's third quarter. And we have to go back and think about what was happening with pulp prices in the second quarter of this year. We did see a stepdown in pulp price from the second quarter to the third quarter, and then it began recovering during the third quarter but did not fully make up the decline through the quarter. That continues into the fourth quarter, and so we expect Ilim's performance to continue moving up. They had good operations, and also the $31 million result that we booked as equity earnings included a $12 million charge for an asset write-off related to a vacant office building that they're no longer using. So that was a one-time item that impacted their third quarter, our fourth quarter. 
When you look at the three-year history of the Ilim joint venture, we finished 2010 EPS accretive, and we had record earnings for 2010. And over the three-year period, after having a good year, the first year of the joint venture and then being hurt by the economic crisis in the second bounced back, and we're now at earnings levels that are above the pre-crisis level. We've also, since the time of investment, received $152 million in cash dividend. And the projects, the strategic investment projects, are currently under way and on track.
Before I shift from the businesses to other corporate items, let me just touch on Europe for a moment. Europe, as we exited the year for the company, we were approaching cost of capital, Europe was at cost of capital all year long and had a really strong performance across all of the businesses. Our Russian Paper business, the Western European Paper businesses and our Container business, which is in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and ended the year with an ROI of 16%, basically on good demand recovery, good operations and really good price momentum.
So with that, I'll switch to debt. And on Slide 26, you can see where we were at the end of 2008 with $12 billion of balance sheet debt and a $3 billion pension gap. And you see the waterfall to our results at the end of 2010, with $8.7 billion of balance sheet debt and $1.5 billion pension gap. That pension gap is made up of about a $1.1 billion gap in our qualified plan and a $400 million gap in the non-qualified plan. So when we look at this, we say, ""Hey, we've made a lot of progress on debt reduction, but we're just getting to the threshold of the targets that we had set for ourselves.""
On the capital spending front, we're estimating that in 2011 we will spend somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on capital. That's after averaging $650 million on capital for the 2009, 2010 period. And it's going to really come from the results of higher maintenance and higher regulatory. You can see that on the chart, which is primarily related to the boiler MAC requirements. But we're also increasing spending on cost reduction projects and strategic projects. The cost reduction projects, where we're going to spend about $200 million more incrementally than we did in 2010, are primarily around consumption reduction projects and lowering our cost base. The strategic and the biggest one is really the Sun joint venture coated board machine that we announced last year, which there'll be a fair amount of spending on that this year.
So with that, we're higher in this year the average that we set over the cycle, but we're still right in line with the $1 billion target of spending on average across the cycle, and we're still committed to that target. So let me end up on Slide 28, and I think this is a good example of what we mean by cost reduction capital. If you look at our energy efficiency progress since 2000, we've reduced our dependence on fossil fuels and purchased energy by 45%. Currently, we spend 1 billion-plus dollars on purchased energy a year, and the capital projects that we have pursued over the past decade are not very large projects. In fact, if you look at the 10-year period, we've completed close to 1,000 projects over 10 years. So these tend to be smaller, smaller dollars, quicker to implement and quicker payback. The one area of opportunity that we think we still have, in our legacy mills, we have more opportunity to reduce consumption of purchased energy, but we have a bigger opportunity in the warehouse or mills where we've just started implementing some of these projects. 
So with that, I'll wrap it up and turn it back over to John."

I think the slide here, and I'm looking at Slide 29, says it all. It was a good end to 2010. Again, I think we had a V-shaped recovery in our earnings performance and cash flow performance, and kind of a U-shaped economic environment certainly here in North America. 
If we turn to the first quarter outlook, I guess I'd say, it's January. It's seasonally slow like it's always is in January from a demand standpoint. You think the first quarter kind of looks like the fourth quarter. On all fronts, things are more or less stable, with the exception of fiber and energy, where we see some increase in cost, and we do see some improvement in the Ilim joint venture, because we're in that one quarter lag, but by and large, kind of a stable and seasonally slow economic environment is in the first quarter. No surprises there.
The 2011 outlook I think is quite positive. From a full year basis, we're quite positive, year with momentum. We think about 2011 as a breakout year. 2010 was a transition year coming out of the worst recession we've had in 70 years since in our view is strong earnings improvement. ROI improvement in the cost of capital zone, and strong free cash flow to go with it. And global balance with all parts of the world contributing to International Paper.

If you look at all the economic indicators, there's global growth in all regions, and we continue to participate in that, and that's a strategic segment for us. I think it has been publicly acknowledged, there has been some downward pressure on export pricing in the fourth quarter due to some seasonal supply that became available, but I can't speculate on future pricing. But my outlook for supply and demand is that as the U.S. hits the seasonal strong second quarter, married up with strong maintenance outages, that the seasonal balance will get tighter.

SCA is turning out to be exactly what we thought it would be from an asset standpoint and customer standpoint. The business was in worst shape than we would like when we closed on July 1. The containerboard pricing ran up significantly over in Asia. If you recall OCC pricing in the second quarter, and we had over 20% run-up in our input cost. On the IP side, in our legacy plants, we recovered that. In the SCA side in the second quarter, they recovered zero of that. So that's what we walked into on July 1 when we close. We've been trying to rebuild those margins. We had some shutdown cost of redundant facilities, cheap plants primarily. So the numbers weren't very good. It didn't meet our expectations in the first six months that we owned them, but we're already seeing price improvement. If we look at our fourth quarter delta P on the SCA plants, we were net positive versus again higher containerboard pricing in China. So we're gaining on it, and we still think it will be exactly what we thought it would be when we bought it. The market right now over in Asia for containerboard is kind of quiet. We're in the middle of Chinese New Year. But we think it's going to be -- we think OCC is relatively stable. Carol maybe have a better view of that, but we think containerboard pricing is going to remain high, and we still have margin to recapture and rebuild particularly at the SCA plants."

We could assume what First Call says and move from there. But there's other factors. There's the possibility of pension contributions that would weigh away on that. There's also the issue of whether we determined at the end of the day, we think the alternative fuel mixture credit is a taxable credit or a non-taxable credit. And there's some reason to believe that the proper conclusion maybe non-taxable. If we come to that conclusion, then economically it just doesn't make sense to refund or payback the credit that we've already received and apply for the CB credit. So we've got more work to do. It's going to take us into 2011 to really nail down where we think we are. And what we took in the fourth quarter was just the benefit on black liquor gallons that we ran in 2009 but did not mix.

If you'll let me just start off by saying we finished 2010 with a strong quarter. Earnings were almost at $0.68, almost 3x what they were in the fourth quarter last year. It's really on the back of solid volume,",818,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. If you'll let me just start off by saying we finished 2010 with a strong quarter. Earnings were almost at $0.68, almost 3x what they were in the fourth quarter last year. It's really on the back of solid volume, on price and cost performance. Margins, and this is important, expanded 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and we had very strong earnings in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Moving to the next slide, to put this in context. The fourth quarter for International Paper was the strongest fourth quarter that we've had in over 10 years. I don't say that to suggest that we're anywhere near our peak. We think we've got quite a bit of runway ahead of us as we go through 2011, which we'll talk about in the call.
So just turning to full year results for a minute. The strong fourth quarter wrapped up a very good 2010. We really had, International Paper, a V-shaped recovery while the economy in the U.S. at least was recovering in more of a U-shape. Our low tide mark was the first quarter where we earned $0.05, and we came out of the year with a lot of momentum, with third and fourth quarter performance. 
The earnings for the year were more than twice what they were last year at just over $2 compared to $0.88, free cash flow of $1.7 billion, margin expansion of 110 basis points. So we kind of ended the year with more margin expansion than we had for the full year, which is a good jumping off point for 2011.
And significant return on investment improvement, which we'll talk about. More debt reduction and pension funding, and two increases in the dividend, the one early in the year and one late in the year, have now restored the dividend back to $0.75 from the $0.10 it was coming into the year. 
2010 headlines. Sales up 8%, again, both volume and price; strong free cash flow even with higher levels of capital spending in 2010 compared to 2009. And the sales growth which also took -- that and capital took about $800 million of cash, and we still had strong free cash flow. Less than $9 billion of debt, a $4 billion reduction in debt over the last several years since we completed the Weyerhaeuser acquisition, that's over -- close to a 40% reduction in our debt and a healthy cash balance of just over $2 billion. And I think this all demonstrates that International Paper can generate very healthy cash flow in still what is I would characterize a recovering, not a fully recovered, economy.
Just the next slide shows you where the revenue growth is coming from. And I think it's important because it underscores the global balance is becoming more and more part of International Paper. Our North American business has performed well. Sales growth was 6%. Outside North America, sales growth was double what it was in North America, 13%. And in our Ilim joint venture, our revenue growth, that's volume and prices, up 33%. So if you include Ilim in the whole package for a minute, our revenue growth outside North America was 3x what it was inside North America. And again, that's both volume and price. 
Turning to the waterfall chart that shows you the EPS comparison of 2009 to 2010. The big levers stand out here: Price, volume, cost and Ilim. And the one negative, and it was a substantial negative, but we were able to overcome it during the year and still expand our margins, we had input cost pressure, primarily wood and OCC of over $1 a share. 
So International Paper is a cash flow story and continues to be a cash flow story. Post-transformation plan in International Paper, we built a step-change capability in our free cash flow, and this slide here shows that. We've more than doubled our free cash flow pre-transformation from an average of about $900 million a year to $1.9 billion a year, if you look at the last three years. And this has obviously flowed through to our ability to improve our return on investment, which is a key metric for International Paper. We come out of 2010 going into 2011 with our returns, as we say, in the cost of capital zone. Our run rate ROI for third and fourth quarter was about 8%. That's twice its low point of 4% in the middle of the recession in 2009. 
And from a macro perspective, I think I would characterize 2010 as a transition year, not nearly a mid-recycle year, because when we look at our Industrial Packaging business, our Coated Board business and xpedx, our three big businesses in North America, we don't see demand yet back to pre-recession levels. Eventually, it’ll get there.
So Tim, I'll turn over to you."
61036,117811230,99018,"International Paper Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 12. So I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and go through a few more of the details. And you can see on this slide, sales growth year-over-year of 9%. Also, look at the EBITDA. We had in the",2248,"Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 12. So I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and go through a few more of the details. And you can see on this slide, sales growth year-over-year of 9%. Also, look at the EBITDA. We had in the third quarter over $1 billion of EBITDA, but we also had the land sale, and it was a fairly light outage quarter. 
So what I feel really good about looking at third quarter to fourth quarter, if you adjust for the land sale and you adjust for outages, we would have been at about $960 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and a very solid $870 million in the fourth quarter. Another good quarter of cash flow, as John mentioned, and in that cash flow number of $600 million, there's $130 million of incremental CapEx spending in the quarter. So a really strong way to finish the year.
If you look at the next slide, just going from third quarter to fourth quarter, I think you'd look at it and say the momentum continues. We had more outages in the quarter. It's seasonally a slower volume quarter, and we did have a few operational issues late in the quarter, but we ran very well in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, as the season changed and cold weather had some impact, and we had a few one-off items in some of the mills, which we've now recovered from, but we probably left around $15 million on the table from the items that we had. 
Price was another good story. In a lot of the businesses, box was up. Export pricing was up. Consumer Packaging business had a price increase through the quarter, as well as our European Paper business. And if you look at volume year-on-year, we were up in our Packaging businesses. PNC was down, which we would have expected in North America, and Brazil continue to perform very strong. 
The one item on tax that I do want to call out, our tax rate in the fourth quarter dropped to 28%, and I think the way to think about that is there was legislation in the fourth quarter in the Extenders Bill that we could not book as we would have normally booked throughout the course of the year, and so it was a catch-up in the fourth quarter. And that's basically for the R&D tax credit that we received, as well as how some of the offshore entities are treated from U.S. tax perspective. 
So in summary, it's a good quarter. Volume was where we expected it to be. Prices were up. Operations were good, but could have been better, and inputs were trending slightly higher. So if you go to the next page, I've got a breakout on input cost. And the thing that I take away from this is good performance with inputs going out. More than half of the inputs were in our North American business, and more than half of the input increases were in Industrial Packaging. So OCC, up $17 million quarter-on-quarter. We did see wood fiber continue to improve, and really for the first time, we saw chemicals start to jump up as well. 
So with that, let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging. Solid quarter. We had much higher maintenance outages in the quarter, and some of the operational issues that I mentioned earlier showed up in IPG. And as I said, have now been resolved. Volume was down seasonally, but up 2.8% year-over-year, and box prices moved up $4, and we continue to see export pricing increasing. 
So when you turn to the next slide, we've shown you this slide before on margins. We saw fourth quarter margins in line with the highest margins in the industry. And I think a really important point, as we exit 2010 fourth quarter, EBITDA margins that are 240 basis points better than the full year average for 2010.
We also saw earnings improve, and not only in North America, but in our European business. So our two largest Industrial Packaging businesses had improved performance in 2010. Specifically in North America, we had to work through a pretty significant input cost increase. The bulk of that being OCC, but with close to $400 million of increased inputs, we still improved the business by $100 million. And we ran in the second half of the year at an average margin of 19½% versus the 12% in the first half as we were dealing with the input cost squeeze. 
International Container had a great year. In Europe, volume was better by $20 million, and our cost was better, largely due to the Etienne mill shutdown, but good performance across all of the business units there. If you turn to Printing Papers. I thought Printing Papers had a very good quarter. Operationally, we ran well in North America. We had a couple of issues outside North America, but the step-down in performance on ops was right in line with our expectations around moving from a warmer season to a colder season.
As I mentioned, price in Europe was up. We were stable in the U.S. We did have about $11 million of green energy credits that did not come through. This is in our Poland mill, and it's just a timing issue, so we should pick those up in the first quarter. So overall, Printing Papers had a solid quarter and a really good year. If you look at Slide 19, you can see the margin improvement across all of the businesses. Starting with North America, very stable performance moving from 19% EBITDA margins to 20%. Just a huge amount of improvement in Europe, and it came from demand recovering in a strong way and prices moving up throughout the year, and also good operations throughout the year. And Brazil did a very good job managing its export price. On average, prices through the year were up about $150 a ton. 
If I turn to the Consumer Packaging business, it ran very well in the quarter also. And if you adjust for the outages, basically had a similar level of earnings in the fourth quarter that it had in the third quarter. Backlogs continue to be strong in our Coated Paper business. We continue to have backlogs that go out about four weeks. That's about a week better than what we had last year, and our year-over-year volume in the fourth quarter was up 9% versus 2009. We also, as I mentioned earlier, got about $15 a ton more in price than the third quarter. So all in all, a really solid quarter for the Consumer Packaging business.
If you look at the next slide, I'm showing you what happened through the course of the year. And the low margin level in the first half was really a result of what happened with the wood shortage and the fiber cost increases that happened at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, but a great job recovering from that and also realizing the announced price increases throughout the year and improving ops. We've had a couple of mills where we've had operational issues for a number of years. And second, third and fourth quarter just showed sequential improvements in mill operations for the business. So the business exit 2010 in the fourth quarter 230 basis points better than the full year average.
If I turn to xpedx, a lower number than expectations, but for a couple of reasons, and I'll go through those. The good news is the business is continuing to recover. And in the fourth quarter, we had our strongest revenue quarter, if you look at average daily sales for the whole year. So first half of the year was 10% lower than how we ended up in the second half of the year on revenue. And total year EBIT moved from $55 million in 2009 up to $78 million in 2010. Part of the reason for the lower earnings number in the fourth quarter is that the business has been undergoing a strategic review of business improvement opportunities, and after having completed most of the work, decided to take some charges for business segments that they'll be exiting in the retail and printing equipment segments specifically. And we're completing the work this quarter, so we'll have a lot more to talk to you about the earnings improvement runway when we release first quarter earnings.
If I turn to the Ilim joint venture, another good quarter building on the third quarter's results. And if you remember, we report Ilim on a one quarter lag. So what you're seeing is our fourth quarter number for Ilim's third quarter. And we have to go back and think about what was happening with pulp prices in the second quarter of this year. We did see a step-down in pulp price from the second quarter to the third quarter, and then it began recovering during the third quarter but did not fully make up the decline through the quarter. That continues into the fourth quarter, and so we expect Ilim's performance to continue moving up. They had good operations, and also the $31 million result that we booked as equity earnings included a $12 million charge for an asset write-off related to a vacant office building that they're no longer using. So that was a one-time item that impacted their third quarter, our fourth quarter. 
When you look at the three-year history of the Ilim joint venture, we finished 2010 EPS accretive, and we had record earnings for 2010. And over the three-year period, after having a good year the first year of the joint venture and then being hurt by the economic crisis in the second, bounced back, and we're now at earnings levels that are above the pre-crisis level. We've also, since the time of the investment, received $152 million in cash dividends. And the projects, the strategic investment projects, are currently under way and on track.
Before I shift from the businesses to other corporate items, let me just touch on Europe for a moment. Europe, as we exited the year for the company, we were approaching cost of capital, Europe was at cost of capital all year long and had a really strong performance across all of the businesses. Our Russian Paper business, the Western European Paper businesses and our Container business, which is in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and ended the year with an ROI of 16%, basically on good demand recovery, good operations and really good price momentum.
So with that, I'll switch to debt. And on Slide 26, you can see where we were at the end of 2008 with $12 billion of balance sheet debt and a $3 billion pension gap. And you see the waterfall to our results at the end of 2010, with $8.7 billion of balance sheet debt and a $1.5 billion pension gap. That pension gap is made up of about a $1.1 billion gap in our qualified plan and a $400 million gap in the non-qualified plan. So when we look at this, we say, ""Hey, we've made a lot of progress on debt reduction, but we're just getting to the threshold of the targets that we had set for ourselves.""
On the capital spending front, we're estimating that in 2011 we will spend somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on capital. That's after averaging $650 million on capital for the 2009, 2010 period. And it's going to really come from the result of higher maintenance and higher regulatory. You can see that on the chart, which is primarily related to the boiler MAC requirements. But we're also increasing spending on cost reduction projects and strategic projects. The cost reduction projects, where we're going to spend about $200 million more incrementally than we did in 2010, are primarily around consumption reduction projects and lowering our cost base. The strategic and the biggest one is really the Sun joint venture coated board machine that we announced last year, which there'll be a fair amount of spending on that this year.
So with that, we're higher in this year the average that we set over the cycle, but we're still right in line with the $1 billion target of spending on average across the cycle, and we're still committed to that target. So let me end up on Slide 28, and I think this is a good example of what we mean by cost reduction capital. If you look at our energy efficiency progress since 2000, we've reduced our dependence on fossil fuels purchased energy by 45%. Currently, we spend $1 billion-plus on purchased energy a year, and the capital projects that we have pursued over the past decade are not very large projects. In fact, if you look at the 10-year period, we've completed close to 1,000 projects over 10 years. So these tend to be smaller, smaller dollars, quicker to implement and quicker payback. The one area of opportunity that we think we still have, in our legacy mills, we have more opportunity to reduce consumption of purchased energy, but we have a big opportunity in the Weyerhaeuser mills where we've just started implementing some of these projects. 
So with that, I'll wrap it up and turn it back over to John."

Again, I think we had a V-shaped recovery in our earnings performance and cash flow performance in kind of a U-shaped economic environment, certainly here in North America. 
If we turn to the first quarter outlook, I guess I'd say, it's January. It's seasonally slow like it always is in January from a demand standpoint. You think the first quarter kind of looks like the fourth quarter. On all fronts, things are more or less stable, with the exception of fiber and energy, where we see some increase in cost, and we do see some improvement in the Ilim joint venture, because we're on that one quarter lag, but by and large, a kind of a stable and seasonally slow economic environment as we look at the first quarter. No surprises there.
The 2011 outlook I think is quite positive. For a full year basis, we're quite positive to see good momentum. We think about 2011 as a breakout year. 2010 was a transition year coming out of the worst recession we'd had in 70 years and in our view is strong earnings improvement, ROI improvement in the cost of capital zone, and strong free cash flow to go with it. And global balance with all parts of the world contributing to International Paper. I think we'll stop right there, Tom, and take questions."

Although I would say that in January, our actual January volume on a year-over-year basis continues to trend up on the same pattern that we've seen. The December data is out now, and December was up 3½%. So we would continue to see modest year-over-year growth on U.S. packaging demand. Relative to export, export demand still remains solid. If you look at all the economic indicators, there's global growth in all regions, and we continue to participate in that, and that's a strategic segment for us. I think as has been publicly acknowledged, there has been some downward pressure on export pricing in the fourth quarter due to some seasonal supply that became available, but I can't speculate on future pricing. But my outlook for supply and demand is that as the U.S. hits the seasonal strong second quarter, married up with strong maintenance outages, that the seasonal balance will get tighter.

So our view is probably better than a mid-single digit decline. We're looking hopefully at a flattish market."

SCA is turning out to be exactly what we thought it would be from an asset standpoint and customer standpoint. The business was in worse shape than we would like when we closed on it July 1. The containerboard pricing ran up significantly over in Asia, if you recall OCC pricing in the second quarter, and we had over a 20% run-up in our input cost. On the IP side, in our legacy plants, we recovered that. In the SCA side in the second quarter, they recovered zero of that. So that's what we walked into on July 1 when we closed. We've been trying to rebuild those margins. We had some shutdown cost of redundant facilities, sheet plants primarily. So the numbers weren't very good. Didn't meet our expectations in the first six months that we owned them, but we're already seeing price improvement. If we look at our fourth quarter delta P on the SCA plants, we were net positive versus again higher containerboard pricing in China. So we're gaining on it, and we still think it will be exactly what we thought it would be when we bought it. The market right now over in Asia for containerboard is kind of quiet. We're in the middle of Chinese New Year. But we think it's going to be -- we think OCC is relatively stable. Carol, maybe you have a better view on that, but we think containerboard pricing is going to remain high, and we still have margin to recapture and rebuild particularly at the SCA plants."

The momentum that we talked about with you last year started to build in the second quarter 2010 continues. 1 of the things that really made a difference for International Paper, has made a difference and continues to make a difference is our global products. And as we talk about our performance during you'll see that global balance really starting to pay off in our results. First quarter were solid returns again and the cost of capital range of operating EPS of $0.74 versus $0.04 a year ago and up 18% sequentially quarter to quarter. During the quarter, as you know, we also increased our dividends for the third time and increase it slightly above prerecession levels.

So just turning to that slide for a brief financial snapshot before I turn it over to Tim. Sales were up 10%. We improved EBITDA margins up 400 basis points over to first quarter, 60 basis points over the fourth quarter, continued very strong free cash flow, and first quarter that always is and was seasonally weak, this was impacted by quite a bit of bad weather in the January-February timeframe.

As John said, we did have a very strong quarter in the first quarter, but not without some headwinds. Volume was seasonally weak. We are typically slower in Russia, slower in Brazil, slower in North America but we did have weather-related impact in North America that hit us as well and I'll speak more about that when i come back to the Industrial Packaging business. We also had higher input cost and I'll speak more about those in details but we are really carried by the strength of our operations and it wasn't just here in North America, it was really around the world. The other notable item on this page was the really strong result from Ilim and I'll share some more details with you in just a few minutes about their fourth quarter, our first quarter reported. 
If you turn to Page, we've got our normal input cost breakout and we had close to $50 million in the first quarter. It was really in line with our expectations weighted towards North America. We had about 80% of the increase in North America and 20% in Europe. The Packaging business is we're able to cover the input cost increases with operational improvements, Printing Papers was hit disproportionately in the quarter by energy chemicals and I'll talk a little bit more about that when we get to the Printing Papers segment. 
So let me turn to each of the segments now and I'll start with industrial packaging. We had a really solid first quarter even with the weather impacts and the rising cost. We had purposely pull back a little bit on export shipments towards the end of last year for the first quarter anticipating higher box demand in the U.S. and then the weather gotten in the way but I think it was the real strength of the business was able to react quickly, take the market-related downtime that they needed to and so if you look about the volume buckets there 10 million of that 14 million was really related to market-related downtime around North American box. Had very solid operations, really across all the mills and converting facility not just here in the U.S. but globally. 
Turning to the next page, look at margins. In North America, the ability of the business to really react quickly led to the highest margins in the industry in the first quarter. If you look at the blue bar. And if you look at the shifts, the Delta between the green which was first quarter last year and the blue first quarter this year, we have the largest improvement year-over-year over 900 basis points. I think the real strength of the business and our ability to react quickly is highlighted on the next page where we are really different from most in terms of how we're positioned across multiple channels to market. And you can see in the green boxes we're integrated to a level of about 80% that includes both the U.S. channel and our box brands overseas. And we have about 20% of volume going to the upper market. Both here in North America and in the export channels. And really what the business is doing is focusing on the right channel mix, period by period to maximize value and that focus has led us to be a consistent long-term supplier in all of these channels over time. 
Last slide on North American Industrial Packaging on the next Page, is just some data point to highlight the strength of the quarter. It's not our seasonally strongest quarter, it's probably our seasonally weakest quarter because of our heavy orientation to the agriculture packaging and that's really a second quarter event. But we had a really strong quarter with improved margins and part of that margin improvement has come from the realization of price increases from the announcements that we made last year. If you look at year-over-year, first quarter to first quarter, we've realized just over $90 per ton in price increases. So we feel really good about that. We also generated cost of capital returns in the first quarter running at an operating rate of 93%. So the way we think about it, we look at it we say, hey there's still some earnings runway here. We took almost 100,000 tons of market downtime in the quarter and still have a cost of capital return. 
To turn the Printing papers on the next Page, another great quarter in Printing Papers and it was really balance around the world. Printing papers incurred almost half of the total company input cost increases driven by energy and chemicals. We have volumes up in North America and Europe in uncoated free sheet. We're seasonally weak in Russia and Brazil as I mentioned. It's really the weakest quarters they have. And we had stable prices in a slightly negative mix impact. That's kind of a normal occurrence in the first quarter given our customer mix in Brazil. And again, strong operating results in both Europe and Brazil.
Let me turn to Consumer Packaging now. And I thought Consumer Packaging just had an excellent quarter. We benefited from lighter outage quarter but even if you exclude that, still had earnings up 30% in the quarter. And it was really on the strength of all of the businesses, John mentioned the global balance and this is a pretty good example of it. Volumes in North America were up 9%, backlogs continue to be strong, we're still running at 5 plus weeks. Prices were up in all of the regions quarter-on-quarter and if you look at price levels year-on-year, North America is up $92 a ton, our Asia business is up 80 and Europe were up 130 euros per ton in Europe. Operations, again strong and all of the regions including North America where we struggled with mill performance over the past few years. Our Augusta mill finally turn the quarter and we have the first favorable operating results since 2006 in Augusta. So if we concentrated first on North American paperboard. Let me just show you some history in the improvement. If you go back to 2008, we had a 900-basis point improvement through the end of last year and it's really a combination of 3 things. It's restructured commercial contracts and better performance there, its improving operating results in the mills here and it's managing the supply chain better. And now you can see where the margin level in the first quarter run rate of 23%, again it's a light outage quarter but I think the business has positioned itself to be able to achieve margins in the low 20s throughout the year.
Turning to the next page and I'll talk about what I call the other Packaging business. We spent a lot of time talking about Industrial Packaging business but coated paperboard is a global business for us. It's a large business at about 3 million tons globally and North America is a big part of that but it's only part. We also have a very attractive business in Eastern Europe, Russia and we have our Sun joint venture in Asia. You can see the margins for all 3 regions, Asia looks low at 11% but all our earning cost of capital returns in Asia gets there by way of a lower capital base and higher turns. So Asia's turning in our capital at roughly 2x tons versus a little over 1 in North America.
Now let me turn to xpedx where we had a slightly better quarter in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year but we were well behind the first quarter of last year. And really, there's several major factors to that. First of all, paper pricing is increasing and so there's been a little bit of a margin squeeze from that. But we've also seen higher freight and higher fuel cost that hit margins in the first quarter. And then there was a negative LIFO accounting charge in the quarter that we didn't have last year. So all in all, a better quarter in the first quarter but not where we think the business will run on more normalized basis. And as I mentioned on our last quarterly call, the business team has been undergoing a strategic review to dramatically improve earnings and today we have Mary Laschinger, who is the President of xpedx, with us to share some of those plans. So mary, I'll turn it over to you."

Prior to the 2009 recession, we were making significant progress in achieving the synergies from all of those acquisitions through increasing our sales revenue and most importantly improving the bottom line, which is shown on Slide 17. And we were showing great progress towards generating cost of capital return. 
Then the recession hit in 2009 and our sales declined by more than 15%. And demand in our primary segment Commercial Print was especially hit hard. And our earnings dropped by about 25%. And so the organization and business went into aggressively reducing operating cost. And you can see, we started to see improvement in 2010 but we're still performing below expectations and what we believe to be our potential. But this reset in the business in 2009 class is to initiate us a strategic review of the business. So over the last 6 months, we've been conducting that strategy review and we confirmed that this business still has significant improvement opportunities. Also as part of the study, we benchmarked other distribution companies as shown in Slide 18, and the data shows that although our asset turns are best in class, our margins lag. We're pleased with our position in terms of against other packaging and paper distributors but our goal is to become 1 of the best among all distributors. 
The external benchmarking and the internal analysis confirmed that we have potential significantly to generate significantly better returns and therefore, our plans are to accelerate the profit improvement plans that we have started prior to the recession. Our strategy for the business remains the same. We're committed to maintaining our position as the largest supplier to the print segment. And we're going to continue to invest in the higher growth segments of packaging and facility solutions. But to support the strategy and to achieve the step change in earnings, we are going to be focusing our change effort around that 3 key drivers in the Distribution business, which are outlined on Slide 19. We believe by focusing on improvements on these key drivers, we can improve our earnings by over $140 million annually. If you look at our distribution business, what we do is we buy products from mills and manufacturers. We handled these products through our network of warehouses and our delivery trucks fleet and we sell these products to a variety of customers. In order for us to achieve significantly better returns we got to be operationally excellent in all 3 of these functions and that's what our goals is. For example in the buy function, we have further opportunity to centralize our procurement processes and decision-making so that we can more effectively leverage our size and scale and most importantly provide a consistent product and service offering to our customers. For example today in our packaging segment, we have about 150 tape suppliers and over 1,200 SKUs. By rationalizing the number of suppliers to a few strategic suppliers and reducing the total number of SKUs, we have the opportunity to improve our asset turns and improve our margins. 
In the handle function, we managed and operate over 100 warehouses across North America. We have further opportunity to optimize our warehouse network and inventory around our customer demand, which will allow us to streamline our operations with fewer, more efficient facility. For example, we recently announced our plan to consolidate 3 facilities in the Salt Lake City area to 1 larger more efficient facility which will be centrally located to support our customer needs. We are also in the process of implementing world-class Warehouse Management System and fleet routing and tracking systems. With all of these initiatives, we have the ability to further reduce our operating cost and improve service to our customers. It is our intent to continue to service all of the geographic markets that we currently serve. 
Finally, in our selling function, we have opportunities to increase productivity in our sales force and invest in additional field marketing capability for the higher growth packaging and facility solutions segment. For us to achieve the $140 million of earnings improvement, we're going to incur about $100 million of net cash cost over about 3-year time period. We're very confident in our ability to implement the plan and improving the earnings and most importantly generate greater than cost of capital return over the next 3 years. So with that, Tim, I'll turn it back to you."

Let me turn to Ilim and talk about what was a great quarter. Again, this is Ilim's fourth quarter, our first quarter because we report on a 1-quarter lag that but volume was up slightly, price was essentially flat on pulp and operations had a record quarter. So all in all, Ilim turned in the results we expected and we expect that result to continue to improve as we go into our second quarter, their first. And just to recap for you, we did, John mentioned the dividend we received in the first quarter, that now brings the total dividend received from Ilim over history of the joint venture to write that $200 million on the $650 million investment. So if you look at Ilim's result today, and we recorded on an equity accounting basis but if we were consolidating, Ilim will have the highest return on investment in the company at right at 25% with 30-plus percent EBITDA margins. 
So 1 last slide before I turn it back over to John. And this is really a summary slide. We look at the transformation plan, which happens 3 or 4 years ago but we say that Transformation Plan is really working. And if you go back to 2008, we thought we were on pace to have a cost of capital year in 2009 before the crisis. So as we come through 2010 and recover faster than probably what most expectations were, we positioned ourselves in the second half of last year to have a cost of capital a year in 2011. And in the first quarter, we're in that zone and we see the momentum continuing. So we expect that in 2011, we'll have the year we expected to have in 2009. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for the outlook."

I'm going to start the quarter by just repeating what Tim just said. The momentum continues. Despite the input cost headwinds that we got, we got the right businesses in the right places with good discipline and focus execution. And what's that leading is continued strong earnings per share results, free cash flow and ROI. So I'm now on the chart that shows all the red, yellow and green that is really how we think about the outlook going forward. Near-term is more of the same. We're going to get some seasonal volume improvement, that's around the world not just in North America. Some sales pricing improvement, another solid quarter at Ilim. We got 2 significant changes in the second quarter, 1 internal that we managed and that's we're going to the second quarter with a lot of outages that were planned and are heavy outage quarter, that's going to cost us about $0.11 a share, kind of quarter-over-quarter. And we see more input cost headwinds specifically transportation. This means that we had $50 million in the first quarter this year versus the fourth quarter and the second quarter, I don't know how it's going to turn out but it can easily be another $50 million. So with that though, we still expect the second quarter to be solid. We expect good operations, we expect strong cash flow and we expect good solid return on investment across the International Paper portfolio. And with that, I think I'll turn it back to you tom for questions."

And if you want to move the bottom line, you got to have a systemic approach and in my opinion it needs to be a fairly broad-based approach because 1 thing is not going to move the needle. So we have still opportunity to get better, there's no doubt. We have a very systemic approach on our mills side. We have focused on consumption, fiber energy, chemicals, we have focus on reliability, which then ends up impacting our spending. And we've got capital projects which I referenced in the past relative to some very high returns, targeted, we're talking in this million dollars range, not 50 or 100 by project. Box plant's equally important. And the great part about the box business is you got to play off in sand meaning we need very good competitive facilities and so we're focused there on waste productivity throughput. Bricks and mortar, we closed 3 facilities last fourth quarter because we can get more through the bricks and mortar we have. But simultaneously with that, we got to be focus on our commercial effectiveness. This is a game that you're selling and it's a broad-based selling efforts. So we got a lot of effort there around making sure that we sell value that we priced well, that we do the right things there. And then the other thing we've got the supply chain. 10 million tons across the globe and there's a lot of opportunity to keep getting better and smarter in that and we are making that probably the last piece of our warehouser work, we're putting our operating model in the warehouse or mills right now and that's going to allow us to really make a step change in how we operate that part. All that said, at the end of the day, the key thing that we got to that is low-cost Mills for competitive advantage and manage supply and demand. This business has to be run well from that perspective. And then have a great boxes them to take to market and then as we put in our presentation, leverage our global reach to find the best markets and optimize. So we've got a really great hand to play and I'm convinced we got more opportunity to make it better."

March feels a whole lot better than January and February for obvious reasons. And April feeling like it's usual kind of a April and call it at 2% GDP environment. So we're feeling pretty positive about the demand in the U.S. but not before. On the paper side the underlying structure issues have been changed. We just got a recovering economy. I think March was the first month that we had fairly strong paper shipments. So even if we get a couple of months of positive year-over-year paper shipments we still think the underlying demand trends are slightly down, we have to see how that plays out. Around the world, it's a different story. Brazil, paper shipments were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Our box business including Turkey, which we do equity accounting just state the volume for a box business and Europe was up 11% quarter-over-quarter. So those kinds of numbers are indicative of the fact that the world outside North America is growing at pretty healthy rates and we're in those markets. And that's kind of 1 of the IP differences. So the bleached board business, looks quite that business came back faster than Containerboard in terms on the demand side it fell very sharply in the first quarter last year that was a low watermark but we're back to sold out with strong backlogs. It feels like we're recovering but not a fully recovered economy in North America and outside North America, it feels like the rest of the world, even places like Europe that we think we really have problems are showing some pretty good growth for us especially in packaging."

For the first quarter, we characterize this a good solid quarter for International Paper. The momentum that we talked about with you last year that started to build in the second quarter of 2010 continues. One of the things that really made a difference for International Paper, it has made a difference, and continues to make a difference is our global balance. And as we talk about our performance during, as Tim will, you'll see that global balance really starting to pay off in our results. 
First quarter were solid returns, again, in the cost of capital range. Operating EPS of $0.74 versus $0.04 a year ago and up 18% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. During the quarter, as you know, we also increased our dividend for the third time and increase it to slightly above prerecession levels. And during the quarter, we announced a strategic entry into the India paper and packaging markets. 
So just turning to that slide here, a brief financial snapshot before I turn it over to Tim. Sales were up 10%; we improved EBITDA margins up 400 basis points over the first quarter, 60 points -- 60 basis points over the fourth quarter; we continued very strong free cash flow; and a first quarter that always is and was seasonally weak. And this time is impacted by quite a bit of bad weather in the January-February timeframe; continued debt reduction; and continue to have a strong cash balance on the balance sheet. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim to take you through the first quarter in somewhat more details."

As John said, we did have a very strong quarter in the first quarter, but not without some headwinds. Volume was seasonally weak. We are typically slower in Russia, slower in Brazil, slower in North America. But we did have the weather-related impact in North America that hit us as well, and I'll speak more about that when I come to the Industrial Packaging business. We also had higher input cost, and I'll speak more about those in details. But we were really carried by the strength of our operations, and it wasn't just here in North America, it was really around the world. The other notable item on this page was the really strong results from Ilim, and I'll share some more details with you in just a few minutes about their fourth quarter, our first quarter reported. 
If you turn to the next page, we've got our normal input costs breakout, and we had close to $50 million in the first quarter. It was really in line with our expectations weighted towards North America. We had about 80% of the increase in North America and then 20% in Europe. The Packaging businesses were able to cover the input costs increases with operational improvements. Printing Papers was hit disproportionately in the quarter by energy, chemicals and wood, and I'll talk a little bit more about that when we get to the Printing Papers segment. 
So let me turn to each of the segments now, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We had a really solid first quarter even with the weather impacts and the rising costs. We had purposely pull back a little bit on export shipments towards the end of last year for the first quarter anticipating higher box demand in the U.S., and then the weather got in the way. But I think it was a real strength of the business, it was able to react quickly, take the market-related downtime that they needed to. And so if you look at the volume bucket there, 10 million of that 14 million was really related to market-related downtime around North American box. Had very solid operations, really across all the mills and converting facilities, not just here in the U.S. but globally. 
Turning to the next page, we look at margins. In North America, the ability of the business to really react quickly led to the highest margins in the industry in the first quarter. If you look at the blue bar. And if you look at the shifts, the delta between the green, which was first quarter of last year and the blue, first quarter this year, we have the largest improvement year-over-year at over 900 basis points. 
I think the real strength of the business and our ability to react quickly is highlighted on the next page, where we are really different from most in terms of how we're positioned across multiple channels to market. And you can see in the green boxes, we're integrated to a level of about 80% that includes both the U.S. channel and our box brands overseas. And we have about 20% of volume going to the open market, both here in North America and in the export channels. And really what the business is doing is focusing on the right channel mix, period-by-period to maximize value, and that focus has led us to be a consistent long-term supplier in all of these channels over time. 
Last slide on North American Industrial Packaging, on the next page, is just some data points to highlight the strength of the quarter. It's not our seasonally strongest quarter, it's probably our seasonally weakest quarter because of our heavy orientation to agriculture packaging. And that's really a second quarter event. But we had a really strong quarter with improved margins, and part of that margin improvement has come from the realization of price increases from the announcements that we made last year. If you look at it year-over-year, first quarter-to-first quarter, we've realized just over $90 per ton in price increases. So we feel really good about that. We also generated cost of capital returns in the first quarter, running at an operating rate of 93%. So the way we think about it, we look at it and we say, ""Hey, there's still some earnings runway here."" We took almost 100,000 tons of market downtime in the quarter and still had a cost of capital return. 
To turn to Printing Papers on the next page. Another great quarter in Printing Papers, and it was really balanced around the world. Printing Papers incurred almost half of the total company input costs increases driven by energy and chemicals. We have volumes up in North America and Europe in uncoated free sheet. We're seasonally weak in Russia and Brazil, as I mentioned. It's really the weakest quarters they have. And we had stable prices, and a slightly negative mix impact. That's kind of a normal occurrence in the first quarter given our customer mix in Brazil. And again, strong operating results in both Europe and Brazil.
Let me turn to Consumer Packaging now. And I thought Consumer Packaging just had an excellent quarter. They benefited from lighter outage quarter, but even if you exclude that, still had earnings up 30% in the quarter. And it was really on the strength of all of the businesses. John mentioned the global balance, and this is a pretty good example of it. Volumes in North America were up 9%. Backlogs continue to be strong. We're still running at 5-plus weeks. Prices were up in all of the regions quarter-on-quarter. And if you look at price levels year-on-year, North America's up $92 a ton. Our Asia business is up $80 and Europe were up EUR 130 per ton in Europe. Operations, again, strong in all of the regions including North America, where we struggled with mill performance over the past few years. Our Augusta mill finally turned the corner, and we had a first favorable operating results since 2006 in Augusta. 
So if we concentrated first on North American Coated Paperboard. Let me just show you some history on the improvement. If you go back to 2008, we had a 900-basis-point improvement through the end of last year. And it's really a combination of 3 things: it's restructured commercial contracts and better performance there, its improving operating results in the mills here and it's managing the supply chain better. And now you can see, we're at a marginal level in the first quarter, a run rate of 23%. Again, it's a light outage quarter, but I think the business has positioned itself to be able to achieve margins in the low 20s throughout the year.
Turn to the next page, and I'll talk about what I call the other Packaging business. We spent a lot of time talking about Industrial Packaging business but Coated Paperboard is a global business for us. It's a large business at about 3 million tons globally, and North America is a big part of that but it's only part. We also have a very attractive business in Eastern Europe, Russia, and we have our Sun joint venture in Asia. And you can see the margins for all 3 regions. Asia looks low at 11%, but all our earning cost-of-capital returns in Asia gets there by way of a lower capital base and higher turns. So Asia's turning their capital roughly 2x versus a little over one in North America.
Now let me turn to xpedx where we had a slightly better quarter in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year, but we were well behind the first quarter of last year. And really, there's several major factors to that. First of all, paper pricing is increasing, and so there's been a little bit of a margin squeeze from that. But we've also seen higher freight and higher fuel cost that hit margins in the first quarter, and then there was a negative LIFO accounting charge in the quarter that we didn't have last year. So all in all, a better quarter in the first quarter but not where we think the business will run on a more normalized basis. And as I mentioned on our last quarterly call, the business team has been undergoing a strategic review to dramatically improve earnings. 
And today, we have Mary Laschinger, who is the President of xpedx, with us to share some of those plans. so mary, I'll turn it over to you."
61036,129304847,119082,"International Paper Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We're going to use the next few slides to provide an overview of the xpedx profit improvement plan that was mentioned during the fourth quarter earnings call earlier this year. Just a little bit of background. Our Di",801,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We're going to use the next few slides to provide an overview of the xpedx profit improvement plan that was mentioned during the fourth quarter earnings call earlier this year. 
Just a little bit of background. Our Distribution business in North America is comprised primarily of independent paper and packaging distributors that were acquired by International Paper over the last many years. Prior to the 2009 recession, we were making significant progress and achieving the synergies from all of those acquisitions through increasing our sales revenue and, most importantly, improving the bottom line, which is shown on Slide 17. And we were showing great progress towards generating cost-of-capital return. 
Then the recession hit in 2009, and our sales declined by more than 15%. And demand in our primary segment, Commercial Print, was especially hit hard, and our earnings dropped by about 25%. And so the organization and the business went into aggressively reducing operating costs. And you can see, we started to see improvement in 2010, but we're still performing below expectations and what we believe to be our potential. But this reset in the business in 2009 caused us to initiate a strategic review of the business. So over the last 6 months, we've been conducting that strategy review, and we've confirmed that this business still has significant improvement opportunities. 
Also, as part of the study, we benchmarked other distribution companies as shown in Slide 18. And the data shows that although our asset turns are best in class, our margins lag. We're pleased with our position in terms of against other packaging and paper distributors, but our goal is to become one of the best among all distributors. The external benchmarking and the internal analysis confirmed that we have potential, significantly, to generate significantly better returns. And therefore, our plans are to accelerate the profit improvement plans that we had started prior to the recession. 
Our strategy for the business remains the same. We're committed to maintaining our position as the largest supplier to the print segment, and we're going to continue to invest in the higher growth segments of packaging and facility solutions. But to support the strategy and to achieve the step change in earnings, we are going to be focusing our change effort around the 3 key drivers in the Distribution business, which are outlined on Slide 19. We believe by focusing improvements on these key drivers, we can improve our earnings by over $140 million annually. 
If you look at our Distribution business, what we do is we buy products from mills and manufacturers. We handle these products through our network of warehouses and our delivery truck fleet, and we sell these products to a variety of customers. In order for us to achieve significantly better returns, we've got to be operationally excellent in all 3 of these functions, and that's what our goal is. 
For example, in the buy function, we have further opportunity to centralize our procurement processes and decision-making so that we can more effectively leverage our size and scale and, most importantly, provide a consistent product and service offering to our customers. For example, today in our Packaging segment, we have about 150 tape suppliers and over 1,200 SKUs. By rationalizing the number of suppliers to a few strategic suppliers and reducing the total number of SKUs, we have the opportunity to improve our asset turns and improve our margins. 
In the handle function, we managed and operate over 100 warehouses across North America. We have further opportunity to optimize our warehouse network and inventory around our customer demand, which will allow us to streamline our operations with fewer, more efficient facilities. For example, we recently announced our plan to consolidate 3 facilities in the Salt Lake City area to one larger, more efficient facility, which will be centrally located to support our customer needs. We are also in the process of implementing world-class warehouse management systems and fleet routing and tracking systems. With all of these initiatives, we have the ability to further reduce our operating costs and improve service to our customers. It is our intent to continue to service all of the geographic markets that we currently serve. 
Finally, in our selling function, we have opportunities to increase productivity of our sales force and invest in additional field marketing capability for the higher growth Packaging and facility solutions segments. 
For us to achieve the $140 million of earnings improvement, we're going to incur about $100 million of net cash costs over about a 3-year time period. We're very confident in our ability to implement the plan and improving the earnings and, most importantly, generate greater than cost-of-capital return over the next 3 years. 
So with that, Tim, I'll turn it back to you."

Let me turn to Ilim and talk about what was a great quarter. Again, this is Ilim's fourth quarter, our first quarter, because we report on a one-quarter lag that, but -- volume was up slightly, price was essentially flat on Pulp and operations had a record quarter. So all in all, Ilim turned in the result we expected, and we expect that result to continue to improve as we go into our second quarter, their first. 
And just to recap for you, we did -- John mentioned the dividend we received in the first quarter that now brings the total dividends received from Ilim over the history of the joint venture to right at $200 million on a $650 million investment. So if you look at Ilim's results today, and we recorded on an equity accounting basis, but if we were consolidating, Ilim will have the highest return on investment in the company at right at 25% with 30%-plus EBITDA margins. 
So one last slide before I turn it back over to John, and this is really a summary slide. We look at the transformation plan, which happens 3 or 4 years ago, what we say that, that transformation Plan is really working. And if you go back to 2008, we thought we were on pace to have a cost-of-capital year in 2009 before the crisis had. So as we come through 2010 and recover faster than probably what most expectations were, we positioned ourselves in the second half of last year to have a cost-of-capital year in 2011. And in the first quarter, we're in that zone, and we see the momentum continuing. So we expect that in 2011, we'll have the year we expected to have in 2009. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for the outlook."

I'm going to start the quarter by just repeating what Tim just said. The momentum continues. Despite the input cost headwinds that we got, we got the right businesses in the right places with good discipline and focus execution. And what that's leading to is continued strong earnings per share results, free cash flow and ROI. 
So I'm now on the chart that shows all the red, yellow and green that is really how we think about the outlook going forward. Near term is more of the same. We're going to get some seasonal volume improvement. That's around the world not just in North America. Some sales pricing improvement. Another solid quarter at Ilim. We got 2 significant changes in the second quarter, one, internal that we managed and that's -- we're going to the second quarter with a lot of outages that were planned as the -- our heavy-outage quarter. So that's going to cost us about $0.11 a share, kind of quarter-over-quarter. And we see more input cost headwinds, specifically transportation. As Tim said, we had $50 million in the first quarter this year versus the fourth quarter. And the second quarter, we don't know how it's going to turn out but it could easily be another $50 million. 
So with that though, we still expect the second quarter to be solid. We expect good operations. We expect strong cash flow, and we expect good solid return on investment across the International Paper portfolio. 
And with that, I think we'll -- I'll turn it back to you, Tom, for questions."

We built a box plant. That's new. And we're right at, I'd say, the first third of the modernization strategy that was part of the whole acquisition that where there's a project going out of Kotlas in the northwest at a paper machine and a coater. The paper machine was relocated from a mill that IP shut down, Inverurie in the U.K. And then the big pulp modernization and expansion project in Bratsk is underway. So the footprint is in the process of changing. Ilim is funding that capital project through its own balance sheet and through the free cash flow they're generating. So their debt, their balance sheet debt is going up but it's on their balance sheet, and it's well within Ilim's financial capability to service that debt."

And if you want to move the bottom line, you got to have a systemic approach. And in my opinion, it needs to be a fairly broad-based approach, because one thing is not going to move the needle. So we have still opportunity to get better, there's no doubt. We have a very systemic approach on our mills side. We have focus on consumption, fiber, energy, chemicals. We have focus on reliability, which then ends up impacting our spending. And we've got capital projects, which I've referenced in the past, relative to some very high return targeted. We're talking in the million-dollars range, not 50 or 100 by project. Box plant is equally important, and the great part about the box business is you got to play offense and defense. Meaning, you need very good competitive facilities, and so we're focused there on waste productivity throughput. Bricks and mortar. We closed 3 facilities last fourth quarter, because we can get more through the bricks and mortar we have. But simultaneously with that, we've got to be focus on our commercial effectiveness. This is a game that you're selling, and it's a broad-based selling effort. So we've got a lot of effort there around making sure that we sell value, that we priced well, that we do the right things there. And then the other thing we've got is supply chain. I mean, we move 10 million tons across the globe. And there's a lot of opportunity to keep getting better and smarter in that, and we are making that, probably the last piece of our Weyerhaeuser, work. We're putting our operating model in the Weyerhaeuser mills right now, and that's going to allow us to really make a step change in how we operate that part. All that said, at the end of the day, the key theme that we've got to do is build low-cost mills for competitive advantage and manage supply to demand. I mean, this business has to be run well from that perspective, and then have a great box system to take it to market. And then as we put in our presentation, leverage our global reach to find the best markets and optimize. So we've got a really great hand to play, and I'm convinced we've got more opportunity to make it better."

I mean, we're going to get back to 2000 levels of box consumption, and I'm talking about the industry now. It's just a question of how many years is it going to take, but that's going to happen. So we're not looking at a business that's got a shrinking demand, and as Tim pointed out, we have -- our strategy is to serve all 3 markets: the independent market in the U.S., the integrated market and the export market. And the global demand for virgin linerboard is growing at 3% a year, where the U.S. is the low-cost producer. And we're the low-cost producer in the U.S. So we're not going to go build another linerboard mill, but we're not looking to shrink the business because we don't see the market shrinking."

And xpedx happens to be our largest merchant customer, but we have a lot of very good and very strategic independent customers. So we don't run the business on an integrated business, we run it as a standalone profit center. And it's a great window to the market for us around paper and packaging. If xpedx was is in the plumbing supplies business, we wouldn't be in it because that's not our core business, but paper and packaging is. And we're figuring out ways also to go joint the market with xpedx and some of the other IP businesses, where we have a capability to do something, having distribution and manufacturing that the competition, just has distribution or just has manufacturing, doesn't have. Now having said that, xpedx has got to earn its cost of capital on its own capital. It's a different kind of business.

March feels a whole lot better than January and February, for obvious reasons. And April is feeling like it's the usual kind of a April and, call it, at 2% GDP environment. So we're feeling pretty positive about demand in the U.S. but not euphoric. On the paper side -- I mean, the underlying structural issues haven't changed. We just got a recovering economy. I think March was the first month that we had fairly strong paper shipments. So even if we get a couple of months of positive, I mean, year-over-year paper shipments, we still think the underlying demand trends are slightly down. We'll have to see how that plays out. Around the world, it's a different story. I mean, Brazil, paper shipments were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Our box business, including Turkey, which we do equity accounting, we've since take the volume for our box business. And in Europe, it was up 11% quarter-over-quarter. So those kinds of numbers are indicative of the fact that the world outside North America is growing at pretty healthy rates, and we're in those markets. And that's kind of one of the IP differences. So the bleached board business looks quite solid. That business came back faster than Containerboard. In terms on the demand side, it fell very sharply in the first quarter last year. That was the low watermark, but we're back to sold out with strong backlogs. So it feels like a recovering but not a fully recovered economy in North America. And outside North America, it feels like the rest of the world. Even places like Europe, that we think we really have problems, are showing some pretty good growth for us, especially in packaging."

For the first quarter, we characterize this a good solid quarter for International Paper. The momentum that we talked about with you last year that started to build in the second quarter of 2010 continues. One of the things that really made a difference for International Paper, it has made a difference, and continues to make a difference is our global balance. And as we talk about our performance during, as Tim will, you'll see that global balance really starting to pay off in our results. 
First quarter were solid returns, again, in the cost of capital range. Operating EPS of $0.74 versus $0.04 a year ago and up 18% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. During the quarter, as you know, we also increased our dividend for the third time and increased it to slightly above prerecession levels. And during the quarter, we announced a strategic entry into the India paper and packaging markets. 
So just turning to that slide here, a brief financial snapshot before I turn it over to Tim. Sales were up 10%; we improved EBITDA margins up 400 basis points over the first quarter, 60 points -- 60 basis points over the fourth quarter; we continued very strong free cash flow; and a first quarter that always is and was seasonally weak. And this time is impacted by quite a bit of bad weather in the January-February timeframe; continued debt reduction; and continue to have a strong cash balance on the balance sheet. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim to take you through the first quarter in somewhat more detail."

As John said, we did have a very strong quarter in the first quarter, but not without some headwinds. Volume was seasonally weak. We are typically slower in Russia, slower in Brazil, slower in North America. But we did have the weather-related impact in North America that hit us as well, and I'll speak more about that when I come to the Industrial Packaging business. We also had higher input cost, and I'll speak more about those in details. But we were really carried by the strength of our operations, and it wasn't just here in North America, it was really around the world. The other notable item on this page was the really strong results from Ilim, and I'll share some more details with you in just a few minutes about their fourth quarter, our first quarter reported. 
If you turn to the next page, we've got our normal input costs breakout, and we had close to $50 million in the first quarter. It was really in line with our expectations weighted towards North America. We had about 80% of the increase in North America and then 20% in Europe. The Packaging businesses were able to cover the input costs increases with operational improvements. Printing Papers was hit disproportionately in the quarter by energy, chemicals and wood, and I'll talk a little bit more about that when we get to the Printing Papers segment. 
So let me turn to each of the segments now, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We had a really solid first quarter even with the weather impacts and the rising costs. We had purposely pulled back a little bit on export shipments towards the end of last year for the first quarter anticipating higher box demand in the U.S., and then the weather got in the way. But I think it was a real strength that the business was able to react quickly, take the market-related downtime that they needed to. And so if you look at the volume bucket there, 10 million of that 14 million was really related to market-related downtime around North American box. Had very solid operations, really across all the mills and converting facilities, not just here in the U.S. but globally. 
Turning to the next page, we look at margins. In North America, the ability of the business to really react quickly led to the highest margins in the industry in the first quarter. If you look at the blue bar. And if you look at the shifts, the delta between the green, which was first quarter of last year and the blue, first quarter this year, we have the largest improvement year-over-year at over 900 basis points. 
I think the real strength of the business and our ability to react quickly is highlighted on the next page, where we are really different from most in terms of how we're positioned across multiple channels to market. And you can see in the green boxes, we're integrated to a level of about 80% that includes both the U.S. channel and our box brands overseas. And we have about 20% of volume going to the open market, both here in North America and in the export channels. And really what the business is doing is focusing on the right channel mix, period-by-period to maximize value, and that focus has led us to be a consistent long-term supplier in all of these channels over time. 
Last slide on North American Industrial Packaging, on the next page, is just some data points to highlight the strength of the quarter. It's not our seasonally strongest quarter, it's probably our seasonally weakest quarter because of our heavy orientation to agriculture packaging. And that's really a second quarter event. But we had a really strong quarter with improved margins, and part of that margin improvement has come from the realization of price increases from the announcements that we made last year. If you look at it year-over-year, first quarter-to-first quarter, we've realized just over $90 per ton in price increases. So we feel really good about that. We also generated cost of capital returns in the first quarter, running at an operating rate of 93%. So the way we think about it, we look at it and we say, ""Hey, there's still some earnings runway here."" We took almost 100,000 tons of market downtime in the quarter and still had a cost of capital return. 
To turn to Printing Papers on the next page. Another great quarter in Printing Papers, and it was really balanced around the world. Printing Papers incurred almost half of the total company input costs increases driven by energy and chemicals. We have volumes up in North America and Europe in uncoated free sheet. We're seasonally weak in Russia and Brazil, as I mentioned. It's really the weakest quarters they have. And we had stable prices, and a slightly negative mix impact. That's kind of a normal occurrence in the first quarter given our customer mix in Brazil. And again, strong operating results in both Europe and Brazil.
Let me turn to Consumer Packaging now. And I thought Consumer Packaging just had an excellent quarter. They benefited from lighter outage quarter, but even if you exclude that, still had earnings up 30% in the quarter. And it was really on the strength of all of the businesses. John mentioned the global balance, and this is a pretty good example of it. Volumes in North America were up 9%. Backlogs continue to be strong. We're still running at 5-plus weeks. Prices were up in all of the regions quarter-on-quarter. And if you look at price levels year-on-year, North America's up $92 a ton. Our Asia business is up $80 and Europe we’re up EUR 130 per ton in Europe. Operations, again, strong in all of the regions including North America, where we struggled with mill performance over the past few years. Our Augusta mill finally turned the corner, and we had the first favorable operating results since 2006 in Augusta. 
So if we concentrated first on North American Coated Paperboard. Let me just show you some history on the improvement. If you go back to 2008, we’ve had a 900-basis-point improvement through the end of last year. And it's really a combination of 3 things: it's restructured commercial contracts and better performance there, its improving operating results in the mills here and it's managing the supply chain better. And now you can see, we're at a marginal level in the first quarter, a run rate of 23%. Again, it's a light outage quarter, but I think the business has positioned itself to be able to achieve margins in the low 20s throughout the year.
Turn to the next page, and I'll talk about what I call the other Packaging business. We spent a lot of time talking about Industrial Packaging business but Coated Paperboard is a global business for us. It's a large business at about 3 million tons globally, and North America is a big part of that but it's only part. We also have a very attractive business in Eastern Europe, Russia, and we have our Sun joint venture in Asia. And you can see the margins for all 3 regions. Asia looks low at 11%, but all our earning cost-of-capital returns in Asia gets there by way of a lower capital base and higher turns. So Asia's turning their capital roughly 2x versus a little over one in North America.
Now let me turn to xpedx where we had a slightly better quarter in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year, but we were well behind the first quarter of last year. And really, there's several major factors to that. First of all, paper pricing is increasing, and so there's been a little bit of a margin squeeze from that. But we've also seen higher freight and higher fuel cost that hit margins in the first quarter, and then there was a negative LIFO accounting charge in the quarter that we didn't have last year. So all in all, a better quarter in the first quarter but not where we think the business will run on a more normalized basis. And as I mentioned on our last quarterly call, the business team has been undergoing a strategic review to dramatically improve earnings. 
And today, we have Mary Laschinger, who is the President of xpedx, with us to share some of those plans. so Mary, I'll turn it over to you."
61036,129304847,119148,"International Paper Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We're going to use the next few slides to provide an overview of the xpedx profit improvement plan that was mentioned during the fourth quarter earnings call earlier this year. Just a little bit of background. Our Di",801,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We're going to use the next few slides to provide an overview of the xpedx profit improvement plan that was mentioned during the fourth quarter earnings call earlier this year. 
Just a little bit of background. Our Distribution business in North America is comprised primarily of independent paper and packaging distributors that were acquired by International Paper over the last many years. Prior to the 2009 recession, we were making significant progress and achieving the synergies from all of those acquisitions through increasing our sales revenue and, most importantly, improving the bottom line, which is shown on Slide 17. And we were showing great progress towards generating cost-of-capital return. 
Then the recession hit in 2009, and our sales declined by more than 15%. And demand in our primary segment, Commercial Print, was especially hit hard, and our earnings dropped by about 25%. And so the organization and the business went into aggressively reducing operating costs. And you can see, we started to see improvement in 2010, but we're still performing below expectations and what we believe to be our potential. But this reset in the business in 2009 caused us to initiate a strategic review of the business. So over the last 6 months, we've been conducting that strategy review, and we've confirmed that this business still has significant improvement opportunities. 
Also, as part of the study, we benchmarked other distribution companies as shown in Slide 18. And the data shows that although our asset turns are best in class, our margins lag. We're pleased with our position in terms of against other packaging and paper distributors, but our goal is to become one of the best among all distributors. The external benchmarking and the internal analysis confirmed that we have potential, significantly, to generate significantly better returns. And therefore, our plans are to accelerate the profit improvement plans that we had started prior to the recession. 
Our strategy for the business remains the same. We're committed to maintaining our position as the largest supplier to the print segment, and we're going to continue to invest in the higher growth segments of packaging and facility solutions. But to support the strategy and to achieve the step change in earnings, we are going to be focusing our change effort around the 3 key drivers in the Distribution business, which are outlined on Slide 19. We believe by focusing improvements on these key drivers, we can improve our earnings by over $140 million annually. 
If you look at our Distribution business, what we do is we buy products from mills and manufacturers. We handle these products through our network of warehouses and our delivery truck fleet, and we sell these products to a variety of customers. In order for us to achieve significantly better returns, we've got to be operationally excellent in all 3 of these functions, and that's what our goal is. 
For example, in the buy function, we have further opportunity to centralize our procurement processes and decision-making so that we can more effectively leverage our size and scale and, most importantly, provide a consistent product and service offering to our customers. For example, today in our Packaging segment, we have about 150 tape suppliers and over 1,200 SKUs. By rationalizing the number of suppliers to a few strategic suppliers and reducing the total number of SKUs, we have the opportunity to improve our asset turns and improve our margins. 
In the handle function, we manage and operate over 100 warehouses across North America. We have further opportunity to optimize our warehouse network and inventory around our customer demand, which will allow us to streamline our operations with fewer, more efficient facilities. For example, we recently announced our plan to consolidate 3 facilities in the Salt Lake City area to one larger, more efficient facility, which will be centrally located to support our customer needs. We are also in the process of implementing world-class warehouse management systems and fleet routing and tracking systems. With all of these initiatives, we have the ability to further reduce our operating costs and improve service to our customers. It is our intent to continue to service all of the geographic markets that we currently serve. 
Finally, in our selling function, we have opportunities to increase productivity of our sales force and invest in additional field marketing capability for the higher growth Packaging and facility solutions segments. 
For us to achieve the $140 million of earnings improvement, we're going to incur about $100 million of net cash costs over about a 3-year time period. We're very confident in our ability to implement the plan and improving the earnings and, most importantly, generate greater than cost-of-capital return over the next 3 years. 
So with that, Tim, I'll turn it back to you."

Let me turn to Ilim and talk about what was a great quarter. Again, this is Ilim's fourth quarter, our first quarter, because we report on a one-quarter lag, but -- volume was up slightly, price was essentially flat on Pulp and operations had a record quarter. So all in all, Ilim turned in the result we expected, and we expect that result to continue to improve as we go into our second quarter, their first. 
And just to recap for you, we did -- John mentioned the dividend we received in the first quarter that now brings the total dividends received from Ilim over the history of the joint venture to right at $200 million on a $650 million investment. So if you look at Ilim's results today, and we recorded on an equity accounting basis, but if we were consolidating, Ilim would have the highest return on investment in the company at right at 25% with 30%-plus EBITDA margins. 
So one last slide before I turn it back over to John, and this is really a summary slide. We look at the transformation plan, which happens 3 or 4 years ago, what we say that, that transformation plan is really working. And if you go back to 2008, we thought we were on pace to have a cost-of-capital year in 2009 before the crisis had. So as we come through 2010 and recover faster than probably what most expectations were, we positioned ourselves in the second half of last year to have a cost-of-capital year in 2011. And in the first quarter, we're in that zone, and we see the momentum continuing. So we expect that in 2011, we'll have the year we expected to have in 2009. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for the outlook."

I'm going to start the quarter by just repeating what Tim just said. The momentum continues. Despite the input cost headwinds that we got, we got the right businesses in the right places with good discipline and focus execution. And what that's leading to is continued strong earnings per share results, free cash flow and ROI. 
So I'm now on the chart that shows all the red, yellow and green that is really how we think about the outlook going forward. Near term is more of the same. We're going to get some seasonal volume improvement. That's around the world not just in North America. Some sales pricing improvement. Another solid quarter at Ilim. We got 2 significant changes in the second quarter, one, internal that we managed and that's -- we're going to the second quarter with a lot of outages that were planned as the -- our heavy-outage quarter. So that's going to cost us about $0.11 a share, kind of quarter-over-quarter. And we see more input cost headwinds, specifically transportation. As Tim said, we had $50 million in the first quarter this year versus the fourth quarter. And the second quarter, we don't know how it's going to turn out but it could easily be another $50 million. 
So with that though, we still expect the second quarter to be solid. We expect good operations. We expect strong cash flow, and we expect good solid return on investment across the International Paper portfolio. 
And with that, I think we'll -- I'll turn it back to you, Tom, for questions."

And if you want to move the bottom line, you got to have a systemic approach. And in my opinion, it needs to be a fairly broad-based approach, because one thing is not going to move the needle. So we have still opportunity to get better, there's no doubt. We have a very systemic approach on our mills side. We have focus on consumption, fiber, energy, chemicals. We have focus on reliability, which then ends up impacting our spending. And we've got capital projects, which I've referenced in the past, relative to some very high return targeted. We're talking in the million-dollars range, not 50 or 100 by project. Box plant is equally important, and the great part about the box business is you got to play offense and defense. Meaning, you need very good competitive facilities, and so we're focused there on waste productivity throughput. Bricks and mortar. We closed 3 facilities last fourth quarter, because we can get more through the bricks and mortar we have. But simultaneously with that, we've got to be focused on our commercial effectiveness. This is a game that you're selling, and it's a broad-based selling effort. So we've got a lot of effort there around making sure that we sell value, that we price well, that we do the right things there. And then the other thing we've got is supply chain. I mean, we move 10 million tons across the globe. And there's a lot of opportunity to keep getting better and smarter in that, and we are making that, probably the last piece of our Weyerhaeuser, work. We're putting our operating model in the Weyerhaeuser mills right now, and that's going to allow us to really make a step change in how we operate that part. All that said, at the end of the day, the key theme that we've got to do is build low-cost mills for competitive advantage and manage supply to demand. I mean, this business has to be run well from that perspective, and then have a great box system to take it to market. And then as we put in our presentation, leverage our global reach to find the best markets and optimize. So we've got a really great hand to play, and I'm convinced we've got more opportunity to make it better."

If xpedx was in the plumbing supplies business, we wouldn't be in it because that's not our core business, but paper and packaging is. And we're figuring out ways also to go joint the market with xpedx and some of the other IP businesses, where we have a capability to do something, having distribution and manufacturing that the competition, just has distribution or just has manufacturing, doesn't have. Now having said that, xpedx has got to earn its cost of capital on its own capital. It's a different kind of business. As Mary said, it's a buy-handle-sell business, not a capital-intensive process business. So the linkage, the strategic linkage is what xpedx sells."

So I think those are some of the things that we -- we've got a great system. And one of the things we're building in to our mindset and to our operations is flexibility. And so we have operators by control room, Mark, that are focused on how to get gas out of boilers, how to optimum-ly run based upon the demand we've got.

March feels a whole lot better than January and February, for obvious reasons. And April is feeling like it's the usual kind of April and, call it, at 2% GDP environment. So we're feeling pretty positive about demand in the U.S. but not euphoric. On the paper side -- I mean, the underlying structural issues haven't changed. We just got a recovering economy. I think March was the first month that we had fairly strong paper shipments. So even if we get a couple of months of positive, I mean, year-over-year paper shipments, we still think the underlying demand trends are slightly down. We'll have to see how that plays out. Around the world, it's a different story. I mean, Brazil, paper shipments were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Our box business, including Turkey, which we do equity accounting, we've since take the volume for our box business. And in Europe, it was up 11% quarter-over-quarter. So those kinds of numbers are indicative of the fact that the world outside North America is growing at pretty healthy rates, and we're in those markets. And that's kind of one of the IP differences. So the bleached board business looks quite solid. That business came back faster than Containerboard. In terms on the demand side, it fell very sharply in the first quarter last year. That was the low watermark, but we're back to sold out with strong backlogs. So it feels like a recovering but not a fully recovered economy in North America. And outside North America, it feels like the rest of the world. Even places like Europe, where we think we really have problems, are showing some pretty good growth for us, especially in packaging."

Then I'll make a couple of comments on the Temple acquisition proposal and if we have time, we'll take a couple of questions on that. So we'll do it in that order. 
So let me just start off talking about the second quarter. International Paper had a very strong second quarter in a recovering but obviously not fully recovered economic environment here in North America. Our results were driven by a couple of things: a balanced segment and global portfolio of businesses around the world; very strong contributions from print papers in North America, Coated Paperboard in North America and the Ilim joint venture; really outstanding operations and cost management that's continuing; good maintenance outage execution during the quarter; some seasonal improvement in demand and offset significant input cost escalation that Tim will talk about. 
This next chart here just shows you the segment and global portfolio balance. It's part of International Paper's business platform today. As you can see on the left, the good balance in terms of where the earnings came from by segment and on the right, good balance in terms of where the earnings came from by geography. 
Turning to the financial snapshot page, strong revenue growth of revenues up 8%, EBITDA, over $900 million in the quarter, up 16% from the second quarter last year, a run rate of $3.6 billion. Free cash flow, amazingly, exactly equal to the first quarter but I would say that that also has $40 million of additional capital spending in the second quarter. So our free cash flow is actually up around 10% if you normalize for capital spending during the quarter. 
Really, if you look at this next slide here, which is the EPS over the last really 10 years, you can see there's a step change in our EPS performance. This is the result of Transformation Plan. The 2009 period you're looking at there is the global recession that is now in the rearview mirror. But importantly, our earnings over the last 4 or 5 quarters are not from land sales as they were in the prior years. So they were really operating earnings from our businesses and as you can see, we've achieved kind of a step change in terms of the capability of International Paper to generate earnings and free cash flow. We think there's more left on the runway as we go forward. In terms of return on capital, 8% return -- over an 8% return on capital over the last 4 quarters into the cost of capital though, which is important in terms of one of our key metrics. So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to summarize the quarter."
61036,136828592,147791,"International Paper Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. As John said, we did have very strong performance in the second quarter. Volume contributed $0.08 to the change in results from the first quarter. And I would say that while volume here in North America is reall",1125,"Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. As John said, we did have very strong performance in the second quarter. Volume contributed $0.08 to the change in results from the first quarter. And I would say that while volume here in North America is really moving sideways, and we'll talk about that a little bit in more detail as we go through the slide deck, in other parts of the world, we're continuing to see growth, whether it's Russia or various parts of Asia. So volume, price, strong operations and a great results from Ilim more than offset the heavy maintenance outage schedule, the heaviest of the year for the second quarter and the impact of the Vicksburg's flood, which cost us about $20 million. Input costs were up in the quarter, $31 million. In line with expectations, about 75% of that in North America and 25% in Europe, which has been kind of a theme to this year and it's really fiber and energy costs in Europe. All of the businesses, industrial, consumer packaging and printing papers also higher costs. 
So let me turn to the segments now and I'll start with Printing Papers. And Printing Papers I thought just had an excellent quarter. We've got a business in North America for the first half. It's running at a 14% of return on investment. EMEA, first half running at 17% ROI. But in the quarter, pricing was up across all regions. Operations were really outstanding, big improvement over the first quarter in all regions but especially strong in North America and really good cost management. We did have the IR outages that I mentioned that was mainly in Europe and Brazil and we had really good execution around all of those. We did have one issue at Svetogorsk mill in Russia, where we found some things that required us to take a little bit more time and spend a little bit more money, probably cost us about $7 million in the quarter. 
Let me turn to Industrial Packaging now and I though Industrial Packaging again had a good quarter, still running at a 9% return on investment. Box price was mostly flat, down about $5 quarter-on-quarter. Volume was seasonally stronger, up about 170,000 tons, but not as strong as we had expected and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a slide or 2. Operations were really good and again, good cost management out of the Industrial Packaging group. Outages, heaviest quarter of the year but we had great execution across the outages. And we also had great execution around the Vicksburg mill. I think most of you know that we had to take the mill down for 49 days due to the flooding that was experienced on the Mississippi River. But the manufacturing team, the business did a great job protecting the mill. We had no damage to the mill at all. It's now back up and running but we did lose about 80,000 tons of production during the quarter. 
If you look at margins for Industrial Packaging in North America, IP had the highest margins in the industry in the second quarter at 17.6%, again, in a heavy maintenance outage quarter and year-over-year, a solid increase, up 180 basis points. Let me come back and talk about demand for a moment. As I said, we see demand really moving sideways. And it feels kind of like what it should feel like in a 1% to 2% GDP environment. Second quarter for us is normally our strongest quarter of the year because of our exposure and weighting to agricultural packaging out on the West Coast. And we had a much lighter season in the West region around agricultural packaging than we expected, mainly due to weather. So what you've got on the chart here, if you look at the blue bars, those are total shipments. And then the gold bars, we've pulled out the Western region to show what the rest of the country looked like from a demand standpoint. And as I mentioned, we were disproportionately impacted in the quarter relative to the industry because of our weightings but just as a couple of examples, the strawberry season came late. So in the quarter, we were down almost 6% year-on-year. Cherries were hit by weather. I think there was damage from hail and storms and so we saw the cherry production almost cut in half on the West Coast, then avocados were down as well. So it was a number of factors on the West Coast that really hit us hard in the quarter. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging, another great performance by Consumer Packaging. Stronger price, favorable ops, offset by outages and input costs but really solid performance across the businesses. Price and operations and cost management covered -- nearly covered $20 million in outages and another $9 million in input cost increases and continued to have really strong performance for coated paperboard in all the regions of the world, Europe, China and the U.S. And when you look at North American coated paperboard performance, for the first half, we've got a business that in the first half of 2011 has already earned more than in all of 2010 and first half of this year is running at a 12% return on investment. 
Turning to the distribution business, xpedx saw only a slight improvement in earnings quarter-to-quarter, really due to pressures from fuel cost and transportation cost. We did see a bit of a bright spot in packaging, which is about 25% of xpedx's business, which posted a 9% growth rate quarter-on-quarter. 
The Ilim Joint Venture just had a great quarter. Again, we report on one quarter lag but Ilim's earnings increased in the quarter from $44 million to $57 million. Volume was up, price was up and it's up both for pulp and containerboard. Operations ran well and just another very strong quarter turned in by the joint venture. 
So if you look at margins first half of this year versus the first half of last year, strong performance across all the businesses. Different sets of challenges, region by region, business by businesses, different sets of opportunities but business management completely focused on margin management and delivering the earnings and cash flows that we need to across all the businesses. And I think if you turn to the next slide and look at returns, then that's what's really making the difference in terms of our return on investment over the past 4 quarters. We're now in that cost of capital zone and have been across each of the last 4 quarters. So with that, I'll end my summary and turn it back over to John for an outlook on earnings."
61036,136828592,147791,"International Paper Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tim. Before I do that, let me just summarize the quarter quickly. I'd say we got the right assets in the right places. We're managing aggressively and we're executing well. Seasonal demand in North America arrived as expected but as Tim said",339,"Okay. Thanks, Tim. Before I do that, let me just summarize the quarter quickly. I'd say we got the right assets in the right places. We're managing aggressively and we're executing well. Seasonal demand in North America arrived as expected but as Tim said, the demand is not robust in North America. Outside North America, demand is good. Latin America, China, Russia, in places like Turkey where we have presence in the packaging business, healthy demand. We've got some flowthrough on pricing during the quarter. Our input costs were not as we expected and OCC continues to move up as we look at the third quarter. And then Ilim delivered just a spectacular quarter. The Ilim accounted for 18% of our EPS during the quarter. 
So let me move on to the third quarter outlook. Page 21 for those of you who are following along. The U.S. economy is growing at 1% to 2% and from a demand standpoint, it feels like a 1% to 2% GDP economy. Export demand in containerboard is good but domestically, whether it's paper, coated paperboard, containerboard or xpedx, it feels like 1% to 2% GDP growth. Demand is not up, it's not down. I'd characterize it as moving sideways. Outside North America, as I said, demand is solid year-over-year and we think that will continue. The biggest area of concern moving on to the third quarter is input costs. And while our outage costs are going to be down $65 million quarter-over-quarter, we can easily see that gets chewed up -- all of it gets chewed up by input costs and the biggest headwind we have on the input cost side is OCC. That could end up accounting for almost half of the input cost increases and we can see on the horizon -- the quarter is not over yet but we can see on the horizon as we look out to the third quarter. So I will just stop right there and turn it back to Glenn and we'll take your questions."

As I said, I'd like to stop here for a moment and provide all of you with an update on our offer to buy Temple-Inland. Then as I said, if we have time, we'd take a couple of questions. And I'd say first is as we said from the start of this process",418,"Thanks. As I said, I'd like to stop here for a moment and provide all of you with an update on our offer to buy Temple-Inland. Then as I said, if we have time, we'd take a couple of questions. And I'd say first is as we said from the start of this process, we're very committed to see this transaction through to completion. We believe the industrial logic of the combination is solid and I don't think there's any debate there. We haven't heard from anybody. It makes a very good business for IP. They're an Industrial Packaging business, an excellent one and it creates a powerful cash flow engine that will continue to drive free cash flow and ROI improvement in International Paper. It strengthens our portfolio and it's consistent with the objective of our transformation plan, which is focusing on solid cost of capital returns in all of our businesses throughout the cycle. Importantly, it's meaningful, accretive to IP as synergies are realized and that is an acquisition requirement. As far as the price goes, we believe we have a very strong offer on the table, which deserves serious consideration. We believe our offer is highly compelling on a present value basis and reflects the future outlook for Temple for both Containerboard and for building products, and has a reasonable split of expected synergies. $30.60 a share in all cash, it represents almost a 20% premium of Temple's all-time high and a 46% premium to their prior day close. And it's also priced significantly above their 52-week high. So as all of you know, we've attempted to engage Temple in negotiations. We told them that in a negotiated process, with us having an opportunity to solicit due diligence would lead to the best value. We strongly prefer to negotiate directly with Temple but we are prepared to let Temple shun as aside, the compelling nature of our offer. On the regulatory side, just one update that we posted yesterday. As expected, since we expected this, we received the second request from the Justice Department yesterday. We've been working with them over several weeks to help them understand the economic benefits of this transaction. And of course, we'll be continuing to cooperate with the Justice Department in their process and expect to be able to address any questions they have quite promptly. So with that, I would be happy to take a couple of questions if we have some time on Temple, if you have any."

So let me just start off talking about the second quarter. International Paper had a very strong second quarter in a recovering but obviously not fully-recovered economic environment here in North America. Our results were driven by a couple of things: a balanced segment and global portfolio of businesses around the world; very strong contributions from Printing Papers in North America, Coated Paperboard in North America and the Ilim Joint Venture; really outstanding operations and cost management that's continuing; good maintenance outage execution during the quarter; some seasonal improvement in demand and we offset significant input costs escalation that Tim will talk about. 
This next chart here just shows you the segment and global portfolio balance. It's part of International Paper's business platform today. As you can see on the left, the good balance in terms of where the earnings came from by segment and on the right, good balance in terms of where the earnings came from by geography. 
Turning to the financial snapshot page, strong revenue growth of revenues, up 8%. EBITDA, over $900 million in the quarter, up 16% from the second quarter of last year, a run rate of $3.6 billion. Our free cash flow, amazingly, exactly equal to the first quarter but I would say that, that also has $40 million of additional capital spending in the second quarter. So our free cash flow is actually up around 10%, if you normalize for capital spending during the quarter. 
Really, if you look at this next slide here, which is the EPS over the last, really, 10 years, you can see there's a step change in our EPS performance. That is the result of the transformation plan. The 2009 period you're looking at there is the global recession, that is now in the rearview mirror. But importantly, our earnings over the last 4 or 5 quarters are not from land sales as they were in the prior years. So they were really operating earnings from our businesses and as you can see, we've achieved some of the step change in terms of the capability of International Paper to generate earnings and free cash flow. We think there's more left on the runway as we go forward. In terms of return on capital, 8% return -- over an 8% return on capital over the last 4 quarters into the cost of capital zone, which is important in terms of one of our key metrics. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to summarize the quarter."
61036,136828592,147992,"International Paper Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. As John said, we did have very strong performance in the second quarter. Volume contributed $0.08 to the change in results from the first quarter. And I would say that while volume here in North America is reall",1132,"Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. As John said, we did have very strong performance in the second quarter. Volume contributed $0.08 to the change in results from the first quarter. And I would say that while volume here in North America is really moving sideways, and we'll talk about that a little bit in more detail as we go through the slide deck. In other parts of the world, we're continuing to see growth, whether it's Russia or various parts of Asia. So volume, price, strong operations and a great results from Ilim, more than offset the heavy maintenance outage schedule, the heaviest for the year in the second quarter and the impact of the Vicksburg's flood, which cost us about $20 million. Input costs were up in the quarter, $31 million, in line with expectations, about 75% of that in North America and 25% in Europe, which has been kind of a theme to this year and it's really fiber and energy costs in Europe. All of the businesses, industrial and consumer packaging and printing papers, also higher costs.
So let me turn to the segments now, I'll start with Printing Papers. And Printing Papers, I thought, just had an excellent quarter. We've got a business in North America for the first half. It's running at a 14% of return on investment. EMEA, first half running at a 17% in ROI. But in the quarter, pricing was up across all regions. Operations were really outstanding, big improvement over the first quarter in all regions but especially strong in North America and really good cost management. We did have the IR outages that I mentioned that was mainly in Europe and Brazil, and we had really good execution around all of those. We did have one issue at the Svetogorsk mill in Russia, where we found some things that required us to take a little bit more time and spend a little bit more money, probably cost us about $7 million in the quarter. 
Let me turn to Industrial Packaging now. And I thought, Industrial Packaging, again, had a good quarter, still running at a 9% return on investment. Box price was mostly flat, down about $5 quarter-on-quarter. Volume was seasonally stronger, up about 170,000 tons, but not as strong as we had expected and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a slide or 2. Operations were really good and again, good cost management out of the Industrial Packaging group. Outages, the heaviest quarter of the year but we had great execution across the outages, and we also had great execution around the Vicksburg mill. I think most of you know that we had to take the mill down for 49 days due to the flooding that was experienced on the Mississippi River. But the manufacturing team, the business did a great job protecting the mill. We had no damage to the mill at all. It's now back up and running, but we did lose about 80,000 tons of production during the quarter. 
If you look at margins for Industrial Packaging in North America, IP had the highest margins in the industry in the second quarter at 17.6%, again, in a heavy maintenance outage quarter and year-over-year, a solid increase, up 180 basis points. Let me come back and talk about demand for a moment. As I said, we see demand really moving sideways. And it feels kind of like what it should feel like in a 1% to 2% GDP environment. The second quarter for us is normally our strongest quarter of the year because of our exposure and weighting to agricultural packaging out on the West Coast. And we had a much lighter season in the west region around agricultural packaging than we expected, mainly due to weather. So what you've got on the chart here, if you look at the blue bars, those are total shipments. And then the gold bars, we've pulled out the western region to show what the rest of the country looked like from a demand standpoint. And as I mentioned, we were disproportionately impacted in the quarter relative to the industry because of our weightings. But just as a couple of examples, the strawberry season came late. So in the quarter, we were down almost 6% year-on-year. Cherries were hit by weather. I think there was damage from hail and storms, and so we saw the cherry production almost cut in half on the West Coast, then avocados were down as well. So it was a number of factors on the West Coast that really hit us hard in the quarter. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging, another great performance by Consumer Packaging. Stronger price, favorable ops, offset by outages and input costs but really solid performance across the businesses. Price and operations and cost management covered -- nearly covered $20 million in outages and another $9 million in input cost increases and continued to have really strong performance for coated paperboard in all the regions of the world, Europe, China and the U.S. And when you look at North American coated paperboard performance, for the first half, we've got a business that in the first half of 2011 has already earned more than in all of 2010 and the first half of this year is running at a 12% return on investment. 
Turning to the distribution business, xpedx saw only a slight improvement in earnings quarter-to-quarter, really due to pressures from fuel cost and transportation cost. We did see a bit of a bright spot in packaging, which is about 25% of xpedx's business, which posted a 9% growth rate quarter-on-quarter. 
The Ilim Joint Venture just had a great quarter. Again, we report on a one quarter lag but Ilim's earnings increased in the quarter from $44 million to $57 million. Volume was up, price was up and it was up both for pulp and containerboard. Operations ran well and just another very strong quarter turned in by the joint venture. 
So if you look at margins first half of this year versus the first half of last year, strong performance across all the businesses. Different sets of challenges, region by region, business by business. Different sets of opportunities but business management completely focused on margin management and delivering the earnings and cash flows that we need to across all of the businesses. And I think if you turn to the next slide and look at returns, that's what's really making the difference in terms of our return on investment over the past 4 quarters. We're now in that cost capital zone and have been across each of the last 4 quarters. 
So with that, I'll end my summary and turn it back over to John for an outlook on earnings."

I'd say, we got the right assets in the right places. We're managing aggressively and we're executing well. The seasonal demand in North America arrived as expected. But as Tim said, the demand is not robust in North America. Outside North America, demand is good. Latin America, China, Russia, in places like Turkey, where we have a big  presence in the corrugated packaging business, healthy demand. We've got some flow through on pricing during the quarter. Our input costs were not as we expected and OCC continues to move up as we look into the third quarter. And then Ilim delivered just a spectacular quarter. The Ilim accounted for 18% of our EPS during the quarter. 
So let me move on to the third quarter outlook. That would be Page 21 for those of you who are following along. The U.S. economy is growing at 1% to 2%. And from a demand standpoint, it feels like a 1% to 2% GDP economy. Export demand in containerboard is good but domestically, whether it's paper, coated paperboard, containerboard or xpedx, it feels like 1% to 2% GDP growth. Demand is not up, it's not down. I'd characterize it as moving sideways. Outside North America, as I said, demand is solid year-over-year and we think that will continue. The biggest area of concern as we move into the third quarter is input costs. And while our outage costs are going to be down $65 million quarter-over-quarter, we could easily see that gets chewed up, all of it gets chewed up by input costs and the biggest headwind we have on the input cost side is OCC. That could end up accounting for almost half of the input cost increases that we can see on the horizon. The quarter is not over yet, but we can see on the horizon as we look out to the third quarter. 
So I will just stop right there and turn it back to Glenn, and we'll take your questions."

Then as I said, if we have time, we'll take a couple of questions. 
And I'd say first is as we said from the start of this process, we're very committed to seeing this transaction through to completion. We believe the industrial logic of the combination is solid and I don't think there's any debate there. We haven't heard any from anybody. It makes a very good business for IP. They're an industrial packaging business, an excellent one, and it creates a powerful cash flow engine that will continue to drive free cash flow and ROI improvement in International Paper. It strengthens our portfolio and it's consistent with the objective of our transformation plan, which is focusing on solid cost of capital returns in all of our businesses throughout the cycle. 
Importantly, it's meaningful, accretive to IP synergies are realized and that is an acquisition requirement. As far as the price goes, we believe we have a very strong offer on the table, which deserves serious consideration. We believe our offer is highly compelling on a present-value basis and reflects the future outlet for Temple for both containerboard and for building products, and has a reasonable split of expected synergies. At $30.60 a share and all cash, it represents almost a 20% premium of Temple's all-time high, and a 46% premium to their prior day close, and it's also priced significantly above their 52-week high. As all of you know, we've attempted to engage Temple in negotiations. We told them that a negotiated process, with us having an opportunity to do due diligence would lead to the best value. We strongly prefer to negotiate at least directly with Temple, but we are prepared to let Temple shareowners decide the compelling nature of our offer. 
On the regulatory side, just one update that we posted yesterday. As expected, so we expected this, we received the second request from the Justice Department yesterday. We've been working with them for several weeks to help them understand the economic benefits of this transaction. And of course, we'll be continuing to cooperate with the Justice Department in their process and expect to be able to address any questions they have quite promptly. 
So with that, I would be happy to take a couple of questions if we have some time on Temple, and if you have any."

What we're going to do from here is, as we typically do, Tim and I will summarize the quarter and then we'll take questions on the quarter. Then, I'll make a couple of comments on the Temple acquisition proposal, and if we have time we'll take a couple of questions on that. So we'll do it in that order. 
So let me just start off talking about the second quarter. International Paper had a very strong second quarter in a recovering but obviously not fully-recovered economic environment here in North America. Our results were driven by a couple of things: a balanced segment and global portfolio of businesses around the world; very strong contributions from Printing Papers in North America, Coated Paperboard in North America and the Ilim Joint Venture; really outstanding operations and cost management that's continuing; good maintenance outage execution during the quarter; some seasonal improvement in demand and we offset significant input costs escalation that Tim will talk about. 
This next chart here just shows you the segment and global portfolio balance. It's part of International Paper's business platform today. As you can see on the left, the good balance in terms of where the earnings came from by segment and on the right, good balance in terms of where the earnings came from by geography. 
Turning to the financial snapshot page, strong revenue growth, revenues up 8%. EBITDA, over $900 million in the quarter, up 16% from the second quarter of last year, a run rate of $3.6 billion. Our free cash flow, amazingly, exactly equal to the first quarter but I would say that, that also has $40 million of additional capital spending in the second quarter. So our free cash flow is actually up around 10%, if you normalize for capital spending during the quarter. 
Really, if you look at this next slide here, which is the EPS over the last, really, 10 years, you can see there's a step change in our EPS performance. That’s just the result of the transformation plan. The 2009 period you're looking at there is the global recession, that is now in the rearview mirror. But importantly, our earnings over the last 4 or 5 quarters are not from land sales as they were in the prior years. So they were really operating earnings from our businesses and as you can see, we've achieved here on the step change in terms of the capability of International Paper to generate earnings and free cash flow and we think there's more left on the runway as we go forward. In terms of return on capital, 8% return -- over an 8% return on capital over the last 4 quarters into the cost of capital zone, which is important in terms of one of our key metrics. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to summarize the quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As John said, we did have very strong performance in the second quarter. Volume contributed $0.08 to the change in results from the first quarter. And I would say that while volume here in North America is reall",1130,"Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. As John said, we did have very strong performance in the second quarter. Volume contributed $0.08 to the change in results from the first quarter. And I would say that while volume here in North America is really moving sideways, and we'll talk about that a little bit in more detail as we go through the slide deck, in other parts of the world, we're continuing to see growth, whether it's Russia or various parts of Asia. So volume, price, strong operations and a great results from Ilim, more than offset the heavy maintenance outage schedule, the heaviest of the year in the second quarter and the impact of the Vicksburg's flood, which cost us about $20 million. Input costs were up in the quarter, $31 million, in line with expectations, about 75% of that in North America and 25% in Europe, which has been kind of a theme this year and it's really fiber and energy costs in Europe. All the businesses, industrial and consumer packaging and printing papers, also higher costs.
So let me turn to the segments now, I'll start with Printing Papers. And Printing Papers, I thought, just had an excellent quarter. We've got a business in North America for the first half. It's running at a 14% of return on investment. EMEA, first half running at a 17% ROI. But in the quarter, pricing was up across all regions. Operations were really outstanding, big improvement over the first quarter in all regions but especially strong in North America and really good cost management. We did have the IR outages that I mentioned that was mainly in Europe and Brazil, and we had really good execution around all of those. We did have one issue at the Svetogorsk mill in Russia, where we found some things that required us to take a little bit more time and spend a little bit more money, probably cost us about $7 million in the quarter. 
Let me turn to Industrial Packaging now. And I thought Industrial Packaging, again, had a good quarter, still running at a 9% return on investment. Box price was mostly flat, down about $5 quarter-on-quarter. Volume was seasonally stronger, up about 170,000 tons, but not as strong as we had expected and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a slide or 2. Operations were really good and again, good cost management out of the Industrial Packaging group. Outages, the heaviest quarter of the year but we had great execution across the outages, and we also had great execution around the Vicksburg mill. I think most of you know that we had to take the mill down for 49 days due to the flooding that was experienced on the Mississippi River. But the manufacturing team, the business did a great job protecting the mill. We had no damage to the mill at all. It's now back up and running, but we did lose about 80,000 tons of production during the quarter. 
If you look at margins for Industrial Packaging in North America, IP had the highest margins in the industry in the second quarter at 17.6%, again, in a heavy maintenance outage quarter and year-over-year, a solid increase, up 180 basis points. Let me come back and talk about demand for a moment. As I said, we see demand really moving sideways. And it feels kind of like what it should feel like in a 1% to 2% GDP environment. The second quarter for us is normally our strongest quarter of the year because of our exposure and weighting to agricultural packaging out on the West Coast. And we had a much lighter season in the west region around agricultural packaging than we expected, mainly due to weather. So what you've got on the chart here, if you look at the blue bars, those are total shipments. And then the gold bars, we've pulled out the western region to show what the rest of the country looked like from a demand standpoint. And as I mentioned, we were disproportionately impacted in the quarter relative to the industry because of our weightings. But just as a couple of examples, the strawberry season came late. So in the quarter, we were down almost 6% year-on-year. Cherries were hit by weather. I think there was damage from hail and storms, and so we saw the cherry production almost cut in half on the West Coast and avocados were down as well. So it was a number of factors on the West Coast that really hit us hard in the quarter. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging, another great performance by Consumer Packaging. Stronger price, favorable ops, offset by outages and input costs but really solid performance across the businesses. Price and operations and cost management covered -- nearly covered $20 million in outages and another $9 million in input cost increases and continued to have really strong performance for coated paperboard in all the regions of the world, Europe, China and the U.S. And when you look at North American coated paperboard performance, for the first half, we've got a business that in the first half of 2011 has already earned more than in all of 2010, in the first half of this year is running at a 12% return on investment. 
Turning to the distribution business, xpedx saw only a slight improvement in earnings quarter-to-quarter, really due to pressures from fuel costs and transportation costs. We did see a bit of a bright spot in packaging, which is about 25% of xpedx's business, which posted a 9% growth rate quarter-on-quarter. 
The Ilim Joint Venture just had a great quarter. Again, we report on a one quarter lag but Ilim's earnings increased in the quarter from $44 million to $57 million. Volume was up, price was up and it was up both for pulp and containerboard. Operations ran well and just another very strong quarter turned in by the joint venture. 
So if you look at margins the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, strong performance across all the businesses. Different sets of challenges, region by region, business by business. Different sets of opportunities but business management completely focused on margin management and delivering the earnings and cash flows that we need to across all of the businesses. And I think if you turn to the next slide and look at returns, that's what's really making the difference in terms of our return on investment over the past 4 quarters. We're now in that cost capital zone and have been across each of the last 4 quarters. 
So with that, I'll end my summary and turn it back over to John for an outlook on earnings."

Before I do that, let me just summarize the quarter quickly. I'd say we got the right assets in the right places. We're managing aggressively and we're executing well.

I'd say we got the right assets in the right places. We're managing aggressively and we're executing well. The seasonal demand in North America arrived as expected. But as Tim said, the demand is not robust in North America. Outside North America, demand is good. Latin America, China, Russia, in places like Turkey, where we have a big presence in the corrugated packaging business, healthy demand. We've got some flow through on pricing during the quarter. Our input costs were not as we expected and OCC continues to move up as we look into the third quarter. And then Ilim delivered just a spectacular quarter. The Ilim accounted for 18% of our EPS during the quarter. 
So let me move on to the third quarter outlook. That’s the Page 21 for those of you who following along. The U.S. economy is growing at 1% to 2%. And from a demand standpoint, it feels like a 1% to 2% GDP economy. Export demand in containerboard is good but domestically, whether it's paper, coated paperboard, containerboard or xpedx, it feels like 1% to 2% GDP growth. Demand is not up, it's not down. I'd characterize it as moving sideways. Outside North America, as I said, demand is solid year-over-year and we think that will continue. The biggest area of concern as we move into the third quarter is input costs. And while our outage costs are going to be down $65 million quarter-over-quarter, we could easily see that get chewed up, all of it gets chewed up by input costs and the biggest headwind we have on the input cost side is OCC. That could end up accounting for almost half of the input cost increases that we can see on the horizon. The quarter is not over yet, but we can see on the horizon as we look out to the third quarter. 
So I will just stop right there and turn it back to Glenn, and we'll take your questions."

But on balance, when you look at the macro numbers, exports from the U.S. are up, which is I think, something good.

So a material and sudden strength in the U.S. dollar would probably hurt our customer base. But if it -- it was also reflected in a weaker currency in some of these emerging markets, we’d get some help and we were getting hammered in Brazil on currency as the real continues to get very strong as a result of a weak U.S. dollar. So there's some offsets there.

Then as I said, if we have time, we'll take a couple of questions. 
And I'd say first is as we said from the start of this process, we're very committed to seeing this transaction through to completion. We believe the industrial logic of the combination is solid and I don't think there's any debate there. We haven't heard any from anybody. It makes a very good business at IP. They're our industrial packaging business, an excellent one, and it creates a powerful cash flow engine that will continue to drive free cash flow and ROI improvement in International Paper. It strengthens our portfolio and it's consistent with the objective of our transformation plan, which is focusing on solid cost of capital returns in all of our businesses throughout the cycle. 
Importantly, it's meaningful, accretive to IP shareowners that synergies are realized and that is an acquisition requirement. As far as the price goes, we believe we have a very strong offer on the table, which deserves serious consideration. We believe our offer is highly compelling on a present-value basis and reflects the future outlet for Temple for both containerboard and for building products, and has a reasonable split of expected synergies. At $30.60 a share in all cash, it represents almost a 20% premium of Temple's all-time high, and a 46% premium to their prior day close, and it's also priced significantly above their 52-week high. As all of you know, we've attempted to engage Temple in negotiations. We told them that a negotiated process, with us having an opportunity to [indiscernible] due diligence would lead to the best value. We strongly prefer to negotiate this directly with Temple, but we are prepared to let Temple shareowners decide the compelling nature of our offer. 
On the regulatory side, just one update that we posted yesterday. As expected, so we expected this, we received a second request from the Justice Department yesterday. We've been working with them for several weeks to help them understand the economic benefits of this transaction. And of course, we'll be continuing to cooperate with the Justice Department and their process and expect to be able to address any questions they have quite promptly. 
So with that, I would be happy to take a couple of questions if we have some time on Temple, and if any of you have any."

I think the $0.92 a share reflects the global balance of International Paper. Our focused businesses continue to produce strong earnings and free cash flow. Basically, it was a study volumes and a weak economic environment, stable pricing, outstanding operations, very strong contributions from our joint venture in Russia. We also set input cost escalation and achieved cost of capital returns. And if you think about our earnings, they are substantially up from the second quarter. And adjusting the third quarter 2010 for a land sale, they were up 11% relative to the third quarter last year. This next chart here shows the balance in the global portfolio. We had strong contributions from both our Paper and Packaging businesses, as you can see. 30% of our operating earnings are coming from the platforms we have had outside North America that have a lot of volume revenue and earnings growth. 
EBITDA margins roved improved across all our global manufacturing businesses, up strongly 300 basis points from where they were in 2010. And again, that just sets the stage for I think underscores International Paper's ability to perform in a challenging economic environment. So with that is just a brief introduction. I'll turn it over to Tim to go through the business"

Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, and I want to just start off by saying that we had, as John said, really strong results in the quarter and what's been a difficult environment. The third quarter of last year has been adjuste",1999,"Okay, and thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, and I want to just start off by saying that we had, as John said, really strong results in the quarter and what's been a difficult environment. The third quarter of last year has been adjusted for the landscape. You can see revenues up nearly 2% versus same time last year. The margins continued to remain very solid and cash has been strong, up from the second quarter and very close to the third quarter last year, even with $130 million more in capital investment in the third quarter of this year than last year. Cash balance grew from the end of last quarter this quarter by another $300 million. If you look at the second quarter versus third quarter earnings performance, a strong quarter in a tough environment, price and volume basically flat despite the weak backdrop. Volume was weaker earlier in the quarter and then showed some improvement as we move towards the end of the quarter. Operations continued to improve after a very strong performance in the second quarter. So the facilities are running extremely well at the moment. We did have a lighter maintenance outage schedule but we executed it extremely well. And the tax rate was slightly lower because of a couple of discrete items in the quarter that won't repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Just turning to our year-over-year performance, and I think this is a real story of improvement. If you take out the land sales from last year, $0.83 versus the $0.92 that John mentioned, price offset the softer volume, and really, as I mentioned on the operations, operations and cost management have completely offset the higher input costs that we faced year-over-year. Lower interest and taxes, along with another quarter of really strong results from Ilim added headroom. 
If you look at the next slide, I think what's even more impressive for the year-to-date results from continuing operations, a top line growth of 7%, EBIT growth up 56%, a doubling of EPS and a 50% improvement in cash provided by operations. And if you look at the cash balancing, again these numbers from last year have been adjusted for land sales about $1.2 billion in cash last year and up to 2.7, this year, 125% improvement. Of course, the building of cash in part because we are looking to bring cash to the Temple close. 
So all of that, what is meant is 5 quarters now of really strong improvement in terms of earnings, starting in the third quarter of last year. And we've put together 5 quarters that are really in the cost of capital zone and feel good about where we are as we go into the fourth quarter and 2012. 
So now, let me turn back to the quarter itself. Input costs, the increases have moderated. In most categories, we did see the exception in OCC during the quarter but in most other categories, chemicals energies, we saw smaller increases than we've seen in previous quarters and that was not only here in North America but in other parts of the world. But because of the OCC, nearly 2/3 of the increase in the quarter was felt in industrial packaging. 
So now, I'll turn to the segments and start with industrial packaging. Even with that increase posted another strong quarter with EBIT moving from 269 to 301 in the quarter. North American prices were relatively stable in the quarter. We did see a little bit of erosion in export Containerboard. Volume was down slightly, and I think it is a slight decrease and it is roughly split half in North America where we saw a slight decrease in box shipments and a slight decrease in domestic Containerboard shipments. And the other half was in Europe where the third quarter is seasonally a weaker quarter in Europe. we've seen a little bit of softness in the industrial segment, but fruit and vegetable continues to perform well. 
The third quarter's earnings were favorably impacted by the lower mill outage scheduled. But as I mentioned, we executed that very well and it was also impacted by the avoidance of the Vicksburg charge that we had in the second quarter although I would say that there are still some smaller residuals as supply-chain cost impacts as we try to recover from that downtime and get product back in the right places. And then as I mentioned, the OCC costs were up and that was about $14 million of the negative impact in input cost. So another quarter. IPG posted the highest margin in the industry again this quarter and it for the entire year as well as 8 out of the last 11 quarters. On a sequential basis, quarter-on-quarter, we added 200 basis points by executing well and taking advantage of the lighter maintenance schedule. And the spread between competition in the quarter was 280 basis points. That's the largest we've had in over 2 years. 
Turning to consumer. Consumer packaging had another very good quarter, a string of quarters that they're putting together now. On a steady volume, improved price realizations associated with the pass-through of previous announcements. Our operational performance was down slightly in the quarter but again off of a very strong second quarter so they continue to perform at the very high level. And this business also benefited from the lighter maintenance outage schedule. 
If you turn to the slides, to the next one , just to highlight where some of these operating performance is coming from, it's really being driven in significant part by outstanding manufacturing and supply-chain performance. You can see that this year, we've generated $30 million of cash cost savings. That's roughly $20 a ton in the manufacturing operations and it's coming from improved reliability and energy usage, a better uptime availability, and basically, just running a more consistent manufacturing operation. The supply chain improvement are really -- all the metrics are moving in the right direction, and as you can see on slide. And the result is we're generating nearly $1 million a month of savings. So the business is operating very well, the key levers in control. What that resulted in is business results that are continuing to be strong and consistent and in the cost of capital zone now for the last 5 quarters, And year-to-date the business has earned 75% more in the first 3 quarters of this year than in all of 2012. 
Additionally, Coated Paperboard. Our North American Coated Paperboard business is realizing the benefits on the commercial side from our Foodservice business. It's not the business that we highlight very often but just sharing some history here. If you look at the next slide, Foodservice basically makes paper cups and food containers. And the business source is roughly 100% of its board from the North American business. We saw a significant decrease in demand during the economic crisis, but this year, the business is on pace to return to prerecession volume levels. And it's doing it, really, on innovative products like the ecotainer and the Hold&Go hot beverage cup. So with those products, margins are up. Year-to-date, margins are up 250 basis points from the low of 2008, it's up 60 basis points year-over-year, and now higher than what we had before the economic crisis. 
Printing papers, a great quarter. We had exceptionally good quarter in North America. Our operations in Europe were basically flat quarter-on-quarter. Brazil was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, mostly because of seasonality and how the seasons slow in those 2 businesses. North America really lifted results by posting strong manufacturing operations. 
Now turning to xpedx. And while the year-over-year revenue is down, clearly, we saw xpedx bounced back in the quarter, nearly doubling its earnings on a seasonal demand lift and good volumes around printing and packaging quarter-on-quarter. 
And if you look at the next slide, you'll see really we are getting some help from the market but we're also seeing the beginnings of the benefits from the strategy implementation that Mary took you through a quarter or so ago. Average daily in shipping rates on printing paper were up 8% on strong seasonal rebound in the publishing grades. We've also been managing our costs effectively and have good realization of estimate cost and headcount reductions with headcount being down 7% year-to-date. So we think the strategy is starting to take hold. And as we promised, Mary will be back at the end of the fourth quarter to update you on the strategy and how the implementation is going. 
Now turning to Ilim. Another strong quarter from the Ilim joint venture. And just as a reminder, it's their second quarter, our third quarter as we continue to report on the lag. So in their second quarter, prices were higher for both pulp and Containerboard. We did see lower volumes and we had higher outage costs than input costs in the quarter. We did receive another dividend in the quarter. It's our second dividend from the joint venture this year and it brings our total cumulative dividends to $234 million since the beginnings of the joint venture. So we've roughly recovered a little bit more than 1/3 of the original investment through dividends. One item that I would note about what will be our fourth quarter, the joint venture's third quarter, we did see a significant weakening in the quarter of the ruble. And because the joint venture has dollar denominated debt, it had to mark that to market. So we will see about a $50 million charge in their third quarter, our fourth quarter reported. It's a non-cash charge and we really like the movement in the ruble as it weakens because it makes the business more competitive and enhances margins over time. 
Just an update on capital expansion. A couple of pictures here. One from the Bratsk mill where we are putting in the new pulp line and see the digester coming out of the ground there. And right now, we are still on track for a start up in 2012. Again, as a reminder, this is about a $700 million project and its projected return at about 20%. The other picture you see is from the mill and it's for uncoated freesheet capacity. Although, we will also have an opportunity to become the first producer of Coated Paper in Russia by putting, installing a coder at the end of the line. This also is scheduled for 2012 start up. And again, nearly $300 million in capital being invested with the greater than 20% return. So we've talked about this for a few quarters now. I thought it would be interesting for people to seek that their structure coming out of the ground at this point. 
So just summarizing our third quarter, I think John covered this is at the beginning but we do feel very good about a very strong quarter in the third quarter. The global balance is paying off and will continue to pay off as we go through the balance of this year and into next year. Volumes pricing steady. We continued to operate our facilities extremely well and manage costs tightly. The strong contribution from Illm the I mentioned will decrease in the fourth quarter because of the non-cash currency charge. But in terms of their operating performance, they continued to operate very well. So again, 5 quarters now in the cost of capital zone and feel good about where we are even though our inputs are up, we are managing so far to offset them in the cost management and operating capabilities. 
And if you look at the last slide, just showing you ROI. So far year-to-date we are at 8%. In the quarter, we are actually over 9%. So we feel very good about posting a cost of capital results for 2011. With that, I'll turn it back over to John for the outlook."

What this says, as we look at it is volume is going to be seasonally slower. It always is as we get into the fourth quarter. We've got more maintenance outages. More the same in terms of the overall economic environment. Pricing looks to be stable with the exception of lower pulp prices which have been occurring over the last several quarters. As Jim said, we have the currency hit, $55 million, 12% weakening of ruble. We are also going to start incur some start up costs as we get ready to complete the project and frankly, Virginia convert that bill into a pulp line. But I think, more importantly, looking beyond the normal seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, I'm quite very positive that International Paper going into 2012 for a number of reasons. We've got India which Tom Kadien we'll talk about in a minute. That's coming online. We've got major investments in Russia that Tim talked about it remember those are being financed off the Ilim balance sheet, not by International Paper but by the joint venture that will begin to contribute to results towards the end of next year. And we've got the importantly, Temple coming later this year come early next year which will significantly country be to our ability to further take costs out of our important North American Industrial Packaging business. So all in, well, the fourth quarter is going to be the usual kind of fourth quarter and the economic environment is more or less the same. We're very positive that International Paper as we end this year and go into next year. Tom Kadien, do you want to give an update in India?"

And on regulatory capital, we got some of that coming down the pipe with so. We are going to force -- there's going to continue to be capital less and we're going to skew the capital to where we think the strategic investment is going to be made but we'll keep our North American, the right assets in North America competitive and modern, and I think we've been able to do that with this $1 billion spending over the last couple of years and going forward for the next couple on average. With Temple, we have little more capital spending. so we'll be updating you on kind of the next 5 years how you should think about CapEx relative to depreciation, but in some places of the world, it will be a lot higher, in some places of the world, it will be a lot lower.

Basically, it was steady volumes and a weak economic environment, stable pricing, outstanding operations, very strong contributions from our joint venture in Russia. We also set input cost escalation and achieved costs of capital returns. And if you think about our earnings, they're substantially up from the second quarter. And adjusting the third quarter 2010 for a land sale, they were up 11% relative to the third quarter of last year. This next chart here just shows what I mean about balance in the global portfolio. We had strong contributions from both our Paper and Packaging businesses. And as you can see, 30% of our operating earnings are coming from the platforms we have outside North America that have a lot of volume revenue and earnings growth in them. 
EBITDA margins improved across all our global manufacturing businesses, up strongly 300 basis points from where they were in 2010. And again, that just sets the stage for -- I think underscores International Paper's ability to perform in a challenging economic environment. So with that, it's just a brief introduction. I'll turn it over to Tim to go through the business"
61036,141075323,179174,"International Paper Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, and I wanted to start out by saying that we had, as John said, really strong results in the quarter and what's been a difficult environment. The third quarter of last year has been adjusted f",1989,"Okay. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, and I wanted to start out by saying that we had, as John said, really strong results in the quarter and what's been a difficult environment. The third quarter of last year has been adjusted for the land sale. You can see revenue is up nearly 2% versus same time last year. Margins continue to remain very solid and cash has been strong, up from the second quarter and very close to the third quarter last year, even with $130 million more in capital investment in the third quarter of this year than last year. Cash balance grew from the end of last quarter this quarter by another $300 million. If you look at the second quarter versus third quarter earnings performance, a strong quarter in a tough environment, price and volume basically flat despite the weak backdrop. Volume was weaker earlier in the quarter and then showed some improvement as we moved toward the end of the quarter. Operations continued to improve after a very strong performance in the second quarter, so the facilities are running extremely well at the moment. We did have a lighter maintenance outage schedule but we executed it extremely well. And the tax rate was slightly lower because of a couple of discrete items in the quarter that won't repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Just turning to our year-over-year performance, and I think this is a real story of improvement. If you take out the land sales from last year, $0.83 versus the $0.92 that John mentioned, price offset softer volume. And really, as I mentioned on the operations, operations and cost management have completely offset the higher input costs that we faced year-over-year. Lower interest and taxes, along with another quarter of really strong results from Ilim added headroom. 
If you look at the next slide, I think what's even more impressive are the year-to-date results from continuing operations: Top line growth of 7%, EBIT growth up 56%, a doubling of EPS and a 50% improvement in cash provided by operations. And if you look at the cash balancing, again, these numbers from last year have been adjusted for land sales, about $1.2 billion in cash last year and up to $2.7 billion this year, 125% improvement. Of course, the building of cash, in part, because we're looking to bring cash to the Temple close. 
So all of that, what it's meant is 5 quarters now of really strong improvement in terms of earnings, starting in the third quarter of last year. And we've put together 5 quarters that are really in the cost of capital zone and feel good about where we are as we go into the fourth quarter and 2012. 
So now let me turn back to the quarter itself. Input costs, the increases have moderated. In most categories, we did see the exception in OCC during the quarter, but in most other categories, chemicals or energies, we saw smaller increases than we've seen in previous quarters and that was not only here in North America but in other parts of the world. But because of the OCC, nearly 2/3 of the increase in the quarter was felt in Industrial Packaging. 
So now, I'll turn to the segments and start with Industrial Packaging. Even with that increase, it posted another strong quarter with EBIT moving from $269 million to $301 million in the quarter. North American prices were relatively stable in the quarter. We did see a little bit of erosion in export Containerboard. Volume was down slightly, and I think it is a slight decrease, and it was roughly split half in North America where we saw a slight decrease in box shipments and a slight decrease in domestic Containerboard shipments. And the other half was in Europe where the third quarter is seasonally a weaker quarter in Europe. we've seen a little bit of softness in the industrial segment, but fruit and vegetable continues to perform well. 
The third quarter's earnings were favorably impacted by the lower mill outage scheduled. But as I mentioned, we executed that very well. And it was also impacted by the avoidance of the Vicksburg charge that we had in the second quarter, although I would say that there's still some small residual supply-chain cost impacts as we tried to recover from that downtime and get product back in the right places. And then as I mentioned, the OCC costs were up, and that was about $14 million of the negative impact in input costs. So another quarter, IPG posted the highest margin in the industry again this quarter and it has for the entire year, as well as 8 out of the last 11 quarters. On a sequential basis, quarter-on-quarter, we added 200 basis points by executing well and taking advantage of the lighter maintenance schedule, and the spread between competition in the quarter was 280 basis points. That's the largest we've had in over 2 years. 
Turning to consumer. Consumer packaging had another very good quarter, a string of quarters that they're putting together now. On steady volume, improved price realizations associated with the pass-through of previous announcements. Operational performance was down slightly in the quarter, but again, off of a very strong second quarter so they continue to perform at a very high level. And this business also benefited from the lighter maintenance outage schedule. 
If you turn the slide to the next one , just to highlight where some of this operating performance is coming from, it's really being driven in significant part by outstanding manufacturing and supply-chain performance. You can see that this year, we've generated $30 million of cash cost savings. That's roughly $20 a ton in the manufacturing operations and it's coming from improved reliability and energy usage, better uptime availability, and basically, just running a more consistent manufacturing operations. The supply chain improvements are really -- all the metrics are moving in the right direction as you can see on the slide. And the result is we're generating nearly $1 million a month of savings. So the business is operating very well, the key levers it can control. What that's resulted in is business results that are continuing to be strong and consistent, and in the cost of capital zone now for the last 5 quarters. And year-to-date the business has earned 75% more in the first 3 quarters of this year than in all of 2012. 
Additionally, our North American Coated Paperboard business is realizing the benefits on the commercial side from our Foodservice business. It's not the business that we highlight very often, but just sharing some history here, if you look at the next slide, Foodservice basically makes paper cups and food containers. And the business source is roughly 100% of its board from the North American business. We saw a significant decrease in demand during the economic crisis, but this year, the business is on pace to return to prerecession volume levels. And it's doing it, really, on innovative products like the ecotainer and the Hold&Go hot beverage cup. So with those products, margins are up. Year-to-date, margins are up 250 basis points from the low of 2008, it's up 60 basis points year-over-year, and now higher than what we had before the economic crisis. 
Printing papers, a great quarter. We had exceptionally good quarter in North America. Our operations in Europe were basically flat quarter-on-quarter. Brazil was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, mostly because of seasonality and how the seasons slow in those 2 businesses. North America really lifted results by posting strong manufacturing operations. 
Now turn to xpedx. And while the year-over-year revenue is down, clearly, we saw xpedx bounce back in the quarter, nearly doubling its earnings on a seasonal demand lift and good volumes around printing and packaging quarter-on-quarter. 
And if you look at the next slide, you'll see really we are getting some help from the market, but we're also seeing the beginnings of the benefits from the strategy implementation that Mary took you through a quarter or so ago. Average daily in shipping rates on printing were up 8% on strong seasonal rebound in the publishing grades. We've also been managing our costs effectively and have good realization of S&A costs and headcount reductions, with headcount being down 7% year-to-date. So we think the strategy is starting to take hold. And as we promised, Mary will be back at the end of the fourth quarter to update you on the strategy and how the implementation is going. 
Now turning to Ilim. Another strong quarter from the Ilim joint venture. And just as a reminder, it's their second quarter, our third quarter as we continue to report on the lag. So in their second quarter, prices were higher for both pulp and Containerboard. We did see lower volumes and we had higher outage costs than input costs in the quarter. We did receive another dividend in the quarter. It's our second dividend from the joint venture this year, and it brings our total cumulative dividends to $234 million since the beginnings of the joint venture. So we've roughly recovered a little bit more than 1/3 of the original investment through dividends. One item that I would note about what will be our fourth quarter, the joint venture's third quarter, we did see a significant weakening in the quarter of the ruble. And because the joint venture has dollar denominated debt, it had to mark that to market. And so we'll see about a $50 million charge in their third quarter, our fourth quarter reported. It's a non-cash charge and we really like the movement in the ruble as it weakens because it makes the business more competitive and enhances margins over time. 
Just an update on capital expansion. A couple of pictures here. One from the Bratsk Mill where we're putting in the new pulp line, and see the digester coming out of the ground there. And right now, we're still on track for a startup in 2012. Again, as a reminder, this is about a $700 million project, so its projected return is above 20%. The other picture you see is from the Koryazhma Mill and it's for uncoated freesheet capacity. Although we will also have an opportunity to become the first producer of coated paper in Russia by putting, installing a coder at the end of the line. This also is scheduled for 2012 startup. And again, nearly $300 million in capital being invested with a greater than 20% return. So we've talked about this for a few quarters now. I thought it'd be interesting for people to see that there's structure coming out of the ground at this point. 
So just summarizing third quarter, I think John covered this is at the beginning, but we do feel very good about a very strong quarter in the third quarter. The global balance is paying off and will continue to pay off as we go through the balance of this year and into next year. Volumes pricing steady, we continue to operate our facilities extremely well and manage costs tightly. The strong contribution from Ilim that I mentioned will decrease in the fourth quarter because of the non-cash currency charge, but in terms of their operating performance, they continue to operate very well. So again, 5 quarters now in the cost of capital zone and we feel good about where we are. Even though inputs are up, we're managing so far to offset them in like our cost management and operating capabilities. 
And if you look at the last slide, just showing you ROI. So far year-to-date we are at 8%. In the quarter, we are actually over 9%. So we feel very good about posting a cost of capital results for 2011. With that, I'll turn it back over to John for the outlook."

The fourth quarter outlook, and what this says when you look at it is volume is going to be seasonally slower. It always is as we get into the fourth quarter. We've got more maintenance outages. More of the same in terms of the overall economic environment. Pricing looks to be stable with the exception of lower pulp prices, which had been occurring over the last several quarters. As Tim said, we've got the currency hit of $55 million because of the 12% weakening of the ruble. We're also going to start incur some start up costs as we get ready to complete the project in Franklin, Virginia, which is going to convert that mill into a pulp line. But I think, more importantly, looking beyond the normal seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, I'm very positive that International Paper going into 2012 for a number of reasons. We've got India, which Tom Kadien we'll talk about in a minute. That is coming online. We've got major investments in Russia that Tim talked about. And remember, those are being financed off the Ilim balance sheet, not by International Paper but by the joint venture that will begin to contribute to results toward the end of next year. And we've got the, importantly, Temple coming on late this year early next year, which is going to significantly contribute to our ability to further take costs out of our important North American Industrial Packaging business. So all in, well the fourth quarter is going to be the usual kind of fourth quarter, and the economic environment is more the same. We're very positive at thinking about International Paper as we end this year and go into next year. So Tom Kadien, do you want to give everybody an update in India?"

We have integration plans that are at full tilt right now in finance and capital buildout plans, manufacturing excellence, as well as IT, forestry, environment health, safety and compliance. And their most recent quarter, or last quarter, APPM had a good quarter. Revenue is growing 10%, and as we look forward to '12, we think we're looking for double-digit increases in tons, earnings, and we feel like we've got a lot of runway in front of us. Some of you have asked Glenn about the dispute, I guess, over the non-compete fee and $25 million that's held in escrow right now. There is a date set of November 16 with the Securities Appellate Tribunal that'll make that decision. And again, our advisors think that we are on strong ground and it'll go in our favor. That said, in India, nothing happens quite as scheduled. So we're hoping it comes off on November 16. And then I guess the last thing, we're still evaluating when we're going to report out on results and how we can sync that up. And you'll hear more about that on future calls."

Before we open up to your questions, I'd just like to make a couple of comments on the people moves we announced this week. We have a very strong and capable management team at International Paper. And I think our results over the last several years, going through the Transformation Plan, coming out of it, managing through the downturn and now the slow recovery demonstrates that. These moves are really the result of a lot of discussion, a lot of thought on my part, and making them now gets us ready for 2012 and beyond. So I've got absolute confidence that going forward, what you're going to see from International Paper is IP-style execution and IP-style results.

Relative to exports, the export market has got a combination of 2 things going on. In the export market, there has been some slowdown in boxed demand in some of these markets. That's combined with the pipe for exports. It's kind of along pipe, so orders get placed and it takes 2, 3 months for them to get there. So that, combined with some extra supply that's hitting those markets, has caused a little deterioration in pricing, but I think that's just a temporary supply chain activity and I don't see any real decline in demand in the export markets through time."

Russia is a great example of being able to do that aggressively on -- not on IP's balance sheet, but on the joint ventures because you've got that capacity. India, we're going to need to get in there and figure out how to grow with the market, both in paper and packaging. And we're going to continue to spend only on cost reduction in North America. And on regulatory capital, we've got some of that coming down the pipe with Willamette. So we are going to force -- there's going to continue to be capitalizing in IP and we're going to skew the capital to where we think the strategic investment's ought to be made, but we'll keep our North American -- the right assets in North America competitive and modern, and I think we've been able to do that with this $1 billion spending over the last couple of years and going forward for the next couple on average. With Temple, we've got a little more capital spending, so we'll be updating you on kind of the next 5 years how you should think about CapEx relative to depreciation.

It was -- third quarter, rather, quite strong relative to where it had been.

I think the $0.92 a share reflects the global balance of International Paper. Our focus businesses continue to produce strong earnings and free cash flow. Basically, it was steady volumes and a weak economic environment, stable pricing, outstanding operations, very strong contributions from our joint venture in Russia. We also set input cost escalation and achieved costs of capital returns. And if you think about our earnings, they're substantially up from the second quarter. And adjusting the third quarter 2010 for a land sale, they were up 11% relative to the third quarter of last year. This next chart here just shows what I mean about balance in the global portfolio. We had strong contributions from both our Paper and Packaging businesses. And as you can see, 30% of our operating earnings are coming from the platforms we have outside North America that have a lot of volume revenue and earnings growth in them. 
EBITDA margins improved across all of our global manufacturing businesses, up strongly 300 basis points from where they were in 2010. And again, that just sets the stage for -- I think underscores International Paper's ability to perform in a challenging economic environment. So with that, it's just a brief introduction. I'll turn it over to Tim to go through the businesses."
61036,141075323,179464,"International Paper Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, and I wanted to start out by saying that we had, as John said, really strong results in the quarter in what's been a difficult environment. The third quarter of last year has been adjusted fo",1987,"Okay. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, and I wanted to start out by saying that we had, as John said, really strong results in the quarter in what's been a difficult environment. The third quarter of last year has been adjusted for the land sale. You can see revenue is up nearly 2% versus same time last year. Margins continue to remain very solid and cash has been strong, up from the second quarter and very close to the third quarter of last year, even with $130 million more in capital investment in the third quarter of this year than last year. Cash balance grew from the end of last quarter this quarter by another $300 million. If you look at the second quarter versus third quarter earnings performance, a strong quarter in a tough environment, price and volume basically flat despite the weak backdrop. Volume was weaker earlier in the quarter and then showed some improvement as we moved toward the end of the quarter. Operations continued to improve after a very strong performance in the second quarter, so the facilities are running extremely well at the moment. We did have a lighter maintenance outage schedule but we executed it extremely well. And the tax rate was slightly lower because of a couple of discrete items in the quarter that won't repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Just turning to our year-over-year performance, and I think this is a real story of improvement. If you take out the land sales from last year, $0.83 versus the $0.92 that John mentioned, price offset softer volume. And really, as I mentioned on the operations, operations and cost management have completely offset the higher input costs that we faced year-over-year. Lower interest and taxes, along with another quarter of really strong results from Ilim added headroom. 
If you look at the next slide, I think what's even more impressive are the year-to-date results from continuing operations: top line growth of 7%, EBIT  growth up 56%, a doubling of EPS and a 50% improvement in cash provided by operations. And if you look at the cash balancing, again, these numbers from last year have been adjusted for land sales, but $1.2 billion in cash last year and up to $2.7 billion this year, 125% improvement. Of course, the building of cash, in part, because we're looking to bring cash to the Temple close. 
So all of that, what it's meant is 5 quarters now of really strong improvement in terms of earnings, starting in the third quarter of last year. And we've put together 5 quarters that are really in the cost of capital zone and feel good about where we are as we go into the fourth quarter and 2012. 
So now let me turn back to the quarter itself. Input costs, the increases have moderated. In most categories, we did see the exception in OCC during the quarter, but in most other categories, chemicals or energies, we saw smaller increases than we've seen in previous quarters and that was not only here in North America but in other parts of the world. But because of the OCC, nearly 2/3 of the increase in the quarter was felt in Industrial Packaging. 
So now, I'll turn to the segments and start with Industrial Packaging. Even with that increase, it posted another strong quarter with EBIT  moving from $269 million to $301 million in the quarter. North American prices were relatively stable in the quarter. We did see a little bit of erosion in export Containerboard. Volume was down slightly, and I think it is a slight decrease, and it was roughly split half in North America where we saw a slight decrease in box shipments and a slight decrease in domestic Containerboard shipments. And the other half was in Europe where the third quarter is seasonally a weaker quarter in Europe. we've seen a little bit of softness in the Industrial segment, but fruit and vegetable continues to perform well. 
The third quarter's earnings were favorably impacted by the lower mill outage scheduled. But as I mentioned, we executed that very well. And it was also impacted by the avoidance of the Vicksburg  charge that we had in the second quarter, although I would say that there's still some small residual supply-chain cost impacts as we tried to recover from that downtime and get product back in the right places. And then as I mentioned, the OCC costs were up, and that was about $14 million of the negative impact in input costs. So another quarter, IPG  posted the highest margin in the industry again this quarter, and it has for the entire year, as well as 8 out of the last 11 quarters. On a sequential basis, quarter-on-quarter, we added 200 basis points by executing well and taking advantage of the lighter maintenance schedule, and the spread between competition in the quarter was 280 basis points. That's the largest we've had in over 2 years. 
Turning to Consumer. Consumer Packaging had another very good quarter, a string of quarters that they're putting together now. On steady volume, improved price realizations associated with the pass-through of previous announcements. Operational performance was down slightly in the quarter, but again, off of a very strong second quarter, so they continue to perform at a very high level. And this business also benefited from the lighter maintenance outage schedule. 
If you turn the slide to the next one, just to highlight where some of this operating performance is coming from, it's really being driven in significant part by outstanding manufacturing and supply-chain performance. You can see that this year, we've generated $30 million of cash cost savings. That's roughly $20 a ton in the manufacturing operations, and it's coming from improved reliability and energy usage, better uptime availability, and basically, just running a more consistent manufacturing operation. The supply chain improvements are really -- all the metrics are moving in the right direction as you can see on the slide. And the result is we're generating nearly $1 million a month of savings. So the business is operating very well, the key levers that it can control. What that's resulted in is business results that are continuing to be strong and consistent, and in the cost of capital zone now for the last 5 quarters. And year-to-date the business has earned 75% more in the first 3 quarters of this year than in all of 2012. 
Additionally, our North American Coated Paperboard business is realizing the benefits on the commercial side from our Foodservice business. It's not a business that we highlight very often, but just sharing some history here, if you look at the next slide, Foodservice basically makes paper cups and food containers. And the business sources roughly 100% of its board from the North American business. We saw a significant decrease in demand during the economic crisis, but this year, the business is on pace to return to prerecession volume levels. And it's doing it, really, on innovative products like the ecotainer and the Hold&Go hot beverage cup. So with those products, margins are up. Year-to-date, margins are up 250 basis points from the low of 2008, it's up 60 basis points year-over-year, and now higher than what we had before the economic crisis. 
Printing papers, a great quarter. We had exceptionally good quarter in North America. Our operations in Europe were basically flat quarter-on-quarter. Brazil was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, mostly because of seasonality and how the seasons slow in those 2 businesses. North America really lifted results by posting strong manufacturing operations. 
Now turn to xpedx. And while year-over-year revenue is down, clearly, we saw xpedx bounce back in the quarter, nearly doubling its earnings on a seasonal demand lift and good volumes around printing and packaging quarter-on-quarter. 
And if you look at the next slide, you'll see really we are getting some help from the market, but we're also seeing the beginnings of the benefits from the strategy implementation that Mary took you through a quarter or so ago. Average daily in shipping rates on printing were up 8% on strong seasonal rebound in the publishing grades. We've also been managing our costs effectively and have good realization of S&A costs and headcount reductions, with headcount being down 7% year-to-date. So we think the strategy is starting to take hold. And as we promised, Mary will be back at the end of the fourth quarter to update you on the strategy and how the implementation is going. 
Now turning to Ilim. Another strong quarter from the Ilim Joint Venture. And just as a reminder, it's their second quarter, our third quarter as we continue to report on the lag. So in their second quarter, prices were higher for both pulp and Containerboard. We did see lower volumes and we had higher outage costs than input costs in the quarter. We did receive another dividend in the quarter. It's our second dividend from the joint venture this year, and it brings our total cumulative dividends to $234 million since the beginnings of the joint venture. So we've roughly recovered a little bit more than 1/3 of the original investment through dividends. One item that I would note about what will be our fourth quarter, the joint venture's  third quarter, we did see a significant weakening in the quarter of the ruble. And because the joint venture has dollar denominated debt, it had to mark that to market. And so we'll see about a $50 million charge in their third quarter, our fourth quarter reported. It's a non-cash charge and we really like the movement in the ruble as it weakens because it makes the business more competitive and enhances margins over time. 
Just an update on capital expansion. A couple of pictures here. One from the Bratsk Mill where we're putting in the new pulp line, and see the digester coming out of the ground there. And right now, we're still on track for a startup in 2012. Again, as a reminder, this is about a $700 million project, so its projected return is above 20%. The other picture you see is from the Koryazhma Mill and it's for uncoated freesheet capacity. Although we will also have an opportunity to become the first producer of coated paper in Russia by putting, installing a coder at the end of the line. This also is scheduled for 2012 startup. And again, nearly $300 million in capital being invested with a greater than 20% return. So we've talked about this for a few quarters now. I thought it'd be interesting for people to see that there's structure coming out of the ground at this point. 
So just summarizing third quarter, I think John covered this is at the beginning, but we do feel very good about a very strong quarter in the third quarter. The global balance is paying off and will continue to pay off as we go through the balance of this year and into next year. Volumes pricing steady, we continue to operate our facilities extremely well and manage costs tightly. The strong contribution from Ilim that I mentioned will decrease in the fourth quarter because of the non-cash currency charge, but in terms of their operating performance, they continue to operate very well. So again, 5 quarters now in the cost of capital zone and we feel good about where we are. Even though inputs are up, we're managing so far to offset them with our cost management and operating capabilities. 
And if you look at the last slide, just showing you ROI. So far year-to-date we are at 8%. In the quarter, we are actually over 9%. So we feel very good about posting a cost of capital results for 2011. With that, I'll turn it back over to John for the outlook."

The fourth quarter outlook, and what this says when you look at it is volume is going to be seasonally slower. It always is as we get into the fourth quarter. We've got more maintenance outages. More of the same in terms of the overall economic environment. Pricing looks to be stable with the exception of lower pulp prices, which had been occurring over the last several quarters. As Tim said, we've got the currency hit of $55 million because of the 12% weakening of the ruble. We're also going to start incur some start up costs as we get ready to complete the project in Franklin, Virginia, which is going to convert that mill into a pulp line. But I think, more importantly, looking beyond the normal seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, I'm very positive that International Paper going into 2012 for a number of reasons. We've got India, which Tom Kadien we'll talk about in a minute. That is coming online. We've got major investments in Russia that Tim talked about. And remember, those are being financed off the Ilim balance sheet, not by International Paper but by the joint venture that will begin to contribute to results toward the end of next year. And we've got the, importantly, Temple coming on either late this year, early next year, which is going to significantly contribute to our ability to further take costs out of our important North American Industrial Packaging business. So all in, well the fourth quarter is going to be the usual kind of fourth quarter, and the economic environment is more the same. We're very positive at thinking about International Paper as we end this year and go into next year. So Tom Kadien, do you want to give everybody an update in India?"

We're in the process of establishing governance over the company.

In their most recent quarter, or last quarter, APPM had a good quarter. Revenue is growing 10%, and as we look forward to '12, we think we're looking for double-digit increases in tons, earnings, and we feel like we've got a lot of runway in front of us. Some of you have asked Glenn about the dispute, I guess, over the non-compete fee and $25 million that's held in escrow right now. There is a date set of November 16 with the Securities Appellate Tribunal that'll make that decision. And again, our advisors think that we are on strong ground and it'll go in our favor. That said, in India, nothing happens quite as scheduled. So we're hoping it comes off on November 16. And then I guess the last thing, we're still evaluating when we're going to report out on results and how we can sync that up. And you'll hear more about that on future calls."

Before we open up to your questions, I'd just like to make a couple of comments on the people moves we announced this week. We have a very strong and deep and [ph] capable management team at International Paper. And I think our results over the last several years, going through the Transformation Plan, coming out of it, managing through the downturn and now the slow recovery demonstrates that. These moves are really the result of a lot of discussion, a lot of thought on my part, and making them now gets us ready for 2012 and beyond. So I've got absolute confidence that going forward, what you're going to see from International Paper is IP-style execution and IP-style results.

Relative to exports, the export market has got a combination of 2 things going on. In the export market, I mean, there has been some slowdown in boxed demand in some of these markets. That's combined with the pipe for exports. It's kind of along pipe, so orders get placed and it takes 2, 3 months for them to get there. So that, combined with some extra supply that's hitting those markets, has caused a little deterioration in pricing, but I think that's just a temporary supply chain activity and I don't see any real decline in demand in the export markets through time."

And obviously, the way we're thinking about that is based on market growth and the other dynamics on how that market's served if we need the additional capacity for not only Brazil, as John said earlier, but for the greater Latin American region, that would be an attractive thing for us to do. But we do have a little more time on that and we're monitoring the market. The currency is obviously a factor, but we would make a decision like that obviously for the long-term."

This would be a 20-year investment, so you don't want to make it just on the spot currency at a point in time and currency in Brazil then from $1.50 to $3.

This would be a 20-year investment, so you don't want to make it just on the spot currency at a point in time and currency in Brazil then from $1.50 to $3. None of them are smart enough to figure out what it's going to be in 2025, but the investment we make will be around in 2025. So we could be dealing with that, as the time comes. From our packaging perspective, we will have a stronger packaging presence in Latin America with Mexico. We've got one box plant in Chile. We like to be in the packaging business, both in bleached and unbleached packaging in Latin America, and if the right opportunity against all that valuation and create value for International Paper, we'll consider it. If it's not the right valuation, it's a place in the world we'd like to be but won't be."

And John, can we just -- with what Tom Kadien is working on now in India, you've kind of -- you're hitting all the bricks at this point. And I wondered if you could just give us thoughts on how you'll allocate capital in all of those different countries? And then when we think about your CapEx budget, how much of that is really going to be focused, just in ballpark terms, in the U.S. and Western Europe? And how much of it will be allocated to some of the emerging markets that you're in?"

Cashback to shareowners, cash reinvested in our existing business, a strong balance sheet and selectively reinvesting. Russia is a great example of being able to do that aggressively on -- not on IP's balance sheet, but on the joint ventures which have got that capacity. India, we're going to need to get in there and figure out how to grow with the market, both in paper and packaging. And we're going to continue to spend only on cost reduction in North America. And on regulatory capital, we've got some of that coming down the pipe with Willamette. So we are going to force -- there's going to continue to be capitalizing in IP and we're going to skew the capital to where we think the strategic investment's ought to be made, but we'll keep our North American -- the right assets in North America competitive and modern, and I think we've been able to do that with this $1 billion spending over the last couple of years and going forward for the next couple on average. With Temple, we've got a little more capital spending, so we'll be updating you on kind of the next 5 years how you should think about CapEx relative to depreciation. But in some places of the world, it'll be a lot higher, in some places of the world, it'll be a lot lower.
Okay. Well, listen, let me just wrap it up by saying International Paper's pretty pleased about the fourth quarter. It was on flat revenues. It was -- third quarter, rather, quite strong relative to where it had been. And we're pretty positive, I'd say, quite positive how we're looking at it in 2012 even though the macro environment kind of feels to us like it's going to be more of the same. But with what we have on our plate, we think International Paper's best days are still ahead of us. So thanks for tuning in on the call, we'll talk to you next quarter"
