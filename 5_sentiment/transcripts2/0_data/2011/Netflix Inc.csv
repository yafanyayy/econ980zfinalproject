And my sense is that those Canadians with capped and $1 or $2 per gigabyte overcharges, many of them probably don't understand their plan, and it will take a billing cycle or two for them, and that is potentially a significant negative for Netflix. The shame of it is that the marginal cost, as we wrote in the letter to deliver a marginal gigabyte over wired network is extremely small, well less than a $0.01. So hopefully, we can work with the different consumer groups and providers, and get a better costing structure, where if there are pay per gigabyte charges, they're more in the $0.01 range or they're bundled in with a much higher cap like exists in the U.S. and in many other nations."

We recently did a calculation about fiber optics and what we discovered is that a single fiber optic, about the size of a human hair, because of the advances in dense weight division multiplexing (sic) [dense wavelength division multiplexing] can now carry all 100% of the Netflix traffic. So if we had a single data center where all the bits came out of, it could comfortably go out in a single fiber.

Cash payments for content increased $130 million year-over-year versus $110 million year-over-year increase in the expense associated with that content. So to the extent that we talked about close to matching our payment terms with our expense, we are continuing to execute on that. We ran a little bit ahead in Q1.

I answered it somewhat narrowly in saying that the two contrasts that drove that AP increase are going to reverse themselves out in Q2, and they did. On top of that, in addition to that, we signed a bunch of new content deals that we discussed in the Investor Letter. And to the extent that those deals were within a year with identified titles, it drove the AP up. So let me answer it in a general sense. Cash payments for content increased $130 million year-over-year versus $110 million year-over-year increase in the expense associated with that content. So to the extent that we'd talked about close matching of our payment terms with our expense, we are continuing to execute on that. We ran a little bit ahead in Q1. In terms of the sequential increase, the cash out the door for content was roughly in line with the expense increase. So I think you should see the accounts payable and the associated long-term accrued payable line increase with our continued investment in streaming content.

I answered it somewhat narrowly in saying that the two contrasts that drove that AP increase were going to reverse themselves out in Q2, and they did. On top of that, in addition to that, we signed a bunch of new content deals that we discussed in the Investor Letter. And to the extent that those deals were within a year with identified titles, it drove the AP up. So let me answer this in a general sense. Cash payments for content increased $130 million year-over-year versus $110 million year-over-year increase in the expense associated with that content. So to the extent that we'd talked about close matching of our payment terms with our expense, we are continuing to execute on that. We ran a little bit ahead in Q1. In terms of the sequential increase, the cash out the door for content was roughly in line with the expense increase. So I think you should see the accounts payable and the associated long-term accrued payable line increase with our continued investment in streaming content.

I answered it somewhat narrowly in saying that the two contrasts that drove that AP increase were going to reverse themselves out in Q2, and they did. On top of that, in addition to that, we signed a bunch of new content deals that we discussed in the Investor Letter. And to the extent that those deals were within a year with identified titles, it drove the AP up. So let me answer this in a general sense. Cash payments for content increased $130 million year-over-year versus $110 million year-over-year increase in the expense associated with that content. So to the extent that we'd talked about close matching of our payment terms with our expense, we are continuing to execute on that. We ran a little bit ahead in Q1. In terms of the sequential increase, the cash out the door for content was roughly in line with the expense increase. So I think you should see the accounts payable and the associated long-term accrued payable line increase with our continued investment in streaming content.

So it grew sequentially but in terms of percent of revenue, it's still about 7% of revenue. I would expect that line to continue to track as we invest further in terms of percent of revenues. In terms of G&A that should scale more slowly, but we did have a $5 million commercial settlement charge in the quarter that it was a one-time charge that you normally wouldn't see in the quarter."

Our marketing expense is constrained by 2 things. One, how much marginal costs or marginal subscriber acquisition cost we'll to layout to acquire that subscriber? Can we do that on a profitable level? And then the second constrained on the marketing expenses is basically our earnings targets that we set forth. So we have 3 rigs basically of investment, one is our streaming content investment, one is our marketing and one is our earnings target, basically putting money towards back to investors. And setting the 14% operating margin domestic operating margin target allows us to set basically a content spend and a marketing spend. And so how do you think about cash relative to the buyback as independent on how much we spend on marketing. And I'd say how we approach the buyback is what can we do with that cash as an alternative use? Should we hold it as an insurance policy or should we were turn it to shareholders and the buyback is the most efficient way to do that."

We gained some confidence when we launched in Canada and that blew away our expectations with the response. We gained some confidence when we led on our nonmember homepage with streaming only. And as we put in our shareholder letter in Q2, about 75% of subscribers chose streaming only. In other words, even though DVD was only $2 more, 75% stuff was streaming only.

But in general, that is how the staging area for content contracts as they move into what we call in window or available for streaming. When they do that, depending on the payment terms on the matching side, they'll be cashed out for a quarter of payment. The quarter of expense associated with that. And then to the extent that there is short-term liabilities, it will move into accounts payable. That's one of the reasons that we discussed that in the letter. And if they're longer than a year, it will increase accrued, the other accrued liabilities. At this point, I'll take those questions and sort of refer you to our IR website. There's a pretty detailed treatment of our content accounting. And it should walk you through exactly what happens under each scenario."
