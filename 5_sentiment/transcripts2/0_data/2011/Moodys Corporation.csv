Fourth quarter revenue of $564 million increased 16% over the prior year reflecting strong performance in credit ratings and growth in all areas of Moody’s analytics. We saw a continuation of positive third quarter issuance trends for corporate investment grade and high yield obligations as well as accelerated completion of projects for customers of our risk management software and professional services units.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $197 million and increase of 10% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter up $0.58 included a tax benefit of $0.08 due to utilization of foreign tax credits and more state taxes. For full year 2010, revenue totaled $2.03 billion a 13% increase from full year 2009 operating income of $773 million increased 12% from a year ago. Revenue of Moody’s investor service was $1.4 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year period. Moody’s analytics revenue was $627 million increased 8% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.15 for 2010 increased 27% and included a legacy tax benefit of $0.02 in the second quarter and other tax benefits of $0.15 in the second half of the year associated with the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings discussed in the third quarter call. And fourth quarter benefits from foreign tax credits and lower state taxes; excluding these tax items full year 2010 diluted earnings per share would have been a $1.98 or 16% above the $1.70 for 2009 which included legacy tax and restructuring related items. I’m now turning the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates

U.S. fourth quarter revenue increased 20% to $295 million well revenue outside the U.S. grew 12% to $269 million and represented 48% of Moody’s total revenue. Recurring revenue of $294 million represented 52% of the total compared to 60% in the prior year period. Looking at each of our businesses Moody’s investor service revenue for the quarter $383 million a 15% increase year-over-year. U.S. revenue was up 25% over the prior year period. Outside the U.S. revenue grew 4% and represented 41% of total ratings revenue global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter increased 43% from a year ago to $165 million. Revenue grew 59% in the U.S. driven by growth from all asset classes particularly high yield bank loan and bond origination from refinancing pre-financing and merger and acquisition activity. Outside the U.S revenue increased 20% from the prior year period with strong bond issuance in Europe and Asia. Global structure finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $76 million 3% below the prior year period. 
In the U.S. revenue declined 2% year-over-year with lower consumer for asset backed activity partially offset by improved issuance in commercial real estate finance. Non-U.S. structure finance revenue was down 4% with reduced European derivative issuance the decline was partially offset by higher European securitization activity. Global financial institutions revenue of $56million decreased 9% from the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower levels of banking sector issuance in the U.S and abroad. U.S. financial institutions revenue declined 10% well outside of the U.S. revenue was down 8% global revenue for the public projects and infrastructure finance business grew by 15% year-over-year to $76 million. Revenue increased 20% in the U.S. reflecting gains in those sectors. Non-U.S. revenue increased 6% mostly driven by growth in Asia.
Now turning to Moody’s analytics global revenue for Moody’s analytics of $182 million was up 18% from the fourth quarter of 2009 U.S. revenue grew by 7% year-over-year to $71 million. And non-U.S. revenue increased by 26% to $111 million and represented 61% of total analytics revenue. Growth was primarily lead by the delivery of risk management software projects and professional services engagement. Globally revenue from research data and analytics of $109 million increased by 3% from the prior year period and represented about 60% of total MA revenue we are seeing good demand for products across our portfolio together with lower rates of customer attrition as conditions continue to improve in the financial industry. 
Revenue for risk management software of $58 million grew 37% with the delivery of seven large projects ahead of schedule. Due to the variable nature of project timings and concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements risk management software revenue remain subject to significant short term volatility. Professional services revenue of $14.5 million more than doubled from the prior year period including revenue from the acquisition of CSI Global Education late in the fourth quarter.
Turning now to expenses Moody’s fourth quarter expenses were $368 million an increase of 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily due to greater headcount and higher accruals for incentive compensation first an allocation to our global profit sharing program. Moody’s reported operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2010, which was 34.8% compared to 36.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.5% compared to 38.3% from the prior year period. The difference was primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credit and a larger portion of tax for income generated outside the US, which is taxed at a lower rate under the US statutory rate, but for the full year 2010 effective tax rate was 28.1% compared to 37.0% a year ago primarily due to the items discussed previously. 
Now I’ll provide an update on capital allocation and stock buy backs. Moody’s increased its quarterly dividend on December 14th by 9.5% to 11.5% per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2010 Moody’s repurchased 3.9 million shares at a total cost of $104 million for an average price approximately $27 per share. Moody’s also issued 0.04 million share under the employees stock sales compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31st 2010 total 230.8 million representing a 3% decline from a year earlier. As of December 10th, 2010 Moody’s had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt at year end, with $1 billion of additional debt available under its revolving credit facility.  
Cash and cash equivalent was $660million and increased $186 million from the prior year period.  Approximately, 2/3rds of our cash holdings are maintained outside the US to enable us to fund operations and hold investments across the lines of business, for example the acquisition of CSI growth of education announced on November 22nd was reappears above receive cash. Capital expenditures for the year 2010 was $79 million and reflected the final phase of building up our London headquarters at Kingsway as well as the ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure for business and compliance requirements.
 In 2011 we expect CapEx to be in the range of $70 to $80 million, which includes continued investment in technology at despite business news. We remain committed to using our strong cash growth to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. We expect to continue repurchase shares at modest level subject to available cash flow, market conditions, and other ongoing capital allocations deficient and with that I’ll turn back over to Ray.

On matters that including reporting of internal controls transparency of rating performance and references to credit ratings and statuary regulations and rules, adoption of the proposed set of rules is planned for April through July 2011. Turning to Europe the transfer of order site of credit rating agencies from national regulators to the new established European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA is scheduled to be effective in July. 
We’ve submitted an application for the registration of our EU-based entities and for authorization to endorse the majority of our non-European credit ratings so that they qualify for use under European regulation. We believe that this positioning will support the efficient flow of capital across national borders and best meet the current needs of all users of credit ratings. As regulatory reviews and activity of current other jurisdictions we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches but align with the G20 statements and directives. Although Moody’s investor service has already made significant progress, we must adapt our business in response to these changing requirements around the world. 
While new rules will spur various changes in our rating agency processes and operations they will not alter our fundamental business objective to drive the highest quality credit opinions research and analysis. Before concluding today’s remarks by reviewing our 2011 outlook I’ll briefly comment on our acquisition of CSI Global Education during the fourth quarter. CSI is Canada’s leading provider of financial learning, credentials and certification. And is making important progress in extending its presence to other markets worldwide. This acquisition is consistent with our ongoing commitment to advance the understanding of the risk management practices represents another means for Moody’s to further financial literary and promote efficiency in financial markets. We’re pleased to welcome our new colleagues and candidates to Moody’s.
Moody’s outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macro-economic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity consumer borrowing and securitization. And the eventual withdrawal of government sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainties surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ Moody’s result for the year may differ materially from our current forecast. Our full year outlook assumes foreign currency transaction at exchange rates as of the end quarter rates. We anticipate market condition to remain generally favorable in 2011 and so project stronger revenue in some margin expansion compared 2010. For Moody’s corporation we expect full year 2011 revenue to grow into high-single-digit % range and expenses to increase in the mid to high-single-digit percent range. We expect expenses to gradually increase throughout the year. For the first half of 2011 expenses will reflect the annualized impact to 2010 hiring. Expenses in the second half forecast could also reflect incremental hiring but won’t feature the higher accruals for incentive compensation that we saw in 2010 unless we exceed our operating income our earnings expectations. Given these assumptions we project the full year 2011 operating margin to be between 38 and 40% the effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 36%. We expect diluted earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22. As mentioned earlier after excluding the legacy tax benefit of $0.02 from the second quarter and $0.15 from the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings and other tax benefits from the second half from the year. 
Full year 2010 diluted EPS would have been $1.98. At Moody’s investors service we now expect global revenue growth in the mid- to-high-single-digit percent range. In the U.S. we expect MIS revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenues expected to grow in a low double digits percent range. Also finance revenues projected to increase in the high-single-to-low-double-digit percent range with ongoing activity driven by refinancing another capital needs.
Structured finance revenues expected to remain about flat while revenue from financial institutions is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Public project and infrastructure finance revenue was projected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. In Moody’s Analytics, we project full year 2011 growth in the high single to low double-digit percent range. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range for research data and analytics and in the low to mid-single-digit percent range for risk management software following the accelerated pays of deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2010. Professional services revenues projected to more than double primarily reflecting revenue from the acquisition of CSI Global Education. We expect Moody's Analytics revenue to increase in the high single digit percent range in the U.S. and in the low double-digit percent range outside the U.S.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question and answer session are Michel Madelain the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investor Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We’ll be pleased to take any questions that you may have.

The difference in expenses in 11 over 10 it should be about $90 million, let me break down the change for you. About $30 million of that is increase expenses that we are looking at for the CSI acquisition that would be afford with $30 million. And other 30 million would be increase compensation expense which includes both 45% headcount increase I mention for 2011 and the annualization at the people we hired in 2010.

I also think though we are going to have similar to what we had in 2010 periods where issuance is more robust. And then it shuts down or declines in response to macro economic conditions or concerns for example in Europe about whether the sovereign debt issues have been resolved and if so in a favorable way. So I would not be surprised in 2011 we continue to see issuance be somewhat lumpy and it has sorted out on a strong foot. You didn’t exactly asked t his Bill but it does give me an opportunity to talk a little bit about some of the longer term issuance that we might expect to see and we have been able to release some research just in the last week looking at refinancing needs. We do this each year over the coming 5 year period and interestingly in the investment grade U.S. investment grade corporate sector the amount of debt to be refunded over the coming 5 years are slightly higher than it was at this time last year. And in the high yield sector it is down but not down by very much compared to the or in context of the very robust issuance we saw in 2010. So it looks like investment grade maturities are going to peak probably in 2013 and high yield peaking in 2014. And as we talked about before the high yield refinancing is more opportunistic and is more likely to follow windows of opportunity in the markets,

So, we could move that stuff around that then we have a tax hits so we have to cut balance what we’re doing here so hope that that answer is what you need.

First quarter revenue of $577 million increased 21% over the prior year reflecting strong corporate debt issuance and increased structured finance ratings activity, supporting growth in Moody's investor service, and continued solid performance for Moody's Analytics.  All reporting units of both MIS and MA grew in the first quarter of 2011 from the same prior year period.
Operating income for the first quarter was $250 million, 27% above the prior year period.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.67 an increase of 43% year over year.  We are raising our full-year 2011 EPS guidance to a range of $2.22 to $2.32 from the prior range of $2.12 to $2.22, based on strong first quarter performance.
Our expectations for market conditions for the remainder of the year are generally unchanged from our February guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Linda, to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $577 million.  
U.S. first quarter revenue increased 18% to $301 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 24% to $276 million, and represented 48% of Moody's total revenue.
Recurring revenue of $294 million represented 51% of the total compared to 59% in the prior year period.
Looking at each of our businesses, Moody's investor service revenue for the quarter was $413 million a 23% increase year over year.  U.S. revenue was up 22% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S. revenue grew 25% and represented 44% of total ratings revenue.
Global Corporate Financial revenue in the first quarter increased 44% from a year ago to $182 million.  Revenue grew 52% in the U.S. while outside the U.S. revenue increased 31% year over year.  Growth was driven by strong issuance activity particularly in the U.S. and European investment-grade and high-yield markets. 
Global Structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $89 million, 25% above the prior year period.  In the U.S., revenue increased 11% year over year with improved issuance in commercial real estate finance, partially offset by declines and asset-backed securities. 
Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 39% primarily driven by demand for rating securitization placed with government-sponsored facilities in Europe, and increased covered bond issuance.
Global Financial Institution revenue of $77 million increased 1% from the same quarter of 2010 primarily due to higher levels of insurance sector issuance abroad. 
U.S. financial institution revenue declined 2% while non-U.S. revenue increased 3%. 
Global revenue for public project and infrastructure finance business grew by 5% year over year to $64 million.  Revenue declined 10% in the U.S. reflecting weakness in public and project finance issuance with the expiration of the Build America Bond Program and the municipal budgetary pressures.  Non-U.S. revenue increased 35% primarily driven by growth in infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $164 million was up 17% from the first quarter of 2010.  U.S. revenue grew by 9% year over year to $71 million.  Non-U.S. revenue increased 23% to $93 million and represented 57% of total Analytics revenue. 
Globally, revenue from research, data, and analytics of $110 million increased by 5% from the prior year period and represented about 67% of total MA revenue.  We are seeing continued demand for products across our portfolio as conditions in the financial industry improve.
Revenue from risk management software of $40 million grew 19% helped by the early completion of transactions that were expected to be realized later this year.  Due to the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue and a relatively small number of engagements, risk management software revenue remained subject to significant short-term volatility.
Professional services revenue increased more than fourfold to $15 million reflecting the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010, as well as much stronger results in the base business.
Turning now to expenses, Moody's first quarter expenses were $327 million an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2010.  This increase was primarily due to increased headcount from the prior year period, higher accruals for incentive compensation reflecting the stronger 2011 full-year outlook and on-going technology spending.
Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 43.3% compared to 41.3% in the first quarter of 2010.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.2% compared with 37.2% for the prior year period.  The difference was primarily due to a higher portion of taxable income generated internationally and lower tax jurisdictions, and a reduction of U.S. state income taxes.
Now I’ll provide an update on capital allocation and stock buybacks.  Moody's increased its quarterly dividend on April 26, by 22% to $0.14 per share, up from $0.11.5 per share of common stock.  During the first quarter of 2011, Moody's repurchased 4.3 million shares at a total cost of $128 million for an average price of less than $30 per share.  Moody's also issued 1.4 million shares under the employees stock-based compensation plan.
Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2011 total 227.8 million shares, representing a 4% decline from a year earlier. As of March 31, 2011, Moody's had 1.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. 
At quarter end, Moody's had 1.2 billion of outstanding debt with $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility.  Cash and cash equivalence was $720 million an increase of $223 million from the prior year period.  Approximately 70% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. 
We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity.  We expect to continue to share repurchase at modest levels, subject to available cash flow, market conditions, and other on-going capital allocation decision.
And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Ray.

I’ll continue with an update on legislative and regulatory developments.  First, in the U.S. the principal regulatory activities for 2011 affecting Moody's Investor Service will be SEC rule making under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The majority of rules are now expected to be proposed through July 2011 on matters that include reporting of internal controls, transparency of ratings performance and references to credit ratings and statutes, regulations and rules.  
Adoption of the proposed set of rules is expected is during the second half of 2011.  While new rules entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us  to adapt our business, we will not alter our fundamental business objective to provide the highest quality, credit opinions, research and analysis. 
Turning to Europe, the transfer of oversight of credit rating agencies from National regulators to newly-established European securities and market authority, or ESMA ,is schedule to be effective July 2011. 
We have submitted an application for registration of our EU-based entities and for authorization to endorse our non-European credit ratings so that they qualify for regulatory use by EU regulated entities.  We believe that this positioning will support the efficient flow of capital across national borders and best meet the current needs of all users of credit ratings.  Moody's registration process is expected to be concluded in the second quarter of 2011.  
The [inaudible] and commission is also scheduled to propose new rules for the rating agency industry in the third quarter of 2011, regarding matters that include competition, business models, liability, and the use of ratings and regulations.  As regulatory reviews and activity occur in other jurisdictions, we will continue advocate for globally-consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I’ll conclude this mornings prepared remarks by discussing our full-year guidance.  Moody’s outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macro-economic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government sponsored economic stabilization initiatives.  There’s an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from our current forecast. 
As mentioned earlier, we’re revising our EPS guidance upward for the full-year 2011 to a range of $2.22 to $2.32 reflecting strong first quarter performance.  Our expectations for market conditions for the remainder of the year are generally unchanged from our February guidance.  
Our full-year outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.  Our revenue expectations for certain areas of change based on conditions specific to those businesses and geographies.  My comments highlight only those components that have been revised, and we refer you to our earnings release for a full review of our 2011 guidance.
For Moody's corporation, we now expect full-year 2011 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range.  We do not expect early strength to continue at levels above our February guidance. 
Full-year expenses are now projected to increase in the high-single digit percent range.  
At Moody's Investor Service, we now expect global revenue growth in the low double-digit percent range.  In the U.S. we now expect MIS revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to grow in the mid-to-high teens percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now projected to increase in the high-teens percent range, with on-going activity driven by refinancing, mergers and acquisitions, and other capital needs. 
Structured finance revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range, while revenue from financial institutions is now expected to increase in the high-single digit percent range.  Public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. 
For Moody's Analytics, our guidance remains unchanged given the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue and a relatively small number of engagements within the risk management software revenue line.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question and answer session are Michele Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investor Service, and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. 
We’d be pleased to take any questions you may have.

And the improvement in the first quarter was primarily driven by the demand for ratings on securitization in Europe that were being placed with government sponsored facilities.  And so the ratings that were mandated as a result of that applied to ratings that were already outstanding in the market in part and that contributed to the growth in the area. 
That has largely been run through the system at this point, so we would expect to revert more to a run rate like we had seen in recent quarters.

We noticed that the 10-Q from [inaudible] is out this morning  Obviously, we haven’t had a chance to study it, but we have a couple of thoughts on this.  
For our first quarter revenue growth for MIS, which was up $77 million, most of that, the lion’s share of that is certainly coming from corporate finance and then the rest from structured.  And we can go through that in a little bit.  
The main drivers of the difference over S&P as we see it is we benefit from the fact that the ECB is looking for second ratings and as Ray has spoken about, before that increased our structured finance business.  
We’d also note that the two companies have different approaches to transaction and recurring revenue.  As you know, we’re more tilted toward transaction revenue and that benefits us during a high-volume high-issuance market.  
Thirdly, our pricing and mix changes were amplified by strong issuance, so strong activity in bank loans, high yields and other places that are particularly helpful to us.  And we are seeing a continued flow of new rating requests; people looking for ratings for counter-party activities and to provide a safeguard if they’re unable to borrow at attractive rates from their local banks.  
So really, a bunch of different reasons and I’ll let Ray comment further on that.

We still see generally favorable conditions in the capital markets and we expect those are going to - those conditions are going to continue through the year.  I think the pipeline reflects that across our businesses.  We certainly believe that we have seen pull forward in the corporate sector, both investment grade and high yield into the first quarter of the year.  And that pull forward may have a dampening effect on issuance later in the year.  On the other hand, we are seeing increased debt financed merger and acquisition activity and a broader set of reasons from issuers for issuing debt including share repurchase business expansion activities.  
So the mix of corporate issuance is becoming more diverse and we feel that’s a positive and an offset to the pull forward that we saw in the first quarter.  
On the structure and finance side, I would characterize the pipeline as being not bad.  As I said, we don’t think we’re going to have the first quarter revenue run rate through the rest of the year, but we certainly have a reasonable pipeline of business over on that side.

The commercial real estate finance area in the first quarter was good, both in the U.S. and internationally.  CLOs, we have - are optimistic about the long-term prospects for CLOs, but whether some of these asset categories are going to show good growth in 2011, at this point probably relates not only to regulatory changes that have been put in place, but also just the economics in terms of where spreads are and whether it’s the right time for - for example, CLOs and certain forms of real estate securitization to come to market.  
So economic conditions are going to dictate the timing even though we are optimistic in the longer run about some of these asset classes.

The reason, Peter, why we’re at those levels, we view first quarter as potentially being the strongest margin quarter in the year.  There’re two things going on.  We’re expecting the revenue view this year potentially to be perhaps U-shaped; a little bit different than what we’ve seen in previous years.  And as I mentioned before, we see expenses ramping up over the course of the year.  
So with all that considered, we’re at 38 to 40%.  You know, we would hope that would come in at the high end, but we’ll have to see how it goes.  So those two things together keep us moderated in our thoughts of what the margin outlook is for the year.

We’ve got about $77 million of increase in revenue in MIS for the first quarter of ’11 versus  ’10.  About - well 55.4 million of that is coming from the corporates area, 17.9 is coming from the structured area.  So, as I said before the lion’s share is from corporate and the next piece is from structured.  FIG and PPIF are relatively flat.  But let me go through the flips that you’re looking for, Craig. 
So, for the first quarter of 2011, investment grade was 36.5 million or 20% of corporate.  Now, that’s very strongly up, that’s up 11.6 million from this time last year.  High yield, $44.7 million, that’s 25%, that’s also up $11.1 million or 33% from last year.  Bank loans $34.6 million or 19% of corporate revenue, up 90% from last year’s 16.4 million. 
So you can see all three of those areas are up pretty dramatically.  Other is at $66 million and that’s 36% of those fees and that’s up $16.3 million or 33% as well.  So as you can see, all the corporate lines have shown very good growth, really driving the biggest part of MIS revenue increases. 
So let’s look at structured and start with ABS.  Looking at $26.7 million for ABS, 30% of those revenues, that’s up 3.6 million, R&BF at 23.1 million, 26% of structured revenues, that’s up from 14.3 million last year to 62% increase.  So that’s helpful.  We understand about 45% of that is from covered bonds.  Commercial real estate, $19 million up from 12.3 last year, a 54% increase and derivatives at $20.6 million, that’s actually off a little bit from last year, 23% of structured finance revenues, which total 89.4.  Do you want me to keep going Craig?

Turning to PPIF, PFG in soverance about $30 million, that’s 46%, Muni’s 4.5 and both of those lines were down a little bit from this point last year.  Project and infrastructure $30 million that was up about 20% from last year.  And for total, $64.5 million for PPIF, last year at this time it was 61.4.  So you see FIG and public project infrastructure are basically flattish and corporate into a lesser extend structure are really driving the changes in MIS revenue.

I think the dialog that’s going on is trying to respond to the mandate under Dodd-Frank to reduce the reliance on ratings and regulation, and the requirement that government regulators  and enterprises review their use of ratings and regulations with an eye to finding alternatives. As you probably know, we support that. We think that we have a healthy industry and a healthy business without the extent of use of ratings and regulations that currently exist. However, there also seems to be a real struggle to find an alternative. So we don’t know how, whether it’s a banking system regulators or SCC or others, are ultimately going to resolve that. But Moody's position is that whether ratings are ultimately used or some alternative is used, the systemic consequences from using any third-party measure of credit risk depends on how those measures are used as opposed to just what measure is chosen. So we are weighing in on this debate more on that side rather than the actual use of ratings and regulations.

Second quarter revenue of $605 million increased 27% over the prior year, reflecting gains across the ratings business particularly for corporate debt and continued strong performance from Moody’s analytics. For all reported units within Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s Analytics grew in the second quarter of 2011 from the same period in 2010.
Operating income for the second quarter totaled $270 million, 42% above the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.82 increased 61% year-over-year and included a benefit of $0.06 resulting from a foreign tax ruling. Based on second quarter performance, we are raising our full year 2011 EPS guidance to a range of $2.38 to $2.48 from the prior range of $2.22 to $2.32. However, we expect more challenging debt issuance conditions in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of the year as compared to the first half.
Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first six months of 2011 was $1.2 billion, a 24% increase from the first half of 2010. Expenses were $662 million, up 17% and operating income of $520 million increased 34% from the prior year period. Revenue of Moody’s Investor Service for the first six months of 2011 was $851 million, an increase of 28% from a year ago. Moody’s Analytics revenue was $332 million, 14% higher than the prior year period.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 27% to $605 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 23%. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 20% to $315 million while revenue outside the U.S. grew 34% to $290 million and represented 48% of Moody’s total revenue. Recurring revenue of $309 million represented 51% of the total compared to 59% in the prior year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investor Service revenue for the quarter was $438 million, a 33% increase year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translations, revenue grew 29%. U.S. revenue was up 26% over the prior year period while outside the U.S. revenue grew 44% and also represented 44% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue for the second quarter was $86.3 million, 18% above the prior year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 8% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance growth in commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Other areas of the U.S. structured finance market including residential mortgage backed securities remained weak.
Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 28%, reflecting higher issuance volumes in European asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, including covered bonds.
Global financial institutions revenue of $79 million increased 25% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. financial institutions revenue increased 27%, driven by increased banking and insurance issuance from smaller-sized institutions, while non-U.S. revenues increased 24% supported by stronger banking activity in all regions.
Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure finance business grew by 13% year-over-year to $73 million. Revenue increased 7% in the U.S. reflecting growth in infrastructure finance partially offset by continued weakness in public and project finance issuance. Non-U.S. revenue increased 25%, primarily driven by growth in infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody’s Analytics, global revenue for Moody's Analytics was $167 million, was up 12% from the second quarter of 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. revenue grew by 4% year-over-year to $70 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 18% to $97 million and represented 58% of total Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally revenue from research, data and analytics of $111 million increased 6% from the prior year period, and represented about 66% of total MA revenue as we continue to see good demand for products across our portfolio.
Revenue from risk management software of $40 million increased 2% over last year’s strong second quarter performance. Due to the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements, risk management software revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than tripled to $16 million, reflecting the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010 as well as strong results in the base business.
Moody's second quarter expenses were $335 million, an increase of 17% compared to second quarter of 2010 or 13% increase including the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. Expense growth was primarily driven by increased headcount including from the acquisition of CSI Global Education and higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting the stronger full year outlook. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 44.6%, compared with 39.9% in the second quarter of 2010.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.8% compared with 31.1% for the prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower taxes on foreign and state income and a recent favorable tax ruling, partially offset by a smaller benefit in 2011 for legacy tax matters.
Now, I will provide an update on capital allocation and stock buybacks. During the second quarter of 2011, Moody's did not repurchase any shares and issued 0.9 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2011 totaled 228.7 million, representing a 2% decline from a year earlier.
As of quarter end, Moody's had 1.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. As of June 30th, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt with $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $939 million, an increase of $453 million from the prior year period, approximately 70% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. 
We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity. We expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2011 subject to available cash flow, market condition and other ongoing capital allocations decisions.
And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray.

I'll continue with an update on legislative and regulatory developments. First, in the U.S., as discussed last quarter, the principal regulatory activities in 2011 will be SEC rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act.
The majority of rule proposals regarding regulation of NRSRO were published in May with the common dead line of August 8th. These rule proposals include requirements on reporting of internal controls, analysts training and transparency of ratings related information.
The SEC has also published request for comment regarding the feasibility of establishing system before a signing in NRSRO to determine one of the credit ratings for structured finance products. This is generally known as the Franken amendment. That comment deadline is September 13. And yesterday, during an open hearing, the SEC adopted rules that we move references to credit ratings and certain rules, forms, and communications made by issuers under the securities laws. This action is consistent with Moody’s long-standing recommendations.
While new rules entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not alter our fundamental business objective to provide the highest quality credit opinions, research and analysis.
Turning to Europe, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies from national regulators to the newly established European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA is effective as of this month. We have submitted an application for the registration of our EU-based entities and for authorization to endorse our non-European credit ratings, so that they qualify for regulatory use by EU regulated entities. We expect the review of Moody’s registration application to be concluded before year end.
The European Commission is expected to propose new rules for the rating agency industry in the coming months regarding matters that include the use of ratings in regulation, business models, sovereign ratings, liability, and competition.
Finally on July 20, the European Commission published its preliminary proposal on bank capital, which seeks to implement Basel III. The proposal focus is on three new elements, provision of sanctions, effective corporate governance, and provisions preventing the over-reliance on external credit ratings. As regulatory reviews and activity occur in other jurisdictions, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G-20 statements and directives.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody’s outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, and business investment spending, mergers and acquisition activity, and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from our current forecast.
As mentioned earlier, we are revising our EPS guidance upward for the full year 2011 to a range of $2.38 to $2.48 reflecting stronger than expected second quarter performance partially offset by expectations from more challenging debt issuance conditions in the U.S and Europe in the second half of 2011 as compared to the first half of the year.
For Moody’s Corporation, we now expect full year 2011 revenue to grow in the low-teens percent range. Full year expenses including the impact of higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody’s profit-sharing plan are now projected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. The full year 2011 operating margin is still projected between 38% and 40%.
Our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 33% for the year. Our revenue expectations for certain areas have changed based on conditions specific to those businesses and geographies. My comments will primarily highlight those components that have been revised and we refer you to our earnings release for a full review of our 2011 guidance.
Our full year outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. At Moody’s Investor Service, we now expect revenue to increase in the low teens percent range globally with high single-digit percent growth in the U.S. and growth internationally in the low 20s percent range. Revenue now projected to increase in the mid 20s percent range in corporate finance and in the high single-digit percent range in structured finance.
Public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to remain about flat to last year. Global revenue of Moody’s Analytics is now expected to grow in the low double-digit percent range with that growth reflected both in the U.S. and internationally. That concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investor Service. Mark Almeida, the President of Moody’s Analytics is traveling today and will not be on the call. We’d be pleased to take any questions that you may have.

Over the next couple of years, I think you said we’d hope to over time return to the low 40s, but for the second half of this year, most immediately we are expecting to see a little bit of margin compression in the back half of the year. Looking at our guidance, you probably inferred that we are expecting some revenue growth slowdown from the first half of the year to the second half of the year and as we had mentioned on the first quarter call, we will continue to ramp expenses. So, we may find that the margin will suffer a bit of contraction before we hopefully return to expansion mode.

Let me give you the actual numbers so that I'm sure that everybody understands where we are here. We do expect revenue slowdown in the second half of the year compared to the first half. You will recall we have tougher comparables as well in the third and fourth quarter, when revenues strengthened last year. So, the first half of the year we have done a $1.182 billion in revenue and we are expecting that we will probably see some more between $50 million and $75 million less in revenue for the second half. That will still be up in the mid single digits over last year's second half, but again the pace of growth is moderating.
Then on the expense side, if you go back to the first quarter call you will remember that I said that the first quarter expenses were in fact $327 million for the first quarter and we are expecting that ramp to increase by $40 million to $50 million for the expense number, when we get to Q4. So, the two trends taken together, earnings growth a little bit slower and ramping expense growth will probably cause margin contraction for the back half of the year.

We don't know that there will be any ruling consistent with the timing of that hearing, but that is when the hearing is going to be held on CalPERS.
In May, we had a Court of Appeals decision affirming the dismissal of three separate cases that we've referred to in previous calls as a 33 Act cases that would seek to hold rating agencies liable as underwriters under the 33 Act. The Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the three separate cases that it was reviewing, so that was very good news. Then just recently in July, we had the Second Circuit again saying that plaintiffs in a shareholder action that they were seeking to establish class action status for could not appeal the decision disallowing them to represent other shareholders as a class. So those would be the three cases that are worth noting from the most recent quarter.

I think it's appropriate to characterize the pipelines now as reasonable. They are not as - certainly in the corporate area are not as robust as they were earlier in the year, but they're still pretty good, especially for investment grade issuance, and I will offer some broader comments in just a moment, but I would also characterize the public finance pipeline as reasonable, although it has been soft for most of this year, so there has been a pick up, but it was off of a low base earlier in the year and then in structured finance again the pipeline looks pretty good, but it has some areas of strength and some areas where there is continuing weakness. So I would say that's the area where our outlook for the second half of the year is probably the most uncertain and may embed the most upside potential as against our current expectations, but beyond the pipelines, which again I am characterizing as being pretty good are questions about whether there are going to be temporary market dislocations associated with some of the sovereign debt issues either in Europe or here in the U.S.
We’re looking at situations that we think are somewhat analogous to when we saw market slowdown a year ago when the initial problems with Greece surfaced and there were temporary slowdowns in debt issuance. We wouldn't be surprised to see that again in the second half this year, although we do believe that those would be temporary. Then whether there would be a slowdown in issuance associated with any rating action on the U.S. Government, I think while there is not a direct linkage between most of the corporate and private sector ratings that we do assign, there are some areas where there are linkages whether it's with government sponsored enterprises or municipality states and we would assume that there would be in the event of a rating action on the U.S. Government, again some market dislocation and we would have to see how quickly any resolution about the debt ceiling problems in the U.S. were resolved, how quickly those actions were taken and what the longer term plan around the sovereign debt situation in the U.S. would be in order to better forecast what the impact would be on the financial markets more broadly.

So a lot of debt that would have been maturing in 2012 has been refinanced, but there is still a large amount of debt that is scheduled to mature in 2013 through 2015 that is going to have to be refinanced and we would expect to see pull-forward of that as we move later into this year and then into 2012 before potentially interest rates or spreads widen and financing costs rise. So, there is a substantial amount of debt to be refinanced. In terms of where we would see upside in the corporate area, it's really not the refinancing at this point though, I think we would want to see a resumption of business spending, business confidence, and merger and acquisition activity to continue as it has in the first half of 2011 and that would provide some upside potential to the corporate sector.

One, the rated bank loan sector is an area where we are gaining share as compared to the unrated sector, so the number of bank loans that are being rated as a percent of the total stock of bank loans is growing.
There has also been a significant amount of bank loan activity, so the stock itself has been growing and in particular, I would point to Europe and what is a longer term secular disintermediation trend and a move to having bank loans rated and available for a wider investment population than historically would have been the case.
We did have very significant amount of bank loan activity in the first half of the year. We don't think it's going to again maintain that pace although it's going to continue to be a strong area for us in the second half of the year, although with the U.S. being stronger than Europe is our current expectation.

After our prepared remarks, we’ll be happy to respond to your questions.
Third quarter revenue of $531 million increased 4% over the prior year, with strong performance by Moody’s Analytics offsetting a modest revenue decline at Moody’s Investors Service.
Operating income for the third quarter totaled $196 million, also 4% above the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.57 increased 2% year-over-year and included a benefit of $0.03 from the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. While volatile market condition in US and Europe may continue, we are reaffirming our 2011 EPS guidance of $2.38 to $2.48 and we expect to beat the upper end of the range.
Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first nine months of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 17% increase from the first nine months of 2010. Expenses were $997 million, up 12% and operating income of $716 million increased 24% from the prior year period. Revenue at Moody’s Investor Service for the first nine months of 2011 was $1.2 billion, an increase of 18% from a year ago. Moody’s Analytics revenue was $512 million, 15% higher than the prior year period.

Looking now at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investor Service revenue for the quarter was $351 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was down 5%. US revenue decreased 4% over the prior year period while outside the U.S. revenue increased 1% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.
Global Corporate Finance revenue in the third quarter decreased a 11% from the year ago period to $129 million.  Revenue was down 11% in the US, while outside the US revenue was lower by 10% year-over-year.  The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance primarily in speculative grade bonds in both the US and Europe.
Global Structured Finance revenue for the third quarter was $82 million, 17% above the prior year period. In the US, revenue increased 20% year-over-year primarily due to strength in commercial real estate. Most other areas of the US structured finance market remained weak including residential mortgage backed securities.
Non-US structured finance revenue rose 14%, driven part primarily by European covered bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities in Europe and Asia.
Global financial institutions revenue of $72 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2010 with US revenue declining 1% while non-US revenue fell 3%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure finance business declined 2% year-over-year to $68 million.  Revenue decreased 8% in the US reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure program.  Non-US revenue increased 13% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.
Turning now to Moody’s Analytics, global revenue from Moody’s Analytics of $180 million was up 16% from third quarter of 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. US revenue grew by 6% year over year to $76 million.  Non-US revenue increased by 24% to $104 million and represented 58% of total Moody’s analytics revenue.
Globally revenue from research data and analytics of $115 million increased 9%  from the prior year period and represented about 64% of total MA revenue as we continue to see good demand for products across our portfolio.
Revenue from risk management software of $48 million increased 12% over last year’s third quarter performance. Due to the variable nature of project timings, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility.  Professional services revenue more than doubled to $117 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010.
Turning now to expenses Moody’s third quarter expenses was $335 million, an increase of 3% compared to third quarter of 2010 or 1% increase excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  Moody's reported operating margins of the third quarter was 36.9% essentially flat to the third quarter of 2010.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5% compared to 24.4% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefits associated with foreign earnings in 2010 partially offset by a tax benefit from the settlement of state tax audits in the current period.
Now I’ll provide an update on capital allocation and stock buyback. During the third quarter of 2011, Moody’s repurchased 6.8 million shares and issued 0.1 million shares under Employee stock based compensation plan.  Outstanding shares as of September 30th totaled 222 million representing a 5% decline from the year earlier.  As of quarter's end, Moody’s had 0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. 
As of September 30, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under a revolving credit facility.  Cash and cash equivalent were $854 million, an increase of $61 million from the year earlier.  Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside US.  
We remain committed to using our strong cash growth, create value for shareholders for maintaining sufficient liquidity.  Share repurchase remained such as to available cash flow and other capital allocation decision.
With that, I will turn the call back to Ray.

In the US, following the SEC’s August common deadline for ruler proposals relevant to NRSROs under the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC is expected to adopt final rules by June 2012. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory authorities have begun resuming their user ratings and regulations and considering alternative measures this replacements. 
In September, a separate SEC common period closed regarding a Dodd-Frank mandated study about, among other matters, feasibility of establishing an alternative system for allocating credit ratings, assignments for structure finance products. The study which the SEC expect to complete by December 2012, stems from what’s known as the Frankin Amendment. Also in September, the SEC released its first annual reports summarizing its examination of NRSROs as mandated by the Dodd-Frank act. It did not determine that any finding discussed in the report constituted a material regulatory deficiency. 
Turning to Europe, transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA became effective in July. We expect the decision on Moody’s registration application of our EU based entities to be made before year end.
As many of you know, the European Commission is expected to for its new rules for credit agency industry, drafts of which have been commented on by the media and some European officials. We also understand that the commission intends to release a formal proposal by mid to late November. Once the proposal is published it will then be debated among members of the European parliament, the commission and members of the European Council of Finance Ministers. The suggested measures that have been imported on by the media address sober ratings, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, rotation of rating agencies, liability and competition.  We will continue to consult with relevant authorities and others as to the specifics of these drafts proposals.
While new rules globally entail various changes in our rating agencies processes and operation and require us to adept a business who not only taught fundamental business objective to apply the highest quality independent credit opinions research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that are aligned in the G-20 statements and directives. 
Finally, as some of you may now, a hearing is scheduled for tomorrow in one of our litigation matters, a case brought in California by Telpers regarding certain of our salable SIV ratings. At that hearing the judge is expected to rule whether the case should be dismissed under California anti-SLAPP statute, which defends free speech on matters of public interest. While we don’t know how the judge will rule, we are obviously hopeful that we will prevail on our motion at which point the case would be dismissed. Even if they do not openly on our motion under the anti-SLAPP statute there will be further opportunities to seek dismissal.
I conclude this morning prepared remarks by discussing our full-year guidance. Moody’s outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, and consumer borrowing and securitization.  There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and if actual condition is different from these assumptions Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.  Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
As mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance for the full-year of 2011 of $2. 38 to $2.48, and we now expect to be at the upper end of the range.  For Moody’s overall, the company now expects full-year 2011 revenue to grow in the low double digit percent range.  Full-year 2011 expenses are now projected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.  Full-year 2011 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 39% due to the planned increase in expenses and lower expected revenue in the fourth quarter. The effected tax rate is now expected to approximately 31%.  Share repurchase remain subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
At Moody's Investor Service revenue for full-year 2011 is now expected to increase from a high-single-digit percent range.  Within the US, MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, while non-US revenue is projected to increase in the low-teens percent range.  Corporate Finance Revenue is now forecast to grow in the low-double-digit percent range.  Revenue from Structured Finance is now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.  Financial Institution is now forecast to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to be about flat.
For Moody’s Analytics full-year 2011, revenue is still expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.  Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single-digit percent range, while research, data, and analytics, and in the low-to-mid-single-digit percent range for risk management software.
Professional services revenue is still projected to more than double, primarily reflecting revenue from the late 2010 acquisition of CSI Global Education and very strong performance in the risk management advisory business.  Moody’s Analytics revenue is now expected to increase from the high-single-digit percent range in the US and in the mid-teens percent range outside the US.
That concludes our prepared remarks.  And joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investor Service, and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics.  We will be pleased to take any questions you might have.

I think its worth noting also that structured finance area where we had strength throughout year in crucial real-estate sector and we do think that that pipeline is a little lighter for the fourth quarter then what we have seen earlier in the year.  So that's an area where we would expect decline as well.

With respect to the regulation, particularly in Europe, we are fully aware of some draft proposal that have been made.  We haven’t seen any formal proposals at this point.  But I would say that the issues being addressed in the proposals in Europe are very similar to what we have been dealing with over the last few years in the US and in some other jurisdictions around competition and conflicts of interest, the issue about over-reliance on credit ratings by market participants, enhanced transparency in the system, whether the liability standards for assigning credit ratings are appropriate or should be changed.
So, its not a change in the topics there being debated in the regulatory area.  Although from what I understand some of the proposals in Europe would for how to address those issues would be different in what we have seen for example in the US. I don’t think, I can go into a whole lot of detail on this at this point, because again we haven’t seen any formal proposals introduced and we don’t know what any formal proposals ultimately going to look like. But from what I understand are some things that we would believe are good ideas and some things that we would think are probably not such good ideas.  Included in the former category would be reducing over reliance on rating agencies and improving information transparency. I think those are workable ideas.  I think, they can develop some useful solutions in those areas.  Some of the ideas that we probably wouldn’t be a supportive of, I think are also probably more unworkable.

I would be particularly hesitant to comment on 2012 tax rates because as you know there are some pretty significant proposal splitting around out there in terms of changing the entire corporate tax structure for the US. But I think it would be pretty draconian of us to try to look it where our tax rates are going to go for next year, before we have some grater clarity on the overall federal corporate rate.

As usual, two components that we want to look at on margin for the rest of the year.  The first component is revenue where frankly we have the most uncertainty and obviously we are guiding down on revenue you can get it from the math for the fourth quarter, and three out of four the business lines in Moody’s Investor Service, so we expect could come off in the fourth quarter.  Moody’s Analytics however we expect to be moving upward in the fourth quarter.
Now expenses, we started the year at $327 million in the first quarter and we told everyone we would ramp expenses around $40 million over the course of the year.  And that looked to be about right.  And actually, expenses will be down we think perhaps a little bit from where we were fourth quarter last year.  Then we're watching our expenses.  We did a pretty good job with expense control in the third quarter.  We'll continue to work on that again, uncertainly around the incentive compensation fees.
But we would expect in the fourth quarter margin if you do the math it’s probably going to be in the low 30s given what we are expecting right now.  Now we do have unusual uncertainty for the fourth quarter of the year.  We could see revenue come off further which would obviously be hurtful to the margin.  We could see revenue move up by a similar amount.
Our guidance incorporates that we could see as much of the $40 million swing to the downside and still hit the bottom end.  We could see that swing to the upside, and obviously we might do better but it’s just extremely difficult to tell at this time.  So, margin, we have got it $38 million to $40 million and we have got it for the year, and we have been pretty thoughtfully about that.

For investment period, 21% of the total $100 million and $29 million was investment, Craig.  Now the place where we have, there are two places where we have challenges here which is interesting to look at Craig for.  Basically, we are running at 12% of the whole CFG line in high-yield and that compares if you want to look at it sequentially in the second quarter of last year we were at 23% of that line running high-yield.  The numbers in terms of the absolute number is $15 million for third quarter down from $45 million in the second quarter.  So that is where we have a revenue issue.
Bank loan is similarly, 16% of overall CFG issuance at $21 million, and if you look at the second quarter it was 22%.  So the absolute number was $43.6 million in the second quarter.  So again, we have had a considerable job in bank loan ratings.
Other accounts, 51% for this quarter versus 37% and that’s looking a little bit flatter from second quarter to third quarter.  So again, from $200 million second quarter to a $129 million in third quarter that’s the tricky part of what we are wrestling with here and that’s why it makes it more difficult to know where we are going for the fourth quarter.  Let me give you structured, you want structured as well as FIG.

I am a bit more optimistic about the run rate for structured finance than I was, because of what we have seen in the second and third quarters.

So, let me run through this again let me look at the big dollar changes because I think that would be helpful. So in second quarter of 2011 obviously, issuance was very, very strong.  We had a record quarter in corporate finance of $200 million of issuance. For corporate finance for this quarter, third quarter we down to $129 million so we lost about $70 million. Now investment trade didn’t suffer quite as much.  We went from about $38 million to about $27 million, but again the high yield business went from $45 million to $15 million and the bank loan business went from almost 47 to $21 million. Other accounts a little bit more stable as well from sort of $74 million to $66 million. So of the $70 million difference of the change is attributable $52 million that is high yield in bank loans.
So, again we like to see those too such as comeback. And again, we would see a revenues swing to the upside or we could see revenue swing to the downside depending on what happens in the fourth quarter. Particularly with the corporate business, it is the toughest one for us to forecast right now because markets are obviously choppy.  We have weeks which are very strong in terms of issuance we have weeks which are almost closedown in terms of issuance.
The general view in November we’ll hearing for just high grade.  Expectations running $80 billion of issuance for high grade, which should be about $20 billion a week which is good. But we are also cognizant that we only got sort of six more weeks to the year to go here obviously we are moving into the holiday period so we’re trying to be thoughtful about this but it’s pretty tricky to forecast.

We’re hoping as we said that we’ll get back to a more typical high grade issuance month of $80 billion for the month of November running about $20 billion a week but again we have to wait and see.
What we’ve seen as the markets open up opportunistic strong issuers jump back in and they are continuing to finance.  Given that many corporates have a lot of cash offshore we think that people are still looking to finance and we see some cases of people financing for share buybacks, also for CapEx and to a lesser extent it’s still there for M&A activity.

What we are also looking to is the degree of financing that is going to occur out of the refi market as a result of M&A activity capital raising for general corporate purposes, share repurchase and the like and that’s what we will associate with issuance activity in a reinvigorated economic environment.  So, its trade-off between the very low rate that we might see in a more of a refi and environment and perhaps higher rates but more narrow spreads in a stronger overall economic environment that would drive financing for different reasons other than just refi.

After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.
Third quarter revenue of $531 million increased 4% over the prior year period, with strong performance by Moody's Analytics offsetting a modest revenue decline at Moody's Investors Service. Operating income for the third quarter totaled $196 million, also 4% above the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.57 decreased 2% year-over-year and included a benefit of $0.03 from the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. While volatile market condition in the U.S. and Europe may continue, we are reaffirming our 2011 EPS guidance of $2.38 to $2.48, and we expect to be at the upper end of the range.
Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 17% increase from the first 9 months of 2010. Expenses were $997 million, up 12%. And operating income of $716 million increased 24% from the prior year period. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.2 billion, an increase of 18% from the year-ago period. Moody's Analytics revenue was $512 million, 15% higher than the prior year period.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates."

Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 1%. U.S. third quarter revenue decreased 1% to $274 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 9% to $257 million and represented 48% of Moody's total revenue, up from 46% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $314 million represented 59% of the total compared to 55% in the prior year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses, Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $351 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was down 5%. U.S. revenue decreased 4% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S., revenue increased 1% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter decreased 11% from the year-ago period to $129 million. Revenue was down 11% in the U.S., while outside the U.S., revenue was lower by 10% year-over-year. The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance primarily in speculative grade bonds in both the U.S. and Europe.
Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $82 million, 17% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 20% year-over-year primarily due to strength in commercial real estate. Most other areas of the U.S. structured finance market remained weak, including residential mortgage-backed securities.
Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 14%, driven primarily by European covered bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities in Europe and Asia.
Global financial institutions revenue of $72 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2010, with U.S. revenue declining 1%, while non-U.S. revenue fell 3%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure finance business declined 2% year-over-year to $68 million. Revenue decreased 8% in the U.S., reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure programs. Non-U.S. revenue increased 13% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.
Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue from Moody's Analytics of $180 million was up 16% from the third quarter of 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. revenue grew by 6% year-over-year to $76 million.  Non-U.S. revenue increased by 24% to $104 million and represented 58% of total Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $115 million increased 9% from the prior year period and represented about 64% of total MA revenue as we continue to see good demand for products across our portfolio.
Revenue from risk management software of $48 million increased 12% over last year's third quarter performance. Due to the variable nature of project timings, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than doubled to $17 million, primarily reflecting the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010.
Turning now to expenses, Moody's third quarter expenses was $335 million, an increase of 3% compared to third quarter of 2010 or 1% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Moody's reported operating margin for the third quarter was 36.9%, essentially flat to the third quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5% compared to 24.4% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit associated with foreign earnings in 2010, partially offset by a tax benefit from the settlement of state tax audits in the current period.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation and stock buyback. During the third quarter of 2011, Moody's repurchased 6.8 million shares and issued 0.1 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of September 30 totaled 222 million, representing a 5% decline from a year earlier. As of quarter's end, Moody's had 0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. 
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under a revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalent were $854 million, an increase of $61 million from a year earlier.  Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.  
We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Ray."

I'll continue with the update on regulatory and litigation developments. In the U.S., following the SEC's August comment deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is expected to adopt final rules by June 2012. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, regulatory authorities have begun reviewing their use of ratings and regulation and considering alternative measures as replacements. 
In September, a separate SEC comment period closed regarding a Dodd-Frank mandated study about, among other matters, feasibility of establishing an alternative system for allocating credit ratings assignments for structured finance products. The study, which the SEC expects to complete by December 2012, stems from what's known as the Franken Amendment. Also in September, the SEC released its first annual report summarizing its examination of NRSROs as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. It did not determine that any finding discussed in the report constituted a material regulatory deficiency. 
Turning to Europe, transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA became effective in July. We expect the decision on Moody's registration application of our EU-based entities to be made before year-end.
As many of you know, the European Commission is expected to propose new rules for the rating agency industry, drafts of which have been commented on by the media and some European officials. We also understand that the commission intends to release a formal proposal by mid to late November. Once the proposal is published, it will then be debated among members of the European parliament, the commission and members of the European Council of Finance Ministers. The suggested measures that have been reported on by the media address sovereign ratings, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, rotation of rating agencies, liability and competition.  We will continue to consult with relevant authorities and others as to the specifics of these draft proposals.
While new rules globally entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not [indiscernible] fundamental business objective to provide the highest quality independent credit opinions, research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that are aligned with the G-20 statements and directives. 
Finally, as some of you may now, a hearing is scheduled for tomorrow in one of our litigation matters, a case brought in California by CalPERS regarding certain of our salable SIV ratings. At that hearing, the judge is expected to rule on whether the case should be dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statute, which defends free speech on matters of public interest. While we don't know how the judge will rule, we are obviously hopeful that we will prevail on our motion at which point the case would be dismissed. Even if we do not ultimately prevail on our motion under the anti-SLAPP statute, there will be further opportunities to seek dismissal.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full-year guidance. Moody's outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and if actual condition is different from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.  Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
As mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance for the full-year of 2011 of $2. 38 to $2.48, and we now expect to be at the upper end of the range.  For Moody's overall, the company now expects full-year 2011 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 expenses are now projected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 39% due to the planned increase in expenses and lower expected revenue in the fourth quarter. The effected tax rate is now expected to be approximately 31%.  Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
At Moody's Investors Service, revenue for full-year 2011 is now expected to increase from the high single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is projected to increase in the low-teens percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now forecast to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Financial institution is now forecast to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to be about flat.
For Moody's Analytics full-year 2011, revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics, and in the low to mid single-digit percent range for risk management software.
Professional services revenue is still projected to more than double, primarily reflecting revenue from the late 2010 acquisition of CSI Global Education and very strong performance in the risk management advisory business. Moody's Analytics revenue is now expected to increase from the high single-digit percent range in the U.S. and in the mid-teens percent range outside the U.S.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have."

So it's not a change in the topics there being debated in the regulatory area, although from what I understand, some of the proposals in Europe would -- for how to address those issues would be different than what we've seen, for example, in the U.S. I don't think I can go into a whole lot of detail on this at this point, because again, we haven't seen any formal proposals introduced and we don't know what any formal proposals ultimately going to look like. But from what I understand, there are some things that we would believe are good ideas and some things that we would think are probably not such good ideas.  Included in the former category would be reducing over-reliance on rating agencies and improving information transparency. I think those are workable ideas.  I think they can develop some useful solutions in those areas. Some of the ideas that we probably wouldn't be as supportive of, I think, are also probably more unworkable."

The issue for us is we're not always sure. Well, we don't know when separate state audit matters will be resolved, which is what causes the uncertainty. It frankly makes it very difficult to predict where the tax rate is going. I'd be particularly hesitant to comment on 2012 tax rates because as you know, there are some pretty significant proposals splitting around out there in terms of changing the entire corporate tax structure for the U.S. So I think it would be a pretty draconian of us to try to look at where our tax rates are going to go for next year before we have some grater clarity on the overall federal corporate rate. So I think we're going to have to wait until February when we give guidance for the year to get more information on that. Sorry about that."

As usual, 2 components that we want to look at for margin for the rest of the year. The first component is revenue where frankly we have the most uncertainty, and obviously, we are guiding down on revenue. You can get it from the math for the fourth quarter. And 3 out of 4 of the business lines in Moody's Investors Service we expect could come off in the fourth quarter. Moody's Analytics, however, we expect to be moving upward in the fourth quarter. Now expenses, we started the year at $327 million in the first quarter, and we told everyone we would ramp expenses around $40 million over the course of the year. And that looks to be about right. And actually, expenses will be down, we think, perhaps a little bit from where we were fourth quarter last year. They were watching our expenses. We did a pretty good job with expense control in the third quarter.  We'll continue to work on that, again, uncertainty around the incentive compensation fees. But we would expect that the fourth quarter margin, if you do the math, it's probably going to be in the low 40s given what we are expecting right now.  Now we do have unusual uncertainty for the fourth quarter of the year. We could see revenue come off further, which would obviously be hurtful to the margin. We could see revenue move up by a similar amount. Our guidance incorporates that we could see as much as a $40 million swing to the downside and still hit the bottom end. We could see that swing to the upside and obviously we might do better, but it's just extremely difficult to tell at this time.  So, margin, we've got it $38 million to $40 million, and we have got it for the year. And we've been pretty thoughtful about that."

The commercial real estate market, although as we said we're not expecting a strong year-end, still has a great deal of real estate financing that needs to occur. And the auto receivable sector has been strong throughout. Some areas where issuance is more in doubt, we're going to all be waiting for more permanent resolution of U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities and how -- what role the private market will play in that sector. And also areas such as credit card and student loans had been under more pressure, even because of the performance of the asset classes there because of changes in regulation."

So let me run through this again and let me look at the big dollar changes because I think that would be helpful. So in second quarter of 2011, obviously, issuance was very, very strong.  We had a little record quarter in corporate finance of $200 million of issuance. For our corporate finance for this quarter, third quarter, we're down to $129 million. So we lost about $70 million. Now investment grade didn't suffer quite as much. We went from about $38 million to about $27 million. But again, the high-yield business went from $45 million to $15 million, and the bank loan business went from almost $47 million to $21 million. Other accounts, a little bit more stable as well from sort of $74 million to $66 million. So of the $70 million difference, the change is attributable. $52 million of that is high yield and bank loans. So, again, we'd like to see those 2 factors come back. And, again, we could see a revenue swing to the upside or we could see a revenue swing to the downside depending on what happens in the fourth quarter, particularly with the corporate business. It's the toughest one for us to forecast right now because markets are obviously choppy.  We have weeks which are very strong in terms of issuance, we have weeks which are almost closed down in terms of issuance. The general view on November, we're hearing for just high grade.  Expectations are running around $80 billion of issuance for high grade, which should be about $20 billion a week, which is good. But we're also cognizant, Doug, that we've only got sort of 6 more weeks of the year to go here. Obviously, we're moving into the holiday period. So we're trying to be thoughtful about this, but it's pretty tricky to forecast."

You might want to take a look at it. The churn would be, while we saw pull forward in the first and second quarter, we saw an air pocket or sort of a stalling out in the third quarter. You can tell by the numbers that I just gave to Doug and to Craig about what the magnitude of that was. So we're hoping, as we said, that we'll get back to a more typical high-grade issuance month of $80 billion for the month of November, running about $20 billion a week. But, again, we have to wait and see. What we've seen is just the markets open up, opportunistic strong issuers jump back in and they are continuing to finance. Given that many corporates have a lot of cash offshore, we think that people are still looking to finance, and we see some cases of people financing for share buybacks, also for CapEx and to a lesser extent, it's still there for M&A activity.  The role of refinancing still exists, but take a look at that next week when we put up the new investor deck."

It has been pushed out from the -- the height of the wall is lower in 2012 than it was early this year, and that's not surprising.  So what I think -- I think we would describe this as, the refinancing that is going to occur is going to have an opportunistic flavor to it. And if rates come in and there is an opportunity to refinance early at good spreads, that's going to be done. What we're also looking to is the degree of financing that is going to occur out of the refi market as a result of M&A activity, general -- capital raising for general corporate purposes, share repurchase and the like. And that's what we would associate with issuance activity in a reinvigorated economic environment. So it's a trade-off between the very low rates that we might see in a more of a pure refi environment and perhaps higher rates but more narrow spreads in a stronger overall economic environment that would drive financing for different reasons other than just refi."

I don't think they are going to be delevering if they are in a business expansion mode, and we would see more of a one-to-one.  If they continue to feel that risk is bad, as they did in August and September, then we may very well see them using some of their cash to delever.  I think also that a lot of finance executives that have come through this period are thinking about having more cash-on-hand on a permanent basis than they would have before the financial crisis.

I will then speak to recent regulatory developments, comment briefly on one of our litigation matters and finish with an update of our outlook for 2011. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.
Third quarter revenue of $531 million increased 4% over the prior year period, with strong performance by Moody's Analytics offsetting a modest revenue decline at Moody's Investors Service. Operating income for the third quarter totaled $196 million, also 4% above the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.57 decreased 2% year-over-year and included a benefit of $0.03 from the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. While volatile market condition in the U.S. and Europe may continue, we are reaffirming our 2011 EPS guidance of $2.38 to $2.48, and we expect to be at the upper end of the range.
Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 17% increase from the first 9 months of 2010. Expenses were $997 million, up 12%. And operating income of $716 million increased 24% from the prior year period. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.2 billion, an increase of 18% from the year-ago period. Moody's Analytics revenue was $512 million, 15% higher than the prior year period.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates."

Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 1%. U.S. third quarter revenue decreased 1% to $274 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 9% to $257 million and represented 48% of Moody's total revenue, up from 46% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $314 million represented 59% of the total compared to 55% in the prior year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses, Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $351 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was down 5%. U.S. revenue decreased 4% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S., revenue increased 1% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter decreased 11% from the year-ago period to $129 million. Revenue was down 11% in the U.S., while outside the U.S., revenue was lower by 10% year-over-year. The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance primarily in speculative grade bonds in both the U.S. and Europe.
Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $82 million, 17% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 20% year-over-year primarily due to strength in commercial real estate. Most other areas of the U.S. structured finance market remained weak, including residential mortgage-backed securities.
Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 14%, driven primarily by European covered bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities in Europe and Asia.
Global financial institutions revenue of $72 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2010, with U.S. revenue declining 1%, while non-U.S. revenue fell 3%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure finance business declined 2% year-over-year to $68 million. Revenue decreased 8% in the U.S., reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure programs. Non-U.S. revenue increased 13% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.
Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue from Moody's Analytics of $180 million was up 16% from the third quarter of 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. revenue grew by 6% year-over-year to $76 million.  Non-U.S. revenue increased by 24% to $104 million and represented 58% of total Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $115 million increased 9% from the prior year period and represented about 64% of total MA revenue as we continue to see good demand for products across our portfolio.
Revenue from risk management software of $48 million increased 12% over last year's third quarter performance. Due to the variable nature of project timings, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than doubled to $17 million, primarily reflecting the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010.
Turning now to expenses, Moody's third quarter expenses was $335 million, an increase of 3% compared to third quarter of 2010 or 1% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Moody's reported operating margin for the third quarter was 36.9%, essentially flat to the third quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5% compared to 24.4% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit associated with foreign earnings in 2010, partially offset by a tax benefit from the settlement of state tax audits in the current period.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation and stock buyback. During the third quarter of 2011, Moody's repurchased 6.8 million shares and issued 0.1 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of September 30 totaled 222 million, representing a 5% decline from a year earlier. As of quarter's end, Moody's had 0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. 
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under a revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalent were $854 million, an increase of $61 million from a year earlier.  Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.  
We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Ray."

I'll continue with the update on regulatory and litigation developments. In the U.S., following the SEC's August comment deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is expected to adopt final rules by June 2012. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, regulatory authorities have begun reviewing their use of ratings and regulation and considering alternative measures as replacements. 
In September, a separate SEC comment period closed regarding a Dodd-Frank mandated study about, among other matters, feasibility of establishing an alternative system for allocating credit ratings assignments for structured finance products. The study, which the SEC expects to complete by December 2012, stems from what's known as the Franken Amendment. Also in September, the SEC released its first annual report summarizing its examination of NRSROs as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. It did not determine that any finding discussed in the report constituted a material regulatory deficiency. 
Turning to Europe, transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA became effective in July. We expect the decision on Moody's registration application of our EU-based entities to be made before year-end.
As many of you know, the European Commission is expected to propose new rules for the rating agency industry, drafts of which have been commented on by the media and some European officials. We also understand that the commission intends to release a formal proposal by mid to late November. Once the proposal is published, it will then be debated among members of the European parliament, the commission and members of the European Council of Finance Ministers. The suggested measures that have been reported on by the media address sovereign ratings, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, rotation of rating agencies, liability and competition.  We will continue to consult with relevant authorities and others as to the specifics of these draft proposals.
While new rules globally entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not [indiscernible] fundamental business objective to provide the highest quality independent credit opinions, research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that are aligned with the G-20 statements and directives. 
Finally, as some of you may now, a hearing is scheduled for tomorrow in one of our litigation matters, a case brought in California by CalPERS regarding certain of our salable SIV ratings. At that hearing, the judge is expected to rule on whether the case should be dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statute, which defends free speech on matters of public interest. While we don't know how the judge will rule, we are obviously hopeful that we will prevail on our motion at which point the case would be dismissed. Even if we do not ultimately prevail on our motion under the anti-SLAPP statute, there will be further opportunities to seek dismissal.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full-year guidance. Moody's outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and if actual condition is different from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.  Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
As mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance for the full-year of 2011 of $2. 38 to $2.48, and we now expect to be at the upper end of the range.  For Moody's overall, the company now expects full-year 2011 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 expenses are now projected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 39% due to the planned increase in expenses and lower expected revenue in the fourth quarter. The effected tax rate is now expected to be approximately 31%.  Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
At Moody's Investors Service, revenue for full-year 2011 is now expected to increase from the high single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is projected to increase in the low-teens percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now forecast to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Financial institution is now forecast to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to be about flat.
For Moody's Analytics full-year 2011, revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics, and in the low to mid single-digit percent range for risk management software.
Professional services revenue is still projected to more than double, primarily reflecting revenue from the late 2010 acquisition of CSI Global Education and very strong performance in the risk management advisory business. Moody's Analytics revenue is now expected to increase from the high single-digit percent range in the U.S. and in the mid-teens percent range outside the U.S.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have."

But I would say that the issues being addressed in the proposals in Europe are very similar to what we've been dealing with over the last few years in the U.S. and in some other jurisdictions around competition and conflicts of interest, the issue about over-reliance on credit ratings by market participants, enhanced transparency in the system, whether the liability standards for assigning credit ratings are appropriate or should be changed. So it's not a change in the topics there being debated in the regulatory area, although from what I understand, some of the proposals in Europe would -- for how to address those issues would be different than what we've seen, for example, in the U.S. I don't think I can go into a whole lot of detail on this at this point, because again, we haven't seen any formal proposals introduced and we don't know what any formal proposals ultimately going to look like. But from what I understand, there are some things that we would believe are good ideas and some things that we would think are probably not such good ideas.  Included in the former category would be reducing over-reliance on rating agencies and improving information transparency. I think those are workable ideas.  I think they can develop some useful solutions in those areas. Some of the ideas that we probably wouldn't be as supportive of, I think, are also probably more unworkable."

It frankly makes it very difficult to predict where the tax rate is going. I'd be particularly hesitant to comment on 2012 tax rates because as you know, there are some pretty significant proposals splitting around out there in terms of changing the entire corporate tax structure for the U.S. So I think it would be a pretty draconian of us to try to look at where our tax rates are going to go for next year before we have some greater clarity on the overall federal corporate rate.

As usual, 2 components that we want to look at for margin for the rest of the year. The first component is revenue where frankly we have the most uncertainty, and obviously, we are guiding down on revenue. You can get it from the math for the fourth quarter. And 3 out of 4 of the business lines in Moody's Investors Service we expect could come off in the fourth quarter. Moody's Analytics, however, we expect to be moving upward in the fourth quarter. Now expenses, we started the year at $327 million in the first quarter, and we told everyone we would ramp expenses around $40 million over the course of the year. And that looks to be about right. And actually, expenses will be down, we think, perhaps a little bit from where we were fourth quarter last year. They were watching our expenses. We did a pretty good job with expense control in the third quarter.  We'll continue to work on that, again, uncertainty around the incentive compensation fees. But we would expect that the fourth quarter margin, if you do the math, it's probably going to be in the low 40s given what we are expecting right now.  Now we do have unusual uncertainty for the fourth quarter of the year. We could see revenue come off further, which would obviously be hurtful to the margin. We could see revenue move up by a similar amount. Our guidance incorporates that we could see as much as a $40 million swing to the downside and still hit the bottom end. We could see that swing to the upside and obviously we might do better, but it's just extremely difficult to tell at this time.  So, margin, we've got it $38 million to $40 million, and we have got it for the year. And we've been pretty thoughtful about that."

We've got some parts of our business that are more subject to capital market activity and issuance trends and some parts of the business, particularly over in Moody's Analytics side, which are relatively immune to issuance cycles. I'd just add that we have been in a period of low issuance for the last few months. And as you can tell from our guidance for the full-year 2011, we are not expecting a large pickup in the fourth quarter. But I also commented that the pipelines, particularly in corporate finance, are pretty strong. And that is issuance activity that is looking for an opportunity, with spreads narrowing to get into the market. So there is reason to feel pretty good about the future.

The numbers in terms of the absolute number is $15 million for third quarter, down from $45 million in the second quarter. So that is where we have a revenue issue. Bank loan similarly is 16% of overall CFG issuance at $21 million. And if you look at the second quarter, it was 22%. So the absolute number was $43.6 million in the second quarter. So, again, we've had a considerable drop in bank loan ratings. Other accounts, 51% for this quarter versus 37%. And that's looking a little bit flatter from second quarter to third quarter. So, again, from $200 million second quarter to $129 million in third quarter, that's the tricky part of what we're wrestling with here, and that's where it makes it more difficult to know where we're going for the fourth quarter.

So let me run through this again and let me look at the big dollar changes because I think that would be helpful. So in second quarter of 2011, obviously, issuance was very, very strong.  We had a little record quarter in corporate finance of $200 million of issuance. For our corporate finance for this quarter, third quarter, we're down to $129 million. So we lost about $70 million. Now investment grade didn't suffer quite as much. We went from about $38 million to about $27 million. But again, the high-yield business went from $45 million to $15 million, and the bank loan business went from almost $47 million to $21 million. Other accounts, a little bit more stable as well from sort of $74 million to $66 million. So of the $70 million difference, the change is attributable. $52 million of that is high yield and bank loans. So, again, we'd like to see those 2 factors come back. And, again, we could see a revenue swing to the upside or we could see a revenue swing to the downside depending on what happens in the fourth quarter, particularly with the corporate business. It's the toughest one for us to forecast right now because markets are obviously choppy.  We have weeks which are very strong in terms of issuance, we have weeks which are almost closed down in terms of issuance. The general view on November, we're hearing for just high grade.  Expectations are running around $80 billion of issuance for high grade, which should be about $20 billion a week, which is good. But we're also cognizant, Doug, that we've only got sort of 6 more weeks of the year to go here. Obviously, we're moving into the holiday period. So we're trying to be thoughtful about this, but it's pretty tricky to forecast."

How should we think about the upcoming maturity schedule, specifically as it means to refis, now that corporate balance sheets of yours are flushed with cash as they've ever been. Should we think about the amount of that issuance relative to what's maturing coming down as cash is used to delever? And how do you think about that for projecting your pipeline?"

I would urge you to look at our third quarter investor deck, which we'll be putting up after we file the 10-Q, which will be sort of middle of next week, I think. And we'll have that chart in there. You might want to take a look at it. The churn would be, while we saw pull forward in the first and second quarter, we saw an air pocket or sort of a stalling out in the third quarter. You can tell by the numbers that I just gave to Doug and to Craig about what the magnitude of that was. So we're hoping, as we said, that we'll get back to a more typical high-grade issuance month of $80 billion for the month of November, running about $20 billion a week. But, again, we have to wait and see. What we've seen is just the markets open up, opportunistic strong issuers jump back in and they are continuing to finance. Given that many corporates have a lot of cash offshore, we think that people are still looking to finance, and we see some cases of people financing for share buybacks, also for CapEx and to a lesser extent, it's still there for M&A activity.  The role of refinancing still exists, but take a look at that next week when we put up the new investor deck."

It has been pushed out from the -- the height of the wall is lower in 2012 than it was early this year, and that's not surprising.  So what I think -- I think we would describe this as, the refinancing that is going to occur is going to have an opportunistic flavor to it. And if rates come in and there is an opportunity to refinance early at good spreads, that's going to be done. What we're also looking to is the degree of financing that is going to occur out of the refi market as a result of M&A activity, general -- capital raising for general corporate purposes, share repurchase and the like. And that's what we would associate with issuance activity in a reinvigorated economic environment. So it's a trade-off between the very low rates that we might see in a more of a pure refi environment and perhaps higher rates but more narrow spreads in a stronger overall economic environment that would drive financing for different reasons other than just refi."

And I think the one other bit of my question will be though, as we look at the wall of financing, as we look at those numbers about what's maturing in each of the upcoming years, should we think about the ratio being one-to-one? So if, say, if a $100 was maturing, should a $100 be issued? Or is it going to be something less than that as companies delever?"

I don't think they are going to be delevering if they are in a business expansion mode, and we would see more of a one-to-one.  If they continue to feel that risk is bad, as they did in August and September, then we may very well see them using some of their cash to delever.  I think also that a lot of finance executives that have come through this period are thinking about having more cash-on-hand on a permanent basis than they would have before the financial crisis.  And so I don't think that a return to historical cash-on-hand level is necessarily the central case."

One is, if there are -- if there's reduced headcount at our customers' fewer number of seats, that may limit the number of licensees that we have for those seats and a reduction in users per customer. On the other hand, the reduction in work force at firms impacts what they were able to do themselves. And they go outside and look for expertise in risk management, risk modeling, risk metrics that we provide and that provides a very good sales opportunity for us.
