I am Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer.
Today we plan to cover our 2010 yearend quarter results, provide a business update and reaffirm our 2011 guidance. Please note there are slides that accompany the conference call which are available on our web page.
I want to remind you that some of the comments that we make today will contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.
You'll note that today's press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. 2010 ongoing earnings per share were $1.62 compared with $1.50 per share in 2009. 2010 GAAP earnings per share were $1.62 compared with $1.48 in 2009.
We believe that ongoing earnings, which remove the impact of our discontinued company-owned life insurance program, Medicare Part D and discontinued operations provide a meaningful comparison. As a result we will discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and ongoing earnings results.
I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.

I'm pleased to announce that Xcel Energy enjoyed another successful year. I'll touch on few of the highlights and Dave will discuss our detailed results in a few moments.
As Paul just mentioned, we reported 2010 ongoing earnings of $1.62 per share compared with a $1.50 per share in 2009. We feel good about delivering earnings results in the upper half of our 2010 earnings guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65 per share. This marks the sixth consecutive year that we've met or exceeded our annual earnings objective.
We were also successful in meeting other financial objectives. We raised the annual dividend $0.03 or 30% to $1.01 per share, and our credit ratings also improved, as S&P raised its rating on Xcel Energy and three of our operating companies by one notch.
In a year where we experienced hot weather throughout our system, I am proud that we maintained our system integrity and once again delivered a high level of customer service. We achieved a customer satisfaction rating of 92% for the third consecutive year.
In 2010, we completed two major construction projects: Comanche 3, an 800-megawatt coal plant in Colorado; and Nobles, a 201-megawatt wind farm in Minnesota. We also began construction on the CapX2020 transmission project.
In addition, we finalized the purchase of two natural gas plants in Calpine. This asset acquisition will save our customers' money in the long run and will also be accretive to 2011 earnings. We were able to finance this transaction and other components of our growth strategy by raising $1.9 billion in the debt and equity market at very attractive rates.
Lastly, I'll provide a few comments regarding the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act in Colorado. In December, the Colorado Commission approved a plan for PSCO to reduce annual emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 70% to 80%. The plan is designed to achieve this goal through a combination of retiring older, less efficient coal plants, returning to natural gas and installing emission controls by 2017.
The primary difference between our recommendation and the CPUC approved plan has to do with Cherokee Unit 4. Under the approved plan, we will fuel switch Cherokee Unit 4 to natural gas.
The Commission also provided for a recovery on construction work in progress and future rate cases. In addition, they incurred stakeholder meetings to discuss a multiyear rate plan.
In January, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission approved the cooperation of the Clean Air Clean Jobs plan into Colorado's Regional Haze State Implementation Plan. Next in the process, the Colorado legislature must approve the State Implementation Plan. Upon legislative approval, the State Implementation Plan will be sent to the Governor for his signature.
Our total investment for the plan is estimated to be approximately $1 billion over the next seven years and is expected to increase customer bills on an average by about 2% annually.
I think this is another great example of our ability to work with key stakeholders to arrive at a creative solution to reduce emission while ensuring timely recovery of cost. In summary, this was a really great year for us.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Sparby who will walk you through our results and provide a regulatory update.

The increase was largely due to new electric rates in",1257,"Thanks, Ben. Let's now take a look at details of 2010 starting with a review of the annual financial results at each of our operating companies.
Earnings at PSCO increased by $0.14 per share in 2010. The increase was largely due to new electric rates in warmer summer temperatures, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes.
At NSP-Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.04 per share for the year, largely due to higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by warmer temperatures, incentives under our conservation programs and weather-normalized sales growth.
Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin decreased $0.01 per share due to fuel recovery and higher O&M expenses, partially offset by warmer-than-normal temperatures and the implementation of new electric rates.
Earnings increased $0.02 per share at SPS due to electric sales growth, the reversal of previously established fuel cost allocation reserves and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher O&M expenses.
Now, I'd like to discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement, beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased by $408 million for the year. Approximately $228 million of the improvement in electric margin was due to the implementation of new rates in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico.
Warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2010 compared with cooler-than-normal temperatures last year resulted in a $65 million improvement in electric margin. Conservation and DSM revenue, which is partially offset by expenses, contributed $72 million of the improvement.
Finally, retail sales, adjusted for weather and the sale of our Lubbock distribution assets, increased 1.4% and contributed $18 million of improvement in margin. Other factors that had a smaller impact on 2010 electric margin are detailed in our earnings release.
Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $20 million for the year. The increase was driven primarily by conservation revenue, which is largely offset by conservation and DSM expenses. In addition, we implemented new rates in Minnesota.
Higher costs partially offset the increases in electric and gas margin. We are investing significant levels of capital, which is growing rate base 7% annually. As you'd expect, this is resulting in additional O&M, depreciation and interest expense.
In 2010, our O&M expenses increased $149 million or about 8%. As a reminder, we decided to invest additional O&M in our generation, transmission and distribution system after a summer of prolonged hot weather. We made those investments to ensure that our customer service and reliability remain at levels our customers have come to expect.
Approximately $77 million or roughly one-half of the increase in 2010 O&M expenses came from higher plant generation, nuclear plant generation and nuclear outage costs. These costs increased as result of higher levels of maintenance and overhaul work, incremental operating costs associated with new facilities and increased security costs for nuclear plants.
Other factors contributing to the increase in O&M expense included $24 million of higher labor cost, $18 million of higher contract labor cost, $15 million of higher employee benefit cost largely, due to rising pension cost, and other items on totaling an increase of $15 million.
Looking ahead at 2011, we project our O&M expenses to increase approximately 4%.
Now, also offsetting the improvement in margin, depreciation and amortization rose $41 million or about 5%. The increase was related to Comanche 3 going into service in the second quarter and our continued investment in our utility system.
Turning to income taxes, our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations came in at 36.7% and was 160 basis points higher than last year. The effective tax rate experience from 2010 was due to the following items: the elimination of tax benefits from Medicare Part D subsidies and an adjustment related to the COLI Tax Court proceedings. Those items were partially offset by the reversal of evaluation allowance for certain state tax credit carryovers. We anticipate that our 2011 effective tax rate will be in the 34% to 36% range.
Now, let me give you an update on our pending rate cases. In November, we filed a request at Minnesota to increase electric rates approximately $150 million or 5.6%. The filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and 11.25% ROE, a rate base of $5.6 billion and a 52.6% equity ratio. We also requested to increase 2012 rates by an additional $48 million for known and measurable cost increases. Interim rates of $123 million subject to refund went into effective earlier this month. We anticipate a decision from the Minnesota Commission in the fourth quarter of 2011.
In December, we filed a request to increase electric rates in North Dakota by approximately $20 million or 12%. The filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year, a requested of 11.25% and electric rate base of $328 million and an equity ratio of 52.6%. We also requested to increase 2012 rates by additional 4 million or 2.6% to recover certain known and measurable cost increases.
In January, the North Dakota Commission approved our request for interim rates of approximately $17 million effective in February. We anticipate a decision from the North Dakota Commission in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Now in December, we filed a request to increase Colorado retail natural gas rates by approximately $28 million. The request is based on a 2011 forecast test year, a 10.9% ROE, a rate base of $1.1 billion and an equity ratio of 57%. We anticipate a decision later this year with new rates effective this summer.
In Texas, we have revised a request to increase electric rates by approximately $48 million on a net basis. The filing is based on a 2009 test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and 11.35% ROE, a rate base of a little over $1 billion and an equity ratio of 51%.
We continue to work with the various parties on a potential settlement. Last week, on behalf of all parties, we filed a motion to abate the procedural schedule to allow time to complete settlement negotiations. The parties agree to set February 11 as a deadline to file a stipulation or a status report. Interim rates subject to refund or the ability to surcharge will be in effect in the middle of February.
Looking ahead, we plan to file New Mexico electric and PSCO wholesale rate cases in the upcoming months. We will provide additional details on these cases as they become available.
In summary, this was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered on our financial objectives. We maintained historically high levels of customer service. We met or exceeded our energy efficiency and conservation program target. We completed a forward equity sale and issued bonds at record low coupon levels. We completed construction projects on time and on budget. We acquired two natural gas plants. And we agreed to a comprehensive plan to invest $1 billion to reduce emissions in Colorado.
Our efforts were also reflected in our stock price. For the third year in a row, shares of Xcel Energy outperformed our peer group of mid-to-large cap regulated utilities. When taking into account the reinvestment of our dividends, we delivered a total return of more than 16%.
We expect continuing success in 2011 and are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Please note there are modest adjustments to the earnings guidance assumptions included in our earnings release. These changes largely reflect our current information and 2010 actual results and will not have a material impact on our projected results.
This concludes my prepared remarks. We are now ready for your questions.

I think the controversy is really kind of localized in our service territory that are mining. And as you know, the Act itself had a bit of a controversy nationally, the kind of a battleground for coal versus gas. And so I think we are seeing a little bit of the residual of that.
We had to do something to meet the haze requirements. I think we did a very balanced plan. And I think when you look at the facts, we're still going to burn coal and we are going to modernize the infrastructure, which a lot of this is about, and address haze and other things. And we made a decision to put some pollution control equipment on more modern plant with the later vintage, but some of these plants that frankly go back to the ice and hot era and are right in the heart of the city, we just determine that it was better to re-power and use those sites, but go to gas and rebalance our portfolio.
Last year, with Comanche 3 coming on, a very new modern plant at a price point, we burnt more than 70% of our energy in coal. So this allows us to rebalance the portfolio, modernize and do all the good things and I think at a very good price point for our customers. However, it is always the local few that aren't happy. And that's what I think you are seeing here.

We're well positioned. You saw in our report that we gave in December to all of our investors that we've anticipated most of the regulations as the industry expects them to be put in place over the next several years. We've also of course made significant investments in the past anticipating this.
So although I think we could see, especially in later years, some variability, I think our CapEx as it reflects what we anticipate from EPA is probably pretty close.

There was a little bit of a downtick in residential in the fourth quarter. Some of the economists here, Jonathan, have suggested that the consumer is seeing some increases in CPI, but yet the unemployment rate is staying pretty steady. So although they are paying about 15% more for things like gasoline, there really hasn't been any more jobs. And that's probably one of the better explanations, which is a little bit of softness at the end of the year residentially.
Now, we do feel better going into 2011 about the economy than we did in 2010. Those industries that were the best performing sectors in 2010 continue to be strong in 2011. There is a little bit of uptick possibly there, but we are seeing some recovery in a couple of sectors of manufacturing also.

Today we plan to cover our first quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page.
I want to remind everyone that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.
You’ll notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. First quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.42 per share compared with $0.42 per share in 2010. First quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.42 per share compared with $0.36 per share in 2010. While there was no difference between GAAP and ongoing earnings in 2011, during the first quarter of 2010 ongoing earnings excluded the impact of adjustments related to the discontinued COLI program and adjustments associated with Medicare Part D subsidies.
Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental core earnings power. As a result, we will only discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings.
With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Ben.

As Paul mentioned, we reported first quarter ongoing earnings of $0.42 per share compared with $0.42 per share in 2010. I’m pleased to report that in addition to delivering a solid quarter financially, we continue to execute on our strategy. This morning I’ll focus my prepared comments on three items of current interest; our decision to terminate the Merricourt Wind project, our preliminary take on EPA’s proposed MACT rules and the depth of our safeguards at our nuclear operations. 
Earlier this month we terminated our argument with enXco for the development of the 150-megawatt Merricourt Wind Project in North Dakota. This was slated to be a $400 million project going into service in late 2011. We terminated the agreement because the project did not close by the contractual closing date and certain conditions required for closing were not satisfied.
These conditions included a failure to resolve concerns about potential adverse consequences the project could have on two endangered species and a failure to obtain the Certificate of Site Compatibility.
Given the uncertainty around the timing, cost and prospects for resolving these issues, we concluded it was in the best interest of our customers to terminate our agreement for this project based on our contractual rights. As a result of this decision, all of our investment in the project has been refunded.
We are now forecasting 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. We’ve also updated our Rider revenue guidance for 2011 to reflect the termination of this agreement. We remain interested in owning additional wind capacity and we are evaluating wind ownership opportunities in North Dakota. 
Turning to the recently proposed EPA rules, last month the EPA issued their proposed MACT rules addressing emission. Like many of our peers, we are in the process of evaluating what if any impact they may have on our operations. Based on our preliminary review we do not anticipate that the rule will require extensive changes to our plans at NSP and PSCo.
Our proactive steps to reduce emissions through the MERP project in Minnesota and our plans for the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act in Colorado put us in good position to comply with these rules. The proposed rules may have a significant impact on our facilities at SPS. However, at this point we do not anticipate a material change to our five-year CapEx forecast.
Lastly, I’ll comment on the safety of our nuclear fleet. In response to the recent events of Fukushima nuclear plants, all U.S. nuclear power plants including our Prairie Island in Minnesota have assessed their capability to maintain safety in the face of sever adverse events including the loss of significant operational and safety systems.
Nuclear power plants are built to withstand environmental hazards including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods. Even plants like ours that are located outside of areas with extensive seismic activity are designed for safety in the events of such a natural disaster.
As either of our plants experience in adverse events, our normal safety systems will keep the reactor core cool. We have two diesel generators for each unit, each one capable supplying power to meet all the safety related needs for that unit should the plant be disconnected from the power grid. In addition, our fuel tanks are stored and sealed below ground, which protects them from natural disasters. Should diesel generators fail, our facilities are equipped with battery backups systems. In addition, we have pumps that are driven by steam turbine that do not depend on electricity. In the unlikely event that none of the normal and backup safety systems were available to keep the reactor core cool, we have potable pumps that could be hoped up to supply cooling water into the reactor from the Mississippi River.
Finally, our plans have multiple sources of getting water into the core. For example, our Minnesota plant has eight independent ways to get water into the core during an emergency, while our Prairie Island plant has nine independent ways to get water into the core.
In summary, we believe the design of our plants, their geographic location and the robust nature of our systems significantly reduce the likelihood of an emergency on the scale experienced to Japan. And as said, there are always lessons learned from a disaster. We are participating in an industry-working group. The groups’ focus will center on understanding the events that occurred at Fukushima and recommending actions to improve the ability of U.S. plants to withstand similar events.
In the meantime, we continue to work to complete the life extension on our Prairie Island plant and our plant power operates at both Minnesota and Prairie Island. We anticipate the timeframe may be delayed a bit but we don't anticipate any material changes to our plants.
I’ll now turn the call over to Dave, who will walk you through our first quarter results and provide the regulatory update. Dave?

Now let's take a look at the details of our first quarter results beginning with a review of each of our subsidiaries. For the quarter, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.03 per share due to the impact of lower seasonal rates as well as higher",1137,"Thanks, Ben. Now let's take a look at the details of our first quarter results beginning with a review of each of our subsidiaries. For the quarter, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.03 per share due to the impact of lower seasonal rates as well as higher O&M expenses, property tax and depreciation expense. These expense increases were partially driven by capital investments made in 2010 including Comanche 3 and the natural gas plants we acquired in Colorado.
At NSP Minnesota, earnings increased by $0.04 per share due to interim rate increases in Minnesota, North Dakota as well as moderate sales growth and colder weather. The positive items were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property tax and depreciation expense. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin and SPS were both flat for the quarter.
Next, I’ll discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement beginning with retail, electric margin. Our first quarter electric margin increased by $90 million driven by two primary items. Retail rate increases in Colorado, Texas and Wisconsin along with interim rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota increased electric margin by $34 million. 
The impact of rate increases was partially offset by the impact of lower seasonal electric rates in Colorado. Electric margin also increased by $34 million due to recovery of the revenue requirements associated with PSCo’s acquisition of two natural gas facilities in late 2010. Please note that the increase in revenue requirements was partially offset by expenses such as higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. Increased rider, conservation and DSM revenue as well as increased sales and weather also contributed to the quarterly improvement in electric margin.
Natural gas margins increased $13 million in the first quarter due primarily to increased conservation and DSM revenue, which is partially offset by expenses. In addition, colder than normal weather also helped to offset a modest sales decrease.
Turning to expenses; first quarter O&M expenses increased about $29 million or about 6%, this was driven by several items including higher employee benefit expenses related to pension, higher labor cost, as well as higher plant generation and nuclear plant generation cost. We expect that O&M expense will increase up to 4% in 2011. The quarterly increase is slightly higher than our annual guidance largely due to the timing of O&M expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased about $19 million or 9%. This increase is consistent with our expectations and was driven by several plants coming online in 2010 including Comanche 3, the Nobles Wind Farm and the acquisition of two natural gas plants.
Finally other taxes increased approximately $15 million or 19% largely due to increased property tax from capital projects going into service primarily in Minnesota and Colorado.
Next I’ll discuss our 2011 financing plans. We have updated our plants to reflect the 2011 capital expenditure forecast of approximately $2 billion. As a result, we no longer plan to issue first mortgage bonds at NSP in Minnesota this year. The rest of our financing plans remain unchanged. In addition to periodic issuance and repayment of short-term debt, we plan to issue the following securities. Approximately $250 million to first mortgage bonds at PSCo during the second half of 2011 
SPS may issue approximately $150 million of bonds during the summer of 2011, and we anticipate issuing approximately $75 million of equity through Xcel Energy strip and various benefit programs in 2011. Naturally, our financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors.
Lastly I’ll provide an update on the rate cases that are currently underway in our various jurisdictions. In Minnesota, we have a pending electric case seeking a 2011 rate increase of a $148 million based on a 2011 forecast test year. 11.25% ROE, rate base of $5.6 billion and a 52.6% equity ratio. Interim rates of $123 million subject to refund went into effect in January. We also requested to increase 2012 rates by an additional $48 million for known and measurable cost increases. 
Earlier this month, Intervener’s filed direct testimony. The primary Intervener, the office of energy security, recommended an increase of approximately $57 million for 2011 based on a recommended ROE of 10.53% and an equity ratio of 52.6% they also recommended an additional $34 million rate increase for 2012.
While the overall recommendation was lower than anticipated, we plan to file a better testimony next month in which we will provide additional support for our position and adjust our request as appropriate. We are confident that we can work to many other more complex issues such as income tax adjustments and pension costs, which represent a large portion of the difference. We anticipated a decision from the Minnesota commission in the fourth quarter.
In Colorado, we have a $26 million gas request pending. The requested is based on a 2011 forecast test year at 10.9% ROE and an equity ratio of 57%. In April Intervener’s filed testimony and we were disappointed by the recommendations. The Staff recommended a rate decrease of $20 million based on a historical test year, a 9.375% ROE and a hypothetical capital structure within equity ratio of 51.8%.
Next month we’ll file rebuttal testimony in which we’ll provide a significant amount of additional support for our position on a number of issues, including the cost of capital. Ultimately we expect to reach constructive outcome.
In North Dakota we are requesting a $20 million electric rate increase. Interim rates of $17.4 million went into effect in February. Intervener testimony is scheduled for June and Rebuttal testimony in July and anticipate a decision later in 2011.
At SPS we filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an annual base rate increase of $20 million. Notably the rate filing is based on 2011 test year adjusted known and measurable changes for 2012. Rates are expected to be effective in early 2012.
In Texas the Commission approved our settlement, which provided for an overall increase of $23 million in 2011 and a stepping increase of $13 million for 2012. While there is still work to be done we continue to make progress at SPS.
Looking ahead, we’re required to file an electric and gas rate case in Wisconsin early in June. We’ll update you on this request during our second quarter conference call. You may have noticed that we have adjusted some of our key guidance assumptions in our earnings release. Specifically we reduced our rider revenue depreciation and interest expense assumptions to reflect the cancellation of the Merricourt project.
The overall impact is a reduction in EPS of about $0.02 per share for 2011. However, we’ve had another solid quarter and remain on track to deliver earnings within our annual earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share.
With that, let’s open it up for questions.

Today, we plan to cover our second quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share.
Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. I want to remind everyone that some of the comments we make may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.
You will notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Second quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.33 per share compared with $0.29 per share in 2010. The second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.33 per share compared with $0.30 per share in 2010.
While there are no differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings during the second quarter of 2011, the second quarter of 2010 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to recognition of a tax benefit related to a previously-held investment. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of results, and is representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental core earnings power. As a result, we will only discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings.

Dave will discuss second-quarter results in more detail in a few moments.
Let me now bring you up-to-date on some recent developments, all of which are favorable to our customers and supportive of our goals. We continue to make excellent progress on our transmission construction plans, as witnessed most recently with the completion of the Midway project in Colorado, a project consisting of 82 miles of 345 kV transmission line.
In June, we passed an important milestone regarding one of the CapX2020 transmission lines. The MISO Board of Directors granted approval for the Brookings transmission line on the condition that this project is included in the full portfolio of multi-value projects being approved in December 2011. Our CapX2020 transmission project remains on schedule. These transmission projects will facilitate access to renewable energy and improve reliability for our customers.
There are also positive developments regarding our nuclear operations. We are pleased that the NRC renewed the operating licenses for our Prairie Island nuclear generating units for 20 years. The renewal will allow units one and two to continue to provide emission-free power to our customers through 2033 and 2034, respectively. These units have operated in a safe, reliable, economic, and environmentally sound manner for nearly 40 years and our significant investments to support life extension will enable continued solid performance for the next 20 years.
Another positive event for our customers was the settlement we reached with the federal government regarding costs incurred by NSP and its customers related to the DOE’s failure to provide long-term spent fuel storage facility by the required deadline.
Under the terms of the settlement, the federal government will pay NSP approximately $100 million for spent fuel storage costs at our nuclear plants incurred through 2008. The federal government will also pay for spent fuel storage costs incurred from 2009 through 2013. We project those costs to be an incremental $100 million. Finally, the settlement does not address costs for used fuel storage after 2013, which could be the subject of future litigation. Settlement funds will be refunded to our customers in our NSP service territory.
As you know, we are striving to improve regulatory recovery and reduce regulatory lag in each of our jurisdictions. In that regard, another significant development occurred in Minnesota this spring, when a law was passed which allows utilities to file multi-year rate plans. As a result, we plan to seek to implement a multi-year plan that would establish rates for a three-year period, adjusting rates annually based on our investments and costs.
We will first propose a multi-year plan in Minnesota, potentially followed by similar proposals in North Dakota and South Dakota. Undertaking a significant change in our regulatory process will require collaboration with stakeholders to demonstrate the benefits of the plan. We anticipate proposing to implement the plan concurrent with the 2013 Minnesota Electric Rate Case filing expected to be filed in November 2012.
Finally, we continue to make significant progress on our efforts to provide our customers with competitively-priced renewable energy and to meet the 30% renewable portfolio standards in Minnesota and Colorado. We recently took advantage of favorable market conditions for the development of new wind projects by signing long-term renewable energy purchase agreements in Minnesota and Colorado.
In Minnesota, we contracted to purchase 200 megawatts of wind energy to be generated at the Prairie Rose Wind Farm in Southwest Minnesota; while in Colorado, we agreed to purchase 200 megawatts of wind energy from the Limon Wind Energy Center. In addition, we’ve been negotiating with several wind developers for the potential ownership of a wind project in North Dakota. These projects will provide our customers with competitively-priced energy and increase the amount of emission-free generation in our portfolio.
I’ll now turn the call over to Dave.

Let’s begin by reviewing second-quarter earnings results at our four utilities. Earnings at NSP Minnesota increased $0.04 per share, largely due to higher interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota, partially offset by higher property taxes and depreciation expense.
Earnings at PSCo decreased $0.02 per share, primarily due to seasonal rates which were implemented in June 2010, higher O&M, property taxes, and depreciation expense.
At NSP Wisconsin, earnings increased $0.01 per share, due to the implementation of new electric rates, partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation.
At SPS, earnings were flat for the quarter.
Now I’d like to discuss the items that affected certain lines of the income statement, beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased $84 million for the quarter, largely driven by three items: A $35 million increase in revenue requirements reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas facilities in Colorado. However, these revenue requirements are partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes, and financing costs; $23 million as a result of retail rate increases in several states; and $19 million for recovery of conservation and DSM expenses and incentives.
Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $7 million for the quarter, driven primarily by weather and recovery of conservation expenses and incentives. The improvement in our second-quarter electric and natural gas margins was partially offset by O&M expenses, which increased $16 million or 3%; higher plant generation costs; and higher labor and contract labor costs were the primary drivers of the increase.
Through the first half of the year, O&M expenses increased 4.5%, which is consistent with our expectations. We continue to project 2011 O&M costs to increase approximately 4%.
Also offsetting some of the improvement in margins, depreciation and amortization increased $17.8 million or 8.4% versus the comparable period last year due primarily to several plants going into service in 2010, including Comanche Unit 3, the Nobles Wind Project, and the acquisition of two natural gas plants. In addition, we experienced an $11.5 million or 14.2% increase in non-income taxes. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Colorado and Minnesota.
Let’s move on to our financing plans. Our plan enables us to maintain a solid balance sheet and strong credit metrics. As I’m sure you can appreciate, this plan is subject to change depending on the timing of capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions, and other factors. Our financing plans for 2011 are relatively light. We plan to issue approximately $250 million of first mortgage bonds at PSCo during the third quarter and approximately $200 million of bonds at SPS in the third quarter. In addition, Xcel Energy also anticipates issuing approximately $75 million of equity through our DRIP and various benefit programs.
Now I’ll provide an update on several of our pending and recent rate cases. In Minnesota, we are requesting $123 million of electric rate increase for 2011 and a $45 million increase for 2012, both based on a 10.85% ROE. The primary intervener, the Department of Energy Resources, is recommending a 2011 rate increase of approximately $85 million and a $34 million increase for 2012, based on a 10.37% ROE. The main difference between our position and the Department’s is ROE.
During the second quarter, we established a provision of approximately $15 million for the Minnesota Electric Rate Case. This reserve is sufficient to address an outcome that is more consistent with the Department’s position and NSP Minnesota’s position on several issues. However, we strongly believe that the appropriate level of rate recovery is our request of $123 million, and we’ll continue to advocate for our position. We are anticipating an ALJ recommendation in the fall and a PUC order in the fourth quarter, although there will be some delay as a result of the recent government shutdown in Minnesota.
In Colorado, we reached a constructive settlement in our natural gas rate case. The settlement effectively provides approximately $21 million in additional revenue, beginning in September 2011. In addition, a rider for gas pipeline integrity cost is projected to add an additional $13 million in revenue in 2012.
Turning to North Dakota; we are requesting a 2011 electric rate increase of $18 million and a 2012 electric rate increase of $2.4 million, based on an 11.25% ROE. Interim rates of $17.4 million were effective in February. Intervener testimony is expected in mid-August; rebuttal testimony in September; and evidentiary hearings in October. We anticipate a final decision in the first quarter of 2012. And, in South Dakota, in June 2011 NSP Minnesota filed a request to increase electric rates $14.6 million, based on a 2010 historic test year, adjusted for known and measurable changes; an 11% ROE; an equity ratio of 52.5%; and an electric rate base of $323 million. South Dakota does not allow interim rates but they typically process rate cases in about six to seven months. Final rates are expected to be effective in early 2012.
At NSP Wisconsin, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission at Wisconsin to increase electric rate to $29 million and gas rate to $8 million. The filing is based on a 2012 forecast test year, 10.75% ROE, and an equity ratio of 52.5%. NSP Wisconsin’s 2012 rate base is forecast to be approximately $718 million for the electric utility and $84 million for the natural gas utility.
Finally, in New Mexico, as you recall, last February SPS filed an electric rate case with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, seeking an annual base rate increase of approximately $20 million. The rate filing is based on a 2011 test year adjusted for 2012 known and measurable changes; a requested ROE of 11.25%; an electric rate base of $390 million; and an equity ratio of 51%. Rates are expected to go into effect during the first quarter of 2012. That concludes my regulatory update.
In summary, we had another good quarter, highlighted by several positive outcomes. Our strong financial results position us to meet our annual earnings guidance. We received conditional approval for our Brookings transmission line. We received approval to extend the operating license of our Prairie Island nuclear plant by 20 years. We were awarded a $100-million settlement from the DOE. The Minnesota Legislature passed a bill, authorizing multi-year rate plans we contracted for 400 megawatts of wind power. We’ve made good progress on our multiple rate cases. The Board of Directors raised the annual dividend by $0.03 per share, and the Board ensured a smooth management transition, naming Ben Fowke to succeed Chairman and CEO, Dick Kelly, upon his retirement next month.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions

Today, we’ll discuss our third quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we’ll provide an update to our 2011 guidance and introduce 2012 guidance.
Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. In addition, please note that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
Today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Third quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. Third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.69 per share compared with $0.67 per share in 2010. Last year third quarter GAAP earnings include a non-recurring benefit of $0.05 per share related to the settlement of a law suit. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of results, and are more representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental earnings power. Therefore we will be discussing ongoing earnings today, during our review of third quarter results. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings results.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke, who became CEO of Xcel Energy in August of this year.

Let me just say that I’m truly honored to be CEO of Xcel Energy. We have a great company with a strong balance sheet, a sound strategy, a constructive regulatory environment, a visible pipeline of investment opportunities, engaged employees and a history of delivering on expectations while managing risk. I will build on our great tradition with an emphasis on improving earned returns, while continuing to bright our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy at a reasonable cost. So, with that let me turn to our results.
This morning, we reported third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. These results represent a continuation of solid performance this year and give us confidence that we will deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective.
Now I’ll brief you on some recent developments, beginning with an update on our regulatory proceedings. This has been a busy one for us with several rate requests pending. As most of you are aware, we arrived at constructive settlements in North Dakota and New Mexico. In North Dakota, the commission recently held hearings on the settlement we reached with staff, which would result in a rate increase of about 14 million in 2011, and an additional spec increase of 2 million in 2012 if approved. This is a black box settlement which was based on a 10.4% ROE. The settlement represents approximately 76% of our requested increase. We also reached a settlement in our electric rate case in New Mexico; the black box settlement is unopposed, resolves all the issues and increases rates by 13.5 million effective January 2012. Here again, the settlement if approved represents approximately 68% of our requested rate increase.
We expect the North Dakota and New Mexico commissions to rule on these settlements by year end. We are also discussing a potential settlement agreement in the Minnesota rate case. While we believe our request in Minnesota is reasonable we think working towards a settlement has the potential to leave to a constructive outcome. Especially in light of the delays the case has experienced and considering the overall economic environment. If our efforts are successful we would expect that an agreement could be sent to the commission by year-end.
These settlements are up our evidence of our ability to effectively manage regulatory risk. The constructive outcomes if approved position us to continue delivering on our financial objectives in 2011 and beyond. 
Next, I would like to comment on EPA’s recently issued Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR, as you are probably aware CSAPR impacts our operations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Texas. While we have proactively addressed environmental issues, the late inclusion of Texas and the required compliance by 2012 creates significant issues for SPS. 
SPS has very limited options to comply with the rules by January 2012. This short timeframe does not allow for the installation of additional control equipment at our coal plants. In addition SPS doesn’t have many viable options to comply with the new rules due transmission constraints that limit energy import and the expected lack of a liquid allowance market in the region. 
Xcel Energy is one of many parties challenging the recently proposed EPA rules. Over 45 petitioners including 13 states, several utilities and others, filed challenges to CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Twelve separate motions for stay including our motion are pending before the quarter. Although the outcome of any litigation is difficult to predict, we are confident in the strength of our challenges to the rule.
Clearly we are not alone in challenging these new rules and are encouraged that FERC Commissioner Moeller has stated that the timing of these rules is too aggressive and could hinder grid reliability. The EPA itself appears to recognize the potential problems with the rule and hence proposed modifications. But we don’t believe these adjustments go far enough to alleviate our concerns, we’re optimistic that a more reasonable time line may be established. To address CSAPR ultimately, we’ll need to increase our capital investments at SPS. We will update you on our plans, including an updated capital expenditure forecast at our analyst meeting in December. 
Now most of our comments on our conference calls tend to focus on financial results. However, operational excellence is a cornerstone at Xcel Energy. Periodically, it’s helpful to provide an example to emphasize this point. This summer 80 mile per hour winds and rain damaged 94 miles of infrastructure including transmission lines, turbines, wind collectors and distributors lines in South Western Minnesota. I am pleased to report that we completed the design and reconstruction of 64 miles of transmission infrastructure and energized it with new and stronger structures in less than three months. The remaining wind collector feeders were completed in mid-October. The successful and timely completion of this project demonstrates the people, alliances resources and internal processes are in place to achieve outstanding results. 
I would now like to introduce you to Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Many of you have met Teresa over the years at various investor conferences. I’ve worked with her for many years. She has incredible depth of understanding of every aspect of the company’s finances and I have every confidence that she will be an outstanding CFO. Teresa, the floor is yours.

Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our recent financing activity, update you on other pending rate cases and close with our 2012 earnings guidance.
Let’s begin with a review of the significant drivers on the income statement. Strong growth in the third quarter earnings was largely driven by a 139 million increase in electric margin. Significant drivers include a $41 million from interim and final rate in multiple states, a 29 million increase in revenue requirement reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado. This margin impact is partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes and financing cost associated with these facilities, a $19 million increase from the higher sales as a result of warmer than normal weather and an 18 million increase for conservation and DSM revenue incentives.
Natural gas margins increased modestly by 4 million over the quarter. As you’re primarily aware, natural gas usage is relatively minor in the third quarter. Partially offsetting the improvement in our electric and gas margins were increases in a few expense categories that I will review. O&M expenses increased 23 million or 4.6% largely driven by increased plant generation, labor, and employee benefit costs. In addition, due to warmer than normal summer temperatures, we are seeing incremental O&M to ensure continued system reliability and high customer satisfaction. As a result, we now project our annual 2011 O&M to increase approximately 4.5%, which is modestly above our original guidance of an increase of 4%.
Also offsetting some of the improvement in margins was higher depreciation and amortization expense, which increased $21 million or 9.3%. The increase is driven by incremental capital investment including the Nobles Wind Farm that went into service in 2010 and the new two natural gas plants we acquired from Calpine. Higher property taxes, primarily in Colorado and Minnesota, led to a $7 million or 8.8% increases in taxes other than income.
Finally, during the quarter, we announced the redemption of $105 million of preferred stock and incurred a call premium of a little over $3 million, which is not tax deductible. These opportunistic financing streamlines, our capital structure and lowers our cost of capital.
Now I’ll review the results of each of our operating company. First, earnings in NSP Minnesota increased $0.05 per share, largely due to higher interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota and conservation incentives, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense.
Second Earnings at PSCo were flat for the quarter. Higher margins primarily due to weather were offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense. Third, NSP Wisconsin earnings were also flat for the quarter. The positive impact of new electric rates was offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense.
Finally, earnings at SPS increased $0.02 per share, largely due to an electric rate increase in Texas and higher sales driven again by hot weather. Similar to our other OPCos, these gains were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we were very active on the financing front during the third quarter issuing $700 million of debt at very attractive interest rate. At PSCo, we issued $250 million at 30-year first mortgage bonds with a 4.75% coupon. At SPS, we issued $200 million of 30-year first mortgage bond at 4.5% which temporarily tied the record for the lowest 30-year coupon across all corporate sectors.
In addition at the holding company, we took advantage of historically low rates and issued $250 million of 30-year senior note at 4.8%, this represents the lowest 30 year coupon ever for a utility holding company bond. Earlier Ben provided an update on several of the rate cases in which we’ve either greed on are working towards a settlement. We do have a few other rate cases pending that are expected to be wrapped up by year end or in early 2012.
In South Dakota we filed request to increase electric rate by 14.6 million based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and 11% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and an electric rate base of $323 million. There has been delayed in the South Dakota rate case process, and we don’t anticipate a decision until the first quarter of 2012. As a result we are planning to request interim rate to be affective in January of 2012.
At NSP Wisconsin we’ve filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to increase electric rates by $29 million and gas rates by $8 million. At filing this based on a 2012 forecast test year, 10.75% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and electric rate base of 718 million and a natural gas rate base of $84 million.
Earlier this month staff a testimony and recommended an electric rate increase of approximately $18 million and a natural gas rate increase of about $3 million both based on an ROE of 10.3%. The staff recommendation reflects a lower ROE and adjustments to nuclear costs, employee compensation and benefit as well as the recovery of future MGP cost. We filed our rebuttal testimony last week and expect to commission to rule on the case by yearend. We anticipate new rates to be effective in January 2012.
Looking ahead, we plan to file an electric rate case in Colorado during the fourth quarter. As you recall we are required to file an electric rate case in Colorado prior to April 2012. A few noteworthy items, we plan on requesting interim rate to be effective in the first quarter of 2012 and we are also discussing the possibility of a multiyear rate plan with key stakeholders to determine whether this approach can be implemented through this case.
Constructive outcomes in these cases combined with the anticipated approval of the settlements in New Mexico and North Dakota, as well as the constructed outcome in Minnesota are key components of our 2012 earnings guidance, which we are introducing today.
For 2012, we expect earnings to be in a range of $1.75 to a $1.85 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth adjusted. Using 2009 as the base here, the low end of the 2012 guidance range represents 5% compounded earnings growth with the upper end representing compound earnings growth of 7%.
Some of the key drivers for 2012 include very modest electric and gas sales growth including the impact of an additional way of sales due to the leap year, stepping rates in Minnesota, new rates in Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico, increased rates from the planned 2012 Colorado electric case. Incremental revenue from various capital writers and finally increased an AFUDC equity earnings associated with our capital investment program. These drivers will be offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. For more information see our earnings release for a listing of our preliminary assumptions.
We plan to provide additional information related to our 2012 forecast including an updated five year capital expenditure plan at our analyst meeting on December 1St in New York. In closing we’re pleased to report another strong quarter. As we enter the last few months of 2011 Xcel Energy is well positioned for continued success. We are on track to deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We financed our growth as historically low interest rate. We’re continuing to demonstrate our ability to manage regulatory risk across several jurisdictions, and finally we’ve established 2012 guidance that is consistent with our earnings objective of 5% to 7% growth. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions.

Today, we’ll discuss our third quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we’ll provide an update to our 2011 guidance and introduce 2012 guidance.
Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. In addition, please note that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
Today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Third quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. Third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.69 per share compared with $0.67 per share in 2010. Last year third quarter GAAP earnings include a non-recurring benefit of $0.05 per share related to the settlement of a law suit. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of results, and are more representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental earnings power. Therefore we will be discussing ongoing earnings today, during our review of third quarter results. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings results.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke, who became CEO of Xcel Energy in August of this year."

Let me just say that I’m truly honored to be CEO of Xcel Energy. We have a great company with a strong balance sheet, a sound strategy, a constructive regulatory environment, a visible pipeline of investment opportunities, engaged employees and a history of delivering on expectations while managing risk. I will build on our great tradition with an emphasis on improving earned returns, while continuing to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy at a reasonable cost. So, with that let me turn to our results.
This morning, we reported third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. These results represent a continuation of solid performance this year and give us confidence that we will deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective.
Now I’ll brief you on some recent developments, beginning with an update on our regulatory proceedings. This has been a busy one for us with several rate requests pending. As most of you are aware, we arrived at constructive settlements in North Dakota and New Mexico. In North Dakota, the commission recently held hearings on the settlement we reached with staff, which would result in a rate increase of about $14 million in 2011, and an additional step increase of $2 million in 2012 if approved. This is a black box settlement which was based on a 10.4% ROE. The settlement represents approximately 76% of our requested increase. We also reached a settlement in our electric rate case in New Mexico; the black box settlement is unopposed, resolves all the issues and increases rates by $13.5 million effective January 2012. Here again, the settlement if approved represents approximately 68% of our requested rate increase.
We expect the North Dakota and New Mexico commissions to rule on these settlements by year end. We are also discussing a potential settlement agreement in the Minnesota rate case. While we believe our request in Minnesota is reasonable we think working towards a settlement has the potential to lead to a constructive outcome especially in light of the delays the case has experienced and considering the overall economic environment. If our efforts are successful we would expect that an agreement could be sent to the commission by year-end.
These settlements are up our evidence of our ability to effectively manage regulatory risk. The constructive outcomes if approved position us to continue delivering on our financial objectives in 2011 and beyond. 
Next, I would like to comment on EPA’s recently issued Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR, as you are probably aware CSAPR impacts our operations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Texas. While we have proactively addressed environmental issues, the late inclusion of Texas and the required compliance by 2012 creates significant issues for SPS. 
SPS has very limited options to comply with the rules by January 2012. This short timeframe does not allow for the installation of additional control equipment at our coal plant. In addition SPS doesn’t have many viable options to comply with the new rules due transmission constraints that limit energy import and the expected lack of a liquid allowance market in the region. 
Xcel Energy is one of many parties challenging the recently proposed EPA rules. Over 45 petitioners including 13 states, several utilities and others, filed challenges to CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Twelve separate motions for stay including our motion are pending before the quarter. Although the outcome of any litigation is difficult to predict, we are confident in the strength of our challenges to the rule.
Clearly we are not alone in challenging these new rules and are encouraged that FERC Commissioner Moeller has stated that the timing of these rules is too aggressive and could hinder grid reliability. The EPA itself appears to recognize the potential problems with the rule and has proposed modifications. While we don’t believe these adjustments go far enough to alleviate our concerns, we’re optimistic that a more reasonable time line may be established. To address CSAPR ultimately, we’ll need to increase our capital investments at SPS. We will update you on our plans, including an updated capital expenditure forecast at our analyst meeting in December. 
Now most of our comments on our conference calls tend to focus on financial results. However, operational excellence is a cornerstone at Xcel Energy. Periodically, it’s helpful to provide an example to emphasize this point. This summer 80 mile per hour winds and rain damaged 94 miles of infrastructure including transmission lines, turbines, wind collectors and distributions lines in Southwestern Minnesota. I am pleased to report that we completed the design and reconstruction of 64 miles of transmission infrastructure and energized it with new and stronger structures in less than three months. The remaining wind collector feeders were completed in mid-October. The successful and timely completion of this project demonstrates the people, alliances, resources and internal processes are in place to achieve outstanding results. 
I would now like to introduce you to Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Many of you have met Teresa over the years at various investor conferences. I’ve worked with her for many years. She has incredible depth of understanding of every aspect of the company’s finances and I have every confidence that she will be an outstanding CFO. Teresa, the floor is yours."
527542,140905890,208424,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben for the kind introduction and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our recent financing activity, update you on other pending rate cases and close with our 2012 earnings guidance.Let’s begi",1292,"Thanks, Ben for the kind introduction and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our recent financing activity, update you on other pending rate cases and close with our 2012 earnings guidance.
Let’s begin with a review of the significant drivers on the income statement. Strong growth in the third quarter earnings was largely driven by a $139 million increase in electric margin. Significant drivers include a $41 million from interim and final rate in multiple states, a $29 million increase in revenue requirement reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado. This margin impact is partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes and financing costs associated with these facilities, a $19 million increase from the higher sales as a result of warmer than normal weather and an $18 million increase for conservation and DSM revenue incentives.
Natural gas margins increased modestly by $4 million over the quarter. As you’re primarily aware, natural gas usage is relatively minor in the third quarter. Partially offsetting the improvement in our electric and gas margins were increases in a few expense categories that I will review. O&M expenses increased $23 million or 4.6% largely driven by increased plant generation, labor, and employee benefit costs. In addition, due to warmer than normal summer temperatures, we are spending incremental O&M to ensure continued system reliability and high customer satisfaction. As a result, we now project our annual 2011 O&M to increase approximately 4.5%, which is modestly above our original guidance of an increase of 4%.
Also offsetting some of the improvement in margins was higher depreciation and amortization expense, which increased $21 million or 9.3%. The increase is driven by incremental capital investment including the Nobles Wind Farm that went into service in 2010 and the new 2 natural gas plants we acquired from Calpine. Higher property taxes, primarily in Colorado and Minnesota, led to a $7 million or 8.8% increases in taxes other than income.
Finally, during the quarter, we announced the redemption of $105 million of preferred stock and incurred a call premium of a little over $3 million, which is not tax deductible. These opportunistic financing streamlines our capital structure and lowers our cost of capital.
Now I’ll review the results of each of our operating companies. First, earnings in NSP Minnesota increased $0.05 per share, largely due to higher interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota and conservation incentives, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense.
Second, earnings at PSCo were flat for the quarter. Higher margins primarily due to weather were offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense. Third, NSP Wisconsin earnings were also flat for the quarter. The positive impact of new electric rates was offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense.
Finally, earnings at SPS increased $0.02 per share, largely due to an electric rate increase in Texas and higher sales driven again by hot weather. Similar to our other Op Cos, these gains were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we were very active on the financing front during the third quarter issuing $700 million of debt at very attractive interest rate. At PSCo, we issued $250 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds with a 4.75% coupon. At SPS, we issued $200 million of 30-year first mortgage bond at 4.5% which temporarily tied the record for the lowest 30-year coupon across all corporate sectors.
In addition at the holding company, we took advantage of historically low rates and issued $250 million of 30-year senior note at 4.8%, this represents the lowest 30 year coupon ever for a utility holding company bond. Earlier Ben provided an update on several of the rate cases in which we’ve either agreed on are working towards a settlement. We do have a few other rate cases pending that are expected to be wrapped up by year end or in early 2012.
In South Dakota we filed request to increase electric rate by $14.6 million based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and 11% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and an electric rate base of $323 million. There have been delays in the South Dakota rate case process, and we don’t anticipate a decision until the first quarter of 2012. As a result we are planning to request interim rates to be effective in January of 2012.
At NSP Wisconsin we’ve filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to increase electric rates by $29 million and gas rates by $8 million. The filing is based on a 2012 forecast test year, 10.75% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and electric rate base of $718 million and a natural gas rate base of $84 million.
Earlier this month staff filed testimony and recommended an electric rate increase of approximately $18 million and a natural gas rate increase of about $3 million both based on an ROE of 10.3%. The staff recommendation reflects a lower ROE and adjustments to nuclear costs, employee compensation and benefits as well as the recovery of future MGP cost. We filed our rebuttal testimony last week and expect to commission to rule on the case by yearend. We anticipate new rates to be effective in January 2012.
Looking ahead, we plan to file an electric rate case in Colorado during the fourth quarter. As you recall we are required to file an electric rate case in Colorado prior to April 2012. A few noteworthy items, we plan on requesting interim rates to be effective in the first quarter of 2012 and we are also discussing the possibility of a multiyear rate plan with key stakeholders to determine whether this approach can be implemented through this case.
Constructive outcomes in these cases combined with the anticipated approval of the settlements in New Mexico and North Dakota, as well as the constructive outcome in Minnesota are key components of our 2012 earnings guidance, which we are introducing today.
For 2012, we expect earnings to be in a range of $1.75 to a $1.85 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective.  Using 2009 as the base year, the low end of the 2012 guidance range represents 5% compound earnings growth with the upper end representing compound earnings growth of 7%.
Some of the key drivers for 2012 include very modest electric and gas sales growth including the impact of an additional way of sales due to the leap year, step in rates in Minnesota, new rates in Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico, increased rates from the planned 2012 Colorado electric case, incremental revenue from various capital writers and finally increased an AFUDC equity earnings associated with our capital investment program. These drivers will be offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. For more information see our earnings release for a listing of our preliminary assumptions.
We plan to provide additional information related to our 2012 forecast including an updated 5 year capital expenditure plan at our analyst meeting on December 1 in New York. In closing we’re pleased to report another strong quarter. As we enter the last few months of 2011 Xcel Energy is well positioned for continued success. We are on track to deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We financed our growth as historically low interest rates. We’re continuing to demonstrate our ability to manage regulatory risk across several jurisdictions, and finally we’ve established 2012 guidance that is consistent with our earnings objective of 5% to 7% growth. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions."

Today, we’ll discuss our third quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we’ll provide an update to our 2011 guidance and introduce 2012 guidance.
Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. In addition, please note that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
Today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Third quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. Third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.69 per share compared with $0.67 per share in 2010. Last year third quarter GAAP earnings include a non-recurring benefit of $0.05 per share related to the settlement of a law suit. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of results, and are more representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental earnings power. Therefore we will be discussing ongoing earnings today, during our review of third quarter results. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings results.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke, who became CEO of Xcel Energy in August of this year."

Let me just say that I’m truly honored to be CEO of Xcel Energy. We have a great company with a strong balance sheet, a sound strategy, a constructive regulatory environment, a visible pipeline of investment opportunities, engaged employees and a history of delivering on expectations while managing risk. I will build on our great tradition with an emphasis on improving earned returns, while continuing to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy at a reasonable cost. So, with that let me turn to our results.
This morning, we reported third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. These results represent a continuation of solid performance this year and give us confidence that we will deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective.
Now I’ll brief you on some recent developments, beginning with an update on our regulatory proceedings. This has been a busy one for us with several rate requests pending. As most of you are aware, we arrived at constructive settlements in North Dakota and New Mexico. In North Dakota, the commission recently held hearings on the settlement we reached with staff, which would result in a rate increase of about $14 million in 2011, and an additional step increase of $2 million in 2012 if approved. This is a black box settlement which was based on a 10.4% ROE. The settlement represents approximately 76% of our requested increase. We also reached a settlement in our electric rate case in New Mexico; the black box settlement is unopposed, resolves all the issues and increases rates by $13.5 million effective January 2012. Here again, the settlement if approved represents approximately 68% of our requested rate increase.
We expect the North Dakota and New Mexico commissions to rule on these settlements by year end. We are also discussing a potential settlement agreement in the Minnesota rate case. While we believe our request in Minnesota is reasonable we think working towards a settlement has the potential to lead to a constructive outcome especially in light of the delays the case has experienced and considering the overall economic environment. If our efforts are successful we would expect that an agreement could be sent to the commission by year-end.
These settlements are up our evidence of our ability to effectively manage regulatory risk. The constructive outcomes if approved position us to continue delivering on our financial objectives in 2011 and beyond. 
Next, I would like to comment on EPA’s recently issued Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR, as you are probably aware CSAPR impacts our operations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Texas. While we have proactively addressed environmental issues, the late inclusion of Texas and the required compliance by 2012 creates significant issues for SPS. 
SPS has very limited options to comply with the rules by January 2012. This short timeframe does not allow for the installation of additional control equipment at our coal plant. In addition SPS doesn’t have many viable options to comply with the new rules due transmission constraints that limit energy import and the expected lack of a liquid allowance market in the region. 
Xcel Energy is one of many parties challenging the recently proposed EPA rules. Over 45 petitioners including 13 states, several utilities and others, filed challenges to CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Twelve separate motions for stay including our motion are pending before the quarter. Although the outcome of any litigation is difficult to predict, we are confident in the strength of our challenges to the rule.
Clearly we are not alone in challenging these new rules and are encouraged that FERC Commissioner Moeller has stated that the timing of these rules is too aggressive and could hinder grid reliability. The EPA itself appears to recognize the potential problems with the rule and has proposed modifications. While we don’t believe these adjustments go far enough to alleviate our concerns, we’re optimistic that a more reasonable time line may be established. To address CSAPR ultimately, we’ll need to increase our capital investments at SPS. We will update you on our plans, including an updated capital expenditure forecast at our analyst meeting in December. 
Now most of our comments on our conference calls tend to focus on financial results. However, operational excellence is a cornerstone at Xcel Energy. Periodically, it’s helpful to provide an example to emphasize this point. This summer 80 mile per hour winds and rain damaged 94 miles of infrastructure including transmission lines, turbines, wind collectors and distributions lines in Southwestern Minnesota. I am pleased to report that we completed the design and reconstruction of 64 miles of transmission infrastructure and energized it with new and stronger structures in less than three months. The remaining wind collector feeders were completed in mid-October. The successful and timely completion of this project demonstrates the people, alliances, resources and internal processes are in place to achieve outstanding results. 
I would now like to introduce you to Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Many of you have met Teresa over the years at various investor conferences. I’ve worked with her for many years. She has incredible depth of understanding of every aspect of the company’s finances and I have every confidence that she will be an outstanding CFO. Teresa, the floor is yours."
527542,140905890,210980,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, for the kind introduction and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our recent financing activity, update you on other pending rate cases and close with our 2012 earnings guidance.Let’s beg",1292,"Thanks, Ben, for the kind introduction and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our recent financing activity, update you on other pending rate cases and close with our 2012 earnings guidance.
Let’s begin with a review of the significant drivers on the income statement. Strong growth in the third quarter earnings was largely driven by a $139 million increase in electric margin. Significant drivers include a $41 million from interim and final rate in multiple states, a $29 million increase in revenue requirement reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado. This margin impact is partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes and financing costs associated with these facilities, a $19 million increase from the higher sales as a result of warmer than normal weather and an $18 million increase for conservation and DSM revenue incentives.
Natural gas margins increased modestly by $4 million over the quarter. As you’re primarily aware, natural gas usage is relatively minor in the third quarter. Partially offsetting the improvement in our electric and gas margins were increases in a few expense categories that I will review. O&M expenses increased $23 million or 4.6% largely driven by increased plant generation, labor, and employee benefit costs. In addition, due to warmer than normal summer temperatures, we are spending incremental O&M to ensure continued system reliability and high customer satisfaction. As a result, we now project our annual 2011 O&M to increase approximately 4.5%, which is modestly above our original guidance of an increase of 4%.
Also offsetting some of the improvement in margins was higher depreciation and amortization expense, which increased $21 million or 9.3%. The increase is driven by incremental capital investment including the Nobles Wind Farm that went into service in 2010 and the new 2 natural gas plants we acquired from Calpine. Higher property taxes, primarily in Colorado and Minnesota, led to a $7 million or 8.8% increases in taxes other than income.
Finally, during the quarter, we announced the redemption of $105 million of preferred stock and incurred a call premium of a little over $3 million, which is not tax deductible. These opportunistic financing streamlines our capital structure and lowers our cost of capital.
Now I’ll review the results of each of our operating companies. First, earnings in NSP Minnesota increased $0.05 per share, largely due to higher interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota and conservation incentives, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense.
Second, earnings at PSCo were flat for the quarter. Higher margins primarily due to weather were offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense. Third, NSP Wisconsin earnings were also flat for the quarter. The positive impact of new electric rates was offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense.
Finally, earnings at SPS increased $0.02 per share, largely due to an electric rate increase in Texas and higher sales driven again by hot weather. Similar to our other Op Cos, these gains were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we were very active on the financing front during the third quarter issuing $700 million of debt at very attractive interest rate. At PSCo, we issued $250 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds with a 4.75% coupon. At SPS, we issued $200 million of 30-year first mortgage bond at 4.5% which temporarily tied the record for the lowest 30-year coupon across all corporate sectors.
In addition at the holding company, we took advantage of historically low rates and issued $250 million of 30-year senior note at 4.8%, this represents the lowest 30 year coupon ever for a utility holding company bond. Earlier Ben provided an update on several of the rate cases in which we’ve either agreed on are working towards a settlement. We do have a few other rate cases pending that are expected to be wrapped up by year end or in early 2012.
In South Dakota we filed request to increase electric rate by $14.6 million based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and 11% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and an electric rate base of $323 million. There have been delays in the South Dakota rate case process, and we don’t anticipate a decision until the first quarter of 2012. As a result we are planning to request interim rates to be effective in January of 2012.
At NSP Wisconsin we’ve filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to increase electric rates by $29 million and gas rates by $8 million. The filing is based on a 2012 forecast test year, 10.75% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and electric rate base of $718 million and a natural gas rate base of $84 million.
Earlier this month staff filed testimony and recommended an electric rate increase of approximately $18 million and a natural gas rate increase of about $3 million both based on an ROE of 10.3%. The staff recommendation reflects a lower ROE and adjustments to nuclear costs, employee compensation and benefits as well as the recovery of future MGP cost. We filed our rebuttal testimony last week and expect to commission to rule on the case by yearend. We anticipate new rates to be effective in January 2012.
Looking ahead, we plan to file an electric rate case in Colorado during the fourth quarter. As you recall we are required to file an electric rate case in Colorado prior to April 2012. A few noteworthy items, we plan on requesting interim rates to be effective in the first quarter of 2012 and we are also discussing the possibility of a multiyear rate plan with key stakeholders to determine whether this approach can be implemented through this case.
Constructive outcomes in these cases combined with the anticipated approval of the settlements in New Mexico and North Dakota, as well as the constructive outcome in Minnesota are key components of our 2012 earnings guidance, which we are introducing today.
For 2012, we expect earnings to be in a range of $1.75 to a $1.85 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective.  Using 2009 as the base year, the low end of the 2012 guidance range represents 5% compound earnings growth with the upper end representing compound earnings growth of 7%.
Some of the key drivers for 2012 include very modest electric and gas sales growth including the impact of an additional way of sales due to the leap year, step in rates in Minnesota, new rates in Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico, increased rates from the planned 2012 Colorado electric case, incremental revenue from various capital writers and finally increased an AFUDC equity earnings associated with our capital investment program. These drivers will be offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. For more information see our earnings release for a listing of our preliminary assumptions.
We plan to provide additional information related to our 2012 forecast including an updated 5 year capital expenditure plan at our analyst meeting on December 1 in New York. In closing we’re pleased to report another strong quarter. As we enter the last few months of 2011 Xcel Energy is well positioned for continued success. We are on track to deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We financed our growth as historically low interest rates. We’re continuing to demonstrate our ability to manage regulatory risk across several jurisdictions, and finally we’ve established 2012 guidance that is consistent with our earnings objective of 5% to 7% growth. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions."
