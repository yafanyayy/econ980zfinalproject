Today, we're pleased to report another strong quarter. As I told you last quarter, we believe that only a few metrics that truly matter for the creation of long-term shareholder value: claims, earnings per share, EBITDA, cash flow, and of course Return On Invested Capital. 
Our performance on all of these metrics for both the quarter and the year was strong. Adjusted claims grew to $753.9 million for the year. Earnings per share was $0.71 for the quarter and $2.50 for the year, reflecting 40% growth over full year 2009. All of this growth in EPS came from operations, as EBITDA was up 42% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 20% to $2.1 billion, and return on invested capital was 20.5%. And I know that this calculation includes all intangible assets in the base.
On last quarter's call, we discussed our view on guidance, which we believe may be slightly different in some of our peers. To reiterate, we focused on forecast accuracy, guides only to metrics that matter and create long-term shareholder value by delivering on these metrics. 
For 2011, we still expect EPS to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30% over 2010. As it is still early in the year, the range around the midpoint has not narrowed. As we move through the year, there are several factors that can move our performance above or below the midpoint of this range.
In keeping with our view on guidance, our policy is not to provide quarterly forecast, as we believe that would only distract us from our long-term goals. However, as we transitioned out of integration, we'd like to provide a point of clarity. As I said last quarter, earnings per share for 2011 would be more back-end loaded than normal. 
First quarter 2011 EPS is expected to be below fourth quarter of 2010 EPS. This expected decline is driven by the normal seasonality of the client renewal, increased call volume as a result of planned changes, which is even higher this year as a result of the Health Care Reform changes. And unlike prior years, we expect only a minimal increase in generic fill rate in the first quarter to offset these normal seasonal patterns.
The strong historical performance and outlook for the future I'd just summarize can be attributed to our focus on the metrics that matter and the consistent execution of our business model of alignment. We follow a simple four-step process to develop and implement field-tested and market-ready innovations to our clients. We work tirelessly to listen, study and understand our clients' needs. We analyzed of these needs in terms of both clinical and financial components. Then, utilizing our advanced understanding of human behavior, redesign and pilot innovative approaches to eliminate waste and improve outcome while maximizing member acceptance. Finally, we closely monitor program performance against design expectations to continue to refine and optimize financial and clinical outcome.
All of this is done in a clinical-first culture, where decisions are data driven and based on facts from randomized and controlled trials. The significant investment have made in our research and new solutions lab, which is unique in the industry, is a testament to our belief in the power of this differentiated model. This model creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, creates a superior shareholder value for our stockholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

The milestones we reached this year are tangible proof of the strength of our business model and the commitment of our employees to improve clinical outcomes, while driving out wasteful spending. As a result of our focus, dedication and passion for service, we delivered record earnings and record cash flow, while accomplishing the following. The seamless and efficient migration of NextRx Live with minimal disruption. 
Thanks to great cooperation from both companies, we were able to achieve our gross in this area on forecast. This alliance now opens new horizons are improving out there outcomes. The near completion of rationalizing our footprint and realization of synergies, the opening of our new technology and innovation center, which secures our best-in-class pharmacy technology leadership, and as Jeff mentioned, the launch of our new research and new lab solutions while We are expanding navigation scope and valid of Consumerology. 
During December, we hosted two important events, our annual kickoff meeting with our national sales force and our annual consultant summary, where we bring together leading PBM consultants to discuss our unique and differentiated approach to the marketplace. In all my Express Scripts years, I don't remember at time that both groups was bullish and our value proposition and product offering as they are today. 
We're returning data-driven research into insights and the insights is the real solution that improve care and drive out ways in the pharmacy benefit. Our investments in Consumerology not only differentiates us from the marketplace but also sustain our competitive advantage. It is now clear, optimal clinical outcomes cannot be accomplished list without an advanced understanding of behavior. Consumer decisions and choices often stand between doctor's orders and the patient achieving the best care at the lowest cost. We embarked on a mission nearly five years ago to understand this behavioral component and it's working.
Not only do we have only industry-leading insights into the consumer health behavior, we have successfully translated those insights into solutions that have proven to be both effective and member friendly. Previously, I mentioned how enthused about we are our offerings for the selling season. 
Here's why. We recently launched solid solutions, a family of choice-based products that nudge members to positive behaviors in a radically new way. Following the success of the Select Home Delivery, we have applied the behavioral science to address other challenges in pharmacy benefiting, including, drug mix, therapy adherence and specialty pharmacy. Now to the power of choice, plan sponsors of numbers alike are able to effectively manage the pharmacy benefit, while clinically and financially.
Also, we recently launched specialty benefit services, a next generation of breakthrough that delivers enhance patient care access across the pharmacy medical spectrum. Specialty benefit services applies proven management methods to both the pharmacy and medical components, especially spent, driving significant savings while improving health care outcomes. 
We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in our marketplace. Clearly understanding and improving patient behavior will be a more crucial than ever as we help clients and members navigate the health care environment in the wake of health care reform. We also will enhance our leading position in the management of cost and health outcomes in the fast-growing specialty pharmacy area.
Our focus on consumer behavior will allow us to be the most effective and successful PBM at maximizing health outcomes, while reducing costs through the advent of biosimilars. Our unique value proposition and innovative approach to the management of pharmacy benefit will allow us to continue our lower cost per plan sponsors, improve health outcomes for our patients and drive a superior returns for our stockholders. At this point, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

But keep in mind, we give guidance, and one of the problems you have when you give guidance is that the more metrics you give, the more micro components you have to manage. In reality, business has to be nimble, and we have to be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, and we have to anticipate what's coming down the pipe. So when we look at Medicare changes, Medicaid opportunities that afford themselves, new client opportunities, implementation costs, all those things going into a bucket. And our job is to deliver on what we told you we deliver on. At to the extent that we could have a higher margin, it gives us more opportunity to invest in things come up to speed up and accelerate investment, to improve our long-term goals, to the extent we are overwhelmed with new coming on board, if you will, then we've got to spend the money now to bring those up. And all those things go into our analysis, which is the beginning of the year, nobody has a crystal ball that tells you where you're going to come in. So our best guess is to try to give guidance. We like, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, our goal is to hit EBITDA targets, ROIC goals and earnings goals. And throughout the course of the year, there's going to be gives and takes on the timing of generics, when the clients actually buy clinical programs, whether they put in Select Home Delivery. All those pieces go into numbers of that could allow us to beat our midpoint of our range, to be slightly below the midpoint of our range or to give us a shift between gross margin and EBITDA. Having said all that, to your earlier question, was there an unusual costs, I don't think any of us that Express Scripts truly understood the amount of confusion that was being dealt to the marketplace through health care reform and all the myriad of changes that were coming in on Medicare. So we knew that there's going to be a lot. And we staffed up our call centers and our account management and gave them the tools to manage a very high volume of inquiry that was going to occur. But quite frankly, they even exceeded our expectations. And so, we had to turn up some of our flexible resources to meet those needs during the fourth quarter in order to make sure we are well positioned for '11. And that's an obviously '11 is a very important to us. Our call center and a lot of these components do run through cost of goods sold, so those numbers drive down margin. But again, at the end of the day, these are things that we worked our way through. January was a tough month. With everything going on from the suspension of pre-existing conditions to covering government people through their 26th, take of yourself if you're a senior and you're trying to choose all this different Medicare options you have available during the fourth quarter. There's just tons of questions that arise. And we have to staff up for that. I think we're pretty comfortable with where we came in, and then we did a very good job with that. But it's always a challenge. Jeff, do you have anything to add?"

One of the big things we did when we had such access when simvastatin came up from Zocor was the effort we put on keeping people on Zocor. If you watch of the drug trends, when a company drug-induced last year of patent protection, you'll see that the market share that drug declined pretty significantly through the course of that year. It's not going to support from the manufacturer. So the detail, and our job is to try to hold it. So that's going to be the big push this year is to hold our Lipitor percentages."

Some drugs are easier to get than others. But the idea is to -- when you have an Express Scripts card and you go and then you find out you've got a pretty severe disease, you can have sort of a lot of our blues plan now. There are number is printed, and there's a prior authorization number. As you know, when you go to the doctor, do take up picture front and back of your card. On the back of that card will this number you have to call. So when the doctor, before they put start you out on like the specific MS drug, they would call that number first to get authorized. And it does two things for us, and that occurs both at the clinical level and could occur at the hospital level, depending on the disparity of the disease and where you're at. So we'll talk for the hospital. But what happens when they call that number, they get you on the right therapy and start by prior authorizing and prior approving which therapy you're going to be on, so that you're on the right drug, and just as importantly, at the right cost. If that clinic drug bills the health plan and those dollars are buried inside of the codes, the codes from the hospital to the clinic, trying to decipher and pull that out and make sure it's being done at the right price is often after the fact, and trying to get your arms around that is very difficult. So our goal here is to get all this stuff done ahead of time. Similar to what we do with the pharmacy today when you walk into a pharmacy with your card, obviously, it's all realtime electronics. That doesn't exist with many of the clinics and hospitals. So the idea is to start using those tools and leveraging them into that space to help control those costs. And by the way, once we get that prior authorization in, we now can really start looking at the adherence levels. Because again, as you probably know, a lot of people get diagnosed with a pretty severe disease, there's a tremendous amount of issues that go around. The members have the willingness to accept it. All the things that go into managing the family approach to your -- the patient's situation. And so, it gives us the opportunity we see that the drug has been prior approved. And then if we don't see an adjudication occur, we now have the ability to reach out to both the doctor and the patient and make sure we get that patient started on therapy. So there's a lot of health improvements that occur as well as cost reductions."

And as the Republicans and some of the key Democrats both understand, at least I hope they understand the depths we are facing, and this is a key move. But at the end of the day, biosimilars isn't the answer, it's biogenerics. And we've got to move down that path. And we're still a ways away from that, but something that our people in Washington are very focused on. Myself, Doctor Miller, our Chief Medical Officer and, Keith, our General Counsel, we have to take the responsibility for all of our clients and for America to try to get this fix.

And I understand that. I mean, I understand why some of you may be concerned. But at the end of the day, and I've been saying this for -- i don't know, I was CFO before I was CEO so I guess, 14 years. I think when you see pricing pressure is when we can't grow earnings any longer. And from my perspective, there's two ways to sell. You sell on results, which is drive down costs for your clients and give them a better offering, which improves health outcomes for their patients or you drop price because you have nothing to offer. And I think this management team has always stayed incredibly discipline, and we understand the commitment we have to make to our shareholders, the commitment we have to make our clients and patients, and we understand that we can't sit back and rest on our morals. We have to constantly innovate inside of our space and bring new solutions that are meeting the needs of today's problems to our clients in order to sell our service at a higher price. Keep in mind what's happening here. There's inflation, generic launches and utilization trends and aging population. A lot of things are causing drug spend to go up. So the question isn't, do I have to go out to my clients and as for our an increase and price? That hasn't happened since I started here. No client ever allowed me to raise their price. What happens is that the amount of those increased and utilization trends and changing dynamics that are occurring, which is driving p drug spend, how much of that is a reduction to that trend line versus how much of that profit opportunity I get to deliver to our shareholders versus stabilized my patient's price. That's the dynamic that works here. And so, it's how much of those increasing trends do I get to keep? And that's where we focus on, and that's what we drive for. So each and every year or every few years in our requirements clients, for repricing, they get deeper discounts. What's happened over those three years, is if you assume an eight, nine, net then take a number of drug cost inflation, do the math. What happened to the that they have to deliver in order to try to make sure that those numbers stayed in conformity with the trends we're trying to hit. So it's a tremendously dynamic process. And again, I think if you can make your client comfortable that you're doing everything in our power and not causing disruption of the membership to manage that drug trend and at the same time improve their health outcomes, they're willing to pay for it. And that's what we've seen a numbers and that's the model we offer."

Today, we are pleased to report another strong quarter. As I told you last quarter, we believe there are only a few metrics that truly matter with the creation of long-term shareholder value: claim, earnings per share, EBITDA, cash flow,",584,"Thank you, David. Today, we are pleased to report another strong quarter. As I told you last quarter, we believe there are only a few metrics that truly matter with the creation of long-term shareholder value: claim, earnings per share, EBITDA, cash flow, and of course return on invested capital. 
Our performance on all of these metrics for both the quarter and the year was strong. Adjusted claims grew to $753.9 million for the year. Earnings per share was $0.71 for the quarter and $2.50 for the year, reflecting 40% growth over full year 2009. All of this growth in EPS came from operations, as EBITDA was up 42% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 20% to $2.1 billion, and return on invested capital was 20.5%. And I note that this calculation includes all intangible assets in the base.
On last quarter's call, we discussed our view on guidance, which we believe may be slightly different than some of our peers. To reiterate, we focused on forecast accuracy, guide to only the metrics that matter and create long-term shareholder value by delivering on these metrics. 
For 2011, we still expect EPS to be in a range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30% over 2010. As it is still early in the year, the range around the midpoint has not narrowed. As we move through the year, there are several factors that could move our performance above or below the midpoint of this range.
In keeping with our view on guidance, our policy is not to provide quarterly forecast, as we believe that would only distract us from our long-term goals. However, as we transitioned out of integration, we'd like to provide a point of clarity. As I said last quarter, earnings per share for 2011 would be more back-end loaded than normal. 
First quarter 2011 EPS is expected to be below fourth quarter of 2010 EPS. This expected decline is driven by the normal seasonality of client renewals, increased call volumes as a result of planned changes, which is even higher this year as a result of the Health Care Reform changes. And unlike prior years, we expect only a minimal increase in generic fill rate in the first quarter to offset these normal seasonal patterns.
The strong historical performance and outlook for the future I just summarized can be attributed to our focus on the metrics that matter and the consistent execution of our business model of alignment. We follow a simple four-step process to develop and implement field-tested and market-ready innovations to our clients. We work tirelessly to listen, study and understand our clients' needs. We analyze of these needs in terms of both clinical and financial components. Then utilizing our advanced understanding of human behavior, we design and pilot innovative approaches to eliminate waste and improve outcome while maximizing member acceptance. Finally, we closely monitor program performance against design expectations to continually refine and optimize financial and clinical outcome.
All of this is done in a clinical-first culture, where decisions are data driven and based on facts derived from randomized controlled trials. The significant investment have made in our research and new solutions lab, which is unique in the industry, is a testament to our belief in the power of this differentiated model. This model creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, creates superior shareholder value for our stockholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

The milestones we reached this year are tangible proof of the strength of our business model and the commitment of our employees to improve clinical outcomes, while driving out wasteful spending. As a result of our focus, dedication and passion for service, we delivered record earnings and record cash flow, while accomplishing the following. The seamless and efficient migration of NextRx Live with minimal disruption. 
Thanks to great cooperation from both companies, we were able to achieve our goals in this area on forecast. This alliance now opens new horizons for improving healthcare outcomes. The near completion of rationalizing our footprint and realization of synergies, the opening of our new technology and innovation center, which secures our best-in-class pharmacy technology leadership, and as Jeff mentioned, the launch of our new research and new lab solutions while We are expanding the application scope and valid of Consumerology. 
During December, we hosted two important events, our annual kickoff meeting with our national sales force and our annual consultant summit, where we bring together leading PBM consultants to discuss our unique and differentiated approach to the marketplace. In all my Express Scripts years, I don't remember a time that both groups were as bullish on our valued  proposition and product offering as they are today. 
We're returning data-driven research into insights and the insights into real solutions that improve care and drive out weights in the pharmacy benefit. Our investments in Consumerology not only differentiates us in the marketplace but also sustain our competitive advantage. It is now clear, optimal clinical outcomes cannot be accomplished without an advanced understanding of behavior. Consumer decisions and choices often stand between doctor's orders and the patient achieving the best care at the lowest cost. We embarked on a mission nearly five years ago to understand this behavioral component and it's working.
Not only do we have industry-leading insights in the consumer health behavior, we have successfully translated those insights into solutions that have proven to be both effective and member friendly. Previously, I mentioned how enthused we are about our offerings for the selling season, here's why: We recently launched select solutions, a family of choice-based products that nudge members to positive behaviors in a radically new way. Following the success of Select Home Delivery, we applied the behavioral science to address other challenges in pharmacy benefiting, including, drug mix, therapy adherence and specialty pharmacy. Now to the power of choice, plan sponsors of members alike were able to effectively manage the pharmacy benefit, both clinically and financially.
Also, we recently launched specialty benefit services, a next-generation breakthrough that delivers enhanced patient care access across the pharmacy medical spectrum. Specialty benefit services applies proven management methods to both the pharmacy and medical components, especially spend, driving significant savings while improving health care outcomes. 
We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in our marketplace. Clearly understanding and improving patient behavior will be more crucial than ever as we help clients and members navigate the health care environment in the wake of health care reform. We also will enhance our leading position in the management of cost and health outcomes in the fast-growing specialty pharmacy area.
Our focus on consumer behavior will allow us to be the most effective and successful PBM at maximizing health outcomes, while reducing costs through the advent of biosimilars. Our unique value proposition and innovative approach to the management of pharmacy benefit will allow us to continue our lower cost per plan sponsors, improve health outcomes for our patients and drive superior returns for our stockholders. At this point, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

But keep in mind, we give guidance, and one of the problems you have when you give guidance is that the more metrics you give, the more micro components you have to manage. In reality, business has to be nimble, and we have to be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, and we have to anticipate what's coming down the pipe. So when we look at Medicare changes, Medicaid opportunities that afford themselves, new client opportunities, implementation costs, all those things going into a bucket. And our job is to deliver on what we told you we would deliver on. And to the extent that we could have higher margin, it gives us more opportunity to invest in things, to speed up, accelerate investments, to improve our long-term goals, to the extents we are overwhelmed with new clients coming on board, if you will, then we got to spend the money now to bring those up. And all those things go into an analysis, which at the beginning of the year, nobody has a crystal ball that tells you where you're going to come in. So our best guess is to try to give guidance. We like, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, our goal is to hit EBITDA targets, ROIC goals and earnings goals. And throughout the course of the year, there's going to be gives and takes on the timing of generics, when do clients actually buy clinical programs? When do they put in Select Home Delivery? All those pieces go into the numbers that could allow us to beat our midpoint of our range, to be slightly below the midpoint of our range or to give us a shift between gross margin and EBITDA. Having said all that, to your earlier question, was there unusual costs? I don't think any of us at Express Scripts truly understood the amount of confusion that was being dealt to the marketplace through Health Care Reform and all the myriad of changes that were coming in on Medicare. So we knew that there's going to be a lot. And we staffed up our call centers and our account management and gave them the tools to manage a very high volume of inquiry that was going to occur. But quite frankly, they even exceeded our expectations. And so, we had to turn up some of our flexible resources to meet those needs during the fourth quarter in order to make sure we're well positioned for 1/1. And that's -- and obviously 1/1 is very, very important to us. Our call center costs and a lot of these components do run through the cost of goods sold, so those numbers drive down margin. But again, at the end of the day, these are things that we worked our way through. January was a tough month. With everything going on from the suspension of pre-existing conditions to covering people till they're 26. Think of yourself if you're a senior and you're trying to choose all this -- all the different Medicare options you have available during the fourth quarter. There's just tons of questions that arise. And we have to staff up for that. I think we're pretty comfortable with where we came in, I think we did a very good job with that. But it's always a challenge. Jeff, do you have anything you want to add?"

PBM price, pass-through pricing can have the same price on average per drug on a bushel basket of drugs, whether it's pass-through or what we call spread or traditional pricing. The benefit of this pass-through or spread is you now you know you've got your vendor, your PBM, aligned with you.

One of the big things we did when we had such success when simvastatin came up from Zocor was the effort we put on keeping people on Zocor.

Some drugs are easier to get at than others. But the idea is to -- when you have an Express Scripts card and you go in and you find out you've got a pretty severe disease, you can have -- so a lot of our blues plans now there. Our number is printed, and there's a prior authorization number. And as you know, when you go to the doctor, they always take a picture of the front and back of your card. On the back of that card will be this number you have to call. So when the doctor, before they start you out on like the specific MS drug, they would call that number first to get authorized. And it does two things for us, and that occurs both at the clinic level and could occur at the hospital level, depending on the disparity of the disease and where you're at. So we'll talk first in the hospital. But what ends up happening when they call that number, they get you on the right therapy and start by prior authorizing and prior approving which therapy you're going to be on, so that you're on the right drug, and just as importantly, at the right cost. If that clinic drug bills the health plan and those dollars are buried inside of the codes, the codes from the hospital, the clinic, trying to decipher and pull that out and make sure it's being done at the right price is often after the fact, and trying to get your arms around that is very difficult. So the goal here is to get all this stuff done ahead of time. Similarly to what we do at a pharmacy. Today when you walk into a pharmacy with your card, obviously, it's all realtime electronics. That doesn't exist with many of the clinics and hospitals. So the idea is to start using those tools and leveraging them into that space to help control those costs. And by the way, once we get that prior authorization in, we now can really start looking at the adherence levels. Because again, as you probably know, a lot of people get diagnosed with a pretty severe disease, there's a tremendous amount of issues that go around that. The members' willingness to accept it. All the things that go into managing the family approach to your or the patient's situation. And so, it gives us the opportunity we see that the drug has been prior approved. And then if we don't see the adjudication occur, we now have the ability to reach out to both the doctor and the patient and make sure we get that patient started on therapy. So there's a lot of health improvements that occur as well as cost reductions."

We're going to fight it incredibly hard. There's probably more of a leaning towards looking for ways to save money than we've seen in a long time. And as the Republicans and some of the key Democrats both understand, at least I hope they understand the deficits we're facing, and this is a key move. But at the end of the day, biosimilars isn't the answer, it's biogenerics. And we've got to move down that path. And we're still a way's away from that, but that's something that our people in Washington are very focused on. Myself; Doctor Miller, our Chief Medical Officer; and Keith, our General Counsel. We have to take the responsibility for all of our clients and for America at large to try to get this fixed. Because Europe is working in Europe,  there's a tremendous opportunity to drive down cost. And once we get those tools, of a biogeneric or even to that degree of biosimilar once it gets to market in place, then our tools become that much better, and our opportunities become that much greater.

And I understand that. I mean, I understand why some of you may be concerned. But at the end of the day, and I've been saying this for -- i don't know, I was CFO before I was CEO, so I guess, 14 years. I think when you'll see pricing pressures when we can't grow earnings any longer. And from my perspective, there's two ways to sell. You sell on results, which is drive down cost for your clients and give them a better offering, which improves health outcomes for their patients, or you drop price because you have nothing to offer. And I think this management team has always stayed incredibly disciplined, and we understand the commitment we have to make to our shareholders, the commitment we have to make to our clients and patients, and we understand that we can't sit back and rest on our laurels. We have to constantly innovate inside of our space and bring new solutions that are meeting the needs of today's problems to our clients in order to sell our services at a higher price. And not necessarily a higher price. Keep in mind what's happening here. There's inflation, generic launches and utilization trends and aging population. A lot of things are causing drug spends to go up. So the question isn't, do I have to go out to my clients and ask for an increase and price? That hasn't happened since I started here. No client ever allowed me to raise their price. What happens is that the amount of those increases and utilization trends and changing dynamics that are occurring, which is driving up drug spend, how much of that does the client get to capture as a reduction to that trend line versus how much of that profit opportunity do I get to deliver to our shareholders versus how life stabilized my patient's price. That's the dynamic that works here. And so, it's how much of those increasing trends do I get to keep? And that's what we focus on, and that's what we drive for. So each and every year or every three years and our clients come up for repricing, they get deeper discounts. What's happened over those three years, is that if you assume a eight, nine, 10, pick a number of drug cost inflation, do the math. What happened to the discount that you have to be able to deliver in order to try to make sure that those numbers stay in conformity with the trends we're trying to hit. So it's a tremendously dynamic process. And again, I think if you can make your client comfortable that you're doing everything in your power and not causing disruption of the membership to manage that drug trend and at the same time improve their health outcomes, they're willing to pay for it. And that's what we see in our numbers and that's the model we offer."

317975,118740819,104303,"Express Scripts Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2011",2011-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Evernorth Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. Today, we are pleased to report another strong quarter. As I told you last quarter, we believe there are only a few metrics that truly matter with the creation of long-term shareholder value: claim, earnings per share, EBITDA, cash flow,",584,"Thank you, David. Today, we are pleased to report another strong quarter. As I told you last quarter, we believe there are only a few metrics that truly matter with the creation of long-term shareholder value: claim, earnings per share, EBITDA, cash flow, and of course return on invested capital. 
Our performance on all of these metrics for both the quarter and the year was strong. Adjusted claims grew to $753.9 million for the year. Earnings per share was $0.71 for the quarter and $2.50 for the year, reflecting 40% growth over full year 2009. All of this growth in EPS came from operations, as EBITDA was up 42% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 20% to $2.1 billion, and return on invested capital was 20.5%. And I note that this calculation includes all intangible assets in the base.
On last quarter's call, we discussed our view on guidance, which we believe may be slightly different than some of our peers. To reiterate, we focused on forecast accuracy, guide to only the metrics that matter and create long-term shareholder value by delivering on these metrics. 
For 2011, we still expect EPS to be in a range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30% over 2010. As it is still early in the year, the range around the midpoint has not narrowed. As we move through the year, there are several factors that could move our performance above or below the midpoint of this range.
In keeping with our view on guidance, our policy is not to provide quarterly forecast, as we believe that would only distract us from our long-term goals. However, as we transitioned out of integration, we'd like to provide a point of clarity. As I said last quarter, earnings per share for 2011 would be more back-end loaded than normal. 
First quarter 2011 EPS is expected to be below fourth quarter of 2010 EPS. This expected decline is driven by the normal seasonality of client renewals, increased call volumes as a result of planned changes, which is even higher this year as a result of the Health Care Reform changes. And unlike prior years, we expect only a minimal increase in generic fill rate in the first quarter to offset these normal seasonal patterns.
The strong historical performance and outlook for the future I just summarized can be attributed to our focus on the metrics that matter and the consistent execution of our business model of alignment. We follow a simple four-step process to develop and implement field-tested and market-ready innovations to our clients. We work tirelessly to listen, study and understand our clients' needs. We analyze of these needs in terms of both clinical and financial components. Then utilizing our advanced understanding of human behavior, we design and pilot innovative approaches to eliminate waste and improve outcome while maximizing member acceptance. Finally, we closely monitor program performance against design expectations to continually refine and optimize financial and clinical outcome.
All of this is done in a clinical-first culture, where decisions are data driven and based on facts derived from randomized controlled trials. The significant investment have made in our research and new solutions lab, which is unique in the industry, is a testament to our belief in the power of this differentiated model. This model creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, creates superior shareholder value for our stockholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

The milestones we reached this year are tangible proof of the strength of our business model and the commitment of our employees to improve clinical outcomes, while driving out wasteful spending. As a result of our focus, dedication and passion for service, we delivered record earnings and record cash flow, while accomplishing the following. The seamless and efficient migration of NextRx Live with minimal disruption. 
Thanks to great cooperation from both companies, we were able to achieve our goals in this area on forecast. This alliance now opens new horizons for improving healthcare outcomes. The near completion of rationalizing our footprint and realization of synergies, the opening of our new technology and innovation center, which secures our best-in-class pharmacy technology leadership, and as Jeff mentioned, the launch of our new research and new lab solutions while We are expanding the application scope and valid of Consumerology. 
During December, we hosted two important events, our annual kickoff meeting with our national sales force and our annual consultant summit, where we bring together leading PBM consultants to discuss our unique and differentiated approach to the marketplace. In all my Express Scripts years, I don't remember a time that both groups were as bullish on our valued proposition and product offering as they are today. 
We're returning data-driven research into insights and the insights into real solutions that improve care and drive out weights in the pharmacy benefit. Our investments in Consumerology not only differentiates us in the marketplace but also sustain our competitive advantage. It is now clear, optimal clinical outcomes cannot be accomplished without an advanced understanding of behavior. Consumer decisions and choices often stand between doctor's orders and the patient achieving the best care at the lowest cost. We embarked on a mission nearly five years ago to understand this behavioral component and it's working.
Not only do we have industry-leading insights in the consumer health behavior, we have successfully translated those insights into solutions that have proven to be both effective and member friendly. Previously, I mentioned how enthused we are about our offerings for the selling season, here's why: We recently launched select solutions, a family of choice-based products that nudge members to positive behaviors in a radically new way. Following the success of Select Home Delivery, we applied the behavioral science to address other challenges in pharmacy benefiting, including, drug mix, therapy adherence and specialty pharmacy. Now to the power of choice, plan sponsors of members alike were able to effectively manage the pharmacy benefit, both clinically and financially.
Also, we recently launched specialty benefit services, a next-generation breakthrough that delivers enhanced patient care access across the pharmacy medical spectrum. Specialty benefit services applies proven management methods to both the pharmacy and medical components, especially spend, driving significant savings while improving health care outcomes. 
We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in our marketplace. Clearly understanding and improving patient behavior will be more crucial than ever as we help clients and members navigate the health care environment in the wake of health care reform. We also will enhance our leading position in the management of cost and health outcomes in the fast-growing specialty pharmacy area.
Our focus on consumer behavior will allow us to be the most effective and successful PBM at maximizing health outcomes, while reducing costs through the advent of biosimilars. Our unique value proposition and innovative approach to the management of pharmacy benefit will allow us to continue our lower cost per plan sponsors, improve health outcomes for our patients and drive superior returns for our stockholders. At this point, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

But keep in mind, we give guidance, and one of the problems you have when you give guidance is that the more metrics you give, the more micro components you have to manage. In reality, business has to be nimble, and we have to be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, and we have to anticipate what's coming down the pipe. So when we look at Medicare changes, Medicaid opportunities that afford themselves, new client opportunities, implementation costs, all those things going into a bucket. And our job is to deliver on what we told you we would deliver on. And to the extent that we could have higher margin, it gives us more opportunity to invest in things, to speed up, accelerate investments, to improve our long-term goals, to the extents we are overwhelmed with new clients coming on board, if you will, then we got to spend the money now to bring those up. And all those things go into an analysis, which at the beginning of the year, nobody has a crystal ball that tells you where you're going to come in. So our best guess is to try to give guidance. We like, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, our goal is to hit EBITDA targets, ROIC goals and earnings goals. And throughout the course of the year, there's going to be gives and takes on the timing of generics, when do clients actually buy clinical programs? When do they put in Select Home Delivery? All those pieces go into the numbers that could allow us to beat our midpoint of our range, to be slightly below the midpoint of our range or to give us a shift between gross margin and EBITDA. Having said all that, to your earlier question, was there unusual costs? I don't think any of us at Express Scripts truly understood the amount of confusion that was being dealt to the marketplace through Health Care Reform and all the myriad of changes that were coming in on Medicare. So we knew that there's going to be a lot. And we staffed up our call centers and our account management and gave them the tools to manage a very high volume of inquiry that was going to occur. But quite frankly, they even exceeded our expectations. And so, we had to turn up some of our flexible resources to meet those needs during the fourth quarter in order to make sure we're well positioned for 1/1. And that's -- and obviously 1/1 is very, very important to us. Our call center costs and a lot of these components do run through the cost of goods sold, so those numbers drive down margin. But again, at the end of the day, these are things that we worked our way through. January was a tough month. With everything going on from the suspension of pre-existing conditions to covering people till they're 26. Think of yourself if you're a senior and you're trying to choose all this -- all the different Medicare options you have available during the fourth quarter. There's just tons of questions that arise. And we have to staff up for that. I think we're pretty comfortable with where we came in. I think we did a very good job with that. But it's always a challenge. Jeff, do you have anything you want to add?"

But the constructive constraints around the benefit designs and access in the meaningful way. And using the tools of the PBM step therapy as per authorization programs, formularity designs, those things can really take a lot of cost out.

Because keep in mind, the drug side of this thing, it's 15% or so of the cost, and so they still want to tack that other 85% and get their arms around the whole thing.

And there was a lot of request for that. We still get them, but I don't think the demand or the requirements are nearly as strong as they used to be. And I think the reason is, is because the PBMs have been able to demonstrate significant savings through their models. And i.e., that is if we can show our profit alignment to the client being in the generic side, it certainly speaks. PBM price, pass-through pricing can have the same price on average per drug on a bushel basket of drugs, whether it's pass-through or what we call spread or traditional pricing. The benefit of this pass-through or spread is you now know you've got your vendor, your PBM, aligned with you because if you put your profits in the generics, there's a more apt to try to push that. And I think more and more clients and more and more people that select our products understand that dynamic and have stayed with the traditional side.

Our recommendation now is to stay with Lipitor. You're going to maximize your generic benefit. You're going to maximize your discounts. The more people you can keep up Lipitor, because keep in mind as you move those people away from Lipitor, you're going to get a lot of will go to the generic, but some percentage of those will go to other statins, branded statins, which will have a cost driver once the drug goes generic.

If you watched the drug trends, when the drugs in this last year of patent protection, you'll see the market share of that drug declined pretty significantly through the course of that year. It's not getting support typically from the manufacturer. So the detail reps are all working to move it, and our job is to try to hold it. So that's going to be the big push this year is to hold our Lipitor percentages."

Some drugs are easier to get at than others. But the idea is to -- when you have an Express Scripts card and you go in and you find out you've got a pretty severe disease, you can have -- so a lot of our blues plans now there. Our number is printed, and there's a prior authorization number. And as you know, when you go to the doctor, they always take a picture of the front and back of your card. On the back of that card will be this number you have to call. So when the doctor, before they start you out on like the specific MS drug, they would call that number first to get authorized. And it does two things for us, and that occurs both at the clinic level and could occur at the hospital level, depending on the disparity of the disease and where you're at. So we'll talk first in the hospital. But what ends up happening when they call that number, they get you on the right therapy and start by prior authorizing and prior approving which therapy you're going to be on, so that you're on the right drug, and just as importantly, at the right cost. If that clinic drug bills the health plan and those dollars are buried inside of the codes, the codes from the hospital, the clinic, trying to decipher and pull that out and make sure it's being done at the right price is often after the fact, and trying to get your arms around that is very difficult. So the goal here is to get all this stuff done ahead of time. Similarly to what we do at a pharmacy. Today when you walk into a pharmacy with your card, obviously, it's all real-time electronics. That doesn't exist with many of the clinics and hospitals. So the idea is to start using those tools and leveraging them into that space to help control those costs. And by the way, once we get that prior authorization in, we now can really start looking at the adherence levels. Because again, as you probably know, a lot of people get diagnosed with a pretty severe disease, there's a tremendous amount of issues that go around that. The members' willingness to accept it. All the things that go into managing the family approach to yours or the patient's situation. And so, it gives us the opportunity we see that the drug’s been prior approved. And then if we don't see the adjudication occur, we now have the ability to reach out to both the doctor and the patient and make sure we get that patient started on therapy. So there's a lot of health improvements that occur as well as cost reductions."

And as the Republicans and some of the key Democrats both understand, at least I hope they understand, the deficits we're facing, and this is a key move. But at the end of the day, biosimilars isn't the answer. It's biogenerics. And we've got to move down that path. And we're still a way's away from that, but that's something that our people in Washington are very focused on. Myself, Doctor Miller, our Chief Medical Officer, and Keith, our General Counsel. We have to take the responsibility for all of our clients and for America at large to try to get this fixed. Because Europe is working in Europe, there's a tremendous opportunity to drive down cost.

And I understand that. I mean, I understand why some of you may be concerned. But at the end of the day, and I've been saying this for -- I don't know, I was CFO before I was CEO, so I guess, 14 years. I think when you'll see pricing pressures when we can't grow earnings any longer. And from my perspective, there's two ways to sell. You sell on results, which is drive down cost for your clients and give them a better offering, which improves health outcomes for their patients, or you drop price because you have nothing to offer. And I think this management team has always stayed incredibly disciplined, and we understand the commitment we have to make to our shareholders, the commitment we have to make to our clients and patients, and we understand that we can't sit back and rest on our laurels. We have to constantly innovate inside of our space and bring new solutions that are meeting the needs of today's problems to our clients in order to sell our services at a higher price. And not necessarily a higher price. Keep in mind what's happening here. There's inflation, generic launches and utilization trends and aging population. A lot of things are causing drug spends to go up. So the question isn't, do I have to go out to my clients and ask for an increase and price? That hasn't happened since I started here. No client ever allowed me to raise their price. What happens is that the amount of those increases and utilization trends and changing dynamics that are occurring, which is driving up drug spend, how much of that does the client get to capture as a reduction to that trend line versus how much of that profit opportunity do I get to deliver to our shareholders versus how life stabilized my patient's price. That's the dynamic that works here. And so, it's how much of those increasing trends do I get to keep? And that's what we focus on, and that's what we drive for. So each and every year or every three years and our clients come up for repricing, they get deeper discounts. What's happened over those three years, is that if you assume a eight, nine, 10, pick a number of drug cost inflation, do the math. What happened to the discount that you have to be able to deliver in order to try to make sure that those numbers stay in conformity with the trends we're trying to hit? So it's a tremendously dynamic process. And again, I think if you can make your client comfortable that you're doing everything in your power and not causing disruption of the membership to manage that drug trend and at the same time improve their health outcomes, they're willing to pay for it. And that's what we see in our numbers and that's the model we offer."

And Larry, when we look at it's getting a little ahead of itself so, we see those numbers starting, clients are already out for bids for 1/1/12.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations. Our Q1 results are in-line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call that EPS for the first quarter would be below the fourth quarter and at the year would be more backend loaded than normal. The lower-than-expected volume was the result of lower utilization across our book of business, lower than anticipated in-group growth, higher than expected number of attrition at some of our clients, and these drivers were partially offset by higher-than-expected prescriptions in Canada.
In the first quarter, we completed the integration of Nexstar X at the lower end of both our original timeframe and cost estimates. Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions as a core competency and our execution was smooth and efficient with minimal disruption. We believe that operating on one platform is imperative in meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by health care reform and Medicare and Medicaid expansions. Our best in class offering also provides us unique opportunities to meet our growth initiatives.
Last night, we also announced our intention to raise funds through a debt offering. The proceeds are expected to be used to finance the share repurchases or for other general purposes. The offering is expected to occur during the next few weeks. In addition, subject to the completion of the debt offering, our Board has approved an increase in our share repurchase program. Given the pending offering, that is all we can discuss at this point about the proposed debt offering of the share repurchases.
We remain on track to achieve full year EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30%. This guidance range includes the expected impact from our debt offering and any share repurchases in the year. As we have said in the past two quarterly calls, we expect this EPS to be more backend loaded than historical trends. Since there still seems to be some confusion about what we mean by back-end loaded, let me give a little more detail. EPS is expected to grow sequentially for the remainder of the year, and EPS in the second would be a higher percentage of the total year EPS than it has been in the past several years. This back-end loading of earnings is primarily driven by four factors. First, volume. Our guidance assumes Rx growth of flat to plus 4% while Q1 was flat. Our guidance also assumes that we will see utilization improvement, improvement in number growth and the implementation of a few known midyear starts.  Second, timing of generic launches. As you know, 2010 and 2011 are light generic years. And as a result, most of the benefits in generic drugs is expected in the third and fourth quarters. Third, share repurchases. Since there were no repurchases in the fourth or first quarters as anticipated in our original guidance, share repurchases are now expected to mainly impact the remainder of the year.  And fourth, now that integration is complete, we are pursuing several profitability and efficiency projects that will continue to improve financial performance in the latter part of the year.
As we have discussed in the past, we expect a significantly increased spending on projects and 2011 to support new products and services, long-term growth and profitability. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase year-over-year and noncapital expenses during the remainder of the year will offset the reduction in first quarter implementation expenses.
Our research and new solutions lab is an example of one of the many investments we are making in this working lab, we are expanding the scope and value of Consumerology where insights lead to the development of innovation and effective solutions. Our differentiated approach creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, create superior value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

And now, more than ever, plant sponsors need our proven tools for driving out ways to improving health outcomes. As a result, there was tremendous interest in our recent outcomes conference and our industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost cutting-edge solutions for more effectively managing the pharmacy benefit. The Drug Trend Report identified $403 billion of waste in the U.S. due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior relating to drug mix, channel and nonadherence. Despite doctor's best efforts in diagnosing and treating diseases, what stands between healthcare providers and high-quality health outcomes is consumer behavior.
Our research has found that there is a fundamental gap between how consumers intend to behave and what they actually do. We discovered that the majority of patients want to engage in the same behaviors plans sponsors can seek. But patient desires often remain dormant. That is, there is a persistent intent behavior gap, and the key to success in structuring interventions that close the gap between what patients really want and what they actually do. At Express Scripts new lab solutions Lab, we are turning data into insights and insights into proven solutions. We focus on applying the behavioral sciences to make it easy for patients to act on their own good intentions. It is possible to significantly narrow the intent behavior gap, which accounts for 33% or $134 billion of the nation's $403 billion in pharmacy ways.
With proven solutions that activate intentions and help patients do what they already want to do.
Our history is one of providing innovative solutions to lower cost and improve health outcomes. Because we preserve choice by aligning behavior with underlying intentions, these programs can be achieved with very little number noise. Moving forward, consumer behavior will continue to elevate the importance of plan sponsors strive to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit. Clearly understanding and improving patient behavior will be crucial, as we help clients and members navigate the healthcare environment in the wake of Health Care Reform. Our strong relationship with our health plan clients, coupled with our deepening understanding of patient behaviors, will serve us well in meeting the needs of the new healthcare consumer.
As just discussed, the high end of our 2011 guidance anticipates an improving economy. During the first quarter, utilization fell short of our expectations. Also, we have yet to see in the aggregate our plan sponsors and health plan clients admit new members. As such, prescription growth fell short of our expectations. We mostly offset this shortfall in Scripts through expense management and new margin initiatives. And as you know, when we drive our clients costs, we improve our financial performance.
Our business remain strong, and we are bullish on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. We continue to increase our spending including CapEx, this year to position our company to be best in class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as preparing for the healthcare reform environment. Our ability to understand behavior, drive out waste and improve health outcomes should translate into continued superior returns for our stockholders.

I think our select offerings are being very well received in the marketplace, and it's what we were discussing on the prepared remarks, and that is clients want to manage costs. If you think about the situation on what's the benefit manager sets, there's the CEOs, CFOs, looking for cross savings and expense reductions. At the same time, the benefit managers working for the HR Director, who has a challenge of retaining key members of the staff, making the health plan attractive to all the membership inside the organization. And often in the past, those two things were not always lined up very well. Our select solutions programs allows the health plan sponsor to be able to drive out cost while having minimal impact on the membership of the company. That is very, very well received, and they're being received very, very much so, as you stated, by large employer groups. We're very early in the season. Keep in mind that in our business, there's still a 90-plus percent, closer to 95%, retention rate.

I'll take a quick stab of some of this, and then Jeff can certainly add, Lisa, and good morning. You're absolutely right. When select programs come in, especially things like that are addressed towards adherence, yes, we do see increases in Rx growth",501,"Yes. I'll take a quick stab of some of this, and then Jeff can certainly add, Lisa, and good morning. You're absolutely right. When select programs come in, especially things like that are addressed towards adherence, yes, we do see increases in Rx growth. During the first quarter, keep in mind what happens. During the January 1st timeframe, we do new client implementation. The client -- company basically goes on hold. We don't roll out new IT solutions during that period. Our task is to really make sure that we perform well on our new client starts and just about every plan has some change, whether it's changing formulary, whether it's changing cold base, conducting levels, you name it, there's changes. We have to have '11 right. If '11 isn't right, then the rest of the year becomes very difficult. Quite frankly, if we don't provide top of the class service and trying to get clients to do put in select programs or anything else for the remainder of the year becomes very difficult. So during the fourth quarter, first quarter, we did not see the uptick in some of those programs as we were focused on '11. Through the remainder of the year, we will see those programs kicking in, whether it's Select Home Delivery, whether it's Select, our Step Therapy, or even things around adherence and select narrowing networks. We have preferred networks, which leave out certain providers and high-cost providers, which are proving to be very well received in the marketplace. Those pharmacies that don't want to meet the needs of the marketplace and driving down costs, the countries today is through all the focus on healthcare won't tolerate pharmacies that won't participate on a cost, on a program of driving out cost. So those -- so that's becoming more and more receptive, and we can do the same thing with select programs and narrowing the network. So all those things, whether it's shipping them between shifting the script from its channel to, from one pharmacy to another or from one drug to another, all can both improve utilization as well as enhance margins. As you know, Lisa, over the years, we've been very focused, not only on utilization. We don't want to be a one-trick pony. When we have issues that hit any line item on our income statement, we work very hard to make sure we make up those differences in other areas. So although utilization came in lower than our expectations, we were very, very focused on making sure that we didn't adjust our range because we have confidence that we'll be able to continue to improve other areas of the income statement to improve financial performance. So we're very much focused on that. In addition on new scripts, well, keep in mind, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, we also have some midyear start. We have several 71 clients that will coming up. So all that goes into the Rx growth as well."

But we also don't want to be -- our motto has never been maximize generics. Our motto has always been drive out cost and waste.

Last year, we did a pilot with the managed care plan that put in Select Home Delivery. And the numbers that came through weren't as great as you would normally get on commercial book, but they were quite compelling. In other words, you're dealing with most managed care plans, you're dealing with a lot of small, very small employers to medium-size employer groups. Some have large employers, but it's a different mix than going into a Fortune 500 company with the program. And so to be able to reach out and touch each of those members is a little tougher. Having said all that, the increase in mail penetration rate was rather significant. And I think both the client and us are very pleased with the outcomes of that, and we're preparing to roll that out in a bigger way. One of the things you got to be careful with, Larry, as you know, is that '11 always ushers in a new mix of clients. So you lose some, we gain some. We lost a couple of plants that had very high mail penetration that were previously discussed during the course of the last year. So one of those roll-off on '11, which had heavy mail penetration use. So that brings down mail penetration level. The other clients put in Select Home Delivery. Some of that could stall beyond '11 so that could be more effective and roll it out after the '11 implementation date this may start a little after that date, a little later so that we don't go off on top of the implementation programs. And so all those things will come to fruition this year. With respect to the client you're referring to, I think that is a focus of ours, that client and all of our managed your clients as they are trying to compete more effectively and to bring down their cost so they have a better offering. The Select Home Delivery as well as other select programs are being very well received and we hope to implement many of those through the course of this year."

Obviously, we had a large implementation for some of the final WellPoint wives in Q4, so those people were in Q4 and Q1. And the other thing we saw was an increase in call volumes around healthcare reform that the level of calls and the amount of time that people wanted to talk about potential changes to their benefit plans was higher than it has been in the past. So we definitely saw that cost. What I said earlier was that as those costs roll-off, we do expect, as anticipated, that our spending on project is going to increase as the course of the year, really offsetting the decline in cost. But as George said, we do expect kind of a normal seasonal growth in margins as we move forward through the course of the year."

The one that's relatively new and that's being, gaining quite a bit of exposure, quite a bit of attention is the whole thing around select networks, where we can go to a client with a narrow network and have a broader -- so we're effectively giving two network offerings. One ought broad and one narrow, and let the members choose. And typically, when you can show a number that there is a drugstore with a very close proximity of a very expensive drugstore that they're currently using. And so the members not put out, there isn't any change in effect, they can help reduce their costs. The way it works is there's a penalty after they get a couple filled. They get a couple of fills to the old drugstore, and then when they don't -- if they don't switch, then they pay a higher price to go to the higher cost drugstore. And the idea is if the plan sponsor has to pay a higher cost, the number should share in the cost savings. This way, they can keep their costs the same if they move to a lower cost pharmacy.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations. Our Q1 results are in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call th",670,"Thanks, David. This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations. Our Q1 results are in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call that EPS for the first quarter would be below the fourth quarter and at the year would be more back-end loaded than normal. The lower-than-expected volume was the result of: lower utilization across our book of business, lower than anticipated in-group growth, higher than expected number attrition at some of our clients, and these drivers were partially offset by higher-than-expected prescriptions in Canada.
In the first quarter, we completed the integration of NextRx at the lower end of both our original timeframe and cost estimates. Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions as a core competency and our execution was smooth and efficient with minimal disruption. We believe that operating on 1 platform is imperative in meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Health Care Reform and Medicare and Medicaid expansions. Our best-in-class offering also provides us unique opportunities to meet our growth initiatives.
Last night, we also announced our intention to raise funds through a debt offering. The proceeds are expected to be used to finance the share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes. The offering is expected to occur during the next few weeks. In addition, subject to the completion of the debt offering, our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase program. Given the pending offering, that is all we can discuss at this point about the proposed debt offering or the share repurchases.
We remain on track to achieve full year EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30%. This guidance range includes the expected impact from our debt offering and any share repurchases in the year. As we have said in the past 2 quarterly calls, we expect this EPS to be more back-end loaded than historical trends. Since there still seems to be some confusion about what we mean by back-end loaded, let me give a little more detail. EPS is expected to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year, and EPS in the second half will be a higher percentage of the total year EPS than it has been in the past several years. This back-end loading of earnings is primarily driven by four factors. First, volume. Our guidance assumes Rx growth of flat to plus 4% while Q1 was flat. Our guidance also assumes that we will see utilization improvement, improvement in number growth and the implementation of a few known mid-year starts.  Second, timing of generic launches. As you know, 2010 and 2011 are light generic years. And as a result, most of the benefits in generic drugs is expected in the third and fourth quarters. Third, share repurchases. Since there were no repurchases in the fourth or first quarter as anticipated in our original guidance, share repurchases are now expected to mainly impact the remainder of the year.  And fourth, now that integration is complete, we are pursuing several profitability and efficiency projects that will continue to improve financial performance in the latter part of the year.
As we have discussed in the past, we expect a significantly increased spending on projects in 2011 to support new products and services, long-term growth and profitability. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase year-over-year, and noncapital expenses during the remainder of the year will offset the reduction in first quarter implementation expenses.
Our Research & New Solutions Lab is an example of 1 of the many investments we are making. In this working lab, we are expanding the scope and value of Consumerology where insights lead to the development of innovation and effective solutions. Our differentiated approach creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, creates superior value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

And now more than ever, plan sponsors need our proven tools for driving out ways and improving health outcomes. As a result, there was tremendous interest in our recent outcomes conference and our industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost -- cutting-edge solutions for more effectively managing the pharmacy benefit. The Drug Trend Report identified $403 billion of waste in the U.S. due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior relating to drug mix, channel and nonadherence. Despite doctor's best efforts in diagnosing and treating diseases, what stands between healthcare providers and high-quality health outcomes is consumer behavior.
Our research has found that there is a fundamental gap between how consumers intend to behave and what they actually do. We discovered that the majority of patients want to engage in the same behaviors plan sponsors can seek. But patient desires often remain dormant. That is, there is a persistent intent behavior gap and the key to success in structuring interventions that close the gap between what patients really want and what they actually do. At Express Scripts Research & New Solutions Lab, we are turning data into insights and insights into proven solutions. We focus on applying the behavioral sciences to make it easy for patients to act on their own good intentions. It is possible to significantly narrow the intent behavior gap, which accounts to 33% or $134 billion of the nation's $403 billion in pharmacy waste, with proven solutions that will activate intentions and help patients do what they already want to do.
Our history is 1 of providing innovative solutions to lower cost and improve health outcomes. Because we preserve choice by aligning behavior with underlying intentions, these programs can be achieved with very little number noise. Moving forward, consumer behavior will continue to elevate the importance of plan sponsors strive to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit. Clearly, understanding and improving patient behavior will be crucial, as we help clients and members navigate the healthcare environment in the wake of Health Care Reform. Our strong relationships with our health plans clients, coupled with our deepening understanding of patient behaviors, will serve us well in meeting the needs of the new healthcare consumer.
As just discussed, the high end of our 2011 guidance anticipates an improving economy. During the first quarter, utilization fell short of our expectations. Also, we have yet to see in the aggregate our plan sponsors and health plan clients add net new members. As such, prescription growth fell short of our expectations. We mostly offset the shortfall in scripts through expense management and new margin initiatives. And as you know, when we drive down our clients costs, we improve our financial performance.
Our business remain strong, and we are bullish on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. We continue to increase our spending including CapEx this year to position our company to be best in class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as preparing for the healthcare reform environment. Our ability to understand behavior, drive out waste and improve health outcomes should translate into continued superior returns for our stockholders.

Yes, when we look out to the year, you're right. I think our select offerings are being very well received in the marketplace, and it's what we were discussing on the prepared remarks, and that is clients want to manage costs. If you think about the situation on what's the benefit managers sit, there's the CEO, CFO, looking for cost savings and expense reductions. At the same time, the benefit manager is working for the HR Director, who has a challenge of retaining key members of the staff, making the health plan attractive to all the membership inside the organization. And often in the past, those 2 things were not always lined up very well. Our select solutions program allows the health -- that plan sponsor to be able to drive out cost while having minimal impact on the membership of the company. They have been very, very well received, and they're being received very, very much so, as you stated, by large employer groups. We're very early in the season. Keep in mind that in our business, there's still a 90-plus percent, closer to 95% retention rate. And our job is to try to find those clients who, where in the current provider is not providing innovative and creative solutions that meets their needs. I think being on 1 platform, I think being very innovative and creative in the way we address the health plan benefit for our plan sponsors, our passion behind number service and driving out the waste, I think all align well for those clients that are looking for someone that can provide timely solutions to their needs. So we're optimistic. Obviously, it's very early. I can't really give you an update on where we see new business heading for this year, but we are very encouraged and excited about the selling season.

I'll take a little quick stab at some of this, and then Jeff can certainly add, Lisa. You're absolutely right. When select programs come in, especially things like -- that are addressed towards adherence, and yes, we do see increases in Rx growth. During the first quarter, keep in mind what happens. During the January 1 timeframe, we do new client implementation. The client -- the company basically goes on hold. We don't roll out new IT solutions during that period. Our task is to really make sure that we perform well on our new client starts and just about every plan had some change, whether it's changing formulary, whether it's changing copays, deductible levels, you name it, there's changes. We have to have '11 right. If '11 isn't right, then the rest of the year becomes very difficult. And quite frankly, if we don't provide top-of-class service, then trying to get clients that do put in select programs or anything else through the remainder of the year becomes very difficult. So during the fourth quarter -- first quarter, we did not see the uptick in some of those programs as we are focused on '11. Through the remainder of the year, we will see those programs kicking in, whether it's Select Home Delivery, whether it's Select Step Therapy,  or even things around adherence and select narrowing networks. We have preferred networks, which leave out certain providers and high-cost providers, which are proving to be very well received in the marketplace. Those pharmacies that don't want to meet the needs of the marketplace and driving down costs, the country today, through all the focus on healthcare, won't tolerate pharmacies that won't participate on a cost -- on a program of driving out cost. So those are -- so that's becoming more and more receptive, and we can do the same thing with select programs and narrowing the network. So all those things, whether it's shifting on between -- shifting the script from its channel to it, from 1 pharmacy to another or from 1 drug to another, all can both improve utilization as well as enhance margins. As you know, Lisa, over the years, we've been very focused, not only on utilization. We don't want to be a one-trick pony. When we have issues that hit any line item on our income statement, we work very hard to make sure we make up those differences in other areas. So although utilization came in lower than our expectations, we are very, very focused on making sure that we didn't adjust our range because we have confidence that we'll be able to continue to improve other areas of the income statement to improve financial performance. So we're very much focused on that. In addition on new scripts, well, keep in mind, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, we also have some mid-year start. We have several 71 clients that will be coming up. So all that goes into the Rx growth as well."

I tend to think of those costs for the most part as fixed as most of them are people and buildings and other -- and the variable part of them is really the investments that we're making. So what I've said earlier was that as we move through the course of the year, we expect to see that level of investment increased as we move through the year. But at the end of the day, the core of that is really fixed. So if revenue comes up, the percentage could come down. But I think looking at percent of revenue is just the wrong way to look at it. We're always looking at ways to get more efficient, and we're balancing that with making investments so that we can deliver the products and services that our clients want and need to manage their trend and to give out the long-term growth and profitability that we're looking for."

Second follow-up, George, it's interesting in your Drug Trend Report this year, I know you discussed this drug mix complexity issue. I know you've talked about this in the past. In the past, the idea is you want to maximize share at fill rates to drive down trend. You addressed the idea in some cases, some branded manufacturers may be willing to be so aggressive on rebates that the value proposition to the customer may not be maximized on maximizing generic fill rates. And I know you're generic fill rate this quarter was down sequentially, slightly. So could you elaborate on that and how you're thinking about selling to clients that way?"

I do believe that certain brand manufacturers are seeing opportunities to grow their share or to maintain their share as their drugs lose patent protection. As they're looking at their pipeline and new products and there may be a reason to have capacity to idle a factory or to idle a production line or to use at a very low percentage of previous levels can have a very adverse affect on cost, as you know. And so I think they are looking at ways. The point you're raising, Larry, is right on. Historically, generic fill rate was critically important to determine how low we were pulling through. But we also don't want to be -- our motto has never been maximize generics. Our motto has always been drive out cost and waste. And so if there's a branded product that actually costs less than a generic, we have no problem utilizing that brand because at the end of the day, it's going to be the best answer for our clients and our patients. So we are absolutely focused on that, and when those opportunities occur, we will absolutely take advantage of them."

Last year, we did a pilot with the managed care plan that put in Select Home Delivery. And the numbers that came through weren't as great as you would normally get on commercial book, but they were quite compelling. In other words, you're dealing with most managed care plans, you're dealing with a lot of small, very small employers to medium-size employer groups. Some have large employers, but it's a different mix than going into a Fortune 500 company with the program. And so to be able to reach out and touch each of those members is a little tougher. Having said all that, the increase in mail penetration rate was rather significant. And I think both the client and us are very pleased with the outcomes of that, and we're preparing to roll that out in a bigger way. One of the things you got to be careful with, Larry, as you know, is that '11 always ushers in a new mix of clients. So we lose some, we gain some. We lost a couple of plans that had very high mail penetration that were previously discussed during the course of the last year. So 1 of those rolled off on '11, which have a heavy mail penetration use. So that brings down mail penetration level. The other clients put in Select Home Delivery. Some of that could stall beyond '11, so we can be more effective and roll it out after the '11 implementation date. This may start a little after that date, a little later, so that we don't go off on top of the implementation programs. And so all those things will come to fruition this year with respect to the client you're referring to, I think that is a focus of ours, that client and all of our managed care clients as they are trying to compete more effectively and to bring down their cost so they have a better offering. The Select Home Delivery, as well as other select programs are being very well received, and we hope to implement many of those through the course of this year."

And typically, when you can show a number that there is a drugstore in very close proximity of a very expensive drugstore that they're currently using, and so the member is not put out, there isn't any change, then, in effect, they can help reduce their costs. The way it works is there's a penalty after they get a couple of fill. They get a couple of fills at the old drugstore, and then when they don't -- if they don't switch, then they pay a higher price to go to the higher cost drugstore. And the idea is if the plan sponsor has to pay a higher cost, the number should share in that cost savings. This way, they could keep their cost the same if they move to a lower-cost pharmacy.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations. Our Q1 results are in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call that EPS for the first quarter would be below the fourth quarter and that the year would be more back end loaded than normal. The lower than expected volume was the result of: Lower utilization across our book of business, lower-than-anticipated in group growth, higher than expected number attrition at some of our clients, and these drivers were partially offset by higher than expected prescriptions in Canada.
In the first quarter, we completed the integration of NextRx at the lower end of both our original timeframe and cost estimates. Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions is a core competency and our execution was smooth and efficient with minimal disruption. We believe that operating on 1 platform is imperative in meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Health Care Reform and Medicare and Medicaid expansions. Our best in class offering also provides us unique opportunities to meet our growth initiatives.
Last night, we also announced our intention to raise funds through a debt offering. The proceeds are expected to be used to finance the share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes. The offering is expected to occur during the next few weeks. In addition, subject to the completion of the debt offering, our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase program. Given the pending offering, that is all we can discuss at this point about the proposed debt offering or the share repurchases.
We remain on track to achieve full year EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30%. This guidance range includes the expected impact from our debt offering and any share repurchases in the year. As we have said in the past 2 quarterly calls, we expect this EPS to be more back end loaded than historical trends. Since there still seems to be some confusion about what we mean by back end loaded, let me give a little more detail. EPS is expected to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year, and EPS in the second half will be a higher percentage of the total year EPS than it has been in the past several years. This back end loading of earnings is primarily driven by 4 factors. First, volume. Our guidance assumes Rx growth of flat to plus 4% while Q1 was flat. Our guidance also assumes that we will see utilization improvement, improvement in number growth and the implementation of a few known mid year starts.  Second, timing of generic launches. As you know, 2010 and 2011 are light generic years. And as a result, most of the benefits in generic drugs is expected in the third and fourth quarters. Third, share repurchases. Since there were no repurchases in the fourth or first quarters as anticipated in our original guidance, share repurchases are now expected to mainly impact the remainder of the year.  And fourth, now that integration is complete, we are pursuing several profitability and efficiency projects that will continue to improve financial performance in the latter part of the year.
As we have discussed in the past, we expect to significantly increased spending on projects in 2011 to support new products and services, long term growth and profitability. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase year over year, and noncapital expenses during the remainder of the year will offset the reduction in first quarter implementation expenses.
Our Research & New Solutions Lab is an example of 1 of the many investments we are making. In this working lab, we are expanding the scope and value of Consumerology where insights lead to the development of innovation and effective solutions. Our differentiated approach creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, creates superior value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

Despite doctor's best efforts in diagnosing and treating diseases, what stands between healthcare providers and high quality health outcomes is consumer behavior.
Our research has found that there is a fundamental gap between how consumers intend to behave and what they actually do. We discovered that the majority of patients want to engage in the same behaviors plan sponsors seek. But patient desires often remain dormant. That is, there is a persistent intent behavior gap and the key to success in structuring interventions that close the gap between what patients really want and what they actually do. At Express Scripts Research & New Solutions Lab, we are turning data into insights and insights into proven solutions. We focus on applying the behavioral sciences to make it easy for patients to act on their own good intentions. It is possible to significantly narrow the intent behavior gap, which accounts for 33% or $134 billion of the nation's $403 billion in pharmacy waste, with proven solutions that will activate intentions and help patients do what they already want to do.
Our history is 1 of providing innovative solutions to lower cost and improve health outcomes. Because we preserve choice by aligning behavior with underlying intentions, these programs can be achieved with very little number noise. Moving forward, consumer behavior will continue to elevate the importance as plan sponsors strive to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit. Clearly, understanding and improving patient behavior will be crucial, as we help clients and members navigate the healthcare environment in the wake of Health Care Reform. Our strong relationships with our health plans clients, coupled with our deepening understanding of patient behaviors, will serve us well in meeting the needs of the new healthcare consumer.
As just discussed, the high end of our 2011 guidance anticipates an improving economy. During the first quarter, utilization fell short of our expectations. Also, we have yet to see in the aggregate our plan sponsors and health plan clients add net new members. As such, prescription growth fell short of our expectations. We mostly offset the shortfall in scripts through expense management and new margin initiatives. And as you know, when we drive down our clients costs, we improve our financial performance.
Our business remains strong, and we are bullish on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. We continue to increase our spending including CapEx this year to position our company to be best-in-class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as preparing for the Healthcare Reform environment. Our ability to understand behavior, drive out waste and improve health outcomes should translate into continued superior returns for our stockholders. At this point, we are happy to answer any questions. Operator?"

Yes, when we look out to the year, you're right. I think our select offerings are being very well received in the marketplace, and it's what we were discussing on the prepared remarks, and that is clients want to manage costs. If you think about the situation on which the benefit managers sit, there's the CEO, CFO, looking for cost savings and expense reductions. At the same time, the benefit manager is working for the HR Director, who has a challenge of retaining key members of the staff, making the health plan attractive to all the membership inside the organization. And often in the past, those 2 things were not always lined up very well. Our select solutions programs allows the health    that plan sponsor to be able to drive out cost while having minimal impact on the membership of the company. They have been very, very well received, and they're being received very, very much so, as you stated, by large employer groups. We're very early in the season. Keep in mind that in our business, there's still a 90 plus percent, closer to 95% retention rate. And our job is to try to find those clients who, where in the current provider is not providing innovative and creative solutions that meets their needs. I think being on 1 platform, I think being very innovative and creative in the way we address the health plan benefit for our plan sponsors, our passion behind member service and driving out the waste, I think all align well for those clients that are looking for someone that can provide timely solutions to their needs. So we're optimistic. Obviously, it's very early. I can't really give you an update on where we see new business heading for this year, but we are very encouraged and excited about the selling season. So we'll definitely keep you posted on that as the year rolls forward."

I'll take a little quick stab at some of this, and then Jeff can certainly add, Lisa. You're absolutely right. When select programs come in, especially things like    that are addressed towards adherence, then yes, we do see increases in Rx growth. During the first quarter, keep in mind what happens. During the January 1 timeframe, we do new client implementation. The client    the company basically goes on hold. We don't roll out new IT solutions during that period. Our task is to really make sure that we perform well on our new client starts and just about every plan has some change, whether it's changing formulary [ph], whether it's changing copays, deductible levels, you name it, there's changes. We have to have '11 right. If '11 isn't right, then the rest of the year becomes very difficult. And quite frankly, if we don't provide top of class service, then trying to get clients that do put in select programs or anything else through the remainder of the year becomes very difficult. So during the fourth quarter    first quarter, we did not see the uptick in some of those programs as we are focused on '11. Through the remainder of the year, we will see those programs kicking in, whether it's Select Home Delivery, whether it's Select Step Therapy, or even things around adherence and select narrowing networks. We have preferred networks, which leave out certain providers and high cost providers, which are proving to be very well received in the marketplace. Those pharmacies that don't want to meet the needs of the marketplace in driving down cost, the country today, through all the focus on healthcare, won't tolerate pharmacies that won't participate on a cost    on a program of driving out cost. So those are    so that's becoming more and more receptive, and we can do the same thing with select programs in narrowing a network. So all those things, whether it's shifting them between    shifting the script from its channel to its -- from 1 pharmacy to another or from 1 drug to another, all can both improve utilization as well as enhance margins. As you know, Lisa, over the years, we've been very focused, not only on utilization. We don't want to be a one trick pony. When we have issues that hit any line item on our income statement, we work very hard to make sure we make up those differences in other areas. So although utilization came in lower than our expectations, we are very, very focused on making sure that we didn't adjust our range because we have confidence that we'll be able to continue to improve other areas of the income statement to improve financial performance. So we're very much focused on that. In addition on new scripts growth, keep in mind, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, we also have some mid year starts. We have several 71 clients that will be coming up. So all that goes into the Rx growth as well."

As they're looking at their pipeline of new products and there may be a reason to have capacity to idle a factory or to idle a production line or to use at a very low percentage of previous levels can have a very adverse effect on cost, as you know. And so I think they are looking at ways. The point you're raising, Larry, is right on. Historically, generic fill rate was critically important to determine how well we were pulling through. But we also don't want to be    our motto has never been maximize generics. Our motto has always been drive out cost and waste. And so if there's a brand new product that actually costs less than a generic, we have no problem utilizing that brand because at the end of the day, it's going to be the best answer for our clients and our patients. So we are absolutely focused on that, and when those opportunities occur, we will absolutely take advantage of them."

Last year, we did a pilot with the managed care plan that put in Select Home Delivery. And the numbers that came through weren't as great as you would normally get on a commercial book, but they were quite compelling. In other words, you're dealing with most managed care plans, you're dealing with a lot of small, very small employers to medium size employer groups. Some have large employers, but it's a different mix than going into a Fortune 500 company with the program. And so to be able to reach out and touch each of those members is a little tougher. Having said all that, the increase in mail penetration rate was rather significant. And I think both the client and us are very pleased with the outcomes of that, and we're preparing to roll that out in a bigger way. One of the things you got to be careful with, Larry, as you know, is that '11 always ushers in a new mix of clients. So we lose some, we gain some. We lost a couple of plans that had very high mail penetration that were previously discussed during the course of the last year. So 1 of those rolled off on '11, which had a heavy mail penetration use. So that brings down the mail penetration level. The other clients put in Select Home Delivery. Some of that gets stalled beyond '11, so we can be more effective and roll it out after the '11 implementation date. This may start a little after that date, a little later, so that we don't go off on top of the implementation programs and so all those things will come to fruition this year.  With respect to the client you're referring to, I think that is a focus of ours, that client and all of our managed care clients as they are trying to compete more effectively and to bring down their cost so they have a better offering. The Select Home Delivery, as well as other select programs are being very well received, and we hope to implement many of those through the course of this year."

They get a couple of fills at the old drugstore, and then when they don't    if they don't switch, then they pay a higher price to go to the higher cost drugstore. And the idea is if the plan sponsor has to pay a higher cost, the member should share in that cost savings. This way, they could keep their cost the same if they move to a lower cost pharmacy. And that's being met with a lot of    very well."

Is there, say, more back end loading of profitability in years 2 and 3 given that the nature of drug spending over the next couple of years is a higher generic mix?

So yes, you're exactly right. I mean, I think what you see is clients that renewed at '11 of this year, were in a little bit of a different situation because they're going to have 2 years with very high    of higher generic utilization trends than they had in the first year. And so to get standard pricing across that mix does have some impact. But that's just part of the equation, the way it works."

Our IT people are constantly looking for ways to provide efficiencies throughout our organization and give better health outcomes for our members by implementing the annual processes today, taking out inefficiencies.

Looking at better ways to handle call centers, we can go on and on that these are all things we are focused on. And from our perspective, the idea here is to take out as much cost and inefficiency as we can possibly get our arms around and then figure out how much of that should go into rewarding our shareholders versus how much should go into providing growth opportunities into the future. And that's management. That's what we get paid to do, and we work very hard to try to make sure we don't disappoint our shareholders and give them the returns that they're looking for, and at the same time, make sure we invest enough money in the ongoing business that it provides returns in the future years.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations.

This morning, we are reporting another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 20% from the prior year despite the fact that volume came in below our expectations. Our Q1 results are in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call that EPS for the first quarter would be below the fourth quarter and that the year would be more back end loaded than normal. The lower-than-expected volume was the result of: Lower utilization across our book of business, lower-than-anticipated in group growth, higher than expected number attrition at some of our clients, and these drivers were partially offset by higher than expected prescriptions in Canada.
In the first quarter, we completed the integration of NextRx at the lower end of both our original timeframe and cost estimates. Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions is a core competency and our execution was smooth and efficient with minimal disruption. We believe that operating on 1 platform is imperative in meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Health Care Reform and Medicare and Medicaid expansions. Our best in class offering also provides us unique opportunities to meet our growth initiatives.
Last night, we also announced our intention to raise funds through a debt offering. The proceeds are expected to be used to finance the share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes. The offering is expected to occur during the next few weeks. In addition, subject to the completion of the debt offering, our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase program. Given the pending offering, that is all we can discuss at this point about the proposed debt offering or the share repurchases.
We remain on track to achieve full year EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30%. This guidance range includes the expected impact from our debt offering and any share repurchases in the year. As we have said in the past 2 quarterly calls, we expect this EPS to be more back end loaded than historical trends. Since there still seems to be some confusion about what we mean by back end loaded, let me give a little more detail. EPS is expected to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year, and EPS in the second half will be a higher percentage of the total year EPS than it has been in the past several years. This back end loading of earnings is primarily driven by 4 factors. First, volume. Our guidance assumes Rx growth of flat to plus 4% while Q1 was flat. Our guidance also assumes that we will see utilization improvement, improvement in number growth and the implementation of a few known midyear starts.  Second, timing of generic launches. As you know, 2010 and 2011 are light generic years. And as a result, most of the benefits in generic drugs is expected in the third and fourth quarters. Third, share repurchases. Since there were no repurchases in the fourth or first quarters as anticipated in our original guidance, share repurchases are now expected to mainly impact the remainder of the year.  And fourth, now that integration is complete, we are pursuing several profitability and efficiency projects that will continue to improve financial performance in the latter part of the year.
As we have discussed in the past, we expect to significantly increased spending on projects in 2011 to support new products and services, long-term growth and profitability. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase year-over-year, and noncapital expenses during the remainder of the year will offset the reduction in first quarter implementation expenses.

In this working lab, we are expanding the scope and value of Consumerology where insights lead to the development of innovation and effective solutions. Our differentiated approach creates value for our clients and their patients, and because we are aligned, creates superior value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

And now more than ever, plan sponsors need our proven tools for driving out waste and improving health outcomes. As a result, there was tremendous interest in our recent outcomes conference and our industry leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost    cutting edge solutions for more effectively managing the pharmacy benefit. The Drug Trend Report identified $403 billion of waste in the U.S. due to suboptimal pharmacy related behavior relating to drug mix, channel and nonadherence. Despite doctor's best efforts in diagnosing and treating diseases, what stands between healthcare providers and high quality health outcomes is consumer behavior.
Our research has found that there is a fundamental gap between how consumers intend to behave and what they actually do. We discovered that the majority of patients want to engage in the same behaviors plan sponsors seek. But patient desires often remain dormant. That is, there is a persistent intent behavior gap and the key to success in structuring interventions that close the gap between what patients really want and what they actually do. At Express Scripts Research & New Solutions Lab, we are turning data into insights and insights into proven solutions. We focus on applying the behavioral sciences to make it easy for patients to act on their own good intentions. It is possible to significantly narrow the intent behavior gap, which accounts for 33% or $134 billion of the nation's $403 billion in pharmacy waste, with proven solutions that will activate intentions and help patients do what they already want to do.
Our history is 1 of providing innovative solutions to lower cost and improve health outcomes. Because we preserve choice by aligning behavior with underlying intentions, these programs can be achieved with very little number noise. Moving forward, consumer behavior will continue to elevate the importance as plan sponsors strive to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit. Clearly, understanding and improving patient behavior will be crucial, as we help clients and members navigate the healthcare environment in the wake of Health Care Reform. Our strong relationships with our health plans clients, coupled with our deepening understanding of patient behaviors, will serve us well in meeting the needs of the new healthcare consumer.
As just discussed, the high end of our 2011 guidance anticipates an improving economy. During the first quarter, utilization fell short of our expectations. Also, we have yet to see in the aggregate our plan sponsors and health plan clients add net new members. As such, prescription growth fell short of our expectations. We mostly offset the shortfall in scripts through expense management and new margin initiatives. And as you know, when we drive down our clients costs, we improve our financial performance.
Our business remains strong, and we are bullish on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. We continue to increase our spending including CapEx this year to position our company to be best-in-class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as preparing for the Healthcare Reform environment. Our ability to understand behavior, drive out waste and improve health outcomes should translate into continued superior returns for our stockholders.

I think our select offerings are being very well received in the marketplace, and it's what we were discussing on the prepared remarks, and that is clients want to manage costs. If you think about the situation on which the benefit managers sit, there's the CEO, CFO, looking for cost savings and expense reductions. At the same time, the benefit manager is working for the HR Director, who has a challenge of retaining key members of the staff, making the health plan attractive to all the membership inside the organization. And often in the past, those 2 things were not always lined up very well. Our select solutions programs allows the health    that plan sponsor to be able to drive out cost while having minimal impact on the membership of the company. They have been very, very well received, and they're being received very, very much so, as you stated, by large employer groups. We're very early in the season.

Or should we now be assuming that the lower end of that range is something that's more likely? And then secondly, when we think about -- 1 of the things that also surprised me that you didn't mention, when we think about select offerings, my expectation would be that if a plan implements 1 of these at the beginning of January, the impact will happen as you move throughout the year, not necessarily in the first quarter. So maybe you can talk about some of those programs and the impact that will have on earnings as well."

I'll take a little quick stab at some of this, and then Jeff can certainly add, Lisa. You're absolutely right. When select programs come in, especially things like    that are addressed towards adherence, then yes, we do see increases in Rx growth. During the first quarter, keep in mind what happens. During the January 1 timeframe, we do new client implementation. The client    the company basically goes on hold. We don't roll out new IT solutions during that period. Our task is to really make sure that we perform well on our new client starts and just about every plan has some change, whether it's changing formulary [ph], whether it's changing copays, deductible levels, you name it, there's changes. We have to have '11 right. If '11 isn't right, then the rest of the year becomes very difficult. And quite frankly, if we don't provide top of class service, then trying to get clients that do put in select programs or anything else through the remainder of the year becomes very difficult. So during the fourth quarter    first quarter, we did not see the uptick in some of those programs as we are focused on '11. Through the remainder of the year, we will see those programs kicking in, whether it's Select Home Delivery, whether it's Select Step Therapy, or even things around adherence and select narrowing networks. We have preferred networks, which leave out certain providers and high cost providers, which are proving to be very well received in the marketplace. Those pharmacies that don't want to meet the needs of the marketplace in driving down cost, the country today, through all the focus on healthcare, won't tolerate pharmacies that won't participate on a cost    on a program of driving out cost. So those are    so that's becoming more and more receptive, and we can do the same thing with select programs in narrowing a network. So all those things, whether it's shifting them between    shifting the script from its channel to its -- from 1 pharmacy to another or from 1 drug to another, all can both improve utilization as well as enhance margins. As you know, Lisa, over the years, we've been very focused, not only on utilization. We don't want to be a one trick pony. When we have issues that hit any line item on our income statement, we work very hard to make sure we make up those differences in other areas. So although utilization came in lower than our expectations, we are very, very focused on making sure that we didn't adjust our range because we have confidence that we'll be able to continue to improve other areas of the income statement to improve financial performance. So we're very much focused on that. In addition on new scripts growth, keep in mind, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, we also have some midyear starts. We have several 71 clients that will be coming up. So all that goes into the Rx growth as well."

But we also don't want to be    our motto has never been maximize generics. Our motto has always been drive out cost and waste.

Last year, we did a pilot with the managed care plan that put in Select Home Delivery. And the numbers that came through weren't as great as you would normally get on a commercial book, but they were quite compelling. In other words, you're dealing with most managed care plans, you're dealing with a lot of small, very small employers to medium size employer groups. Some have large employers, but it's a different mix than going into a Fortune 500 company with the program. And so to be able to reach out and touch each of those members is a little tougher. Having said all that, the increase in mail penetration rate was rather significant. And I think both the client and us are very pleased with the outcomes of that, and we're preparing to roll that out in a bigger way. One of the things you got to be careful with, Larry, as you know, is that '11 always ushers in a new mix of clients. So we lose some, we gain some. We lost a couple of plans that had very high mail penetration that were previously discussed during the course of the last year. So 1 of those rolled off on '11, which had a heavy mail penetration use. So that brings down the mail penetration level. The other clients put in Select Home Delivery. Some of that gets stalled beyond '11, so we can be more effective and roll it out after the '11 implementation date. This may start a little after that date, a little later, so that we don't go off on top of the implementation programs and so all those things will come to fruition this year.  With respect to the client you're referring to, I think that is a focus of ours, that client and all of our managed care clients as they are trying to compete more effectively and to bring down their cost so they have a better offering. The Select Home Delivery, as well as other select programs are being very well received, and we hope to implement many of those through the course of this year."

So as we look forward, certainly, macroeconomics is 1 of the factors. We do have some known new clients for midyear. And of course, we're always optimistic that there'll be other midyear start as we win other pieces of business. Certainly, as George alluded to, we're very excited about our opportunity in the selling season, so there's probably additional upside beyond the known. But really, it comes down to the known new and the improving economy. And the improving economy really hits us in 2 ways, and 1 is from increased utilization, as people get more confident about their personal situations. And as a result, start taking their maintenance medications again or start going back to the doctor's office and et cetera. And the other is as our clients begin to grow their member base, either through hiring new people or bringing on new people onto their staff. So really, it's all those factors, and I don't really want to break out the impact between the 3."

And typically, when you can show a member that there is a drugstore in very close proximity of a very expensive drugstore that they're currently using, and so the member is not put out, there isn't any change, then, in effect, they can help reduce their costs. The way it works is there's a penalty after they get a couple of fills.

Our IT people are constantly looking for ways to provide efficiencies throughout our organization and give better health outcomes for our members by implementing the annual processes today, taking out inefficiencies. Our operations people are focused on 0 defects. And although we can hit 6 sigma qualities in the back end and even greater, any defect is not acceptable. So we strive hard to take all those out. Looking at better ways to handle call centers, we can go on and on that these are all things we are focused on. And from our perspective, the idea here is to take out as much cost and inefficiency as we can possibly get our arms around and then figure out how much of that should go into rewarding our shareholders versus how much should go into providing growth opportunities into the future. And that's management. That's what we get paid to do, and we work very hard to try to make sure we don't disappoint our shareholders and give them the returns that they're looking for, and at the same time, make sure we invest enough money in the ongoing business that it provides returns in the future years. And so to the extent, some of these things drive better or worse than we anticipate, we anticipate taking that money and either enhancing it through other initiatives or plowing some of it back into the business.

We reported another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 22% from the prior year and cash flow from operations at $957 million. U.S. claims declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the current economic environment. This was partially offset by stronger script performance in Canada, which is a lower margin business. Claims from midyear starts were in line with our original estimates. The quarter reflects the additional spending in both cost of goods sold and SG&A, including acceleration of projects to free up capacity for integration activities next year, investing to support clients and members as they move away from Walgreens and compliance with new regulatory guidance. Spending in these areas that is expected to increase in the fourth quarter.
As a result of our alliance business model, gross profit margin increased 7.5%, up from 7.2% last year and 7.1% last quarter. This improvement reflects several factors, including supply chain efficiencies, productivity improvements, increased contributions from generics and the launch of our group purchasing organization, or GPO.
SG&A costs were down year-over-year, reflecting lower management compensation and synergies resulting from the NextRx integration. These items were partially offset by the additional spending this year I referred to earlier.
As a result, EBITDA was up 11% over last year, and EBITDA after our adjusted Rx rose to $3.72, up 13%. During the quarter, one of our accelerated share purchase agreement was settled, resulting in the receipt of 1.9 million additional shares. The remaining ISR agreement is expected to be settled in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate receiving approximately 1.8 million additional shares.
We remain on track to achieve the 4-year EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05, growth of 18% to 22% over last year. In response to our revised earnings guidance earlier this month, we believe sell side estimates for the year are reasonable. After much thought and consideration, we have decided not to provide 2012 guidance at this time. Since the Medco acquisition has not closed, it's too early to provide combined guidance.
But based on our continued expectation that the acquisition will close in the first half of next year, we do not believe that it make sense to provide stand-alone guidance. Stand-alone 2011 results would not be representative for a number of reasons. The halting of share repurchases, a significant time and money spent on integration planning, the acceleration of IT and operational projects to free up resources to focus on integration next year and other transaction-related items. Similar to the NextRx acquisition, we will provide combined guidance after the transaction closes. We anticipate closing the proposed transaction in the first half of 2012.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

For a quarter of a century, we have focused on delivering innovative solutions to drive up waste and improve health outcomes for our clients and patients.
Our focus on execution has translated into superior growth for our stockholders through our business model of alignment. This focus has not changed. There are several major initiatives underway to reduce costs and improve health outcomes.
As you know, branded drug inflation, utilization and new generics provide significant economic benefits to the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our job has always been to work on behalf of our clients to temper the increase in pharmaceutical costs. We do this by continuously negotiating deeper discounts on drug procurement from our network pharmacies, securing larger rebates from drug manufacturers and obtaining deeper discounts on drugs procured from our mail-order pharmacies.
Unlike the other promises in our networks, Walgreens is not only attempting to retain in the entire windfall from new generics and brand inflation, but they're also trying to change the terms and definitions of our contract in order to significantly increase in the reimbursement rate. These actions by Walgreens would considerably drive up the cost of healthcare, while plant sponsors are working hard to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit in these tough economic times.
This is inconsistent with our business model of alignment and is not acceptable to us, our clients or our patients. The vast majority of our clients are aligned with us and support us. As a result, greater than 95% of our clients prescription volume will move forward into 2012 without Walgreens as a network provider.
We are investing to support clients and members as they move away from Walgreens pharmacies. To date, we have corresponded with millions of our patients through letters, e-mails and outbound phone calls to aid in this transition.
Fortunately, the process for transferring a prescription is incredibly straightforward and easy. A patient simply needs to bring their pill bottle for their prescription into a new pharmacy in order to obtain a refill. 
We're also making significant investment in other areas, not inherent to prescription medications is responsible for over $250 billion of waste each year from unnecessary hospital visits and other health-related costs. As part of our behavioral platform, our predictive modeling capabilities are generating significant interest due to the ability to reliably indicate in advance whether an individual members is at risk for non-adherence. Through Consumerology, we can deliver an appropriate innovation tailored to resonate with each patient. One of the fastest-growing areas of healthcare is government-sponsored programs. As such, we continue to invest to position our company as the best in class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as strength for the Health Care Reform environment.
We have also accelerated spending on certain projects to complete them this year to create capacity for an integration projects next year. 
As just mentioned, while we will not be providing 2012 earnings guidance at this time, we can provide some color on our outlook. We expect the challenging macroeconomic environment to continue to impact utilization and organic growth. However, we realized the 7% client retention and the sales season that has yielded 3 signature wins. As a result, we expect claims growth in 2012 to be in the range of 0% to 2%. In addition, our ability to drive positive clinical behavior through Consumerology continues to gain traction in the marketplace.
Moving to a longer-term focus, we remain bullish on the PBM space, as evidenced by our proposed combination with Medco. Although it's in its early stages, integration planning is on track. We continue to believe this is the transaction the nation needs now. The combination of our complement strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes.
We are making progress working through the regulatory review process, and we believe we are on track to close the Medco transaction in the first half of 2012. Why we are being impacted in the near-term, due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and our increased spending due to our pending Medco acquisition, we continue to be well-positioned to take advantage of a long-term growth opportunities inherent in the PBM marketplace. We remain focused on delivering superior value for our clients, our patients and our stockholders. At this point, we'd be happy to answer any questions."

So for example, in some situations, a competition is what's drive pricing in the marketplace. And so what we do is our supply chain people look out to the future estimate, what's going to happen with that drug price inflation. And when we price into our products, we will assume that we are going to get a certain amount of inflation utilization, generic transfer, generic launches that are going to occur, when the pricing components of those others are going to roll out into the future. And we've price that into our products. We do it, all of our competitors do it. And those that guess the best and can understand where these things are headed are the ones that fare the best and can pass along appropriate savings. So saying a little differently, we anticipate that when drug prices are rounding at 10%, that, that won't be kept by the pharmacies that in fact, they will share some portion of that back with our sponsors. And we price that into our product. So when a pharmacy, all of a sudden, decides they're going to keep everything, a matter of fact, change the terms and conditions to increase pricing, that is not contemplated a price structure that we have on the table for our clients. And therefore, if we didn't get them to give part of that inflationary and new generic launches benefits up to our clients, the cost of healthcare would in fact rise. So it really depends on when the client was contracted, what stage they're in and as to whether or not there's any benefit is going to be derived for those clients. But I will tell you, though, is that we are working very hard and what's becoming more what Walgreens is helping us do is actually sell the idea of more restricted networks to our clients. Once you lose Walgreens, when a ticket to the next step? And of the whole concept here of finding providers that want to help drive down costs and take ways out of the system are stepping up. And we're putting together networks, which are much narrower. And we're taking those outdoor clients. And through this latest situation, we find much more receptivity than we've had in the past on this new concept. And so clients are looking at that opportunity. As you might guess, if a big chain doesn't have to compete with Walgreens, they're willing to give up, to give more of a discount. They don't have to worry about them sharing their membership with the other providers. So they're stepping up in deeper discounts. Most all of the other providers look at that Walgreens book of business. Walgreens a very large retail supply chain, supplier of product. And they see a tremendous opportunity for them to increase their sales in a time of severe economic depression. So this is a huge opportunity for the rest of the retailers in our book of business to gain market share at the cost of Walgreens. So that's unfolding."

Keep in mind what's taking place. We're going to open enrollment. Companies are now sending out their enrollment packages to their employee base. So if net goes up, you have to show the network. And keep in mind that when people are choosing health care providers, what's the first thing you look at? You don't look at what pharmacies in. I've never heard that before. What people do is the first thing they do is they look up their doctor. Changing doctors is traumatic. If you've got diabetes or you've got a heart condition, you want to make sure that the plan you're associated with has your physician, if you have confidence in them. You don't want to leave that plan. Because the tension things up particular pharmacy. The second thing you do is you check your drug trend. Your drugs is my drug, a listed drug on the formulary of the plan that I'm in. Those are the most important things. As far as I'm concerned, what drives healthcare costs is the proper application of medicine by the doctors and proper pharmacy controls by the PBMs and the plan sponsors. Those are what's going to drive it, not the people putting the pills in the bottle. People putting the pills in the bottle, their job is to make sure they talk about side effect profiles, help the client, help the patient deal with their situation, but they don't control the formularies. They don't control what drugs are going to be acceptable or not. And unfortunately, when you look in mail order as an example, we have much higher generic perpetration and therapy classes that are common to both retail and mail. And the reason is because we controlled the formularies, we can reach out, we have time, and we can do those things. So getting the person to the right channel is incredibly important. As far as what the situation with Medco, we haven't closed yet, Larry. We are not privy to this, as part of the FTC process. we're not privy to their rates and their conditions and where they're at. I would like to think that Walgreens and us would come together at some point and have an agreement here. It's better for everyone.

I mean, that's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day, is how do we save our patients money and make cost of drugs more affordable for our members. These are very difficult economic times. And if a patient can save money, we should do everything we can to do it. So if that means a brands, then we'll do the brands. If it means the generic, then we'll do the generic. We will utter this, we will work a with our clients on a regular basis. We will stay in front of our clients to show them what's happening in the marketplace by access and supply, and what's the best interest for them. Keep in mind, if there's limited supply, having patients switch back and forth between brand and generics isn't a good answer either. So we've got cost that also has to do with supply and availability. So that's, those were all important factors, and we'll have to see how this unfolds. But keep in mind, the point here is we often get accused of being a generic company, where we really are a cost reduction company. And we'll take advantage of whatever is in the best interest of our plan sponsors and our patients to reduce the overall cost, whether there's brands or generics. As far as helping our clients, I think, again, in these very difficult, tough economic times, it's very hard for our plan sponsor that's trying to control costs and laying the cost of shutting down sites, laying off individuals, trying to figure out how to continue their dividend payment streams and what have you, to accept except undue increases at healthcare costs. And that's what our clients were looking at. We were able to work with them, show them the impact of the Walgreens rates increases. And as I've said in my prepared comments, this is very simple at the end of the day. If I'm a Walgreens user today and I have 3 pill bottles at all the labels on what's in the medicine, how often I take it, doctors name and phone number? All I do is walk into the CVS store and have them, or the Rite Aid store or Wal-Mart Stores or many other pharmacies, there's another 58,000 pharmacies out there that the members can go to. And they can walk in with those pill bottles, hand the pill bottles to the pharmacists, the go do their shopping or go pick up some things and come back. And meanwhile, the come from Cisco's the doctor and gets the prescription refill. It's very, very simple. And it sounds catastrophic and it's a shame that some people are out there trying to scare tactics on people who are elderly or maybe not as good a position in order to scare them into thinking making decisions, when this is very a very simple process that we can help our clients address. Again, the worst thing that happens to an elderly person is somebody wants to move lose their pharmacy, move to another plan and find out all of a sudden, their cardiologist is no longer available to them, and they can't go back for a year. Think about what happens to that poor person in that situation. God, I hope that doesn't happen."

And we bring that to them. We bring them those benefits. On top of that, what we do is we bring them new tools. Medco is going to give us a plethora of new opportunities and new tools to bring down costs through clinical programs and other reporting mechanisms and other things that we are very, very excited about. And we can't sell that today. We can bring those to our clients. But that is the hope. And I think most of what we're hearing in the marketplace are the clients are excited about the TRCs and what Medco brings to the table, combined with our Consumerology, just focusing on the diseases state, specifically from a clinical program, coupled with our understanding of consumer behavior, rolled together should make a tremendous impact on bringing down the cost of healthcare and improving health outcomes.

And the reason they're doing that is because they have to control costs to survive. And in those situations, a big generic going to do a whole lot form, there's already generic opportunities out there. And so for those clients, we had to have a different answer in a different proposition.

We reported another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 22% from the prior year and cash flow from operations at $957 million. U.S. claims declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the current economic environment. This was partially offset by stronger Script performance in Canada, which is a lower margin business. Claims from midyear starts were in line with our original estimates.
The quarter reflects additional spending in both cost of goods sold and SG&A, including acceleration of projects to free up capacity for integration activities next year, investing to support clients and members as they move away from Walgreens and compliance with new regulatory guidance. Spending in these areas is expected to increase in the fourth quarter.
As a result of our aligned business model, gross profit margin increased 7.5%, up from 7.2% last year and 7.1% last quarter. This improvement reflects several factors, including supply chain efficiencies, productivity improvements, increased contributions from generics and the launch of our group purchasing organization, or GPO.
SG&A costs were down year-over-year, reflecting lower management compensation and synergies resulting from the NextRx integration. These items were partially offset by the additional spending this year I referred to earlier. As a result, EBITDA was up 11% over last year, and EBITDA after our adjusted Rx rose to $3.72, up 13%.
During the quarter, one of our accelerated share purchase agreement was settled, resulting in the receipt of 1.9 million additional shares. The remaining ASR agreement is expected to be settled in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate receiving approximately 1.8 million additional shares.
We remain on track to achieve the full year EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05, growth of 18% to 22% over last year. In response to our revised earnings guidance earlier this month, we believe sell side estimates for the year are reasonable. After much thought and consideration, we have decided not to provide 2012 guidance at this time. Since the Medco acquisition has not closed, it's too early to provide combined guidance. But based on our continued expectation that the acquisition will close in the first half of next year, we do not believe it makes sense to provide stand-alone guidance.
Stand-alone 2011 results would not be representative for a number of reasons. The halting of share repurchases, significant time and money spent on integration planning, the acceleration of IT and operational projects to free up resources to focus on integration next year and other transaction-related items. Similar to the NextRx acquisition, we will provide combined guidance after the transaction closes. We anticipate closing the proposed transaction in the first half of 2012.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

For a quarter of a century, we have focused on delivering innovative solutions to drive out waste and improve health outcomes for our clients and patients.Our focus on execution has translated into superior g",730,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For a quarter of a century, we have focused on delivering innovative solutions to drive out waste and improve health outcomes for our clients and patients.
Our focus on execution has translated into superior growth for our stockholders through our business model of alignment. This focus has not changed. There are several major initiatives underway to reduce costs and improve health outcomes.
As you know, branded drug inflation, utilization and new generics provide significant economic benefits to the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our job has always been to work on behalf of our clients to temper the increase in pharmaceutical costs. We do this by continuously negotiating deeper discounts on drug procurement from our network pharmacies, securing larger rebates from drug manufacturers and obtaining deeper discounts on drugs procured from our mail-order pharmacies.
Unlike the other pharmacies in our networks, Walgreens is not only attempting to retain the entire windfall from new generics and brand inflation, but they are also trying to change the terms and definitions of our contract in order to significantly increase the reimbursement rate. These actions by Walgreens will considerably drive up the cost of healthcare, while plan sponsors are working hard to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit in these tough economic times.
This is inconsistent with our business model of alignment and is not acceptable to us, our clients or our patients. The vast majority of our clients are aligned with us and support us. As a result, greater than 95% of our clients' prescription volume will move forward into 2012 without Walgreens as a network provider.
We are investing to support clients and members as they move away from Walgreens pharmacies. To date, we have corresponded with millions of our patients through letters, e-mails and outbound phone calls to aid in this transition.
Fortunately, the process for transferring a prescription is incredibly straightforward and easy. A patient simply needs to bring their pill bottle for their prescription into a new pharmacy in order to obtain a refill.
We are also making significant investments in other areas, non-adherence to prescription medications is responsible for over $250 billion of waste each year from unnecessary hospital visits and other health-related costs. As part of our behavioral platform, our predictive modeling capabilities are generating significant interest due to the ability to reliably indicate in advance whether an individual member is at risk for non-adherence. Through Consumerology, we can deliver an appropriate innovation tailored to resonate with each patient.
One of the fastest-growing areas of healthcare is government-sponsored programs. As such, we continue to invest to position our company as the best in class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as preparing for the Health Care Reform environment. We have also accelerated spending on certain projects to complete them this year to create capacity for integration projects next year.
As just mentioned, while we will not be providing 2012 earnings guidance at this time, we can provide some color on our outlook. We expect the challenging macroeconomic environment to continue to impact utilization and organic growth. However, we realized through 97% client retention and the sales season that has yielded 3 signature wins, as a result, we expect claims growth in 2012 to be in the range of 0% to 2%. In addition, our ability to drive positive clinical behavior through Consumerology continues to gain traction in the marketplace.
Moving to a longer-term focus, we remain bullish on the PBM space, as evidenced by our proposed combination with Medco. Although it's in its early stages, integration planning is on track. We continue to believe this is the transaction the nation needs now. The combination of our complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes.
We are making progress working through the regulatory review process, and we believe we are on track to close the Medco transaction in the first half of 2012. While we are being impacted in the near-term due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and our increased spending due to our pending Medco acquisition, we continue to be well-positioned to take advantage of a long-term growth opportunities inherent in the PBM marketplace. We remain focused on delivering superior value for our clients, our patients and our stockholders.
At this point, we'd be happy to answer any questions."

So for example, in some situations, competition's what's drives pricing in the marketplace. And so what we do is our supply chain people look out to the future, estimate what's going to happen with drug price inflation. And when we price into our products, we will assume that we are going to get a certain amount of inflation utilization, generic transfer, generic patented -- generic launches that are going to occur when the pricing components of those, others are going to roll out into the future. And we price that into our products. We do it, all of our competitors do it. And those, I guess, the best and can understand where these things are headed are the ones that fare the best and can pass along appropriate savings. So saying it a little differently, we anticipate that when drug price inflations are rounding at 10%, that, that won't be kept by the pharmacies that in fact, they will share some portion of that back with our plan sponsors. And we price that into our products. So when a pharmacy, all of a sudden, decides they're going to keep everything, and matter of fact, change the terms and conditions to increase pricing, that is not contemplated in our price structure that we have on the table for our clients. And therefore, if we didn't get them to give part of that inflationary and new generic launches benefits up to our clients, the cost of healthcare would in fact rise. So it really depends on when the client was contracted, what stage they're in, and as to whether or not there's any benefit is going to be derived for those clients. But I will tell you, though, is that we are working very hard and what's becoming more what Walgreens is helping us do is actually sell the idea of more restricted networks to our clients. Once you lose Walgreens, why not take it to the next step? And the whole concept here of finding providers that want to help drive down costs and take waste out of the system are stepping up. And we're putting together networks which are much narrower. And we're taking those out to our clients. And through this latest situation, we find much more receptivity than we've had in the past on these new concepts. And so, clients are looking at that opportunity. As you might guess, if a big chain doesn't have to compete with Walgreens, they're willing to give up -- they give more of a discount. They don't have to worry about them sharing their membership with the other providers. So they're stepping up in deeper discounts. Most of all the other providers look at that Walgreens book of business. Walgreens is a very large retail supply chain -- supplier of product. And they see a tremendous opportunity for them to increase their sales in a time of severe economic depression. So this is a huge opportunity for the rest of the retailers in our book of business to gain market share at the cost of Walgreens. So that's unfolding."

Keep in mind what's taking place. We're going into open enrollment. Companies are now sending out their enrollment packages to their employee base. So when that's up, goes out, you have to show the network. And keep in mind that when people are choosing health care providers, what is the first thing you look at? You don't look at what pharmacies in. I've never heard of that before. What people do is the first thing they do is they look up their doctor. Changing doctors is traumatic. If you've got diabetes or you've got a heart condition, you want to make sure that the plan you're associated with has your physician, if you have confidence in them. You don't want to leave that plan. Because that shake things up because you can't go to a particular pharmacy. The second thing you do is you check your drug trend -- your drugs, ""Is my drug a listed drug on the formulary of the plan that I'm in?"" Those are the most important things. As far as I'm concerned, what drives healthcare costs is the proper application of medicine by the doctors and proper pharmacy controls by the PBMs and the plan sponsors. Those are what's going to drive it, not the people putting the pills in the bottle. People putting the pills in the bottle, their job is to make sure they talk about side effect profiles, help the client -- help the patient deal with their situation, but they don't control the formularies. They don't control what drugs are going to be acceptable or not. And unfortunately, when you look in mail order as an example, we have much higher generic penetration and therapy classes that are common to both retail and mail. And the reason is because we controlled the formularies, we can reach out, we have time, and we can do those things. So getting the person to the right channel is incredibly important. As far as what the situation with Medco, we haven't closed yet, Larry. We are not privy to this, as part of the FTC process. We're not privy to their rates and their conditions and where they're at. I would like to think that Walgreens and us would come together at some point and have an agreement here. It's better for everyone.

The clarity that exist around LIPITOR does exist in the mail. However, it does not necessarily exist at retail yet. We're going to have to wait and see how all this unfolds, how the access to the drugs is going to -- what level of access to the generic is going to exist, and we'll keep you posted on that."

I mean, that's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day, is how do we save our patients money and make cost of drugs more affordable for our members. These are very difficult economic times. And if a patient can save money, we should do everything we can to do it. So if that means a brands, then we'll do the brands. If it means the generic, then we'll do the generic. We will monitor this. We will work a with our clients on a regular basis. We will stay in front of our clients to show them what's happening in the marketplace by access and supply, and what's the best interest for them. Keep in mind, if there is limited supply, having patients switch back and forth between brands and generics isn't a good answer either. So we've got to -- it's not just cost, it also has to do with supply and availability. So that's, those were all important factors that we'll have to see how this unfolds. But keep in mind, the point here is we often get accused of being a generic company, where we really are is a cost reduction company. And we would take advantage of whatever is in the best interest of our plan sponsors and our patients to reduce the overall cost, whether there's brands or generics. As far as helping our clients, I think, again, in these very difficult, tough economic times, it's very hard for a plan sponsor that's trying to control costs and laying the cost of shutting down sites, laying off individuals, trying to figure out how to continue their dividend payment streams and what have you to accept undue increases in healthcare costs. And that's what our clients are -- were looking at. We were able to work with them, show them the impact of the Walgreens rates increases. And as I've said in my prepared comments, this is very simple at the end of the day. If I'm a Walgreens user today and I have 3 pill bottles that all -- that have the labels on them, that says, what's in the medicine, how often I take it, doctors name and phone number. All I do is walk into the CVS store and hand them -- or the Rite Aid store or Wal-Mart Stores or the many other pharmacies, there's another 58,000 pharmacies out there that we could -- that members can go to. And they can walk in with those pill bottles, hand the pill bottles to the pharmacist, go do their shopping or go pick up some things and come back. And meanwhile, the pharmacist calls the doctor and gets the prescription refilled. It's very, very simple. And it sounds catastrophic, and it's a shame that some people are out there trying to use scare tactics on people who are elderly or maybe not in as good a position in order to scare them into making decisions, when it's a very -- really, a very simple process that we can help our clients address. Again, the worst thing that happens to an elderly person is somebody that wants to move because they may think they're going to lose their pharmacy. Move to another plan and find out all of a sudden, their cardiologist is no longer available to them, and they can't move back for a year. Think about the -- what happens to that poor person in that situation. God, I hope that doesn't happen."

From an employer perspective, employers are looking for specific solutions to specific problems. Having the right solution for that client is going to -- we will be able -- when we solve that, it doesn't really depend if we Walgreens or not. They need access.

If they're in a situation where Walgreens is by far the biggest provider, there is not a whole lot of those where there is another alternatives, but once in a while, it can hit us, but not very often. So we can always offer a network with adequate access. The issue really comes down to how does the business model changed though in acquisition. I think we are pretty good at that, quite frankly, because we've done this so much. Keep in mind, just a couple of years ago, we were in the troughs and the low point of integration. Before that, we were in the NPA. We had Priority before that, we had DPS, we had Value Rx. We've done a few of these. And we know what the clients are looking for. And what they're looking for is consistency in the way their account managers approach their business. They are looking for -- they want the same people on their accounts. They want to know that they're going to have that team that support them and deliver them great service over the last 8 to 10 years is going to continue to provide that service. And we bring that to them. We bring them those benefits. On top of that, what we do is we bring them new tools. Medco is going to give us a plethora of new opportunities and new tools to bring down costs through clinical programs and other reporting mechanisms and other things that we are very, very excited about. And we can't sell that today. We can bring those to our clients. But that is the hope. And I think most of what we're hearing in the marketplace are the clients are excited about the TRCs and what Medco brings to the table, combined with our Consumerology, just focusing on the diseases state specifically from a clinical program, coupled with our understanding of consumer behavior, rolled together should make a tremendous impact on bringing down the cost of healthcare and improving health outcomes.

And they're closed. There may be mandatory mail, they may be mandatory generics, they may be very stringent formularies with only prior offs to get the certain drugs. And the reason they're doing that is because they have to control costs to survive. And in those situations, a big generic wave aren't going to do a whole lot form, there's already generic opportunities out there. And so for those clients, we had to have a different answer and a different proposition. Other clients that may have very open formularies that maybe a company that's not under the same economic situation, we'll then have sit-down with them talk to them about what their opportunities are, how they might tailor their programs to meet their needs, to make sure their members still have open and adequate access, but at the same time, take advantage of the upcoming generic launches.

So what I was saying earlier, John, was that some clients are just going forward with their current network without Walgreens. In that situation, the pricing anticipated certain reductions from the pharmacy. And so Walgreens would've stayed in and would have really showed that network. It would've taken the cost way up. So taking them out just keeps the cost to where it should've been, and so those prices don't reset, it is where it is. The ones that actually moved to a narrower network and decide to make that change, those people, their pricing will stay now set because they've accepted a narrower network, they've taken them out, they've got a lower cost than they would've had, and they're learning to live without Walgreens or they've learned to live without Walgreens. And that stays the case. And it'll be up to them. Every year, they can decide whether or not they want to broaden their network or they want to stay where they're at. And quite frankly, what we usually see is people don't go the other direction. Once you take -- once you start taking drugs and put them on the third tier, you don't increase your second-tier drugs in the future, unless there's some new innovated product that comes to market.

We reported another quarter of strong growth, with EPS up 22% from the prior year and cash flow from operations at $957 million. U.S. claims declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the current economic environment. This was partially offset by stronger Script performance in Canada, which is a lower margin business. Claims from midyear starts were in line with our original estimates.
The quarter reflects additional spending in both cost of goods sold and SG&A, including acceleration of projects to free up capacity for integration activities next year, investing to support clients and members as they move away from Walgreens and compliance with new regulatory guidance. Spending in these areas is expected to increase in the fourth quarter.
As a result of our aligned business model, gross profit margin increased 7.5%, up from 7.2% last year and 7.1% last quarter. This improvement reflects several factors, including supply chain efficiencies, productivity improvements, increased contributions from generics and the launch of our group purchasing organization, or GPO.
SG&A costs were down year-over-year, reflecting lower management compensation and synergies resulting from the NextRx integration. These items were partially offset by the additional spending this year I referred to earlier. As a result, EBITDA was up 11% over last year, and EBITDA per our adjusted Rx rose to $3.72, up 13%.
During the quarter, one of our accelerated share purchase agreement was settled, resulting in the receipt of 1.9 million additional shares. The remaining ASR agreement is expected to be settled in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate receiving approximately 1.8 million additional shares.
We remain on track to achieve the full year EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05, growth of 18% to 22% over last year. In response to our revised earnings guidance earlier this month, we believe sell side estimates for the year are reasonable. After much thought and consideration, we have decided not to provide 2012 guidance at this time. Since the Medco acquisition has not closed, it's too early to provide combined guidance. But based on our continued expectation that the acquisition will close in the first half of next year, we do not believe it makes sense to provide stand-alone guidance.
Stand-alone 2012 results would not be representative for a number of reasons. The halting of share repurchases, significant time and money spent on integration planning, the acceleration of IT and operational projects to free up resources to focus on integration next year and other transaction-related items. Similar to the NextRx acquisition, we will provide combined guidance after the transaction closes. We anticipate closing the proposed transaction in the first half of 2012.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

For a quarter of a century, we have focused on delivering innovative solutions to drive out waste and improve health outcomes for our clients and patients.Our focus on execution has translated into superior g",731,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For a quarter of a century, we have focused on delivering innovative solutions to drive out waste and improve health outcomes for our clients and patients.
Our focus on execution has translated into superior growth for our stockholders through our business model of alignment. This focus has not changed. There are several major initiatives underway to reduce costs and improve health outcomes.
As you know, branded drug inflation, utilization and new generics provide significant economic benefits to the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our job has always been to work on behalf of our clients to temper the increase in pharmaceutical costs. We do this by continuously negotiating deeper discounts on drug procurement from our network pharmacies, securing larger rebates from drug manufacturers and obtaining deeper discounts on drugs procured for our mail-order pharmacies.
Unlike the other pharmacies in our networks, Walgreens is not only attempting to retain the entire windfall from new generics and brand inflation, but they are also trying to change the terms and definitions of our contract in order to significantly increase the reimbursement rate. These actions by Walgreens will considerably drive up the cost of healthcare, while plan sponsors are working hard to provide an affordable pharmacy benefit in these tough economic times.
This is inconsistent with our business model of alignment and is not acceptable to us, our clients or our patients. The vast majority of our clients are aligned with us and support us. As a result, greater than 95% of our clients' prescription volume will move forward into 2012 without Walgreens as a network provider.
We are investing to support clients and members as they move away from Walgreens pharmacies. To date, we have corresponded with millions of our patients through letters, e-mails and outbound phone calls to aid in this transition.
Fortunately, the process for transferring a prescription is incredibly straightforward and easy. A patient simply needs to bring their pill bottle for their prescription into a new pharmacy in order to obtain a refill.
We are also making significant investments in other areas, non-adherence to prescription medications is responsible for over $250 billion of waste each year from unnecessary hospital visits and other health-related costs. As part of our behavioral platform, our predictive modeling capabilities are generating significant interest due to the ability to reliably indicate in advance whether an individual member is at risk for non-adherence. Through Consumerology, we can deliver an appropriate intervention tailored to resonate with each patient.
One of the fastest-growing areas of healthcare is government-sponsored programs. As such, we continue to invest to position our company as the best in class in serving our clients in the Medicare and Medicaid marketplace, as well as preparing for the Health Care Reform environment. We have also accelerated spending on certain projects to complete them this year to create capacity for integration projects next year.
As Jeff mentioned, while we will not be providing 2012 earnings guidance at this time, we can provide some color on our outlook. We expect the challenging macroeconomic environment to continue to impact utilization and organic growth. However, we realized greater than 97% client retention and the sales season that has yielded 3 signature wins, as a result, we expect claims growth in 2012 to be in the range of 0% to 2%. In addition, our ability to drive positive clinical behavior through Consumerology continues to gain traction in the marketplace.
Moving to a longer-term focus, we remain bullish on the PBM space, as evidenced by our proposed combination with Medco. Although it's in its early stages, integration planning is on track. We continue to believe this is the transaction the nation needs now. The combination of our complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes.
We are making progress working through the regulatory review process, and we believe we are on track to close the Medco transaction in the first half of 2012. While we are being impacted in the near-term due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and our increased spending due to our pending Medco acquisition, we continue to be well-positioned to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunities inherent in the PBM marketplace. We remain focused on delivering superior value for our clients, our patients and our stockholders.
At this point, we'd be happy to answer any questions."

So for example, in some situations, competition is what drives pricing in the marketplace. And so what we do is our supply chain people look out to the future, estimate what's going to happen with drug price inflation. And when we price into our products, we will assume that we are going to get a certain amount of inflation utilization, generic transfer, generic patented -- generic launches that are going to occur when the pricing components of those, others are going to roll out into the future. And we price that into our products. We do it, all of our competitors do it. And those, I guess, the best and can understand where these things are headed are the ones that fare the best and can pass along appropriate savings. So saying it a little differently, we anticipate that when drug price inflations are running at 10%, that, that won't be kept by the pharmacies that in fact, they will share some portion of that back with our plan sponsors. And we price that into our products. So when a pharmacy, all of a sudden, decides they're going to keep everything, and matter of fact, change the terms and conditions to increase pricing, that is not contemplated in our price structure that we have on the table for our clients. And therefore, if we didn't get them to give part of that inflationary and new generic launches benefits up to our clients, the cost of healthcare would in fact rise. So it really depends on when the client was contracted, what stage they're in, and as to whether or not there's any benefit is going to be derived for those clients. What I will tell you, though, is that we are working very hard and what's becoming more -- what Walgreens is helping us do is actually sell the idea of more restricted networks to our clients. Once you lose Walgreens, why not take it to the next step? And the whole concept here of finding providers that want to help drive down costs and take waste out of the system are stepping up. And we're putting together networks which are much narrower. And we're taking those out to our clients. And through this latest situation, we find much more receptivity than we've had in the past on these new concepts. And so, clients are looking at that opportunity. As you might guess, if a big chain doesn't have to compete with Walgreens, they're willing to give up -- they give more of a discount. They don't have to worry about them sharing their membership with the other providers. So they're stepping up in deeper discounts. Most of all the other providers look at that Walgreens book of business. Walgreens is a very large retail supply chain -- supplier of product. And they see a tremendous opportunity for them to increase their sales in a time of severe economic depression. So this is a huge opportunity for the rest of the retailers in our book of business to gain market share at the cost of Walgreens. So that's unfolding."

Keep in mind what's taking place. We're going into open enrollment. Companies are now sending out their enrollment packages to their employee base. So when that stuff  goes out, you have to show the network. And keep in mind that when people are choosing health care providers, what is the first thing you look at? You don't look at what pharmacies in. I've never heard of that before. What people do is the first thing they do is they look up their doctor. Changing doctors is traumatic. If you've got diabetes or you've got a heart condition, you want to make sure that the plan you're associated with has your physician, if you have confidence in them. You don't want to leave that plan. Because to shake things up because you can't go to a particular pharmacy. The second thing you do is you check your drug trend -- your drugs, ""Is my drug a listed drug on the formulary of the plan that I'm in?"" Those are the most important things. As far as I'm concerned, what drives healthcare costs is the proper application of medicine by the doctors and proper pharmacy controls by the PBMs and the plan sponsors. Those are what's going to drive it, not the people putting the pills in the bottle. People putting the pills in the bottle, their job is to make sure they talk about side effect profiles, help the client -- help the patient deal with their situation, but they don't control the formularies. They don't control what drugs are going to be acceptable or not. And unfortunately, when you look in mail order as an example, we have much higher generic penetration and therapy classes that are common to both retail and mail. And the reason is because we controlled the formularies, we can reach out, we have time, and we can do those things. So getting the person to the right channel is incredibly important. As far as what the situation with Medco, we haven't closed yet, Larry. We are not privy to this, as part of the FTC process. We're not privy to their rates and their conditions and where they're at. I would like to think that Walgreens and us would come together at some point and have an agreement here. It's better for everyone.

Certain providers, the big chains out there can go and you try to negotiate discounts and deals. Smaller chains and independents are going to have a much more difficult time. The clarity that exists around LIPITOR does exist in the mail. However, it does not necessarily exist at retail yet. We're going to have to wait and see how all this unfolds, how the access to the drug is going to -- what level of access to the generic is going to exist, and we'll keep you posted on that."

I mean, that's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day, is how do we save our patients money and make cost of drugs more affordable for our members. These are very difficult economic times. And if a patient can save money, we should do everything we can to do it. So if that means a brand, then we'll do the brand. If it means the generic, then we'll do the generic. We will monitor this. We will work a with our clients on a regular basis. We will stay in front of our clients to show them what's happening in the marketplace by access and supply, and what's the best interest for them. Keep in mind, if there is limited supply, having patients switch back and forth between brands and generics isn't a good answer either. So we've got to -- it's not just cost, it also has to do with supply and availability. So that's, those were all important factors that we'll have to see how this unfolds. But keep in mind, the point here is we often get accused of being a generic company, where we really are is a cost reduction company. And we would take advantage of whatever is in the best interest of our plan sponsors and our patients to reduce the overall cost, whether there's brands or generics. As far as helping our clients, I think, again, in these very difficult, tough economic times, it's very hard for a plan sponsor that's trying to control costs and laying the cost of shutting down sites, laying off individuals, trying to figure out how to continue their dividend payment streams and what have you to accept undue increases in healthcare costs. And that's what our clients are -- were looking at. We were able to work with them, show them the impact of the Walgreens rates increases. And as I've said in my prepared comments, this is very simple at the end of the day. If I'm a Walgreens user today and I have 3 pill bottles that all -- that have the labels on them, that says, what's in the medicine, how often I take it, doctors name and phone number. All I do is walk into the CVS store and hand them -- or the Rite Aid store or Wal-Mart store or the many other pharmacies, there's another 58,000 pharmacies out there that we could -- that members can go to. And they can walk in with those pill bottles, hand the pill bottles to the pharmacist, go do their shopping or go pick up some things and come back. And meanwhile, the pharmacist calls the doctor and gets the prescription refilled. It's very, very simple. And it sounds catastrophic, and it's a shame that some people are out there trying to use scare tactics on people who are elderly or maybe not in as good a position in order to scare them into making decisions, when it's a very -- really, a very simple process that we can help our clients address. Again, the worst thing that happens to an elderly person is somebody that wants to move because they may think they're going to lose their pharmacy. Move to another plan and find out all of a sudden, their cardiologist is no longer available to them, and they can't move back for a year. Think about the -- what happens to that poor person in that situation. God, I hope that doesn't happen."

From an employer perspective, employers are looking for specific solutions to specific problems. Having the right solution for that client is going to -- we will be able -- when we solve that, it doesn't really depend if we have Walgreens or not. They need access. And in limited situation, it does matter. If they're in a situation where Walgreens is by far the biggest provider, there is not a whole lot of those where there isn't other alternatives, but once in a while, it can hit us, but not very often. So we can always offer a network with adequate access. The issue really comes down to how does the business model change though in acquisition. I think we are pretty good at that, quite frankly, because we've done this so much. Keep in mind, just a couple of years ago, we were in the throughs of the WellPoint of integration. Before that, we were in the NPA. We had Priority before that, we had DPS, we had Value Rx. We've done a few of these. And we know what the clients are looking for. And what they're looking for is consistency in the way their account managers approach their business. They are looking for -- they want the same people on their accounts. They want to know that they're going to have that team that supported them and delivered them great service over the last 8 to 10 years is going to continue to provide that service. And we bring that to them. We bring them those benefits. On top of that, what we do is we bring them new tools. Medco is going to give us a plethora of new opportunities and new tools to bring down costs through clinical programs and other reporting mechanisms and other things that we are very, very excited about. And we can't sell that today. We can't bring those to our clients. But that is the hope. And I think most of what we're hearing in the marketplace are the clients are excited about the TRCs and what Medco brings to the table, combined with our Consumerology, just focusing on the diseases state specifically from a clinical program, coupled with our understanding of consumer behavior, rolled together should make a tremendous impact on bringing down the cost of healthcare and improving health outcomes.

And they're closed. There may be mandatory mail, they may be mandatory generics, they may be very stringent formularies with only prior offs to get the certain drugs. And the reason they're doing that is because they have to control costs to survive. And in those situations, big generic waves aren't going to do a whole lot for them, there's already generic opportunities out there. And so for those clients, we have to have a different answer and a different proposition. Other clients that may have very open formularies that maybe a company that's not under the same economic situation, we'll then have sit-down with them talk to them about what their opportunities are, how they might tailor their programs to meet their needs, to make sure their members still have open and adequate access, but at the same time, take advantage of the upcoming generic launches.

So what I was saying earlier, John, was that some clients are just going forward with their current network without Walgreens. In that situation, the pricing anticipated certain reductions from the pharmacy. And so if Walgreens would've stayed in it would have really killed that network. It would've taken the cost way up. So taking them out just keeps the cost to where it should've been, and so those prices don't reset, it is where it is. The ones that actually moved to a narrower network and decide to make that change, those people, their pricing will stay now set because they've accepted a narrower network, they've taken them out, they've got a lower cost than they would've had, and they're learning to live without Walgreens or they've learned to live without Walgreens. And that stays the case. And it'll be up to them. Every year, they can decide whether or not they want to broaden their network or they want to stay where they're at.

George, first, you talked about your goal is to lower costs, and whether it's from a generic or a brand, it doesn't really matter to you as long as it drives costs lower. So in the case of maybe Pfizer here with very aggressive rebating, is it well understood then by your retail network that -- I can understand that in the mail channel, you'll take the rebate and you'll pass that savings onto clients is that understood then for your larger retailers who might also be buying direct from Pfizer that -- am I right to think they're getting reimbursed at that lower rebated level then or somewhere around that?"

If there's a huge rebate on the drug and it makes sense to be on the branded product, then what we would do is set our adjudication engine for that client to adjudicate the brand and take the brand. So that this way, when the member goes in, they get it processed, we reimburse the pharmacy at the brand reimbursement rate, but then the rebate goes back to the client to make them whole on the reduction. And depending on the product, depending on the discounts, there could be a generic co-pay, associated with that drug even though it's a branded product. So it's just -- it's all in the mechanics of the system and the processes."

And what we've said is that we're accelerating a lot of capital expenditures and a lot of projects into this year because we've got a big job ahead of us next year as we integrate the Medco transaction. So what we prefer to do is just wait until we close and then validate our assumptions and then come out with our earnings guidance at that point.
