I know a lot of companies are holding their earnings calls today, so we appreciate your taking the time to join us. This morning, Walter and I will update you on our performance for the quarter and for the full year of 2010. Let’s begin.",1965,"Good morning. I know a lot of companies are holding their earnings calls today, so we appreciate your taking the time to join us. This morning, Walter and I will update you on our performance for the quarter and for the full year of 2010. Let’s begin.
We reported good fourth quarter earnings and we finished the year with our best full-year results ever as a public company. For the quarter, we generated $2.6 billion in operating net revenues, a 19% increase over last year. Our operating net income was 312 million, which was up 30% over a year ago.
I should point out that the earnings includes two notable items. A $28 million expense related to FAS 157 impacts in variable annuities and $7 million in auto and home claims from a single hailstorm in Arizona.
For the year, on an operating basis, we recorded earnings of $1.2 billion or $4.47 per share, and we achieved record net revenues of $9.6 billion, an increase of 24% compared with 2009. Our return on equity reached 12.6%, an increase of 340 basis points over the last year. Well, that’s also an all-time high.
We focused on driving further improvement in our returns. We’re making continued progress towards generating a higher percentage of our earnings from our less capital-demanding, higher-returning businesses. For the quarter, we generated 54% of operating earnings from advice and wealth management and asset management compared with 30% a year ago.
Given the environment, we’re pleased that we have already surpassed our previous high watermarks which we reached back in 2007. Remember, the S&P 500 was 20% higher then and interest rates today remain extremely low, so we feel good about the path we’re following. We came through the crisis untarnished and in excellent condition. And we’ve used our relative strength to grow the company both organically and through the Columbia Management acquisition.
Owned management and administrative assets reached a new record at $673 billion, which was 47% higher than a year ago. Our prudent operating principles continue to serve us well. Our balance sheet and capital are stronger than at any time in the past, which gives us a competitive advantage and allows us to return capital to shareholders. In fact, we’re still one of the very few firms in the industry that’s buying back stock.
For the quarter, we brought back 3.8 million shares for $200 million, and since we’re starting our buyback program in May, we repurchased a total of $573 million. Including dividends for the year, we returned two-thirds of our earnings to shareholders. We intend to continue the buyback program in 2011.
At the same time, we’re maintaining our expense discipline. We achieved over $240 million in re-engineering savings across the company in 2010, and we used a portion of the savings to fund investments for growth while delivering much of the savings to the bottom line. While expenses have increased as a result of the stronger business activity, we remain very comfortable with our expense management.
In total, we feel quite good about the position we’re in. The business is performing well and we have good earnings leverage for improving conditions.
Now, I’d like to discuss our segment performance. First, advice and wealth management delivered another strong quarter. The segment generated a record $1 billion in operating net revenues and $90 million in pretax operating income, nearly triple its earnings over a year ago.
Margin improvement has been an area of focus for us in the segment, and we made good progress in 2010. In the fourth quarter, the segment’s pretax operating margin was 8.9%, nearly 5 percentage points higher than a year ago.
Advisor productivity is an important measure of our progress in this segment and is improving nicely. Operating net revenue per advisor reached new highs at 88,000 for the quarter and 326,000 for the year.
Several factors led to the stronger productivity. First, client activity continued to tick upward. While clients still haven’t returned to pre-crisis activity levels, clearly confidence in the markets and the economy is improving. You can see the stronger activity in our client asset metrics. We continue to generate good net inflows into wrap accounts and our total retail client assets reached a new high of $329 billion.
Second, over the past several years, we’ve significantly strengthened the advisor force and its economics. We had good success at recruiting with approximately 800 experienced advisors joining us over the past two years. It takes a while for new recruits to bring over assets and clients, and now we’re starting to realize the benefits of their established books of business.
The transformation of the employee advisor continues. Advisor retention has increased dramatically and we reduced cost substantially even as we continue to invest in the business.
So while a total number of advisors has continued to decline, we’re more than making up for it with stronger advisor productivity, both on a per advisor and total basis. In fact, on average, the advisors we’ve added had five times the trailing productivity of the advisors who have left.
Finally, we’re continuing to make major investments in the business. We’re building our brand through advertising and we’re continuing to add to the tools and technology available to advisors. In fact, we’re in the process of our multi-rollout of the new industry standard brokerage platform, which is one of the largest investments we’ve made in the advisor technology.
I should note that our financial performance in this segment still faces the headwinds of extremely low interest rates, which obviously depresses the spread we earn on client deposits. We don’t expect rates to rise sharply any time soon, but an increase in rates would give us nice additional earnings leverage.
The asset management segment also delivered another strong quarter. We generated pretax operating earnings of $163 million for the quarter, more than double a year ago and 35% higher than the sequential quarter. The segment’s pretax operating margin was 21.1%. These results, which includes $22 million of net income in hedge fund performance during the year, demonstrated the improved profitability and scale of our combined asset management business.
Global retail flows improved sequentially and was essentially flat for the quarter. Strong retail net inflows at Threadneedle were offset by retail and institutional outflows in the domestic business. Domestic retail flows improve with the sequential quarter, but we remain in net outflows. While we’re starting to see a pickup in equity fund sales, we saw our outflows in municipal and taxable funds.
In our institutional business, flows were eschewed by the loss of two relatively large but low-margin mandates. In fact, of the 5.7 billion in global net institutional outflows, approximately 4.7 billion came from low-margin pools of insurance assets including Zurich outflows.
While we expect some of the outflows of low-margin institutional assets to continue, the pipeline of more profitable mandates is solid. In fact, the Columbia mandate sold in the fourth quarter that we expect to be funded early this year were more than offset revenues lost from the fourth quarter’s net institutional outflows.
Threadneedle reported another strong quarter with revenues, assets, and profitability, all increasing significantly compared with a year ago. European investors began to return to equity funds during the quarter, and as a result, Threadneedle’s retail flows improved substantially. Investment performance remained strong with particular strength in equity funds. Threadneedle continues to manage its expenses well even as revenues have increased significantly, so the international business is generating increasingly solid margins.
The Columbia Management integration remains on schedule. Fund mergers will mostly be complete by the end of the second quarter and the new lineup will include strong performing funds in every style box. In fact, on a pro forma basis, our funds are performing above the 60th percentile in Lipper performance rankings in every category. We believe the combination of strong performance and a clearly defined fund lineup will help us to start the turnaround of asset flows as we move through 2011.
In annuities, we reported pretax operating earnings of 128 million which represents a 9% decrease compared with a year ago. The decline was driven by the impact of FAS 157 which has no impact on the underlying economics of the business and which we recognize in operating earnings. Walter will explain this item in more detail.
The underlying business continue to perform well as our new variable annuity product helped us generate variable annuity net inflows of approximately $400 million. We continue to feel good about the variable annuity business, especially now that we have focused our efforts and resources on our advisor force where we have a very good understanding of client behavior and can generate strong returns.
During the quarter, we made a strategic decision to stop selling variable annuities to clients of other firms. The decision was based in part on the fact that our outside distribution generated 12.5% of our variable annuity sales with a count of over 25% of the equity we invested in the variable annuity business.
Just as important, we knew that achieving scale in outside distribution of annuities will require substantial additional capital, so we chose to focus our resources on our system where we can add real value to the client’s long-term financial plans.
The fixed annuity business remains stable with net outflows resulting from our decision not to rate new business because of the rate environment. Lapse rates remain low and asset persistency high in the fixed book which continues to generate stable spread earnings and good returns. We’ll continue to pursue opportunities in fixed annuities when market conditions become more favorable.
The protection segment produced pretax operating earnings of $86 million, down 26% compared with a year ago. We had weaker performance during the quarter due to claims from the hailstorm I mentioned earlier and because we increased reserves related to bodily injury coverage claims. The results also include 10 million in higher variable universal life reserves related to SOP 03 which Walter will explain.
Aside from these impacts to the quarter, we continue to feel good about the health of our insurance business. Our underwriting performance has been strong and our large book of insurance business generates solid recurring earnings.
In auto and home, policy counts grew by 9% over a year ago, driven in part by a promising partnership we’ve established to provide homeowners insurance to customers of Progressive Insurance.
In the life and health business, clients across the industry continue to be somewhat reluctant to commit cash required for new insurance contracts. That said, our advisors are finding their clients are beginning to be more receptive to a conversation about insurance. As a result, our full-year cash sales were up 14% compared to 2009.
To summarize, I feel very good about the progress we’ve made and the results we’ve delivered, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We’re succeeding at driving higher margins and a greater percentage of earnings from our less capital-demanding businesses, and we’re deriving real benefits from the scaling trend of all four of our operating segments.
Our asset management and distribution acquisitions are paying off. At the same time, we continue to manage our finances prudently, our balance sheet and capital positions are as strong as ever, and our expense disciplines will not waver.
These actions are contributing to higher returns, which is a long-term focus for us. We’re pleased with the upward trend in our ROE and we’re confident that we have the right strategy as well as the business and financial strengths to drive increasing returns.
Overall, we produced an excellent year with record results and we feel good about our ability to continue making progress.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Walter and later we’ll take your questions.

We continue to report strong performance with operating EPS of $1.21, up 33% from the prior year.

We continue to report strong performance with operating EPS of $1.21, up 33% from the prior year. The operating earnings include some notable negative impacts which I will describe shortly.
These negatives were offset by strong growth in our low-capital businesses and continued solid performance of our annuity in life and health businesses. Our low-capital businesses, advice and wealth management, and asset management, generated 54% of operating segment pretax income compared with 30% a year ago. That shift, combined with prudent capital management resulted in an operating ROE of 12.6% of 340 basis points from last year. In addition, our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong in all areas.
On the next slide, I’ll provide some detail on the quarter. Operating results exclude the impact of consolidated investment entities realized gains and losses, as well as integration and restructuring charges. These items and the segment impacts are detailed in our certificate supplement.
Operating net revenues grew 19% to 2.6 billion in the quarter while net operating earnings were 312 million, up 30%. Operating earnings per share increased 33% to $1.21, reflecting growth and improved margins in advice and wealth management and asset management.
Our results included $0.12 per share in mean reversion benefits and hedge fund performance fees trimmed primarily by the markets. We believe this $0.12 is embedded in your estimates, whereas, there were three unanticipated negative items included in the $1.21 that we believe are not reflected in the sell side analyst expectations.
First, we recorded $0.11 for the negative impact of credit spreads narrowing on our variable annuity liability. Its impact is not economic, and consequently, we do not hedge it. In fact, many of our insurance companies do not include it in their operating earnings. Excluding this, earnings were $1.32.
Second, we recorded a $0.03 for auto and insurance claims related to an unusual hailstorm in Phoenix. And finally, we recorded a $0.04 loss for increased auto and liability reserves in the quarter.
Our results were also impacted by increased general administrative expenses which are booked in each segment. We had to catch up in our (inaudible) due to strong business performance during the year and we incurred some increased legal expenses.
On a full-year basis, we reported record operating earnings. Operating net revenue grew 24% to 9.6 billion and operating earnings were up 56% to a record 1.2 billion, which includes eight months of Columbia acquisition results.
Operating EPS grew 45% to $4.47 for the full year, which includes the impact of the higher-weighted average share account for the equity we issued in June of 2009, partially offset by the share we purchased in 2010.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, low-capital businesses generated 61% of our operating segment net revenues, up from 54% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. This strong revenue growth, combined with margin expansion, AWM, and asset management, resulted in 54% of operating segments earnings from our low-capital businesses, up from 30% last year.
Now, I move on to our segment performance. In advice and wealth management, you can see that we generated a nearly threefold increase in segment PTI year-over-year. The segment reported record revenues surpassing 1 billion.
These strong results were driven by recovering (inaudible) activity, growth in assets under management from markets and inflows and retail client assets, as well as continued good expense management.
Interest rates continue to impact our earnings with our brokerage cash spreads marginally down sequentially. Expenses also continued to be well managed on a sequential basis. G&A expenses increased mostly due to higher business volumes and an increase in compensation expenses, reflecting strong overall company performance. We also incurred higher than normal legal expenses as a result of our ongoing litigation at Securities America.
On the slide, I’ll discuss asset management. The segment had another very strong quarter with operating net revenues up 66% year-over-year and with a pretax operating margin of 21.1%. Net (inaudible) revenues, margins increased to 34.1%.
Hedge fund performance fees primarily from Seligman generated 22 million of pretax earnings in the quarter compared to 30 million last year. As Jim described, we saw our increased net outflows driven by low-margin insurance portfolios in the institutional business. Retail net flows improved sequentially.
The Columbia Management integration is proceeding according to plan. We remain on track to deliver our financial projections we provided when we announced the transaction and we feel very good about the business synergies we are realizing.
Let’s move to the next slide. For annuities, operating pretax income declined 9% year-over-year. However, the underlying performance was strong. In the quarter results included a $43 million expense relating to variable annuity living benefits. This expense resulted in a FAS 157 impact which we do not hedge, namely, non-performance risk, and which many companies do not include in operating earnings.
The business continued to generate strong sales while our new annuity product, RAVA 5. The overall book of business continued to generate strong, stable earnings and returns despite absorbing the volume-driven increased course of distribution. We believe these returns will be further enhanced by our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities which Jim described.
Our next slide will discuss the protection segment. The life and health segment business continue to generate consistent results. DI and LTC claims returned to expected levels after a higher-than-expected third quarter and we continue to reserve at higher levels for our universal life products with secondary guarantees.
As a reminder, I mentioned on the third quarter call that we’re expected an increased run rate in these reserves. That said, our results for the quarter were impacted by several notable items, including the hailstorm in Phoenix. We’ve already reached our retention limits and are 100% reinsured for any future development from the storm. We also increased our auto liability reserves by $16 million in the quarter.
Aside from those items, the insurance business continue to generate good results with increased VUL sales during the year and good continued growth in the auto and home business.
On the next slide, we continue to manage our financial foundation well, which has enabled us to return capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $200 million. This brings our total repurchases in 2010 to 13.1 million shares for $573 million. Including dividends, we returned 756 million to shareholders this year for over two-thirds of our net income.
We continue to hold more than $1.5 billion in excess capital while our cash flow remains strong at $2.9 billion with $1.8 billion of free cash.
The quality of our balance sheet also remains strong. Our preliminary estimate of the RiverSource risk-based capital ratio is approximately 67% and our unrealized gain position is 1.5 billion. Our balance sheet ratios continue to remain conservative, both in terms of leverage and coverage ratios. Finally, our variable annuity hedge program continues to be effective.
So to summarize, we generated strong earnings in the quarter as a result of very good underlying business performance in a challenging economic environment. Our actions have resulted in increased operating leverage and we are making good progress. We are driving our mix towards the lower-capital businesses, effectively managing our excess capital, and driving our operating returns through the higher end of our on-average overtime targets.
Our balance sheet remains strong, including our capital and liquidity positions. And we are continuing to manage our risk exposures prudently, positioning the company for continued growth.
Now we’ll take your questions.

I think it will do it in two ways. One will be the wirehouses will have to move to that standard that will change the way they operate a bit. And then independence, because there’s been a call in now, if people did move to that, to have greater reviews by either the SEC or FINRA as well as the states, and in many cases, we have consistent level of those reviews because we’re a big house, but others sort of are able to dock a little bit below the radar and that may change as there is a call in for more of actual reviews by the regulatory authorities as we move to the standard.

We still experience some outflows in some key funds, some (inaudible) one or two of our that were Columbia funds that lower their star ratings last year or the year before.

Having said that, we did declare the new funds, that things are moving to the proxies are already starting to be nailed, et cetera. So I think it has some impact. It’s hard for me to tell you after that’s over and we’re through that process what the full effect is, but we just announced the fund lineup in the fourth quarter and we have put the wholesalers on their territories as we adjust the activity. They’re very focused now. We had our kickoff meetings. So, we’re going to try to work hard to improve the flows, but I think it will take some time, but we’re optimistic that we can get a turnaround. The institutional side, you know, that’s a bit lumpy. Because as we said, we’ve lost these two large accounts domestically. There were only a few (inaudible) in account. One was Bank of America or Bank Cline (inaudible), another was insurance from the Columbia.
So I think, the revenue side of that is not going to be material but on a volume basis, it looks significant. On mandates, are starting to come in institutional now that the consultants are getting more comfortable that we’re making our way through the process. We’re picking up some nice winds. There’s a lot more to do but the pipeline is building. So we hopefully will start to see some traction there as well as we go into the New Year.

And so, with that, that’s the other piece of the tranche within the 20 to 40. Regarding whether we suffer full outflows that we experience or not, we didn’t dictate every account, but we feel comfortable, with where we are today and the assets, et cetera, that we’re within those reasonableness as far as what we expected. Now, having said that, we would like to move into inflows to grow the business rather than continue to be in sort of the outflow area, and that’s where we’re going to work hard to try and turn that around. But from what we originally estimated, from what we knew at the time, I think we’re within those bounds, with the last piece coming as we merge the funds.

First of all, I want to thank you for participating in the call and asking for the various questions that helped clarify things.
I think one of the issues we do have which is very hard and we’ll try to figure out is how to deal with things like the 157 because it’s a noneconomic charge, but I know people can’t predict it and so the estimates that you come out with do not include and it does sort of get little noise in the system.
I would also leave you with this thought. I think for the things that we wanted to do in 2010 and what we told you back in 2009 and ‘08, I think is actually coming about quite well. I think we’ve had a strong business and a strong year. I think we’re seeing improvements. We think we continue to drive margin improvements. I feel very good about where AWM is and where it can go as well as with the Columbia deal and Threadneedle, that we can actually continue to improve there as well.
Of course, we got work to do to change the flows around, et cetera, but I think we got good product line and good performance, which is something that we never really had completely in the past. And I think we have a more substantial and fuller lineup.
Yes, we’re still working through further levels of integration, but the savings are being realized. I think we have a good business now, a sizeable business. I think if you compare it to other large independent managers out there, we’re quite sizeable, including our earnings and our ability to earn.
And the same thing with our advice and wealth management. We’re starting to come into the stream where this is really having a substantial impact. We think we can continue to grow those margins even with low interest rates. Yes, we had some pickup and some expenses in the fourth quarter, but I think outside of the Securities America activity, our margins would have shown nice improvements as well in the fourth quarter for our core franchise business which is really the focus that we have.
So, I just want to leave you with the thoughts. I think we’ll manage our other businesses very prudently to drive returns and manage the risk, that’s why we chose to get out of the outside distribution of annuities. I think we can generate good returns with good consumer behavior in the other annuities with strong hedging. And I do believe our protection business will start to improve.
I take the note regarding the auto and home, it has not been a problem for us, but we don’t want it to be a problem for us. So if we see anything substantially changing, we will evaluate, but we really think it can continue to drive margins because of some flexibility in case we don’t need to.
And overall, as Walter said, we do have a strong capital position. We will be looking to utilize that appropriately. I will not use the money for acquisitions unless they really made sense and we can really get good synergies as we’ve been showing you for the last few that we did. And we will return to shareholders as appropriately, but we don’t need to do that all in one moment, but we can do that over time so that you can feel comfortable, we can feel comfortable and still have degrees of opportunity for growth and investment.
So I appreciate you taking the time. I do feel we had a good year and we tried to deliver everything that we told you about a year ago and we look forward to continuing to work with you in the New Year. Thank you.

Thanks for joining us for our first quarter earnings discussion.  This morning, Walter and I will update you on our performance and then we'll take your questions.
This was another strong quarter for Ameriprise financial.  We continue to make good progress in growing our high-return Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses highlighted by record advisor productivity and client assets and by strong investment performance in fund sales.
At the same time, our insurance and annuity businesses continue to generate solid returns.  For the quarter, on an operating basis and excluding the Securities America legal expenses, we reported earnings of $347 million, an increase of 54% over a year ago.
Revenues increased by 22% to $2.6 billion and our return on equity increased to an all-time high of 13.6% for the trailing 12 months.  Our strong financial foundation continues to contribute to our growth.
Our balance sheet and capital are among the strongest in the industry and we have the ability to return significant capital to shareholders.  In fact, during the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $395 million.
Since starting our buyback program last May we have repurchased nearly $1 billion of our stock.  Today we also announced the largest dividend increase we have ever made.  The quarterly dividend will increase 28% to $0.23 per share.
While we're focused on growing the business, we are maintaining our long-time commitment to expense control and reengineering.  We're on a run rate to achieve our reengineering targets for the year and we will continue to use the proceeds to fund our growth and to improve the bottom line.
Overall, we feel very good about the trajectory of our results and the position we're in.  Before I discuss our performance by business, I'd like to give you some detail on our decisions regarding Securities America.
As you're probably aware, Securities America has been involved in a legal process related to sales or private placement securities issued by [Medical Capital] and [Providence Shale].  Both of those companies have been accused of fraud by the FCC and are in receivership.
After careful consideration we determined that a reasonable and expeditious solution to this unfortunate situation was in the best interest of all constituents.  The $150 million comprehensive settlement includes the $40 million previously reserved.
The net after-tax charge, as we reported in the earnings release, was $77 million, which includes the settlement and related legal fees.  Our value proposition is centered on our Ameriprise branded advisor force and that is where we will continue to focus our energy.
As a result, we intend to identify an appropriate buyer for Securities America.  Just to be clear, the sale process will not affect our commitment to complete the settlement on its current terms.  I should also note that this move will have a [deminimous] impact on our results.
Now, I'd like to talk about our segment performance.  First, Advice & Wealth Management delivered another strong quarter wit operating pretax income increasing by 94% over a year ago to $99 million.  We continue to make progress in improving margins.
For the quarter, the segment's pretax operating margin reached 10.8%, which is approximately four percentage points higher than last year.  We remain focused on improving advisor productivity and we reached our highest advisor productivity ever.
Several factors are contributing to the improvements.  First, client activity has continued its steady recovery.  Given the depth of the financial crisis it is no surprise to us that retail clients have been reluctant to take on risk.
Now, risk appetites are gradually returning as clients recognize the need to generate returns.  As a result, transactional activity increased and our branded retail client assets reached an all-time high of $315 billion, highlighted by strong growth in wrap products.
We recorded wrap net inflows of $2.8 billion for the quarter and total wrap assets reached $103 billion.
Second, the long-term work we've done to strengthen the economics of our advisor force is paying off.  We surpassed 1000 experienced advisory recruits since we cranked up that effort the end of 2008 and those advisors are highly productive.  Many of them have joined our employee channel, which has led to much stronger profitability in that part of the business.
Now that we've substantially reengineered the advisory force, our total advisor count has stabilized.  While we will continue to experience attrition of lower-producing advisors, we will also continue to bring in better producers.
Advisor retention is very strong across the force with retention of our franchisees increasing to 94% and with employee advisor retention reaching 87%.  The employee number represents a very large improvement.  It's up 14 percentage points in just one year.
We're also acquiring valuable clients at a better rate, both from experienced advisor recruits bringing over their clients and from client acquisition work by our advisors.
Finally, we continue to make investments in the business.  Our brand building and training efforts continue and so does our work to roll out a new industry standard brokerage platform. 
The Asset Management segment also delivered a strong quarter with pretax operating income of $136 million.  Compared to a year ago, revenues essentially doubled to $737 million and the segment's adjusted pretax operating margin was 33.6%.
Next week will mark one year since we closed the Columbia transaction.  The integration remains on track and the combined business is performing very well.  Our strong performing fund lineup is generating increasing sales and we further built out the lineup during the quarter with new absolute return funds and by acquiring active ETF capabilities.
Overall, assets under management increased to $465 billion.  Moving to flows, we continued to experience net outflows with $2 billion in net outflows at Colubmia and $3 billion at Threadneedle.
As we look into these numbers, some of the trends are improving significantly.  I'd like to give you some detail.
Columbia retail net outflows of $0.5 billion reflects a significant improvement over the past quarter since the acquisition.  While we still saw redemptions in fixed income, particularly in tax exempt, we drove strong retail sales growth, mainly in equities.
We distribute Columbia products in many advisor channels and we identified a number of firms that we want to provide with a strong focus.  Sales store focus firms are especially promising.  In fact, for the quarter, sales of long-term retail mutual funds were at the highest levels since before we announced the acquisition.
In our domestic institutional business, net outflows in the quarter continued to come mostly from the loss of low-margin assets.  In fact, the higher margin institutional mandates sold recently will offset revenues lost from the higher institutional outflows.  The pipeline of institutional sales continues to look promising.
Threadneedle reported net outflows of $0.6 billion, which was largely from increased volatility due to geopolitical events.  The Japan crisis and the unrest in the Middle East have raised investors' desire to safety and caution.
As a result, redemptions increased during the period.  Sales remained consistent.  Threadneedle also had $2.4 billion in institutional net outflows with more than half coming from expected and low-margin [Zurich] outflows.
The international institutional flows picture looks considerably better so far in the second quarter with sizeable mandates coming from international markets outside the UK.  Threadneedle's financial performance was impacted by higher expenses from and industry-wide regulatory levee as well as the annual enterprise valuation adjustment expense that we recognize in the first quarter of each year.
Assets under management at Threadneedle increased to $107 billion.  In general, our investment performance remains strong.  Columbia has 52 four and five star funds out of a total of 120 that are rated by Morningstar and the trend in domestic performance remains solid across asset classes.
At Threadneedle, performance has returned to its historically strong levels.  In annuities, we reported pretax operating earnings of $174 million, up 30% compared to last year.  The business continues to perform well with continuing strong sales of new variable annuity products we introduced last year.
For the quarter, we drove $347 million in net variable annuity inflows from the Ameriprise channel.  Overall, net flows in this business were $104 million reflecting expected outflows from outside distribution channels where we have stopped sales.
Outflows from contracts sold outside the Ameriprise channel will continue.  Overall, our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities positions us to generate better returns on capital with lower risk.
Fixed annuities continue in net outflows, which will continue as long as the interest rate environment remains unfavorable to new contracts.  The book we have continues to generate good spread earnings and good returns and asset persistency remains high.
The protection segment produced pretax operating earnings of $106 million, which was down 10% compared with a year ago.  While industry-wide sales of insurance products remain challenging, we continue to feel very comfortable with the condition of our insurance business.
Our underwriting performance has been strong and our $192 billion book of life insurance and force continues to provide solid recurring returns.  We have a number of initiatives underway to turn around the sales trends and life insurance products.
As our advisor force has changed through acquisition and recruiting, we brought in a lot of advisors who were not previously focused on selling insurance.  We're working with them to help them understand the products and to train them to have insurance-related conversations with their clients.
At the same time, we work to simplify product descriptions and the process for entering into a contract.
The auto and home business continued to grow policy counts and premiums, driven in part by continuing strong sales through our partnership with Progressive.  Auto and home losses and loss frequency improved sequentially and in the quarter returned to more normal levels.
However, we continue to reserve for an 85% loss level in the quarter.  If losses continue to more normal levels we will be able to adjust reserves downward.
To summarize, we continue to make solid, steady progress with driving higher margins for our less capital demanding businesses and the four businesses are working in complement with each other to drive growing consolidated earnings and returns.
We continue to believe we have further room to expand our returns.  At the same time, we continue to manage our financial foundation prudently.  Our balance sheet and capital positions are exceptionally strong and we are staying true to our expense and risk management philosophies and we are returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders both through our share repurchase program and through our $0.05 per share increase in dividend.
Overall, this was a very good start to the year and we feel good about our ability to continue making progress.  Now, I'll turn it over to Walter and later we'll take your questions.

4165019,129545239,125999,"Ameriprise Financial Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim.  We generated strong earnings across all measures with reported EPS up 16% from last year, operating up 24% and operating excluding Securities America legal expense up 59%.  The SAI legal charge was $77 million after tax or $0.30 per share",1416,"Thank you, Jim.  We generated strong earnings across all measures with reported EPS up 16% from last year, operating up 24% and operating excluding Securities America legal expense up 59%.  The SAI legal charge was $77 million after tax or $0.30 per share.
In addition to the legal charge we took during the quarter, as Jim said, we have made the decision to pursue a sale of SAI.  As a result, we have moved SAI results from the Advice & Wealth Management segment to the Corporate and Other segment.
Beginning in the second quarter, we intend to present SAI as discontinued operations for all prior periods.  Our loan capital businesses, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management continue to drive our growth and earnings mix shift.
That shift, combined with prudent capital management, resulted in an operating ROE of 12.8% or 13.6% when excluding the SAI charge.  In addition, our balance sheet fundamental remain strong in all areas.
We have substantial liquidity, a strong excess capital position and our debt to capital ratio remains conservative.  I'll go into more detail shortly.  On the next slide, I will provide some detail on the quarter.
As you likely saw, we enhanced our operating earnings definition to now exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  Operating net revenues grew 22% to $2.6 billion in the quarter while net operating earnings, excluding the SAI expense, were $347 million, up 54%.
Operating earnings per share, excluding the SAI legal charge, increased 59% to $1.35 reflecting growth and improved margins in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management.  Our results were impacted by both positive and negative items but we believe the EPS of $1.35 is a good measure that reflects the strong underlying fundamentals of our business.
We did have a tax time benefit this quarter, which brought our effective tax rate to 23.2% versus our targeted 2011 range of 26% to 28%.  We also were impacted by a regulatory levee at Threadneedle as well as the higher G&A expense as result of the annual Threadneedle valuation.
In addition, the first quarter had two fewer business days than the fourth quarter of 2010, which lowered earnings by $10 million after tax.  We continue to make progress in shifting our earnings mix to greater contributions from our low capital businesses.
In the first quarter of 2011 these businesses generated 59% of our operating net revenues, up from 51% in the first quarter last year and 56% from the full year of 2010.  Management distribution fees in AWM and Asset Management increased 49% driven by the Columbia acquisition, positive markets and increased client activity.
Continued strong revenue growth, combined with margin expansion, AWM and Asset Management resulted in 46% of our operating earnings from our low capital businesses, up 23% a year ago and 41% for the full year of 2010.
We feel good about the progress we're making and the actions we are taking to continue this trend.  Now, I'll move on to our segment performance.
In Advice & Wealth Management, which no longer reflects SAI results, you can see that our PTI nearly doubled year-over-year with net revenues increasing 19% and operating margins improving to 10.8%.
Ameriprise advisor productivity was up 23% over last year as client activity improved and assets under management increased due to market appreciation and client net inflows.  Branded client wrap assets exceeded $103 billion with net inflows of $2.8 billion for the quarter.  This activity is in line with pre-crisis levels and reflects clients shifting back to equity-based products.
Interest rates continue to negatively impact our earnings in this segment with our brokerage cash spreads still at a low level of 46 basis points.  On a sequential basis, operating earnings were also impacted by approximately $6 million due to two fewer business days than the fourth quarter of 2010.
Expenses continue to be well managed.  As we invest in the advisor business, we are also realizing the benefits of our reengineering in prior periods.  On the next slide I'll discuss Asset Management.
The Asset Management segment had another strong quarter with operating net revenues doubling year-over-year and very strong PTI improvement.  Overall, we saw improved net flows sequentially.
Columbia had improving retail sales and net flows along with better institutional flows.  Threadneedle net flows were negatively impacted by the dislocation in the Middle East and Japan as European investors took a more defensive posture with their investments while the majority of institutional outflows continued to be from low margin, including [Zurich] accounts.
Asset Management operating earnings were also negatively impacted by $10 million sequentially due to two fewer days than in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Adjusting for this impact as well as the Threadneedle expense items, adjusted net operating margins were 37.1% and operating margins were 20.8% compared to 33.6% and 19.7% respectively in the fourth quarter of 2010, excluding hedge fund performance fees.
Columbia management integration is proceeding according to planned and we feel very good about the business synergies we are realizing.  We realized savings of approximately $106 million since the acquisition closed and we are on an annualized run rate of $124 million.
Integration expenses remain on track as well.  In Q1 we expensed $29 million and since announcement we have expensed $136 million.  Let's move to annuities.
Operating pretax income increase by 30% year-over-year.  In the quarter we modified our operating earnings definition to exclude the market impact on variable annuities guaranteed living benefits.
Our treatment is now consistent with the majority of our peers.  The guaranteed living benefit expense was $17 million in the first quarter, the same as last year.  Included in our operating results is the market impact on separate account balances or mean reversion, which was a benefit of $16 million this quarter versus $7 million last year.
The Ameriprise channel continued to generate strong sales of our new variable annuity product [Rabber 5].  Net flows in this channel were $347 million.  Redemptions in the outside distribution channel were consistent with prior trends but since we stopped sales we had net flows of approximately $250 million.
The fixed annuity book continues to experience net outflows reflecting low client demand in the current interest rate environment.  We feel good about the business we book and the spread is strong at 2.6%.  Now, I will discuss the Protection segment.
The life and health business continues to generate consistent results.  DI and long-term care claims are in line with expectations and we continue to reserve at higher levels for our UL product with secondary guarantees.
Auto & Home continue to grow with premiums increasing 5% over last year.  The aggregate loss ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, which included $8 million in higher auto liability reserves.  However, in the first quarter, our reported losses and frequency have improved to the levels prior to the increase in the latter part of 2010.  We will continue to monitor our claims and re-examine our reserve levels in the second quarter.
Expenses remain well-controlled with the expense ratio at 15% for the quarter.  Aside from those items, the insurance businesses continue to generate good results.  Please turn to the next slide.
We continue to manage our financial foundation well, which has enabled us to return capital to shareholders.  During the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $395 million.  At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $531 million remaining on our current authorization.
As Jim said, we also increased our dividend $0.05 per share, or 28% to $0.23.  We continue to hold more than $1.5 billion in excess capital and our cash flow remains strong at $2.5 billion with $1.5 billion of free cash.
The quality of that balance sheet will also remain strong.  Our preliminary estimates of [Riversource] risk-based capital ratio is above 585% and our unrealized gain position is $1.4 billion.
Our balance sheet ratios continue to remain conservative, both in terms of leverage and coverage ratios.  Finally, our variable annuity hedge programs continue to be quite effective.
So to summarize, we generated strong earnings in the quarter as a result of solid, underlying business performance.  We continue to drive our mix toward lower capital businesses, managing our excess capital effectively and driving our operating returns to a higher end of our on-average, over-time targets.
Our balance sheet remains strong, including our capital and liquidity positions and we are managing our risk exposures prudently, positioning the company for continued growth.  Now we will take your questions.

So I think we're going to continue to be proactive in this area.  I can't say exactly that we will trend line it exactly as you saw in the first quarter based on current economic or business circumstances on the market but I would say that we will be at a bit higher level.
We achieved roughly about a $1 billion since we announced the buyback and we will be going to our board to talk about an increase to a buyback program at the end of the second quarter and that would be earlier than we would have normally when we asked for the original buyback approval, which was extended over two years.

One is the one you just mentioned.
As people come into the network it does take them time to transfer the book to become fully productive again.  We're still going through that maturation process.  So people who were added last year need to ramp up.  The people who were two years ago are ramping up but they've still got a little ways to go.  So probably when you look at hitting sort of a two, 2.5 year cycle, they probably get closer to what their full - the total prior production was.
So we will see ramp up for people that we previously brought on, including those that we're bringing on or brought on in the first quarter.  I would also say that we, ourselves, have always driven productivity improvements based upon our channel helping our advisors grow their practices.
So we're continuing to do that this quarter.  We will be conducting comprehensive training programs again throughout our network and helping our advisors to concentrate on areas to improve their practice management, to how to grow their book, how to acquire higher level clients, etc cetera.
So we will continue to focus on productivity improvements.  We don't just look at, as others do particularly in the independent channel, just bringing people onboard.  We have probably the highest productivity increases against our core network of advisors on an annual basis and that's where we'll continue to focus.
Then Walter mentioned, again, retail activity has come back a bit more as people are continuing to get more settled and to reinvest.  So some cash has moved back from the sidelines, back into the products such as wrap and now annuity products, etc cetera.

I think it has more to it some of the lumpiness that we may experience, again, on some of these parent relationships, or ex-parent relationships, that we and Columbia had that may drive some lumpy outflows.
But what I could say to you is this.  Our timeline, particularly in retail, that are higher margin products is trending very nicely with a significant increase in the first quarter in sales activity.  Again, we're still in a new outflow and that's mainly due to the redemption particularly in some of the fixed income product but that seems to be improving, particularly as people have moved more back to equities, which is one of our strong suites here.
So that could be a positive that can turn.  I can't predict the exact quarter for it.  The next thing I would say is on the institutional side, even if the outflow doesn't turn -- and, again, I would say there will be some lumpiness on that and there may be some other larger contracts that do not renew.
I would say that on a revenue basis, as we said for the first quarter, that could be positive because we are winning mandates and higher fee products in areas that we're really concentrating on.  So on a dollar volume, maybe not, but on a revenue, yes.  I think that could be a possibility as we continue to move forward.
But, again, we're building the pipeline, we're executing, we're very focused and this will come, we think, in time.
Threadneedle, yes, Threadneedle was a bit lumpy in the quarter.  If you go back to second quarter of last year when there was the volatility in Europe, we experienced a similar thing.  Retail flows changed very quickly and institutional mandates didn't come in immediately.  The costs of it were put on hold.
But then it ramped up later on with that pent up demand and we got positive in the third and fourth quarter.  So I would just say that I think we experienced some of that in the first quarter. 
We are seeing more mandates come in on the institutional side as we started April.  I can't dictate what will be outflows.  [Zurich], for instance, was $1.4 billion roughly of the $2 billion we mentioned.  There was also another low-margin mandate that we lost during the quarter for -- it was on a pension scheme.  So it wasn't a lot of revenue but the dollar amounts are higher.
But we are seeing more mandates as things have settled in Japan and the people are seeing how the Middle East works out.  So we'll see how that goes.

From our perspective, we think overall this would be appropriate for Securities America so they can continue to build their model.  They actually have a quite strong network of 1800 advisors.  Their actual advisor account went up in the first quarter from recruitment.  But they've been under attack because of this legal issue and with the settlement, which we think will be appropriate to resolve this issue, it should settle things down there.
This does present an opportunity for Securities America and their advisors because I think the independent space, as you know, has attracted interest.  Some people -- one company recently went public with it.  Others are trying to put together various networks appropriate.  So this could end up being appropriate for them to continue to build what they stand for in the independent space.

So even when we have redemptions, it's not that we don't lose some contracts that have some higher fees but when you look at the size of the assets that we're talking about on a net flow negative basis.
They are being driven by higher asset levels for some of the lower margin products.  Now, those margins range anywhere from roughly four or five bips to 11 bips roughly on the low end and then on the high end you're talking in the high 20s to the 40s.
The ones that we've been concentrating on, as you would imagine, would be more of areas such as some of the equity areas, particularly small, mid caps, some of the large cap areas, such as certain debt vehicles, like high yield, etc cetera, floating rate.
So there's a number of places that you have higher margins in the particular mandates that you get based on the type of assets that you're managing.  That both goes for Columbia as well as Threadneedle.  So that's where we have put a stronger focus and that are some of the focused areas that we are marketing out there.

One is we did shift, as we spoke about, from bringing in our own novices and training them on planning and requiring them to do planning as every part of their new client acquisition.
That drives up a level of plan count and fees.  As we transformed the employee network now and brought in over 1000 recruits, it takes us a bit longer to get them to really understand the aspects of the planning to actually start to do financial planning as part of their business curriculum, so to speak, and their practice management.  So that's what we've been focused on but that will be more of a gradual build.
They are interested in it.  That's part of the reason they came over but it's also not natural for them to all of a sudden start the relationship or take a relationship they already have and make it a financial planning-based relationship versus adding a financial plan to it.  Then on the fee structure that they feel comfortable with based on how they actually sell today and how they charge today.
So part of the disconnect that you're seeing is in the past we required a lot more -- and got a lot more -- financial planning from our novice channel in the employee side and that has changed.  In the franchisee channel actually financial planning has picked up and continues to grow a bit and penetration.
Now, from a fee basis, I think our advisors are also a little bit sensitive on the fee basis so far based on the market cycle, so they haven't been raising their fees.  In some cases they are, but not necessarily across the entire channel.  So it's a combination of those factors.
But to the point you referenced, retail activity was actually slowed down even though we actually charged financial fees during the crisis.  The activity under those financial plans actually slowed and now that activity is picking up again.  So that's part of probably what you're seeing if you just look at a straight trend line.

We know that with working with [Zurich] to continue to keep a strong focus on their business but we also know that when we purchased this there will be a continued outflow and that what we've been using is then reusing that capacity to win these other mandates.  One of the whole reasons was to diversify Threadneedle and win a lot more intermediary retial and institutional mandates rather than just manage the [Zurich] book.
So therefore, [Zurich] has become less than 20%, I think thereabouts, 19% of the revenue today versus 49% of the assets.  Part of that revenue will continue, which is the larger part, which has to do with the retail contracts of the [Zurich] book.

They underperformed in the fourth quarter.  Then you've got some of the scary messages coming out namely in the December timeframe that really impacts January and February because retail, unlike institutional don't react immediately that moment.

It was more that people want to associate because they heard about us.  We never proactively went out and marketed ourselves.  We never had a recruitment area in place that would actually be proactive in that regard because we really concentrated on novices.
So beginning in 2008 we said with shifting that, with slowing down because of how we want to drive productivity and make the employee channel more of a permanent channel, and so we did that first with the Block acquisition and then we went and did it to add recruits into these offices that would become more productive offices rather than training offices.
We still today are playing more in what I would call the average production of around $300,000, not necessarily in the million dollar plat.  But we're finding that a number of people in the $1 million teams above that are interested in who we are and so, yes, we welcome them.  We would like them onboard and we bring them onboard.
But I would also say that we haven't really started and stopped it.  We started to ramp this up.  We got a bigger influx in 2009 because of the disruption that occurred.  Before that we were actually ramped up in our own recruiting.
We slowed that down only because we had to actually transfer the employee system onto a new system and so we couldn't do both at the same time.  But now we're building the pipeline last year again.  We're concentrated on bringing people in in a consistent fashion and we're getting good traction and good results for the levels that we're focused on.
The market has heated up a bit compared to when you're talking about 2009 but I would also say that we're concentrated more in the probably $300,000 to $500,000 range.  Then we still attract people at the $1 million but that's not our focus as a primary.

So Ameriprise is a very important client of Columbia, one of its largest but it's not a majority or a substantial part of that makeup today.
It is an important part as one of the key clients and one of the largest ones but the majority of activity does come from a combination of third party and Bank [America]'s channels like US Trust.
But now third party is becoming larger and larger as they're more important.  The recovery in sales is occurring in Ameriprise as you've seen a pickup in sales.  So that's recurring nicely.  It's starting to pick up to get back to the levels that we previously really would want from Ameriprise but there's still more work to do because I think even our advisors going through this change are re-acclimating to what are the funds, what are the performance, what's the mergers coming through.
So we're seeing an activity pickup there and as it has refocused more to equity again, we're seeing the interest increase based on the performance of a number of those funds and factors there.
So I am hoping that our focused efforts in a number of these key businesses will continue.  We saw a nice improvement in the first quarter.  We want that to continue.  So overall, I would like the sales to continue to grow and at least be at least strongly consistent to what I saw in the first quarter and I'm hoping that some of the redemptions will continue to slow as things like the munis, etc cetera, hopefully get to play out a little more.

Then I think that your last was around the Bank America.  As we mentioned to you over the last quarter, we've seen some lumpier outflows from the Bank America where their institutional client, the bank clients that we've gotten mandates as part of the relationship with Bank America, we saw some of those things.
We saw as Merrill Lynch was selling [Balboa], that contract went in December, so that was on the institutional side, so we'll see those.  On the retail side we're actually seeing a pickup again in sales in the Merrill Lynch channel but we're seeing continued weakness in the US Trust, particularly in the muni area because that's where there was a heavy focus for those type of clients.
I think overall -- I think the US Trust channel, some of the sales have not come back but I think sales are a bit lower in US Trust to begin with I think based on some changes going on there.  So it's a combination of those things.  So that's really maybe to give you a little color.
Did we answer -- was that it, Colin?  We're going to close then the call.  What I'd like to end just with is I appreciate your continued attention to Ameriprise.  What you see and we're trying to do is give you more detail and color underlying some of the flows and some of the activity and the business of what we're seeing today.
Again, we're dealing with our business mix.  We're dealing with the environment.  We're dealing with some adjustments that will always occur.  But what I would say is as you look through those, last quarter, this quarter, etc cetera, you'll see a consistent focus that we have.  You can see a continued strength of our business and continued changes that we're continuing to make in that business that would drive higher returns, better margins, better sales activity, better net flows.
So that's where we're going to continue to concentrate.  We can't say every quarter.  Based on the complexity of the businesses, all of the models that you run that everything will be exactly as you think about it going the quarter before but I think if you look through those adjustments you would say, hey, what we're doing, including whether it's overall tax rate, overall revenue, overall margin profitability, cash flow, our total cash that we generate continues to improve because it requires less to reinvest in the business and that's why we can return more to you as shareholders and raise dividends and still have a good flexibility in our capital base.
So that's what we're continuing to focus on.  We feel good about the first quarter.  We felt good about how we ended the year.  We think we're on track to what we had told you that we were looking to achieve for 2012.  I think if we can continue along this way with the environment, there will be continued improvements beyond that that we're hoping based on reenergizing our channel with our remix of businesses that we will give a better return to shareholders overall.
So we appreciate your time and attention.  If there's any other questions please call Chad and we'll try to follow up with some of the ones that you had asked for if we didn't complete the information to you.
Thank you and have a great day.

I’ll start by giving you my high-level view of the business. Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail and then we’ll take your questions. Let’s begin.
Overall, this was another very good quarter for Ameriprise Financial. In our Advisory and Asset Management businesses, we build on the momentum we’ve been generating over the past several quarters and delivered strong growth and profitability. In fact, for the first half of this year, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management contributed about half of our operating segment earnings, demonstrating our ongoing shift to earnings from our higher-returning businesses. At the same time, our Annuity business delivered good earnings and our insurance fundamentals remain solid, despite higher claims, especially in auto and home.
The good performance across our franchise drove our operating return on equity to 14.5%, which is an all-time high and continues to move us closer to our 2012 objective of 15%, which we outlined in 2009. Our strong foundation presents opportunities and gives us flexibility. We are maintaining a large excess capital position, we are investing to accelerate business growth and we’re returning significant capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $400 million through buyback and dividends. And so far this year, we returned well over 100% of our earnings to shareholders.
Now, I’d like to provide some commentary on our performance in each business. First in Advice & Wealth Management, we delivered strength in all of our key business metrics, as well as compelling profitability. I’d like to take a step back here and reflect on the upward trajectory we put our Advice business on over the past two years. Since we started emerging from the financial crisis in the second quarter of 2009, operating earnings in this segment have increased by a factor of five and operating margins have increased dramatically.
At the same time quarterly revenue per advisor has grown from $65,000 to a record $99,000. And remember, we’re generating strong earnings, even in a continuing environment of very low interest rates. While the market improvements of the past two years have certainly helped, I want you to understand the significant changes we’ve made to drive up the profitability of the Advisor business.
Years ago, the Advisor business was regarded primarily as a distribution platform and not a profit center. We brought in a large number of novice advisors and trained them from scratch with a field leadership and infrastructure to support them. As a result, the employee channel was a significant expense.
Today, we’ve transformed the business, both from an economic and operating perspective. Our 2008 acquisition of H&R Block financial advisors gave us a big boost in our efforts to re-engineer the employee platform. Since then, we’ve put in place a much more efficient leadership model, lower producing advisors have left the firm and we instill the sharper focus on productivity. In addition of the more than 1,000 experienced advisors we recruited over the past few years, the majority of them have joined the employee channel.
As a result of all these improvements, our employee advisor productivity is at an all-time high and our retention rate for this group has increased by 16 percentage points in just two years. The franchise channel has always been highly productive with long-tenured advisors and very strong retention. Those trends have continued throughout our time as a public company, but we haven’t rested on our laurels. We continue to enhance the platform and its leadership to ensure franchise advisors remain motivated and satisfied.
We made very significant investments in our advisors and we’re continuing to do so. We’ve consistently supported them with national and local marketing. We’ve offered new products and enhanced existing options, and we’re delivering a number of important technology upgrades, including the new brokerage platform that we’re rolling out now.
Overall, our advisor force and field leadership have undergone extensive positive change and the transformation has helped us deliver earnings growth and notable improvements in all of our important metrics. To review, record advisor productivity, good experienced advisor recruiting, excellent advisor retention, and increasing client assets, including a record level of wrap assets. Just as important, the strong and efficient operating platform I just described gives us significant leverage for continued growth, especially as webegin to increase our advisor force.
Now, I’ll move on to Asset Management, which is also performing well, both in the U.S. and internationally. We’re generating quarterly pre-tax operating earnings in the neighborhood of $150 million in this segment, and we have $467 billion of assets under management in the segment, which makes us one of the largest and most profitable asset managers.
In the U.S., the Columbia integration is near complete with only final technology work left to do. Columbia’s investment performance remains very strong with 52 four- and five-star funds, which is among the most of any fund family. At Threadneedle, investment performance remains exceptional and the firm is creating increased traction in Asia and the Middle East.
Overall, our asset flows are improving. Across the business, we recorded net inflows of $450 million in the quarter. We generated $257 million in U.S. retail net inflows, which included re-invested dividends. Retail sales and flows have improved across all distribution channels. Of course, June was challenging with the weak and volatile markets leading to a sizeable, industry-wide outflows from equity funds. That trend seems to have stabilized in July.
I feel good about the progress we’re making. Our fund merges were essentially completed during the second quarter so our wholesalers no longer having to discuss pending merges. Now, they can discuss a very high-performing, very diverse fund family. At the same time, we started promoting our investment performance in a new advertising campaign. And we entered a new and promising asset class during the quarter with the launch of absolute return funds.
In the Domestic Institutional business, we reported $256 million in net outflows, which is a significant improvement over both a year ago and sequential quarter. We’re winning important and attractive mandates and our pipeline of unfunded mandates continues to build. Of course, the Institutional business is lumpy, so a single redemption can have a significant impact on net flows. But overall, we’re pleased with the trends we’re seeing in this business.
Threadneedle returned to strong retail net inflows of over $2 billion in the quarter with sales remaining strong and redemptions declining substantially. Flows turned around after one-quarter blip that was caused by the crisis in Japan and the Middle East. The Institutional business at Threadneedle also generated good net inflows apart from the continuing and expected runoff of low-margin Zurich assets. Threadneedle won several nice mandates around the world, including its first ever Institutional win in Asia.
Now, I’ll move on to Annuities and Insurance. We generated another good quarter in the Annuities business. The decision to focus our efforts on the Ameriprise channel where the risk and profitability are more attractive, and to exit outside distribution of variable annuities is working well.
While total flows are impacted by the run-off in outside variable annuities, we drove $400 million in net inflows in the Ameriprise channel during the quarter.
The overall economics in the business, including its risks characteristics, are in very good shape. Fixed annuity sales remain slow due to the interest rate environment. Both annuity books, variable and fixed, continue to generate strong returns. Like many other insurers, our Protection segment was impacted by increased claims from the storms that hit the Midwest and the South this spring. Still, our second quarter catastrophic claims were manageable, just $15 million, and the claims in the auto business are improving nicely. Walter will provide more detail on this.
In the Life & Health Insurance businesses, sales are still challenging across the industry, but we’re seeing some improvement. Overall, our Life & Health Insurance business continues to provide reliable earnings and solid returns.
To summarize, Ameriprise is continuing to perform at a high level. We have transformed the Advisor business into a highly-profitable, efficient contributor to our earnings. Our large and global Asset Manager is generating strong profits and performance, and our Insurance and Annuity businesses continue to deliver good returns. At the same time, we continue to manage our resources prudently. Our balance sheet and capital are extremely strong and returning significant capital to shareholders.
Overall, I feel very good about both this quarter and the trajectory of the company. The business is generating record revenues and very strong earnings, and our returns have improved substantially as we’ve grown and shifted the mix of earnings through our higher-return businesses.
In fact, our returns compare favorably by segment and overall against the industry. I believe we have the right strategy and the right market positions and the right foundation to continue to drive growth and higher returns in the years ahead. Now, I’ll turn it over to Walter.

4165019,137036079,147908,"Ameriprise Financial Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We generated strong earnings across all measures with operating EPS up $0.27. As Jim covered, core business trends are strong, and as a result, we are delivering double-digit revenue growth. Earnings growth was very good across our busines",1312,"Thank you, Jim. We generated strong earnings across all measures with operating EPS up $0.27. As Jim covered, core business trends are strong, and as a result, we are delivering double-digit revenue growth. Earnings growth was very good across our businesses, with the exception of Protection.
I was pleased overall with the earnings in the quarter. There were a few non-reoccurring items, both positive and negative, which largely offset. Importantly, our low capital-intense businesses, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management, continue to drive our growth and earnings mix shift. That shift, combined with prudent capital management, resulted in an operating ROE of 14.5% this quarter.
Now let’s look more deeply at the drivers for Ameriprise and each segment. We’re generating strong 14% revenue growth and driving a higher contribution from our less capital-demanding, fee-based businesses, where revenues increased 12% and 34%, respectfully. We are seeing slow revenue growth in Annuities and Protection. In those businesses, we maintained our price discipline and focused on the Ameriprise channel where the economics and risk are more balanced.
Turning to Slide 5, we are seeing similar growth from an earnings perspective. In the second quarter, we generated strong 30% growth in the pre-tax operating earnings, and more than half of that was from low capital-intense businesses. This is great progress towards our goal of approximately 60% over time.
As we shift the business mix, we are generating significant excess capital. In fact, about 90% of our operating earnings are available for capital redeployment, even though we are growing the company at a strong rate.
Our excess capital has grown to over $2 billion, even after buying back 761 million of shares so far this year. This change is the result of a number of factors, including the rate of shift in the business mix to low capital-intense lines, as well as the exit from selling variable annuities in the third-party channel. On the next slide, you’ll see a bit more detail on our capital position.
We continue to prudently manage our financial foundation, which has enabled us to return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares for $366 million. We recently announced an additional $2 billion repurchase authorization, bringing our total to $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter.
At our Life companies, our risk-based capital ratio is over 585%, well in excess of the required level, even after paying a $400 million dividend to the holding company in the second quarter. We intend to bring that ratio down by year-end to below 500%, which is still in excess of the required amount.
The quality of our balance sheet is strong with good liquidity, $1.3 billion of free cash, and a low debt-to-capital level. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of unrealized gains and our variable annuity hedging program continues to be quite effective.
Now, let’s look at the performance of our business segments in more detail. In Advice & Wealth Management, earnings were up 26%. Margins remained strong at 11.3%, up from 10.1% last year.
As Jim described, we are improving Ameriprise advisor productivity and growing assets under management. Client wrap assets were approximately $106 billion, with net inflows of $2.3 billion for the quarter. Interest rates remain a headwind in this segment with over $13 billion of brokerage cash earning low spreads of about 44 basis points. Expenses continue to be well-managed. As we invest in the Advisor business, we are also realizing the benefits of our re-engineering in the prior periods.
Turning to Asset Management. Asset Management had strong 40% operating growth in the second quarter. We had a full three months of Columbia results this quarter compared to last year’s quarter which only reflected two months, as the acquisition closed to May. Normalizing for the extra months of Columbia’s results, earnings would have been up 25%. As Jim detailed, we had $450 million of net inflows and net revenue increase of 34%. The 19.4 operating margin includes the impact of reporting transfer agent fees on a gross basis versus net and the impact of Portfolio Navigator program modification.
As we discussed in the past, we show transfer agent revenues on a gross basis. We have also modified our Portfolio Navigator program, which also grosses up revenues in this segment. We did not anticipate these changes when we originally provided the 25% margin target for 2012.
These non-economic changes reduce our margin by approximately 200 basis points, and therefore a more appropriate target operating margin would be 23%. The adjusted net operating margin, which nets out the impact of these gross-ups, increased from 33.8% to 34.9%. The Columbia integration is progressing well with most of the fund merges complete and net expense synergies on track for our target of $130 million for 2011. We’re expecting net synergies in 2012 of approximately $145 million.
Now turning to Annuities. Operating pre-tax income increased 46% compared to last year. As a reminder, last year’s earnings were impacted by about $17 million of unfavorable items, including mean reversion, DAC model updates and the Portfolio Navigating modifications. On an adjusted basis, earnings increased 23%.
The current level of earnings in the Annuities segment represents a good quality run rate for 2011. Of course, earnings will vary based upon DAC unlockings and mean reversions. Since there was little impact from these factors this quarter, we wanted to ground you with a run rate.
The Ameriprise channel continued to generate strong sales of our new variable annuity product, RAVA 5. Net inflows in this channel were about $400 million. Overall growth of the variable annuity business will be lower given our decision to exit outside distribution, but profitability remains strong, reflecting the differentiated performance of business sold through our advisor network.
The fixed annuities book continues to experience net outflows reflecting low client demand in the current interest rate environment. Returns for fixed annuities remained strong with an operating ROE of 20.3% and a 250-basis-point spread this quarter.
Let’s move on to Protection. Operating pre-tax income was down 35% compared to last year. Auto & Home continues to grow with revenues up 5% over last year. Results in the quarter were down $20 million and were impacted by severe storms in April and May.
Our catastrophic losses were $15 million, which is reasonably good given the severity of the storms and compares well to the industry. Our 91% reported loss ratio reflects these higher losses as well as the continuing higher reserve for auto policies. We have seen improving trends and will closely monitor claims.
In the Life & Health businesses, earnings declined $26 million on an operating basis. Earnings in each quarter had several unusual items. So on a normalized basis, earnings were essentially flat year-over-year. As we noted last year, we had about $9 million of favorable items, including mean reversion, DAC model updates and the Portfolio Navigator modifications, as well as unusually-low claims.
This quarter, claims were $7 million higher and in line with expectations. We also put up a $7 million higher reserve on a year-over-year basis for universal life guarantees, which we started in the third quarter of 2010 and will be ongoing. Looking ahead, this level of Life & Health earnings represents a reasonable quarterly run rate for 2011.
To wrap, we continue to drive a steady increase in operating ROE, reaching 14.5% this quarter. We generated strong earnings as a result of solid underlying business performance and the investments we have made to drive growth. Our mix continues to shift to lower capital businesses, which is providing a strong source of excess capital. We are prudent capital managers and we’ll continue to return capital to shareholders.
Together, this is driving up return on equity toward our target of 15% in 2012 and we see further opportunity to increase ROE beyond that. Now, we’ll take your questions.

But we see greater opportunity, as we would say, in the Advice & Wealth Management business.
We think we have a good, strong capability overall in our Asset Management. Our returns, as we de-risk some of our variable annuity business for the outside distribution, will start to reflect some of those opportunities as well as we move forward. And the business will be more, I think, refined. So again, as you’ve seen in the quarter, we’re getting good growth - good net flows in the Ameriprise channel, but we’re in outflows. But as we reconfigure that business, it’s not going to be growing as quickly because we’re not going through third-party channels, but it will be growing more profitably.
And so there are things such as that as we continue to shift the companies mix. Hopefully, there we’ll also see some changes. Interest over time will have to start to percolate if we have a growing economy and that will give us a lot of benefits.
So we’re going to come back to you.

When you have a risk-free rate of return that everyone benchmarks off of and we have some of the lowest rates here in the United States for government debt, as well as what that triggers off of around the world, I think we’re going to see some change, particularly if we went into default.
Now hopefully, what we’re talking about now which is not reasonable, even from those standards as I mentioned, is a downgrade. So I think if I apply that to Ameriprise, clearly, we have good liquidity situations as we look at the capital markets with debt, et cetera, we’re in a good situation. That’s nothing that we have to fund on a short-term basis.
We have good flexibility in our portfolios where necessary, if various clients are needing liquidity or get concerned. But our clients actually handled the financial crisis, which was much more we think was much more significant than that regard well, and we maintained strong asset flows and maintained stability. So we’re not expecting anything along those lines.
But you know what? We’ve made sure that some of our portfolios have moved a little to the shorter-term and the investment philosophies that Ted and his team, they’ve taken a conservative posture in the quality of assets that they’ve been investing in. We feel good about the owned assets that we have. So we’re going to be like everyone else really monitoring the situation and adjusting when necessary. But we don’t see anything significant, particularly as we see this unfolding right now.
Longer-term I think is a larger issue for the country. And that will depend on whether Congress and the President come together with something that’s meaningful rather than just lifting the ceiling. But I think that’s going to affect all of us, not just financial companies, but the overall economy. And you know that from your own analysis and working with the industry.

I know in the first quarter, we had to really comment on how that moved to a bit of outflows. There was some increased redemptions that we saw out of the European area, as well as holding on mandates for investment based on what was happening in Japan and the Middle East. And so we had mentioned that we saw stability coming and we saw improvement as we moved out of the April timeframe.
And so that’s what we’re seeing now. And so Threadneedle continues I think to gather good mandates. We’ve got our first mandate in Asia this quarter. We’re ramping up our activities there. We think there’s good opportunity. Same thing with flows coming in now from the Middle East again. So the activity has increased. Now third quarter’s always a little slower, as you would know, and but having said that, we didn’t see the volatility that we saw and Europe is settling a little more with what happened in Greece. So hopefully, that will be a bit better as well as we move forward.
Retail flows picked up strongly, and so you can never predict that because you’re working through intermediaries, et cetera of what that is, but that looked nicely as a turnaround from the first quarter.
With Columbia, as we said, we were actually picking up sales nicely and sales were growing in June; became a bit more of a volatile period for equities and I think you saw that across the industry. July looks like that stabilized again and improved. But you know, listen, we have some things going on right now in the economy and with the country, and so I can’t predict what the flows will be as we look over the next quarter or so. But I feel good about the progress we’ve made with the fund families.
We’re now putting the advertising, the wholesalers are to work with one set of group of funds. Their clients don’t have to deal with the proxies and the mergers and et cetera. And we’ve got to be hard at work here. So this is going to take some time to gain the ground that we want. So again, I can’t predict that we’re going to be in inflows and retail in the short-term, but I’m hoping that we’re going to show continued improvement quarter-to-quarter.
Institutional, I do feel good about the pipeline there. We know that we’re going to lose some mandates from what we had previously. But we know that going in and so we’re really working on mandates that have good fees, mandates that we have strong investment performance.
We have a much bigger and better lineup than we ever had with the combination of the two. We have a stronger Institutional sales team on the ground now gaining traction. We’re off held - we’re out of the hold period on the consultants across the board, so we’re seeing things pick up, but those things continue to take time to build and get in front of people.
But so far, the tractions been pretty good and I think you saw that in the second quarter building from the first quarter. So I can’t sit here and tell you I can predict the flows; I can just tell you that I think what we have in place is great, great capability, terrific performance, a motivated team and we’ll deal with the economy and the markets as they unfolded. But again, I think we are someone that could be successful in the marketplace.

And in fact, it’s come over the last few years into a scaled situation. It’s actually one of the better and larger providers in that light and it’s a very attractive space.
And if you look at many of the large companies, they’re starting to figure out whether they need to be there looking at Progressive and others. We were just rated in the top five and that’s ahead of all the majors in Auto & Home in client satisfaction, which is pretty significant and there’s only a few names there that are more smaller and probably less visible to the broader public there.
We actually have a very good model, a good underwriting model. So even if you look at the major storms that hit the Midwest and the South and the billions that it cost the industry, we had $15 million in cat losses, so that’s again quite manageable through a very volatile period. In the Auto area, just so you know, in certain areas, you do get spikes in bodily injury or PIP, et cetera. It’s across the industry. We’ve actually now put in rate increases in those areas and we’ve adjusted where we underwrite even a bit more.
But Walter said the claims have come down. That was sort of a quarter, quarter-plus blip, so we don’t know whether that’s - it didn’t look like or realize to be at this point based on the next two quarters. So I wouldn’t say that one blip should be a big black mark because we had good earnings from this business over multiple periods. We scaled it up. We’re getting good returns on capital there. We got good underwriting.
We save our clients as they take these policies on average $500 a year based on and we have very high satisfaction. And so we think it is a complement. It’s not necessarily an integrated part of the court to point you reference. So strategically, we do have flexibility as we think about it, but we think it’s a nice complement.
It gives us some diversification and we think it does provide a good consumer benefit that we can gain relationships over time with. But as, of course, we’ll always evaluate it if things change, but outside of this sort of blip period, we got a good business here and I think one that as we continue to invest and scale up will be worth a lot - and it worth a lot of money today.

If you look at the gross-ups, it’s in revenue and the same amount goes into expense. There’s no PTI. But when you look at the margin, particularly off the business as it including grew from even last year, it actually squeezes the margin more because of that as an in and out.
Columbia used to have that as a net. And finally, as we looked across the industry, again, we adjusted it to be industry standard. But when we actually came out with a GAAP margin, we didn’t have that factored in. We didn’t realize the significance of it. And the same thing as we adjusted the EPN. Now having said that, as I mentioned to you and Walter, that’s why we’re starting to look at adjusted margin as the key number. And when we look at the adjusted margin, that comes out.
So as you said, like this quarter, we’re at 34.9. We have not adjusted the goal or anything that we want to get that to close to 40%, even though the GAAP margin. But we noticed that many of you are tracking the GAAP margin against the 25. So we wanted to highlight that as the business grows, we would actually get more squeeze based on that gross-up of just revenue and expense. And it’s just a net wash to zero margin. But on the adjusted, we haven’t changed anything, because that gets washed out and so we’re still striving to get to that 40% mark rather than where we are today at the 35%. Does that help you?

First, I just wanted to follow up on Alex’s question about the Asset Management margin. Clearly, the reason that a lot of us model to GAAP results is because that’s the way that you report it and that’s also the target that you’ve established.
So I’d just like to be clear, is the message that we’re getting today that because of these I guess changes, that the new 2012 Asset Management pre-tax margin target on a GAAP basis is 23%? Or are you saying that these changes are causing a 200-basis-point drag but you still think you can hit the 25%? Thanks.

Based on this extent of the gross-up that we’re doing with the TA, which is pretty significant, and I don’t think we realize that impact against the margin target when they made this adjustment to tell you. It is a 200-basis-points change against that goal from 25% to 23%.
So if you look at it now, if you pull that out and we’re doing it the way when we set up the goal even last year, you would find that the 19.4 number would go up adjusted just by pulling out the gross revenue and the expense based on making that change. So the goal in itself hasn’t changed. The accounting based upon what we made the change has caused the GAAP margin to get compressed. But the range of improvement from when we started, if you pull out that accounting change, would still get you to 25%.
So we can look at it one of two ways. We can report to you every quarter what that gross-up is and adjust for it so that we can say 19.4 becomes 20 some, 21-plus percent against the 25, or we can say to you that’s the way we’re going to report it and the 25 is really 23. Now over time, what I would hope we would do is talk about the adjusted margin number and I would hope to say to you that 35% I want to get to 40%.
But you can see the difference even there on a grosser net is due to that in and out. So I would say, Suneet, if it was helpful, we would say to you if you want to track it based on reported, that the 25% is 23%. But again, I have no problem, or Walter has no problem, if you want to stick to the 25% that we try to identify what that gross-up is every quarter and report it to you. So it’s one of two ways, but -

And as Jim said, we’re going to certainly try and go from the 34.9% up to 40% and certainly increase our margins, but if the EPN program is quite a large program, and the transfer agency we announced, we made the alignment last quarter. But the EPN is the larger of the issue, and that is large. And as it’s large, it certainly is very beneficial for the company, but it does have an impact on the margins.

Alicia is going to be around working with you if you have any other questions or comments. I will leave you with this thought. I know it’s always hard quarter-to-quarter and there’s a lot of ins and outs last year. So for you to crack some of those against this year, I can understand some of the questions and some of the differences. So we’re going to try to get better and be clearer. Last year, there wasn’t a lot of going on with the DAC unlockings and the mean reversions and the market changes. But we feel like we’re getting to a more normalized period now. We feel the business is operating quite well.
As I said, you can’t market-to-market, day-to-day. There’s always going to be variations in the businesses that we’re in, but the trend line if you look over the quarters, if you look at what we said we wanted to do and how we’re doing it, we are executing. We are getting good results. The profitability in these segment, whether even at the margins were at, et cetera, are quite good compared to the industry, quite good compared to generating and the type of scale businesses we now have.

We’re one of the few people buying back stock at this level if you look at our cap level and look at our capital, and having the flexibility that we have today, though the environment has proved out there.
So we’ll continue to look at the best ways to deploy that, the best ways to continue to invest for growth. We don’t want to stop at where we are. We feel we are on a good trajectory. We want to continue that, given markets are reasonable and hopefully our government will do their work as we’re all trying to do so that we can get back to a good step. So thank you and if there’s anything else, please let us know and we’ll continue to try to communicate as best we can. Have a great day.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings discussion. I’ll begin with an overview of our performance and then Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail.
Overall, we generated another solid quarter despite very challenging market conditions and we continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model. In our Advisory business, earnings were up nicely and our advisors remained highly productive. In Asset Management, our net outflows increased primarily due to the equity market weakness and volatility. However, the business still produced solid earnings.
At the same time, our Insurance and Annuity businesses generated solid underlying performance despite significant market impacts, the related DAC unlocking and some catastrophic losses in Auto and Home. Our strong financial foundation continues to serve us well. We’re maintaining more than $2 billion in excess capital. We’re continuing our investments for future growth and we’ve accelerated our share repurchases.
During the quarter, we bought back nearly 10 million shares, returning $447 million to shareholders. In fact, so far this year we returned $1.4 billion or nearly 150% of our operating earnings through buybacks and dividends.
I’d like to briefly discuss the markets and their effect on our business and then I’ll provide some commentary on our underlying performance. Both the equity markets and the interest rate environment worked against us in the quarter. As you know, the S&P 500 was down 14% and the markets were quite volatile. The drop in equities affected our DAC muni reversion and the market conditions also drove an industry-wide pull back in equity investing which affected our flows in Asset Management and wrap accounts. Our overall assets were down as well which reduced our fees.
At the same time, long-term rates fell substantially because of the Fed’s Twist action and shorter rates remained near zero. The interest rate movements impacted our DAC unlocking and had a continuing effect on our spread revenue which Walter will discuss in more detail.
Even with the fairly severe headwinds we’re facing, the business generated good results and I feel confident about our ability to navigate the markets. Our diversified mix of businesses along with our strong capital position and flexibility gives us the ability to manage through this near-term disruption and accelerate our growth when conditions improve. In fact, I believe we’re in a stronger position today than ever before.
To illustrate, I’ll talk about each of our businesses and help you understand their performance apart from the market impacts. First, our Advice & Wealth Management segments generated another strong quarter. In fact, despite market conditions and despite the fact that our third quarter is typically slower for us, the segment delivered record pre-tax operating earnings of $116 million. Adviser productivity remained near all-time highs at $97,000 in operating net revenue per advisor for the quarter. We generated retail inflows, however, overall wrap inflows of $800 million were down from previous quarters as advisors held more cash in their clients’ accounts.
We’re continuing our long-term investments in our advisor force and they are providing important benefits. Our experienced advisor recruiting effort delivered its best quarter since the financial crisis in 2009 with 88 recruits during the quarter and 37 in September alone. Advisors across the industry are seeing the benefits of our model. As a result, our pipeline of potential advisor recruits is quite full. In addition, our new national advertising campaign featuring the Academy Award winner, Tommy Lee Jones, has been very well-received by both by advisors and consumers. You can expect to see more of our ads as we move into 2012.
We’re also continuing the rollout of our new brokerage technology platform, which combined with all our other advisor support is enabling advisors to be more productive and grow their client bases. All these improvements have led to a remarkably strong advisor retention and satisfaction rates. The retention of our most productive franchisee advisors is up to an all-time high of 97% and as we’re completing the transformation of our employee channel, our employee advisor retention rose to 91%. That’s an increase of 13 percentage points in just one year and it’s up 30 percentage points over three years ago.
Now I’ll move onto Asset Management where the fundamentals also remain solid. In the U.S., Columbia Management was in net outflows in the quarter, which was consistent with a very tough quarter for the industry. In the retail business, our net outflows increased to $1.9 billion, however, we did make some progress. We drove net inflows in some categories that are in outflows for the industry as a whole and our market share improved in key distribution channels. In the domestic institutional business, we reported net outflows of $2 billion, about half of which came from a single expected Bank of America Balboa insurance redemption. We have won several good institutional mandates recently and our new mandates are generally producing higher fees than the business we’re losing, so the revenue impact of the net outflows is relatively muted.
Given the extremely volatile conditions in Europe, the regular move to net outflows of $1.2 billion in retail funds; however, institutional flows were quite strong and new wins more than offset continued Zurich outflows resulting in net institutional inflows of $414 million.
We’re particularly pleased that Threadneedle won several new mandates including several in the Middle East, which demonstrates the expanding global reach of our Asset Management distribution. While the flows picture was challenging in the quarter, both for us and for the rest of the industry, I feel good about our ability to improve flows over time for a number of reasons. First, investment performance remains strong both in the U.S. and at Threadneedle. Columbia Management increased its number of four and five-star funds from 52 to 54, which is among the most in the industry and Threadneedle’s performance remains excellent.
Second, we’re making good progress reestablishing wholesaling relationships now that our teams have been in place for several quarters. Third, our institutional pipeline is quite strong and continues to grow. Fourth, we’re dealing effectively with former parent-related outflows that we expected as part of the acquisition and we’re generating good revenue offsets for the outflows. Fifth, Threadneedle is making good inroads as it expands its distribution to Asia and the Middle East. And finally, Columbia integration is essentially complete with only final technology work remaining.
Now I’ll move on to Annuities and Insurance. The Annuity business performed in line with our expectations despite the market driven DAC impacts. Net inflows continue to be impacted by our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities and by the expected lack of fixed annuity sales given low rates. That said, we feel very good about our decision to exit outside the distribution of variable annuities. It has given us a stronger risk profile while reducing the capital required by the business. We’ve also been able to focus all of our wholesaling efforts on Ameriprise advisors and sales remain quite strong. In the quarter, variable annuity net inflows in our advisor channel were about $400 million as advisors and clients continue to find our relatively new annuity product attractive.
In the Insurance business, Life & Health sales remain challenging. Clients continue to be reluctant to commit cash to long-term investments especially in products like variable universal life which has been one of one of our strongest products, but we are seeing some pickup in part because of the introduction of our new equity indexed universal life product. We also benefited from good claims experience in the quarter. In the Auto & Home business, catastrophic claims were higher than usual, primarily because of Hurricane Irene, but the catastrophic losses remain very manageable for a business of our size. Sales in Auto & Home continue their steady upward trend with policy counts increasing 8% over a year ago. In addition, we are in the process of raising auto insurance rates, which should help improve the earnings for that business.
To summarize, we certainly are feeling the impacts of the market environment, but the conditions are very manageable for us and I feel very good about our positioning. We’re driving strong improvements in earnings and profitability in our Advisory business. The Asset Management business is holding up well despite very tough conditions and we have a strong foundation to build on in that business. Insurance & Annuities remain solid contributors outside of the quarter’s DAC expenses and catastrophic losses. And our foundation is as strong as ever. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition and we are returning significant capital to shareholders while investing for growth. I continue to believe we have the right strategy, the right market positions and the right foundation to navigate this period in the markets and emerge stronger just as we’ve done before.

The 10-year Treasury declined 125 basis points to abou",1643,"Thank you, Jim. Our reported earnings in the third quarter clearly reflected the challenging environment we’ve been operating in. The S&P was down 14% sequentially, point to point and 7% on average. The 10-year Treasury declined 125 basis points to about 1.9% and corporate spreads widened. And we had some pretty severe weather which impacted Auto & Home claims. The most pronounced impact on our earnings was in the annual and quarterly changes in DAC amortization which resulted from negative market movements.
With this as a backdrop, core business trends were solid with earnings growth in Advice & Wealth Management. Underlying results in Asset Management, Annuities & Protection were all within our expectations. Our balance sheet remained very strong and we will continue to shift to low capital-intensive businesses.
On slide 4, you’ll see a break out of the different items that impacted results in the quarter, particularly given some of the large year-over-year changes. First, there were two different DAC impacts in the quarter, one from our regular mean reversion that captures equity market movements. The other is our annual DAC unlocking which factors in our other assumptions like interest spreads and policyholder behavior.
As you can see, the combined impact of the DAC items reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.42. The mean reversion in the quarter was a negative $0.17 compared to a positive $0.10 last year, reflecting declines in the equity markets. The DAC unlocking was a negative $0.10 compared to a positive $0.05 last year. The annual DAC unlocking was primarily driven by lower interest spreads offset partially by continued strong persistency. Excluding DAC impacts, there were a few unusual items in the quarter that were largely offset and aggregate to about $0.01 per share benefit.
Now let’s look more deeply at the drivers for Ameriprise in each segment. We generated 8% revenue growth and are driving a hard contribution from our less capital demanding businesses. Management and distribution fees had a double-digit growth while we had a 1% growth in net investment income reflecting lower portfolio yields. Overall, we continue to shift our revenue base to our less capital-intensive businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management which represented 58% of the revenues in the quarter.
Turning to Capital on the next slide. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares for $447 million. Between both share repurchase and dividends, we have returned more than $2.1 billion to investors since we began our repurchase program in the second quarter of 2010. This represents about 110% of our operating earnings. At our Life companies, the estimated risk based capital ratio is over 600%, well in excess of the required amount. We are planning to take a fourth quarter dividend of around $850 million and intend to manage RiverSource Life over the long term at an RBC ratio below 500%.
Our hedge program is effective and the quality of our balance sheet is strong. The investment portfolio is high quality and had $2 billion of net unrealized gains at the end of the quarter. We have no sovereign debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain and only $50 million of holdings in the U.S. subsidiary of a financial institution in Spain. We are very confident with our holdings in Europe and you can find additional detail on these holdings in the Appendix of this presentation.
Before I move into the segment results I want to touch on two special topics, the adoption of EITF 09-G and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Let’s start with the DAC accounting changes that will be effective in January. We will adopt EITF 09 on a retrospective basis. We estimate that this will result in a reduction to our DAC asset of between $2 billion to $2.2 billion which represents about 45% to 50% of the current DAC asset.
On an after-tax basis, this is estimated to reduce book value between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. It is expected to have a slight favorable impact on earnings in 2012 and the reduction in book value will increase our return on equity going forward. The amount of DAC that we are writing off is primarily a result of our distribution model and not due to having an aggressive deferral policy. We have sold the vast majority of our products to our advisor versus using a third-party distribution channel. Since this is an affiliated distribution model, there are sales-related expenses that we can no longer capitalize since they are not linked directly to a successful sale.
Examples of these selling costs include certain compensation and benefits of employee advisors, field leadership and wholesalers, as well as some branch office selling costs and support staff. This change has no impact on our statutory accounting and therefore will have no impact on our excess capital position. Importantly, the reduction in the size of the DAC assets should reduce equity market-related quarterly earnings volatility.
Now let’s move to the potential impact from low interest rates on the next slide. Clearly the current rate environment is not the best for our business. The biggest impact is in the Fixed Annuity business. However, the pressure we would expect to see on earnings if the 10-Year Treasury remained low is very manageable. We estimate that in 2011, low rates will reduce earnings by an estimated $30 million. If rates remained where they are now, it would impact us by an incremental $35 million in both 2012 and 2013. This evaluation is based upon a static view of the business currently on our books and does not project new business growth. We do not anticipate low rates to have an impact on reserves or our excess capital during this period, and like I said, we view this impact as very manageable.
Now let’s take a closer look at our operating performance starting with Advice & Wealth Management on the next slide. Earnings in Advice & Wealth Management increased 30% and margins increased to 12.4%, up from 10.7% last year. We continue to improve Ameriprise advisor productivity and grow client assets. Client wrap assets net flows were over $800 million despite the weak equity markets during the quarter. We saw a 10% increase in the brokerage cash to $14.1 billion and these balances currently earn only about forty basis points.
Turning to Asset Management, Asset Management earnings include about $10 million of project-related expenses at Threadneedle relating to a change of transfer agents. While this resulted in additional expense now, it does reduce expense over time. Excluding these items, earnings in the segment increased 7%. Adjusted net operating margins were 32.7%. If you exclude the higher expense at Threadneedle, margins increased to 35.1%. The Columbia integration is progressing well, with all the fund mergers completed and net synergies on track for our target of $130 million for 2011. The technological integration is taking a bit longer than we anticipated and we are now targeting a complete separation in early 2012.
Turning to Annuities, operating pre-tax income was down year-over-year. As you can see, most of that was related to the $183 million swing we saw in DAC. In addition, earnings benefited from about $33 million in higher investment income. This was associated with an adjustment we made to the recognition of prepayment income on some structured securities. Adjusting for these impacts, earnings decreased by about 16% primarily from lower fixed annuity earnings reflecting spread compression and lower account values. The fixed annuity book continues to experience net outflows reflecting low client demand in the current interest rate environment.
From a sales perspective, the Ameriprise channel continued to generate strong sales of our RAVA 5 variable annuity product. As Jim said, net flows in this channel were about $400 million. Overall, variable annuity deposits are down 10% given our decision to exit outside distribution last year. During the quarter, we also announced plans to increase the fees on our living benefit riders and variable annuities to reflect current market realities.
Let’s move onto Protection. Operating pre-tax income in the Protection segment was also impacted by DAC as well as $23 million of higher weather-related losses in the Auto & Home business. If you exclude these items, earnings increased 3% year-over-year as underlying results in both Life & Health, and Auto & Home were good. Auto & Home revenues increased 5% over last year, primarily driven by growth in the sales through our partnership with Progressive and we have seen improving trends in the auto bodily injury claims. In the Life & Health businesses, earnings were consistent with our expectations given improvement in the overall claims levels.
Turning to the trends in the firm’s return on equity, returns in the quarter declined to 13.4% from a high of 14.5% last quarter. Since we calculate the return on equity on a trailing four-quarter basis, this does reflect the year-over-year swing in DAC unlocking as well as higher catastrophic claims in the Auto & Home. Given the challenging market environment, returns are holding up well.
In conclusion, our underlying business performance this quarter was solid. Earnings were affected by the markets and we continue to invest in our businesses so we are well positioned for growth when the equity markets come back. We are facing some headwind from low rates yet as we look ahead, the impact of prolonged low interest rates on earnings is quite manageable. Our risk management discipline is paying off under these conditions and we continue to prudently run our business. We have an effective hedging program against our variable annuities liabilities and our balance sheet is strong. The business mix continues to shift to lower capital businesses, which provide a strong source of excess capital.
As we have demonstrated, we are prudent capital managers and will continue to return capital to shareholders as appropriate.
Now we’ll take your questions.

First on the RBC ratio and the excess capital of $2 billion, and the RBC ratio of over 600%, my understanding is some of the improvement from last quarter came from the increase in value of the hedges that you have on the books, for your variable annuity business. So if that’s the case, and markets rise, obviously, in the fourth quarter then some of that benefit will unwind. So I guess what I’m trying to get at is how much of this excess capital that you’re talking about is really sort of redeployable or cash that you’re comfortable taking out of the life subs to support redeployment going forward?

First and foremost, it is totally appropriate the level that we’re doing, write down from that standpoint and it primarily focuses on the nature of the business and written through the inside channel, and certainly if you look at the components, if you look at the comp component and then the selling rate as it relates to the DAC that you would have in those two components, the impact relates to an inside channel. Those elements under the new rules of being a successful sale are more subject to reversal from that standpoint of the policy that was in effect prior. So since we have the bulk of our activity through the inside channel, that’s where the impact is coming on the reversal of that DAC; whereas if you sold in an outside channel, most of that is absorbed through the comp rate and which is again tied to a successful sale, so therefore it does not get reversed. So we’ve been through this, we’ve reviewed it, we’ve reviewed it with our auditors and certainly have been evaluated it and we feel it’s totally appropriate based upon the type of business and the focus in the channel that it evolved from.

As you are aware, we had mentioned over the last few quarters that we’ve been expanding our distribution with Threadneedle to the other regions of the world and one of the ones that we started to really develop last year was the Middle East, and over the course of the year we’ve been winning mandates coming from the Middle East. We’ve also expanded recently to Asia and we think that, that will start also come to bear some fruit as we move to the next number of quarters as well. So we do believe that it is something sustainable. Threadneedle has excellent product. As you know, based on what we’ve experienced in Europe and the sovereign debt crisis, we experienced some lumpiness in redemptions et cetera, because of what has occurred, but that come back quickly again as we saw previously when that picked up again as an issue in Europe earlier in the year.
So we do feel like the pipeline for Threadneedle is good, it’s strong, and we can continue to win good mandates. Their investment performance over the cycle has been quite good and they have really good product. And so we think that that will continue.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings discussion.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings discussion. I’ll begin with an overview of our performance and then Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail.
Overall, we generated another solid quarter despite very challenging market conditions and we continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model. In our Advisory business, earnings were up nicely and our advisors remained highly productive. In Asset Management, our net outflows increased primarily due to the equity market weakness and volatility. However, the business still produced solid earnings.
At the same time, our Insurance and Annuity businesses generated solid underlying performance despite significant market impacts, the related DAC unlocking and some catastrophic losses in Auto and Home. Our strong financial foundation continues to serve us well. We’re maintaining more than $2 billion in excess capital. We’re continuing our investments for future growth and we’ve accelerated our share repurchases.  
During the quarter, we bought back nearly 10 million shares, returning $447 million to shareholders. In fact, so far this year, we returned $1.4 billion or nearly 150% of our operating earnings through buybacks and dividends.
I’d like to briefly discuss the markets and their effect on our business and then I’ll provide some commentary on our underlying performance. Both the equity markets and the interest rate environment worked against us in the quarter. As you know, the S&P 500 was down 14% and the markets were quite volatile. The drop in equities affected our DAC muni reversion and the market conditions also drove an industry-wide pull back in equity investing which affected our flows in Asset Management and wrap accounts. Our overall assets were down as well which reduced our fees.
At the same time, long-term rates fell substantially because of the fed’s twist action and shorter rates remained near 0. The interest rate movements impacted our DAC unlocking and had a continuing effect on our spread revenue which Walter will discuss in more detail.
Even with the fairly severe headwinds we’re facing, the business generated good results and I feel confident about our ability to navigate the markets. Our diversified mix of businesses, along with our strong capital position and flexibility, gives us the ability to manage through this near-term disruption and accelerate our growth when conditions improve. In fact, I believe we’re in a stronger position today than ever before.
To illustrate, I’ll talk about each of our businesses and help you understand their performance apart from the market impacts. First, our Advice & Wealth Management segments generated another strong quarter. In fact, despite market conditions and despite the fact that our third quarter is typically slower for us, the segment delivered record pre-tax operating earnings of $116 million. Advisor productivity remained near all-time highs at $97,000 in operating net revenue per advisor for the quarter. We generated retail inflows, however, overall wrap inflows of $800 million were down from previous quarters as advisors held more cash in their clients’ accounts.
We’re continuing our long-term investments in our advisor force and they are providing important benefits. Our experienced advisor recruiting effort delivered its best quarter since the financial crisis in 2009 with 88 recruits during the quarter and 37 in September alone. Advisors across the industry are seeing the benefits of our model. As a result, our pipeline of potential advisor recruits is quite full. In addition, our new national advertising campaign featuring the Academy Award winner, Tommy Lee Jones, has been very well-received both by advisors and consumers. You can expect to see more of our ads as we move into 2012.
We’re also continuing the rollout of our new brokerage technology platform, which combined with all our other advisor support, is enabling advisors to be more productive and grow their client bases. All these improvements have led to a remarkably strong advisor retention and satisfaction rates. The retention of our most productive franchisee advisors is up to an all-time high of 97% and as we’re completing the transformation of our employee channel, our employee advisor retention rose to 91%. That’s an increase of 13 percentage points in just one year and it’s up 30 percentage points over 3 years ago.
Now I’ll move onto Asset Management where the fundamentals also remain solid. In the U.S., Columbia Management was in net outflows in the quarter, which was consistent with a very tough quarter for the industry. In the retail business, our net outflows increased to $1.9 billion, however, we did make some progress. We drove net inflows in some categories that are in outflows for the industry as a whole and our market share improved in key distribution channels. In the domestic institutional business, we reported net outflows of $2 billion, about half of which came from a single expected Bank of America Balboa insurance redemption. We have won several good institutional mandates recently and our new mandates are generally producing higher fees than the business we’re losing, so the revenue impact of the net outflows is relatively muted.
Given the extremely volatile conditions in Europe, the regular moved to net outflows of $1.2 billion in retail funds, however, institutional flows were quite strong and new wins more than offset continued Zurich outflows, resulting in net institutional inflows of $414 million.
We’re particularly pleased that Threadneedle won several new mandates including several in the Middle East, which demonstrates the expanding global reach of our Asset Management distribution. While the flows picture was challenging in the quarter both for us and for the rest of the industry, I feel good about our ability to improve flows over time for a number of reasons. First, investment performance remains strong both in the U.S. and at Threadneedle. Columbia Management increased its number of 4 and 5-star funds from 52 to 54, which is among the most in the industry and Threadneedle’s performance remains excellent.
Second, we’re making good progress reestablishing wholesaling relationships now that our teams have been in place for several quarters. Third, our institutional pipeline is quite strong and continues to grow. Fourth, we’re dealing effectively with former parent-related outflows that we expected as part of the acquisition and we’re generating good revenue offsets for the outflows. Fifth, Threadneedle is making good inroads as it expands its distribution to Asia and the Middle East. And finally, Columbia integration is essentially complete with only final technology work remaining.
Now I’ll move on to Annuities and Insurance. The Annuity business performed in line with our expectations despite the market-driven DAC impacts. Net inflows continue to be impacted by our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities and by the expected lack of fixed annuity sales given low rates. That said, we feel very good about our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities. It has given us a stronger risk profile while reducing the capital required by the business. We’ve also been able to focus all of our wholesaling efforts on Ameriprise advisors and sales remain quite strong. In the quarter, variable annuity net inflows in our advisor channel were about $400 million as advisors and clients continue to find our relatively new annuity product attractive.
In the Insurance business, Life & Health sales remained challenging. Clients continue to be reluctant to commit cash to long-term investments especially in products like variable universal life, which has been one of one of our strongest products. But we are seeing some pickup in part because of the introduction of our new equity index universal life product. We also benefited from good claims experience in the quarter. 
In the Auto & Home business, catastrophic claims were higher than usual, primarily because of Hurricane Irene, but the catastrophic losses remain very manageable for a business of our size. Sales in Auto & Home continue their steady upward trend with policy counts increasing 8% over a year ago. In addition, we are in the process of raising auto insurance rates, which should help improve the earnings for that business.
To summarize, we certainly are feeling the impacts of the market environment, but the conditions are very manageable for us and I feel very good about our positioning. We’re driving strong improvements in earnings and profitability in our Advisory business. The Asset Management business is holding up well despite very tough conditions and we have a strong foundation to build on in that business. 
Insurance & Annuities remain solid contributors outside of the quarter’s DAC expenses and catastrophic losses and our foundation is as strong as ever. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition and we are returning significant capital to shareholders while investing for growth. I continue to believe we have the right strategy, the right market positions and the right foundation to navigate this period in the markets and emerge stronger just as we’ve done before.
Now I’ll turn it over to Walter."

Our reported earnings in the third quarter clearly reflected the challenging environment we’ve been operating in. The S&P was down 14% sequentially point to point and 7% on average.

The S&P was down 14% sequentially point to point and 7% on average. The 10-year treasury declined 125 basis points to about 1.9% and corporate spreads widened. And we had some pretty severe weather which impacted Auto & Home claims. The most pronounced impact on our earnings was in the annual and quarterly changes in DAC amortization which resulted from negative market movements.
With this as a backdrop, core business trends were solid with earnings growth in Advice & Wealth Management, underlying results in Asset Management. Annuities & Protection were all within our expectations. Our balance sheet remained very strong and we will continue to shift to low capital-intensive businesses.
On Slide 4, you’ll see a break out of the different items that impacted results in the quarter, particularly given some of the large year-over-year changes. First, there were 2 different DAC impacts in the quarter, one from our regular mean reversion that captures equity market movements. The other is our annual DAC unlocking which factors in our other assumptions like interest spreads and policyholder behavior.
As you can see, the combined impact of the DAC items reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.42. The mean reversion in the quarter was a negative $0.17 compared to a positive $0.10 last year, reflecting declines in the equity markets. The DAC unlocking was a negative $0.10 compared to a positive $0.05 last year. The annual DAC unlocking was primarily driven by lower interest spreads, offset partially by continued strong persistency. Excluding DAC impacts, there were a few unusual items in the quarter that were largely offset and aggregate to about $0.01 per share benefit.
Now let’s look more deeply at the drivers for Ameriprise in each segment. We generated 8% revenue growth and are driving a hard contribution from our less capital-demanding businesses. Management and distribution fees had a double-digit growth while we had a 1% growth in net investment income reflecting lower portfolio yields. Overall, we continue to shift our revenue base to our less capital-intensive businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management which represented 58% of the revenues in the quarter.
Turning to capital on the next slide. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares for $447 million. Between both share repurchase and dividends, we have returned more than $2.1 billion to investors since we began our repurchase program in the second quarter of 2010. This represents about 110% of our operating earnings. At our life companies, the estimated risk-based capital ratio is over 600%, well in excess of the required amount. We are planning to take our fourth quarter dividend of around $850 million and intend to manage RiverSource Life over the long term at an RBC ratio below 500%.
Our hedge program is effective and the quality of our balance sheet is strong. The investment portfolio is high quality and had $2 billion of net unrealized gains at the end of the quarter. We have no sovereign debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain and only $50 million of holdings in the U.S. subsidiary of a financial institution in Spain. We are very confident with our holdings in Europe and you can find additional detail on these holdings in the Appendix of this presentation.
Before I move into the segment results I want to touch on two special topics, the adoption of EITF 09-G and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Let’s start with the DAC accounting changes that will be effective in January. We will adopt EITF 09 on a retrospective basis. We estimate that this will result in a reduction to our DAC asset of between $2 billion to $2.2 billion which represents about 45% to 50% of the current DAC asset.
On an after-tax basis, this is estimated to reduce book value between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. It is expected to have a slight favorable impact on earnings in 2012 and the reduction in book value will increase our return on equity going forward. The amount of DAC that we are writing off is primarily a result of our distribution model and not due to having an aggressive deferral policy. We have sold the vast majority of our products to our advisor versus using a third-party distribution channel. Since this is an affiliated distribution model, there are sales-related expenses that we can no longer capitalize since they are not linked directly to a successful sale.
Examples of these selling costs include certain compensation and benefits of employee advisors, field leadership and wholesalers, as well as some branch office selling costs and support staff. This change has no impact on our statutory accounting and therefore will have no impact on our excess capital position. Importantly, the reduction in the size of the DAC assets should reduce equity market-related quarterly earnings volatility.
Now let’s move to the potential impact from low interest rates on the next slide. Clearly the current rate environment is not the best for our business. The biggest impact is in the Fixed Annuity business. However, the pressure we would expect to see on earnings if the 10-Year Treasury remained low is very manageable. We estimate that in 2011, low rates will reduce earnings by an estimated $30 million. If rates remained where they are now, it would impact us by an incremental $35 million in both 2012 and 2013. This evaluation is based upon a static view of the business currently on our books and does not project new business growth. We do not anticipate low rates to have an impact on reserves or our excess capital during this period, and like I said, we view this impact as very manageable.
Now let’s take a closer look at our operating performance starting with Advice & Wealth Management on the next slide. Earnings in Advice & Wealth Management increased 30% and margins increased to 12.4%, up from 10.7% last year. We continue to improve Ameriprise advisor productivity and grow client assets. Client wrap assets net flows were over $800 million despite the weak equity markets during the quarter. We saw a 10% increase in the brokerage cash to $14.1 billion and these balances currently earn only about forty basis points.
Turning to Asset Management, Asset Management earnings include about $10 million of project-related expenses at Threadneedle relating to a change of transfer agents. While this resulted in additional expense now, it does reduce expense over time. Excluding these items, earnings in the segment increased 7%. Adjusted net operating margins were 32.7%. If you exclude the higher expense at Threadneedle, margins increased to 35.1%. The Columbia integration is progressing well, with all the fund mergers completed and net synergies on track for our target of $130 million for 2011. The technological integration is taking a bit longer than we anticipated and we are now targeting a complete separation in early 2012.
Turning to Annuities, operating pre-tax income was down year-over-year. As you can see, most of that was related to the $183 million swing we saw in DAC. In addition, earnings benefited from about $33 million in higher investment income. This was associated with an adjustment we made to the recognition of prepayment income on some structured securities. Adjusting for these impacts, earnings decreased by about 16% primarily from lower fixed annuity earnings reflecting spread compression and lower account values. The fixed annuity book continues to experience net outflows reflecting low client demand in the current interest rate environment.
From a sales perspective, the Ameriprise channel continued to generate strong sales of our RAVA 5 variable annuity product. As Jim said, net flows in this channel were about $400 million. Overall, variable annuity deposits are down 10% given our decision to exit outside distribution last year. During the quarter, we also announced plans to increase the fees on our living benefit riders and variable annuities to reflect current market realities.
Let’s move onto Protection. Operating pre-tax income in the Protection segment was also impacted by DAC as well as $23 million of higher weather-related losses in the Auto & Home business. If you exclude these items, earnings increased 3% year-over-year as underlying results in both Life & Health, and Auto & Home were good. Auto & Home revenues increased 5% over last year, primarily driven by growth in the sales through our partnership with Progressive and we have seen improving trends in the auto bodily injury claims. In the Life & Health businesses, earnings were consistent with our expectations given improvement in the overall claims levels.
Turning to the trends in the firm’s return on equity, returns in the quarter declined to 13.4% from a high of 14.5% last quarter. Since we calculate the return on equity on a trailing four-quarter basis, this does reflect the year-over-year swing in DAC unlocking as well as higher catastrophic claims in the Auto & Home. Given the challenging market environment, returns are holding up well.  
In conclusion, our underlying business performance this quarter was solid. Earnings were affected by the markets and we continue to invest in our businesses so we are well positioned for growth when the equity markets come back. We are facing some headwind from low rates yet as we look ahead, the impact of prolonged low interest rates on earnings is quite manageable. Our risk management discipline is paying off under these conditions and we continue to prudently run our business. We have an effective hedging program against our variable annuities liabilities and our balance sheet is strong. The business mix continues to shift to lower capital businesses, which provide a strong source of excess capital.
As we have demonstrated, we are prudent capital managers and will continue to return capital to shareholders as appropriate.  Now we’ll take your questions."

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings discussion.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings discussion. I’ll begin with an overview of our performance and then Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail.
Overall, we generated another solid quarter despite very challenging market conditions and we continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model. In our Advisory business, earnings were up nicely and our advisors remained highly productive. In Asset Management, our net outflows increased primarily due to the equity market weakness and volatility. However, the business still produced solid earnings.
At the same time, our Insurance and Annuity businesses generated solid underlying performance despite significant market impacts, the related DAC unlocking and some catastrophic losses in Auto and Home. Our strong financial foundation continues to serve us well. We’re maintaining more than $2 billion in excess capital. We’re continuing our investments for future growth and we’ve accelerated our share repurchases.  
During the quarter, we bought back nearly 10 million shares, returning $447 million to shareholders. In fact, so far this year, we returned $1.4 billion or nearly 150% of our operating earnings through buybacks and dividends.
I’d like to briefly discuss the markets and their effect on our business and then I’ll provide some commentary on our underlying performance. Both the equity markets and the interest rate environment worked against us in the quarter. As you know, the S&P 500 was down 14% and the markets were quite volatile. The drop in equities affected our DAC muni reversion and the market conditions also drove an industry-wide pull back in equity investing which affected our flows in Asset Management and wrap accounts. Our overall assets were down as well which reduced our fees.
At the same time, long-term rates fell substantially because of the fed’s twist action and shorter rates remained near 0. The interest rate movements impacted our DAC unlocking and had a continuing effect on our spread revenue which Walter will discuss in more detail.
Even with the fairly severe headwinds we’re facing, the business generated good results and I feel confident about our ability to navigate the markets. Our diversified mix of businesses, along with our strong capital position and flexibility, gives us the ability to manage through this near-term disruption and accelerate our growth when conditions improve. In fact, I believe we’re in a stronger position today than ever before.
To illustrate, I’ll talk about each of our businesses and help you understand their performance apart from the market impacts. First, our Advice & Wealth Management segments generated another strong quarter. In fact, despite market conditions and despite the fact that our third quarter is typically slower for us, the segment delivered record pre-tax operating earnings of $116 million. Advisor productivity remained near all-time highs at $97,000 in operating net revenue per advisor for the quarter. We generated retail inflows, however, overall wrap inflows of $800 million were down from previous quarters as advisors held more cash in their clients’ accounts.
We’re continuing our long-term investments in our advisor force and they are providing important benefits. Our experienced advisor recruiting effort delivered its best quarter since the financial crisis in 2009 with 88 recruits during the quarter and 37 in September alone. Advisors across the industry are seeing the benefits of our model. As a result, our pipeline of potential advisor recruits is quite full. In addition, our new national advertising campaign featuring the Academy Award winner, Tommy Lee Jones, has been very well-received both by advisors and consumers. You can expect to see more of our ads as we move into 2012.
We’re also continuing the rollout of our new brokerage technology platform, which combined with all our other advisor support, is enabling advisors to be more productive and grow their client bases. All these improvements have led to a remarkably strong advisor retention and satisfaction rates. The retention of our most productive franchisee advisors is up to an all-time high of 97% and as we’re completing the transformation of our employee channel, our employee advisor retention rose to 91%. That’s an increase of 13 percentage points in just one year and it’s up 30 percentage points over 3 years ago.
Now I’ll move onto Asset Management where the fundamentals also remain solid. In the U.S., Columbia Management was in net outflows in the quarter, which was consistent with a very tough quarter for the industry. In the retail business, our net outflows increased to $1.9 billion, however, we did make some progress. We drove net inflows in some categories that are in outflows for the industry as a whole and our market share improved in key distribution channels. In the domestic institutional business, we reported net outflows of $2 billion, about half of which came from a single expected Bank of America Balboa insurance redemption. We have won several good institutional mandates recently and our new mandates are generally producing higher fees than the business we’re losing, so the revenue impact of the net outflows is relatively muted.
Given the extremely volatile conditions in Europe, the regular moved to net outflows of $1.2 billion in retail funds, however, institutional flows were quite strong and new wins more than offset continued Zurich outflows, resulting in net institutional inflows of $414 million.
We’re particularly pleased that Threadneedle won several new mandates including several in the Middle East, which demonstrates the expanding global reach of our Asset Management distribution. While the flows picture was challenging in the quarter both for us and for the rest of the industry, I feel good about our ability to improve flows over time for a number of reasons. First, investment performance remains strong both in the U.S. and at Threadneedle. Columbia Management increased its number of 4 and 5-star funds from 52 to 54, which is among the most in the industry and Threadneedle’s performance remains excellent.
Second, we’re making good progress reestablishing wholesaling relationships now that our teams have been in place for several quarters. Third, our institutional pipeline is quite strong and continues to grow. Fourth, we’re dealing effectively with former parent-related outflows that we expected as part of the acquisition and we’re generating good revenue offsets for the outflows. Fifth, Threadneedle is making good inroads as it expands its distribution to Asia and the Middle East. And finally, Columbia integration is essentially complete with only final technology work remaining.
Now I’ll move on to Annuities and Insurance. The Annuity business performed in line with our expectations despite the market-driven DAC impacts. Net inflows continue to be impacted by our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities and by the expected lack of fixed annuity sales given low rates. That said, we feel very good about our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities. It has given us a stronger risk profile while reducing the capital required by the business. We’ve also been able to focus all of our wholesaling efforts on Ameriprise advisors and sales remain quite strong. In the quarter, variable annuity net inflows in our advisor channel were about $400 million as advisors and clients continue to find our relatively new annuity product attractive.
In the Insurance business, Life & Health sales remained challenging. Clients continue to be reluctant to commit cash to long-term investments especially in products like variable universal life, which has been one of one of our strongest products. But we are seeing some pickup in part because of the introduction of our new equity index universal life product. We also benefited from good claims experience in the quarter. 
In the Auto & Home business, catastrophic claims were higher than usual, primarily because of Hurricane Irene, but the catastrophic losses remain very manageable for a business of our size. Sales in Auto & Home continue their steady upward trend with policy counts increasing 8% over a year ago. In addition, we are in the process of raising auto insurance rates, which should help improve the earnings for that business.
To summarize, we certainly are feeling the impacts of the market environment, but the conditions are very manageable for us and I feel very good about our positioning. We’re driving strong improvements in earnings and profitability in our Advisory business. The Asset Management business is holding up well despite very tough conditions and we have a strong foundation to build on in that business. 
Insurance & Annuities remain solid contributors outside of the quarter’s DAC expenses and catastrophic losses and our foundation is as strong as ever. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition and we are returning significant capital to shareholders while investing for growth. I continue to believe we have the right strategy, the right market positions and the right foundation to navigate this period in the markets and emerge stronger just as we’ve done before.
Now I’ll turn it over to Walter."
4165019,140180818,279431,"Ameriprise Financial Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Our reported earnings in the third quarter clearly reflected the challenging environment we’ve been operating in. The S&P was down 14% sequentially point to point and 7% on average. The 10-year treasury declined 125 basis points to about",1641,"Thank you, Jim. Our reported earnings in the third quarter clearly reflected the challenging environment we’ve been operating in. The S&P was down 14% sequentially point to point and 7% on average. The 10-year treasury declined 125 basis points to about 1.9% and corporate spreads widened. And we had some pretty severe weather which impacted Auto & Home claims. The most pronounced impact on our earnings was in the annual and quarterly changes in DAC amortization which resulted from negative market movements.
With this as a backdrop, core business trends were solid with earnings growth in Advice & Wealth Management, underlying results in Asset Management. Annuities & Protection were all within our expectations. Our balance sheet remained very strong and we will continue to shift to low capital-intensive businesses.
On Slide 4, you’ll see a break out of the different items that impacted results in the quarter, particularly given some of the large year-over-year changes. First, there were 2 different DAC impacts in the quarter, one from our regular mean reversion that captures equity market movements. The other is our annual DAC unlocking which factors in our other assumptions like interest spreads and policyholder behavior.
As you can see, the combined impact of the DAC items reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.42. The mean reversion in the quarter was a negative $0.17 compared to a positive $0.10 last year, reflecting declines in the equity markets. The DAC unlocking was a negative $0.10 compared to a positive $0.05 last year. The annual DAC unlocking was primarily driven by lower interest spreads, offset partially by continued strong persistency. Excluding DAC impacts, there were a few unusual items in the quarter that were largely offset and aggregate to about $0.01 per share benefit.
Now let’s look more deeply at the drivers for Ameriprise in each segment. We generated 8% revenue growth and are driving a hard contribution from our less capital-demanding businesses. Management and distribution fees had a double-digit growth while we had a 1% growth in net investment income reflecting lower portfolio yields. Overall, we continue to shift our revenue base to our less capital-intensive businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management which represented 58% of the revenues in the quarter.
Turning to capital on the next slide. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares for $447 million. Between both share repurchase and dividends, we have returned more than $2.1 billion to investors since we began our repurchase program in the second quarter of 2010. This represents about 110% of our operating earnings. At our life companies, the estimated risk-based capital ratio is over 600%, well in excess of the required amount. We are planning to take our fourth quarter dividend of around $850 million and intend to manage RiverSource Life over the long term at an RBC ratio below 500%.
Our hedge program is effective and the quality of our balance sheet is strong. The investment portfolio is high quality and had $2 billion of net unrealized gains at the end of the quarter. We have no sovereign debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain and only $50 million of holdings in the U.S. subsidiary of a financial institution in Spain. We are very confident with our holdings in Europe and you can find additional detail on these holdings in the Appendix of this presentation.
Before I move into the segment results I want to touch on 2 special topics, the adoption of EITF 09-G and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Let’s start with the DAC accounting changes that will be effective in January. We will adopt EITF 09 on a retrospective basis. We estimate that this will result in a reduction to our DAC asset of between $2 billion to $2.2 billion which represents about 45% to 50% of the current DAC asset.
On an after-tax basis, this is estimated to reduce book value between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. It is expected to have a slight favorable impact on earnings in 2012 and the reduction in book value will increase our return on equity going forward. The amount of DAC that we are writing off is primarily a result of our distribution model and not due to having an aggressive deferral policy. We have sold the vast majority of our products to our advisor versus using a third-party distribution channel. Since this is an affiliated distribution model, there are sales-related expenses that we can no longer capitalize since they are not linked directly to a successful sale.
Examples of these selling costs include certain compensation and benefits of employee advisors, field leadership and wholesalers, as well as some branch office selling costs and support staff. This change has no impact on our statutory accounting and therefore will have no impact on our excess capital position. Importantly, the reduction in the size of the DAC assets should reduce equity market-related quarterly earnings volatility.
Now let’s move to the potential impact from low interest rates on the next slide. Clearly the current rate environment is not the best for our business. The biggest impact is in the Fixed Annuity business. However, the pressure we would expect to see on earnings if the 10-Year Treasury remained low is very manageable. We estimate that in 2011, low rates will reduce earnings by an estimated $30 million. If rates remained where they are now, it would impact us by an incremental $35 million in both 2012 and 2013. This evaluation is based upon a static view of the business currently on our books and does not project new business growth. We do not anticipate low rates to have an impact on reserves or our excess capital during this period, and like I said, we view this impact as very manageable.
Now let’s take a closer look at our operating performance starting with Advice & Wealth Management on the next slide. Earnings in Advice & Wealth Management increased 30% and margins increased to 12.4%, up from 10.7% last year. We continue to improve Ameriprise advisor productivity and grow client assets. Client wrap assets net flows were over $800 million despite the weak equity markets during the quarter. We saw a 10% increase in the brokerage cash to $14.1 billion and these balances currently earn only about forty basis points.
Turning to Asset Management, Asset Management earnings include about $10 million of project-related expenses at Threadneedle relating to a change of transfer agents. While this resulted in additional expense now, it does reduce expense over time. Excluding these items, earnings in the segment increased 7%. Adjusted net operating margins were 32.7%. If you exclude the higher expense at Threadneedle, margins increased to 35.1%. The Columbia integration is progressing well, with all the fund mergers completed and net synergies on track for our target of $130 million for 2011. The technological integration is taking a bit longer than we anticipated and we are now targeting a complete separation in early 2012.
Turning to Annuities, operating pre-tax income was down year-over-year. As you can see, most of that was related to the $183 million swing we saw in DAC. In addition, earnings benefited from about $33 million in higher investment income. This was associated with an adjustment we made to the recognition of prepayment income on some structured securities. Adjusting for these impacts, earnings decreased by about 16% primarily from lower fixed annuity earnings reflecting spread compression and lower account values. The fixed annuity book continues to experience net outflows reflecting low client demand in the current interest rate environment.
From a sales perspective, the Ameriprise channel continued to generate strong sales of our RAVA 5 variable annuity product. As Jim said, net flows in this channel were about $400 million. Overall, variable annuity deposits are down 10% given our decision to exit outside distribution last year. During the quarter, we also announced plans to increase the fees on our living benefit riders and variable annuities to reflect current market realities.
Let’s move onto Protection. Operating pre-tax income in the Protection segment was also impacted by DAC as well as $23 million of higher weather-related losses in the Auto & Home business. If you exclude these items, earnings increased 3% year-over-year as underlying results in both Life & Health, and Auto & Home were good. Auto & Home revenues increased 5% over last year, primarily driven by growth in the sales through our partnership with Progressive and we have seen improving trends in the auto bodily injury claims. In the Life & Health businesses, earnings were consistent with our expectations given improvement in the overall claims levels.
Turning to the trends in the firm’s return on equity, returns in the quarter declined to 13.4% from a high of 14.5% last quarter. Since we calculate the return on equity on a trailing 4-quarter basis, this does reflect the year-over-year swing in DAC unlocking as well as higher catastrophic claims in the Auto & Home. Given the challenging market environment, returns are holding up well.  
In conclusion, our underlying business performance this quarter was solid. Earnings were affected by the markets and we continue to invest in our businesses so we are well positioned for growth when the equity markets come back. We are facing some headwind from low rates yet as we look ahead, the impact of prolonged low interest rates on earnings is quite manageable. Our risk management discipline is paying off under these conditions and we continue to prudently run our business. We have an effective hedging program against our variable annuities liabilities and our balance sheet is strong. The business mix continues to shift to lower capital businesses, which provide a strong source of excess capital.
As we have demonstrated, we are prudent capital managers and will continue to return capital to shareholders as appropriate.  Now we’ll take your questions."

So since we have the bulk of our activity through the inside channel, that’s where the impact is coming on the reversal of that DAC; whereas if you sold in an outside channel, most of that is absorbed through the comp rate and which is again tied to a successful sale, so therefore it does not get reversed. So we’ve been through this, we’ve reviewed it, we’ve reviewed it with our auditors and certainly have been evaluated it and we feel it’s totally appropriate based upon the type of business and the focus in the channel that it evolved from."

As you are aware, we had mentioned over the last few quarters that we’ve been expanding our distribution with Threadneedle to the other regions of the world and one of the ones that we started to really develop last year was the Middle East, and over the course of the year we’ve been winning mandates coming from the Middle East. We’ve also expanded recently to Asia and we think that, that will start also come to bear some fruit as we move to the next number of quarters as well. So we do believe that it is something sustainable. Threadneedle has excellent product. As you know, based on what we’ve experienced in Europe and the sovereign debt crisis, we experienced some lumpiness in redemptions et cetera, because of what has occurred, but that come back quickly again as we saw previously when that picked up again as an issue in Europe earlier in the year.  So we do feel like the pipeline for Threadneedle is good, it’s strong, and we can continue to win good mandates. Their investment performance over the cycle has been quite good and they have really good product. And so we think that that will continue."

We appreciate you listening in this morning. As I opened the call, even though we’ve experienced another impact from the market environment, stock market being down a lot in the quarter, we do feel like the fundamentals of our business remain quite solid. And as we look across the businesses, we feel very comfortable with the position and the hand that we have. We feel good that if this environment continues, we can navigate even stronger than we did the first time out and in addition to that, we do believe that as markets continue to repair and stabilize, the foundation we have in place, the investments we continue to make and the traction we’re gaining including with the Asset Management businesses as we have really integrated and stabilized them, will bear fruit as we move forward.
We have derisked the business. We feel very good about our capital position. Volatility is lower. We really have an excellent book in our Annuity business and we have, even though there are the normal exposures from market declines et cetera, on a relative size and scale, it’s very manageable for the size and scope of our business and the diversity of our business and the capital position.
So we will update you even further as we talk at our Financial Community Meeting, which is November 16 at 8:00 a.m. at the New York Stock Exchange and we look forward to having a very good conversation with you and outlining how we’ll continue to make progress as we move forward and also to discuss any of what you might think as issues or concerns in the environment so that we can actually quantify that for you and qualitatively give you how we think about it so that you can make informed decisions.
So we appreciate your time, and thank you very much, and look forward to speaking to you further."
