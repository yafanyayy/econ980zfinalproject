Good morning and many thanks to all of you for joining us today and of course, for your continued investment and interest in both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me on today's call are Curtis Dinan, Chief Financial Officer for both ONEOK and ONEOK partners; Terry Spencer, our Chief Operating Officer of ONEOK Partners and Rob Martinovich, our Chief Operating Officer of ONEOK.
W e completed another successful quarter and year at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners with all of our businesses performing well. At ONEOK Partners, we benefited from the first full year of operations of the assets we built during our $2 billion capital program we completed in late 2009, resulting in higher natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes moving through our assets, selecting fees and creating additional opportunities.
Those projects will continue to contribute earnings growth through this year and beyond and set the stage for the partnership's next phase of growth which now totals between 1.8 billion and 2.1 billion in new projects. Our ONEOK distribution segment continues to benefit from our new, performance-based rates in Oklahoma, which reduced volumetric sensitivity and increased revenues in the warmer months.
This shift in the segment earnings pattern is reflected in the lower fourth-quarter operating income compared with the previous year but higher year-over-year operating income. And, as expected, the energy services segments fourth quarter results were lower but were higher for the year as we have indicated it would be earlier.
In 2010, we increased the ONEOK dividend three times and, an additional increase of $0.04 per share announced last month. This dividend increase is consistent with the forecast we gave last October, to increase the dividend by 50% to 60% in 2000 - by 2013.
It is enabled by the cash coming to ONEOK from its ownership interest in ONEOK Partners, which increased its distributions to unit holders four times in 2010. This growth in earnings, distributions and dividends, is primarily the result of ONEOK Partners recently completed capital projects and, with our plans to invest another $2 billion plus at the partnership over the next few years, we are very confident in our ability to continue to grow.
While we remain active on the acquisition front, evaluating many of the assets that are publicly known to be for sale and some that are not, we have not completed any transactions for a number of reasons. The most compelling one being that we have very attractive alternatives to grow through our internal capital projects.
These projects, the ones just completed, the ones currently being built and the ones we are evaluating but not yet announced, provide us with very attractive returns. They also deliver stable cash flow growth that gives us the confidence to forecast our three-year growth targets and, the ability to consistently increase our distributions.
Bottom line, we do not have to wait on the next big acquisition, probably at pricing multiples to grow and reward our investors at ONEOK or at the partnership. Our growth continues to be embedded with our own assets.
Curtis will now review ONEOK Partners’ financial highlights and then we will ask Terry to review the partnership's operating performance. So, now let me turn this over to Curtis.

John has already provided a brief summary of the partnership's fourth quarter and year-end results and Terry will provide additional detail in a moment. My remarks will focus on our financial results and outlook.
In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners reported net income of $142 million or $1.09 per unit compared with last year's fourth quarter net income of $116 million or $0.93 per unit. For 2010, net income was $473 million or $3.50 per unit compared with $434 million or $3.60 per unit in 2009.
2010 results included a $16 million gain related to the sale of a 49% interest in Overland Pass to Williams Partners. That gain had a $0.16 per unit impact on the partnership year-end results. Also impacting the per unit calculation is the February 2010 public equity offering of 5.5 million common units, which resulted in additional units outstanding in 2010 compared with 2009.
Distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter was $170 million, a 14% increase compared with fourth quarter 2009. For the year, distributable cash flow increased to $30 million to $588 million more than adequate to cover our 2010 distributions and maintain a 1.02 times coverage ratio for the year.
The partnership issued its 2011 net income guidance in January in the range of $525 million to $575 million for the year with distributable cash flow in the range of $625 million to $675 million. Pending board approval, the partnership anticipates increasing the distribution a penny per quarter in 2011, building on the fourth quarter 2010 distribution increase to $1.14 per unit paid in February which marked the 17th distribution increase since ONEOK became sole general partner, accumulative 43% increase over that time.
Capital expenditures for the partnership are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion comprised of $1 billion in growth capital, related to our $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion of growth projects announced today and $105 million in maintenance capital. Terry will provide an update on these growth projects in a moment.
We have hedges in place to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the partnership's natural gas, gathering and processing segment which has the most sensitivity to commodity price changes. For 2011, we have hedged 69% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes at an average price of $1.40 per gallon and 74% of our expected natural gas equity volumes at $5.61 per MMBtu.
For 2012, approximately 12% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes are hedged at an average price of $2.34 per gallon. As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant.
At the end of 2010, the partnership had $430 million of commercial paper outstanding and $570 million available under the $1 billion revolving credit agreement that expires in 2012. The partnership ended 2010 with a debt-to-capital ratio of 50% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.8.
In January, we completed an offering of $1.3 billion of senior notes consisting of $650 million of five-year notes at a coupon of 3.25% and $650 million of 30-year senior notes at a coupon of 6.125% generating net proceeds of approximately $1.28 billion. After the debt offering, we have repaid all of our outstanding commercial paper and have a cash balance of approximately $900 million, leaving us well-positioned to repay the $225 million principal amount of senior notes that mature next month and to fund our capital spending program in 2011.
At this time, the partnership does not anticipate any additional financing need this year but we continue to monitor the capital markets and will take advantage of opportunities that are presented. There is one item that I would like to highlight, related to the partnership's 2011 guidance.
We expect the partnership’s interest expense to be approximately $12 million higher compared with what we provided in January. This amount will be offset by an increase of $12 million in equity earnings for the natural gas liquids segment for Overland Pass. This line item shipped reflects our financing of Overland Pass pipeline at the ONEOK Partners level versus at the joint venture level that we assumed in our initial 2011 financial guidance.
Now, Terry Spencer will provide you with an overview of the operating performance of the partnership.

The partnership had a solid fourth-quarter operating performance from all segments, driven primarily by higher volumes gathered, fractionated and stored, and higher optimization margins in the natural gas liquids segmen",1617,"Thank you, Curtis and good morning. The partnership had a solid fourth-quarter operating performance from all segments, driven primarily by higher volumes gathered, fractionated and stored, and higher optimization margins in the natural gas liquids segment, due to increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for NGL optimization activities as a result of a large frac only contract that expired in September of last year.
Volume increases in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, particularly in the Bakken Shale and the Williston Basin also led to higher earnings in the fourth quarter. I will now briefly discuss the operating performance of ONEOK Partners’ three segments.
The natural gas gathering and processing segments fourth-quarter financial results were lower than the same period in 2009, due primarily to the sale of our bankruptcy claims with Lehman Brothers, lower net realized commodity prices, lower processed volumes in the mid-continent driven by natural production declines and lower gathered volumes from the reduced drilling activity in the Powder River basin in Wyoming.
These increases were offset by higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Bakken Shale as a result of increased drilling activity. The midpoint of the gathering and processing segment in 2011 operating income guidance is $182 million reflecting higher gathered and processed volumes in the Bakken Shale as well as new supply connections from Cana-Woodford Shale and Granite Wash development to our systems and plants in Oklahoma.
For 2011, we expect our process volumes to be approximately 11% higher compared with 2010. We expect our gathered volumes to increase 5% compared with 2010, with growth in the Cana-Woodford Shale and Granite Wash development more than offset in declines in the Powder River basin in Wyoming.
Now, moving to our natural gas pipeline segment. Fourth-quarter results, including our 50% interest in Northern Border Pipeline were solid. Earnings from Northern Border more than doubled compared with the same period last year due mainly to an increase in contracted capacity as a result of continued strong Midwest market demand.
TransCanada announced on its conference call last week that a significant amount of Northern Border’s capacity has been contracted into the spring of 2012. The midpoint of a natural gas pipelines 2011 operating income guidance is $148 million, excluding equity earnings, reflecting nearly 90% of our pipeline of storage capacity, under firm contracts.
This segments natural gas storage facilities remain an important component by enhancing our ability to maintain reliable deliveries during periods of peak demand and during weather related, well head supply averages by producers. Our storage facilities can deliver up to 1.7 billion cubic feet per day into the marketplace.
Now, let's move to our natural gas liquids segment. As I discussed earlier in the fourth quarter, natural gas liquids segment benefited from having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities and favorable NGL price differentials. Higher NGL storage margins and higher NGL volumes gathered fractionated and transported.
Net NGL volumes fractionated during the fourth quarter were approximately 530,000 barrels per day, more than 96% of capacity. Further emphasizing that excess fractionation capacity continues to be in short supply industry wide. NGLs transported during the fourth quarter on a gathering lines were 403,000 barrels per day and reflect the exclusion of Overland Pass volumes, due to the September 2010 deconsolidation to an equity investment compared with 414,000 barrels per day for the same period last year that included Overland Pass.
Excluding Overland Pass, the fourth quarter 2009 gathered volumes were 337,000 barrels per day. NGLs transported on our distribution lines in the fourth quarter were down slightly compared with the same period last year, due to much higher Midwest crop drop in demand for propane experienced in the fall of 2009.
But, these volume still increase 2% year-over-year. Overland Pass pipeline gross NGL volumes continue to average approximately 120,000 to 130,000 barrels per day. The pipelines’ current capacity is 154,000 barrels per day.
The robust NGL supply outlet, particularly in the Bakken Shale is necessitating continued expansions such as those we announced back in July. And, we expect the capacity to increase to 255,000 barrels per day during 2013.
Arbuckle Pipeline volumes are currently averaging approximately 100,000 to 120,000 barrels per day and remained well-positioned to accommodate NGL volumes growth from the Rockies, Mid-Continent and Barnett Shale production growth as our access to more fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu increases in the second quarter of this year from the fractionation services agreement with Targa at our Cedar Bayou facility that is being expanded.
Current capacity of Arbuckle is approximately 180,000 barrels per day with plans to expand the capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in 2012. Let me point out the Arbuckle pipeline has emerged as a key connector of Mid-Continent NGL production, the Gulf Coast NGL fractionation. Accordingly, Arbuckle has expanded our north to south optimization capability, allowing us to capture more location price differential opportunities. With Arbuckle, our broad operating footprint and delivery capability to multiple market centers creates value for customers and for us.
The natural gas liquids segment in 2011 operating income mid point is $326 million, reflecting higher fee-based earnings from increased NGL volumes and higher optimization volumes as a result of our having increase the fractionation capacity available to us in 2011 when a frac only contract expired last fall.
In our 2011 earnings guidance, we assume a $0.09 per gallon Conway to Mont Belvieu at same price distribution compared with $0.10 price per gallon in 2010. A brief comment on how the partnership's natural gas and NGL assets perform during this winters record cold temperatures and snowfall. Not surprising to us, our field operations and back office employees performed exceptionally well during these harsh operating conditions and rapidly changing supply environment.
Our businesses were affected by periodic supply outages resulting from well production free soft and processing plan interactions requiring swift and responsive adjustments to our operations and product scheduling to maintain deliveries to our customers. Our employees adjusted incredibly well to these difficult conditions and in particular, our natural gas pipeline segment did not have to curtail any firm or interruptible transportation customers due in part to our storage capability.
I will now briefly comment on the recent events that caused a disruption to the NGL marketplace earlier this month. On February 8, we temporarily shut down our 160,000 barrel per day, Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionator as a precautionary measure due to a fire and resulting outage at a nearby enterprise NGL storage facility and, we were able to restart our fractionator the next day.
Today, all of our Mont Belvieu facilities are operating normally. Our operations were not affected materially by the outage, due in large part, to the connectivity, integration and flexibility of our own collection of pipelines and storage assets at Mont Belvieu.
Our NGL purity product distribution pipelines, the Sterling pipelines, were unaffected and continue to run at or near capacity. Volumes on our Arbuckle pipeline that delivers raw NGLs into our Mont Belvieu fractionator were not affected materially, delivering raw NGLs to storage while our fractionator was down.
Accordingly, most of our process explain customers were unaffected by the outage. The petrochemical industry continues to recognize our NGL service capability, which we expect will lead to more opportunities to expand and grow our Mont Belvieu presence.
Now, for some additional color on the NGL industry. The petrochemical industry continues to find ways to crack more ethane due to its continued strong price advantage. So, over the next couple of years, we see ethylene demand remains strong as the ethane to crude ratio remains relatively low.
NGL infrastructure and fractionation capacity remains tight but will gradually improve as the frac capacity comes online over the next couple of years. Looking at the NGL supply picture, producers are very focused on liquid rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Granite Wash and Eagle Ford Shales.
Well, NGL growth opportunities continues at a rapid pace, much of the growth in volumes is being offset by the inherent natural decline of the base natural gas production, which exceeds 20% per year according to some experts. And, the decline rate is getting steeper.
We and others believe that NGL demand will be sufficient over the next two years and that regional processing and NGL infrastructure expansions will continue to be needed. Now, a few comments on the status of our announced growth projects. In aggregate, we have announced plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in the Bakken related projects with midstream infrastructure needed to allow producers to fully monetize their oil and natural gas reserves.
We have announced approximately $1 billion in gathering and processing growth projects in the Bakken Shale which includes three 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plants, the Garden Creek plant and related infrastructure and the Stateline I and II plants, which will quadruple our processing capacity in the region to nearly 400 million cubic feet per day.
We also have more than 700 million in NGL infrastructure projects related to the Bakken growth which includes the 500 plus mile 60,000 barrels per day raw NGL pipeline referred to as the Bakken pipeline that will connect with Overland Pass. These projects are in various stages of development, engineering, design and procurement, with some under construction and all are progressing within our expected timeline.
In addition to growth projects, we have already announced we are continuing to evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas in NGL related infrastructure projects including investments in natural gas pipelines, fractionator expansions or a new fractionator, NGL storage facilities and additional pipeline capacities both for raw NGL and purity NGL products. John, that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK’s net income for the fourth quarter was $83 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared with last year's fourth quarter net income of $93 million or $0.87 per diluted share.

ONEOK’s net income for the fourth quarter was $83 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared with last year's fourth quarter net income of $93 million or $0.87 per diluted share. ONEOK’s 2010 net income was $335 million or $3.10 per diluted share versus $305 million or $2.87 per diluted share in 2009.
2010 results include a $16 million or $0.04 per share impact from the gain on ONEOK Partner sale of a 49% interest in Overland Pass pipeline company to Williams Partners, completed last September. Rob will provide more details on the drivers of our operating results in a few minutes.
ONEOK’s 2010 stand-alone free cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $339 million. This free cash flow increase was the result of bonus depreciation that ONEOK recorded due to the enactment of recent federal income tax legislation.
Bonus depreciation will continue to provide us with benefits in 2011, more on that in a minute. By virtue of ONEOK’s general partner interest and significant ownership position, ONEOK received $304 million in distributions from the partnership for 2010, a 9% increase from 2009.
At the partnership’s estimated distribution level as detailed in the 2011 guidance, ONEOK will receive approximately $328 million in distributions for 2011, an 8% increase over 2010. As a reminder, ONEOK’s income taxes on the distributions from the limited partner units it owns are deferred which contributes to the strong free cash flow that ONEOK generates.
ONEOK liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the fourth quarter and on a stand-alone basis, we had $127 million in short-term debt, $30 million in cash and cash equivalents and $394 million of natural gas in storage. As of today, ONEOK has repaid all of its short-term debt as we continue to pull gas from storage to meet our customers’ needs.
Our next scheduled debt maturity is in April of this year, when $400 million comes due which we will repay with cash on hand and with borrowings from our commercial paper program. Our current stand-alone, long-term debt to capitalization is 30% and our stand-alone total debt to capitalization is 40%, well below our 50-50 target.
ONEOK significant free cash flow and financial flexibility provide us with several opportunities. As a reminder, the board authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million through 2013 with an annual maximum of $300 million. At this time, we have not purchased any shares that continue to evaluate the opportunity to do so.
This authorization provides another method to return value to shareholders, however, we also remain focused on increasing our investment in ONEOK Partners, evaluating strategic acquisitions and increasing future dividends. Our 2011 guidance anticipates dividend increases of $0.04 per share, semi-annually during 2011, the first of which, ONEOK’s Board of Directors approved a $0.04 per share increased last month to $0.52 per share, representing an 86% increase since January 2006.
This most recent dividend increase is consistent with the company's expected 50% to 60% dividend increase between 2011 and 2013. Last month, ONEOK issued its 2011 net income guidance in the range of $325 million to $360 million reflecting higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partner segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment.
The financial guidance reflects stand-alone free cash flow of $235 million to $275 million, which also includes the benefit from the bonus depreciation, I described earlier. This range does not reflect any anticipated share repurchases, so obviously, if we were to repurchase shares under our authorized program, free cash flow would be reduced.
Now, Rob Martinovich will provide an update on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Let's begin with our distribution segment. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were lower due to the exploration of the 2009 capital recovery mechanism in Oklahoma, recognized in the same period last year, offsetting thos",1781,"Thanks Curtis and good morning everyone. Let's begin with our distribution segment. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were lower due to the exploration of the 2009 capital recovery mechanism in Oklahoma, recognized in the same period last year, offsetting those for higher margins from the new rates approved in our 2009 Oklahoma rated case.
Expenses were higher due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred, integrity management program costs in Oklahoma now recovered in base rates. Natural gas volumes sold by the distribution segment were lower in the fourth quarter, due to warmer weather compared with the same period in 2009. However, this decrease was moderated by weather normalization mechanisms.
Year-to-date operating income was up approximately $5 million, compared with 2009. due primarily to the new rates in Oklahoma, plus increased margins from higher natural gas shale sales volumes and other successful rate outcomes in all three states offset partially by a decrease in retail marketing margins. Expenses were higher, due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity management program costs in Oklahoma.
By design, the new Oklahoma rate structure reduces volumetric sensitivity by increasing fixed fees. This segments quarterly earnings pattern during 2010 experience less of a drop in earnings in the second and third quarter compared to the prior years. With the lack of any large rate cases of filings, we expect the pattern for 2011 to be relatively similar to 2010.
Approximately two-thirds of our total margin comes from our residential customers with 73% fixed and 27% volume sensitive. In addition, a significant amount of our volumetric sensitive margin is stabilized by normal usage patterns and weather normalization mechanisms. This segments retail business had a difficult year, down approximately $8 million in margin from 2009 due primarily to the lack of price volatility that resulted in fewer customers locking in their natural gas price and lower volumes due to both warmer and wetter weather.
In addition, expenses were up approximately $3 million due to the consolidation of administrative functions from Topeka to Tulsa and other one-time expenses. The midpoint for the 2011 distribution segment operating income guidance is $231 million, compared with $226 million for 2010. We expect minimal customer growth and relatively small margin increases from rate activities planned in 2011.
Now, a brief regulatory update beginning in Oklahoma. A joint stipulation and settlement agreement was filed on February 10 for the parties agreed on the terms of an Oklahoma natural gas demand portfolio of conservation and energy efficiency programs totaling approximately $11 million annually and authorizes the recovery of cost and performance incentives through the performance-based rate structure.
This settlement agreement was presented to the administrative law judge on February 18. We took the matter under advisement. The administrative law judge's recommendation will be submitted to the Oklahoma co-operation commission for final consideration. In March, Oklahoma natural gas will submit its first annual rate filing related to the performance-based rates in Oklahoma that were put in place in January 2010.
To refresh your memory, this performance-based rate structure allows for a 75 basis point band above and below the authorized return of 10.5%. In this rate case, several writers including capital recovery were moved to base rates. Future rate adjustments are anticipated to be on a smaller scale than in the past depending on our actual returns.
Working with other Kansas utilities, the Kansas Corporation staff and the citizen’s utility rate payer board, a joint report was filed proposing acceptable and reasonable reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions in lieu of potential affiliate and refinancing rules and regulations. The Kansas Corporation commission approved the filing on December 3.
Also in December, the Kansas Corporation commission approved a $1.7 million increase in Kansas gas services, gas system reliability surcharge effective January 2011. In Texas, we filed an appeal with the railroad commission of Texas on May 12 to increase rates by $5.3 million in our El Paso service area after the El Paso city Council denied our rate request.
Subsequently, rate case expenses were placed into a separate docket which effectively reduced the requested increase of $4.4 million. On December 14, the railroad commission of Texas approved a base rate increase of $850,000 annually, which has been implemented and $850,000 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense plus, the recovery of annual pipeline integrity expenditures via a separate writer.
On January 7, we filed a motion for rehearing urging the rail road commission of Texas to reconsider several issues including the redesign in our El Paso service area. This morning, the commission denied our motion for rehearing.
Lastly, an update on the railroad commission of Texas proposed rulemaking procedure on the replacement of steel natural gas service lines. Our first draft of the steel service line replacement rule was noted on last fall. Texas gas service along with a number of other utilities provided written comments in response to the proposal.
The commission has taken comments from industry into consideration in a proposed final rule, which we believe both improves the clarity of their expectations and will enhance pipeline safety. We do not anticipate any material changes to our ongoing infrastructure upgrade efforts.
Our final vote on the proposed rule is expected this morning by the commission. Any capital expenditures impact associated with replacing lines would be recovered through the regulatory process.
We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by efficiently investing our capital in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. In 2011, we expect to invest approximately $25 million to continue installation of automated meters in select residential communities.
The target areas are in Oklahoma and Texas based on the quickest recovery and return on capital in combination with the areas of greatest expense savings. This investment follows our 2010 investment of $31 million for the installation of automated meters in Tulsa and Oklahoma city. As a result, almost half of Oklahoma natural residential customers have automated meters.
These meters provide quicker, safer and more efficient greetings and a net reduction in expenses while allowing us to earn a return on these investments, creating a win-win for customers and the company. Now, let's turn to energy services.
As expected, our fourth-quarter results were lower compared with the same quarter in 2009. This was driven primarily by a decrease in storage withdrawals from a reduced contracted natural gas storage capacity and lower transportation margins due to narrower Mid-Continent to Gulf coast location price differentials.
Partially offset in these decreases was an increase in our premium services revenues due primarily to the decrease cost in providing the services due to the warmer weather in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Full year 2010 operating income was $131 million, up $7 million compared with 2009, due primarily to our storage margins that benefited from hedges put in place during 2009, that enabled us to capture wider, seasonal storage differentials and, our ability to capture incremental margins as a result of cold weather in the first quarter and hotter than normal weather in the summer.
Our natural gas in storage at the end of the year was about 63 Bcf, up slightly from last year's 61 Bcf. We currently have 73.6 Bcf of storage capacity under the lease and as of February 18, 2011, we had approximately 27.1 Bcf of gas in storage.
As part of our ongoing realignment of storage and transportation capacity, to meet the requirements of our premium services customers, our 2012 year-end leased storage capacity target is 65 Bcf. Our 2012 year and long-term leased transportation capacity target is one Bcf per day compared with our current long-term capacity of 1.1 Bcf per day.
This capacity reduction targets those assets with lower than average unit margins. These actions will also reduce our earnings volatility and working capital requirements. Energy services operating income guidance for 2011 is $91 million. As we stated previously, the current business environment is indeed challenging.
We continue to see narrow location and seasonal storage differentials which impact the value realized on our transportation and storage positions. These narrow location differentials are primarily a result of low natural gas prices and increased pipeline capacity.
Low natural gas prices coupled with a flat forward price curve have reduced seasonal storage differentials. Our strategy is to achieve our 2011 operating income guidance include maintaining our existing premium service customers while adding new ones, maximizing earnings to reflect optimization activities, growing our market share with electric generation customers and working with producers to move their supply in constrained areas.
Seasonal storage spreads and optimization opportunities will be dependent on where storage levels end up after the first quarter heating season. For 2011, we have hedged approximately 45% of our transportation margins and 41% of our storage margins, with approximately 100% of our storage margins hedged for the first quarter.
Our general strategy is to execute hedges on both transportation and storage based on our forward view of the market and availability of market liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate our pipeline integrity efforts at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Federal and state regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain formal integrity management programs for natural gas transmission and natural gas liquid pipelines that cross high consequence areas or HCAs.
HCAs include areas with large population, navigable waterways and sensitive environmental areas. These regulations require assessments on relevant natural gas pipelines at least once every seven years while assessments on natural gas liquid pipelines are required every five years.
For our natural gas liquid pipelines, we completed all required assessments by the March 2008 deadline. Natural gas pipeline assessments which include our gas distribution and gas transmission pipelines must be completed before December 17, 2012. All of our gas pipeline assessments are scheduled to be completed within the required inspection timeframe. Also, the integrity assessment program is not limited to only those pipelines in HCAs. Monitoring and testing are done on all parts of our pipelines as appropriate to verify the safety of our operations.
Recently, as a result of the preliminary incident investigation findings from Pacific Gas and Electric San Bruno, California incident, the pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued an advisory bulletin to pipeline operators concerning the establishment of maximum allowable operating pressure or an AOP for regulated pipelines. The Advisory requires pipeline operators that rely on design, construction, inspection, testing and other related historic data in determining MAOPs to ensure the accuracy and completeness of these records. Upon issuance of this advisory bulletin ONEOK and ONEOK Partners business segments initiated and are continuing their reviews of pipeline data and documentation used to establish pipeline MAOPs.
John, this concludes my remarks.

A couple of final comments before we take your questions. As you all know, we announced a series of executive management changes last week. This is all part of our succession planning process to further develop and prepare our next generation of leaders so that they have the skills and experience to lead our continued growth and future success. While I have no plans to retire, our board and I believe strongly that we have the responsibility to our investors, our employees and other key stakeholders to make sure we have the right talent with the right skills, right experienced and a proven ability to lead in place. That is what this re-alignment was about, nothing more, nothing less.
I have great confidence in all our leaders and know they will perform great in their new roles. I’d like to sing aloud and make a few comments about Curtis, who is participating in his last conference call, as CFO. He has done an exceptional job over the last four years in the CFO role, both at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners helping us finance the partnership’s growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. His new role, leading the partnership’s natural gas business, will give him an important operating experience that will benefit him, and the Company well into the future.
I would like to congratulate Curtis on his new role and personally thank him for what he has done for the company. I know those of you listening, who know Curtis, recognize how much he has contributed to our company as our CFO. And of course, I would like to extend my congratulations to the other leaders who are moving into their new roles.
And finally, I’d like to thank our 4700 employees, whose hard work, dedication and commitment creates value everyday for our investors and customers. I thank our employees, every conference call and you may tune out my expression of appreciation knowing that it’s just a signal that we are getting ready to take questions. But, you should note that these last few weeks have been very difficult and challenging for our employees for many reasons.
Along with the typical activities associated with the year and financial closings and reports, we experienced record low temperatures and snow falls across our operating areas. Along with enterprise experiencing a fire at Mont Belvieu that resulted in our shutting our fractionator for a day, and then we had to deal with the related issues the next day, including a loss of electrical power at the fractionator that resulted in yet another short shutdown. At all times, our employees acted quickly and safely to protect our assets while meeting our customer’s needs. Day in and day out, our employees continue to rise to the occasion and meet the challenges that inevitably come their way. They do what’s required to help our customers, to meet our financial filing deadlines and to deal with adverse weather conditions. And they do so under the most challenging of circumstances, safely.
We have exceptional employees who make exceptional efforts, not just during difficult times, but every day. That’s why I take the time to thank them. I want our employees, who listen to this call, hear me tell you our investors, that I appreciate their efforts and realize that our financial and operating results are not just because of the efforts of our management team, but also because of what each and every employee contributes every day.
So, again, I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for the contributions and at this time, open it up for questions.

Those are long-term acreage dedications, percent of proceeds contract, so that is going very well.
To answer your second question, I think the opportunities we see down in Texas are primarily in the natural gas liquids business. We see opportunity to expand our presence in Mont Belvieu. I think in particular in light of some of the events we’ve seen this recently, our chances of doing that have increased. So, you know, when we look at our backlog of projects and if we specifically address Texas of the fractionation projects as a possibility, further expansions of our pipeline infrastructure that feeds the Belvieu area as well as our storage capability down there.

So, that capacity we couldn’t use to make, to make money with, we had to use that to fulfill our contractual obligations. That, as I mentioned to you several quarters ago is on us. We are the ones that lead in what we thought the increasing volumes on Arbuckle would be going into the fractionator. We’re the ones that didn’t think we fill up Arbuckle as fast as we did, so that is on us. That’s one way to think about it is that $35 million had we had the capacity would have been added dollars in 2010, relative to 2009.
The other way I think about it is, it’s also an indication of our cost of honoring contractual obligations because I guess we could have, but obviously chose not to use that fractionation capacity for our own gain and then fight it out in the courts with somebody that we shorted. But obviously that’s not something we are going to do. But so, the answer is the capacity was large and the capacity was cheap.

Well, on an ongoing basis, we have contracts coming up for renewal across all of our business units every year. And in particular in our natural gas liquids business and in our gathering and processing business which is where bulk of those renegotiations are occurring, we are seeing increased demand for capacity on our assets. And of course, that’s impacting the rates that we charge for gathering NGLs and fractionated NGLs as well as gathering and processing natural gas. So we’ve also seen the same impact on storage. So, we’re just going to continue to see that and there is going to be a tranche of uplift or upgrade, if you will, every year.

We appreciate your continued interested and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me today are Rob Martinovich, Chief Financial Officer of both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners; Terry Spencer, ONEOK Partners’ Chief Operating Officer; and Pierce Norton, ONEOK’s Chief Operating Officer.
Before we begin, I would like to make a few comments about our announcement two days ago to build a new NGL pipeline and fractionator. Then, I will briefly review our first quarter performance, discuss our 2011 earnings guidance, turn things over to Rob, Terry and Pierce to review our financial and operating results in more detail, and then make a few final comments before taking your questions.
Our decision to build a new pipeline between Medford, Oklahoma and Mont Belvieu, Texas and a new fractionators at Mont Belvieu was driven by a market demand, in particular from producers, processors and petrochemical companies. This new pipeline project will alleviate the infrastructure constraints that currently exists for producers and processors in the Mid-Continent and limit the ability of NGLs to get from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast.
We will also build additional fractionation capacity on the Gulf Coast to serve the growing NGL feedstock needs of petrochemical companies. Both projects are yet another extension of our NGL infrastructure and will provide producers, processors, and customers with the critical services needed to monetize their respective investments and meet their customers’ needs.
Terry will provide additional information about these new NGL investments and we will answer your questions later in the call. Now, let’s talk about our first quarter results. We had a successful quarter at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, while continuing to meet some challenges in the marketplace. ONEOK Partners first quarter performance was exceptional, posting an 80% earnings increase from last year’s first quarter. These strong results were led by our natural gas liquids business, which benefited from favorable natural gas liquids price differentials and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available to use for optimization activities.
In spite of extremely cold weather and record snowfalls as well as some NGL market disruptions caused by fire at a competitor’s facility, our assets and people performed extremely well. The partnership continues to benefit from the new assets built during our $2 billion growth program that was completed in 2009. And we are executing on the next tranche of growth projects that Terry will discuss later.
Our ONEOK Distribution segment performed as expected, but was adversely impacted by higher operating costs, primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses in the quarter that Rob will explain in a few minutes. Energy services had a good quarter in a very difficult industry environment. Seasonal storage and location price differentials remained extremely narrow and were mitigated somewhat by our ability to place hedges. As we stated in our news release, we are reaffirming our financial guidance for the year at ONEOK and at ONEOK Partners. We believe the continued strong performance at ONEOK Partners will offset lower expected results and energy services. Due to current and projected market conditions, we now expect energy services 2011 operating income to be at the low end of the earnings range of $75 million to $125 million, which is the range we announced in 2009 with our plan to reduce our contracted storage and transportation capacity.
Seasonal storage and location differentials are not where we expected them to be, and with the continued oversupply of natural gas, we don’t expect them to improve significantly during the rest of the year, absent of course a weather-related event. Pierce will explain energy services performance and outlook in more detail.
Rob will now review ONEOK Partners’ financial highlights, and then we will ask Terry to review the partnership’s operating performance. Rob?

In the first quarter ONEOK Partners reported net income of $151 million or $1.16 per unit compared with last year’s first quarter net income of $84 million of $0.57 per unit, an 80% year-over-year increase. Distributable cash flow in the first quarter was $185 million, a 51% increase compared with first quarter 2010, resulted in a coverage ratio of 1.30 times. We reaffirmed the partnership’s 2011 net income guidance in the range of $525 million to $575 million, with distributable cash flow in the range of $625 million to $675 million. We expect the partnership’s interest expense to be approximately $12 million higher compared with what we announced in January. This amount will be offset by a projected $12 million increase in equity earnings for Overland Pass Pipeline. This line item shift reflects financing of Overland Pass Pipeline at the ONEOK Partners level versus at the joint venture level that we assumed in our initial 2011 financial guidance
Pending Board approval, the partnership anticipates increasing the distribution of $0.01 per quarter for the remainder of 2011, building on the first quarter of 2011 distribution increase to $1.15 per unit to be paid this month, which marks the 18th distribution increase since ONEOK became sole general partner five years ago, a 44% increase.
We have hedges in place to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the naturals gas gathering and processing segment, which is the most sensitive to commodity price changes. For the remainder of 2011, we have hedged 68% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes at an average of $1.40 per gallon and 78% of our expected natural gas equity volumes at $5.60 per MMBtu.
For 2012, approximately 52% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes are hedged at an average price of $1.82 per gallon. For 2013, we have hedged approximately 5% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes at an average price of $2.55 per gallon. In January, we completed an offering of $1.3 billion of senior notes consisting of $650 million of five-year senior notes at a coupon of 3.25% and $650 million of 30-year senior notes at a coupon of 6.125%, generating net proceeds of approximately $1.28 billion. As a result of the debt offering, we repaid all of our outstanding commercial paper and the $225 million senior notes that were due in March 2011 and we will use the remaining funds for general partnership purposes, including our 2011 capital spending program.
At the end of the first quarter, we had $617 million [ph] in cash and no commercial paper for borrowings outstanding under the $1 billion revolving credit agreement that expires in 2012. On March 31st, the partnership had a debt-to-capital ratio of 54% and debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2.
The majority of the Sterling III and Mont Belvieu-2 projects estimated capital expenditures will be in 2012 and 2013, with a minimal amount in 2011. Therefore, we do not anticipate any additional financing this year, but we will continue to monitor the capital markets and be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities.
Now, Terry will review the partnership’s operating performance.

The partnership had an exceptional first quarter. Operating income increased almost 50% compared with the first quarter of 2010, driven primarily by higher optimization margins in the natural gas liquids segment due to higher NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for NGL optimization activities as a result of a large frac-only contract that expired in September of last year.
Earnings also increased as a result of contract renegotiations for our exchange service activities in our NGL business as well as higher commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. I will briefly discuss the operating performance for the three segments, followed by a review of the current NGL market environment and close with a status report on our growth projects.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s first quarter financial results were higher than the same period in 2010 due primarily to higher net realized commodity prices and changes in contract terms. Processed volumes were down slightly due primarily to adjustments to drilling schedules by Western Oklahoma producer and weather-related outages offset partially by increased drilling activity in the Bakken Shale.
Gathered volumes were lower due to continued production declines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, adjustments to drilling schedules by adjustments to drilling schedules by a Western Oklahoma producer and weather-related outages, offset partially by increased drilling activity in the Bakken Shale.
Although natural gas gathered and processed volumes were down in the quarter, we still expect to achieve the volume estimates we communicated to you at the beginning of the year, processed volumes to be up 11% and gathered volumes to be up 5%, with growth in the Cana-Woodford Shale more than offsetting declines in the Powder River Basin at Wyoming.
Now, moving to our natural gas pipeline segment. First quarter results were slightly lower. Transportation margins were down approximately 4% due to decreased contracted activity on Mid-Western and less interruptible volumes due to narrower regional natural gas price differentials. As a reminder, approximately 84% of our pipeline’s subscribed capacity directly serves end users such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. And approximately 90% of our pipeline and storage capacity is contracted under long-term firm contracts.
Northern Border’s earnings were up almost 40% due to an increase in contracted capacity from continued strong Mid-West market demand, with most if not all of Northern Border’s capacity contracted through March of 2012. Now, let’s move to our natural gas liquids segment. The segment benefited from more available fractionation and transportation capacity for optimization activities and favorable NGL price differentials. Contract renegotiations associated with our exchange service activities also helped earnings.
The first quarter Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential was $0.15 per gallon compared with $0.08 for the same period in 2010. We fractionated approximately 488,000 net barrels per day, almost 90% of capacity, further evidence of how tight frac capacity. We expect it to remain tight, but gradually improve as new frac capacity comes online over the next couple of years.
Fractionated volumes were relatively flat in the quarter due primarily to weather-related outages in the Mid-Continent and an unplanned outage at Mont Belvieu. NGLs transported on our gathering lines were 397,000 barrels per day and reflect the exclusion of Overland Pass volumes because of its deconsolidation last September. If you back out the Overland Pass barrels for the comparable quarter last year, volumes were up as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent.
Arbuckle volumes have increased over 150,000 barrels per day. Current Arbuckle capacity is approximately 180,000 barrels per day, increasing to 240,000 barrels per day in 2012. The pipeline remains well positioned to accommodate NGL volume growth from Rockies, Mid-Continent and Barnett Shale production growth for the rest of the year, helped by more fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu when the fractionation service agreement with Targa gives us access to 60,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity.
Arbuckle Pipeline has emerged as a key connector of Mid-Continent NGL production to Gulf Coast NGL fractionation. Accordingly, Arbuckle has expanded our Mid-Continent to Gulf Coast optimization capability and allowed us to capture more location class differential opportunities. However, Arbuckle capacity is primarily earmarked for NGL supply growth from new natural gas processing plant development in the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle unconventional resource plays. We will talk more about Mid-Continent to Gulf Coast capacity needs in a moment.
Now, a brief summary of the NGL market. On the demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to find ways to consume more ethane due to its strong price advantage oil-based feedstocks. Accordingly, we see strong ethane demand from the petrochemical as the ethane to crude ratio remains relatively low and regional processing and NGL infrastructure expansions will continue to be needed. The recent announcements of petrochemical plant restarts expansions and development of new world-class petrochemical plants is further evidence of the growing need over the next three to five years for price advantaged light end NGLs such as ethane and propane for feedstocks.
On the supply, producers continued focus on liquids-rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Granite Wash, and the Eagle Ford Shales. While NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, much of the growth and volumes offsets the inherent natural decline rate of the base natural gas production, which exceeds 20% per year and getting steeper according to some experts.
Now, a few comments on the sale of several growth projects. On Monday, we announced we are building a new NGL pipeline and fractionators. These projects, the 570-mile Sterling III Pipeline and the Mont Belvieu-2 fractionators will provide greatly needed infrastructure will alleviate capacity constraints between Conway and Mont Belvieu as well as provide capacity to serve Mid-Continent NGL supply growth. The new Sterling III pipeline doubles our current NGL capacity between Medford, Oklahoma and the Mont Belvieu markets. In conjunction with the reconfiguration of the existing Sterling I and II pipelines, the new pipeline will enhance our ability to transport unfractionated NGLs and products by providing us the flexibility to move multiple products through either of the Sterling Pipelines. Given our view of the new NGL supply development in the Mid-Continent and elsewhere, we are confident in our ability to fill the pipeline and our fractionator, which would come online in 2013.
Now, an update on our previously announced projects. As we execute on another major capital spending program, we remain focused on applying the lessons learned from our last series of projects to ensure better cost and schedule management. While our contractors are important to the overall success of these projects, it’s our employees who are the difference makers during the construction phase, and we plan to have more of our employees on the ground this time around.
We have also applied our lessons learnt to the regulatory and route planning process. We have used fixed price turnkey construction contracts on all three processing plants, have already purchased the steel pipe for the Bakken NGL pipeline, minimized winter construction periods and have a more favorable construction labor environment, which helps keep costs down.
That does not mean we won’t face potential challenges with weather and construction labor housing and other issues that inevitably surface during construction. Accordingly, we have included contingency costs in our estimates. In aggregate, we plan to invest approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in Bakken Shale related projects to build midstream infrastructure, allowing producers who have dedicated their volumes to our systems to fully monetize their oil and natural gas reserves. Acreage dedicated to our systems under long-term gas supply contracts has grown steadily to approximately 1.7 million acres today.
Our gathering and processing growth projects include three 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas processing plants, the Garden Creek plant and related infrastructure and the Stateline I and II plants, which will quadruple our processing capacity in the region to nearly 400 million cubic per day. We are full steam ahead constructing the Garden Creek plant and are progressing through the permitting process for the Stateline I and II plants. And we are currently on schedule and within our proved capital budget.
Our NGL infrastructure projects related to the Bakken growth which include the 500-plus miles 60,000 barrels per day Bakken Pipeline are in various stages of development, engineering, design, procurement and write-away acquisition, and all are progressing within our expected timelines and capital budgets.
In addition to growth projects we have already announced, we are continuing to evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects including investments in natural gas pipelines and NGL storage facilities.
John, that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $130 million or $1.19 per diluted share compared with $155 million or $1.44 per diluted share in the same period last year. Operating costs were higher primarily due to increased share-based compensation",589,"Thanks John. ONEOK’s first quarter net income was $130 million or $1.19 per diluted share compared with $155 million or $1.44 per diluted share in the same period last year. Operating costs were higher primarily due to increased share-based compensation costs as well as increased employee benefit costs and higher property taxes in the ONEOK Partners segment.
Share-based compensation costs include stocks issued to employees and Directors under the company’s long-term incentive plans and our employee stock award program that awards one share of stock each time ONEOK stock closes at or above a new $1 benchmark. The program began in 2004 to reward employees for their contributions to the company’s success. Since then, we have awarded 44 shares of stock and in the first quarter, we awarded 11 shares of stock at a cost of $5 million.
ONEOK’s first quarter 2011 standalone free cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $117 million. This includes the benefit of bonus depreciation we recorded as a result of federal income tax legislation. Bonus depreciation will continue to benefit us throughout 2011. As general partner and significant limited partner owner, ONEOK received $80 million in distributions from the partnership for the first quarter of 2011, a 10% increase from the same period last year.
At the partnership’s planned 2011 distribution level, ONEOK will receive approximately $328 million in distribution this year, an 8% increase over 2010. ONEOK’s income tax is on the distributions from the LP units it owns are deferred, contributing to ONEOK’s strong free cash flow. ONEOK’s liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the first quarter, on a standalone basis, we had no short-term debt, $1.2 billion available on our existing credit facilities, $253 million of cash and cash equivalents and $174 million of natural gas and storage.
In April 2011, we repaid $400 million of maturing senior notes of available cash and borrowings from our commercial paper program. And last month, we completed a new five-year $1.2 billion unsecured senior revolving credit facility replacing one that was to expire in June. Our standalone long-term and total debt-to-capitalization ratios at March were 38%. ONEOK’s significant free cash flow and excellent liquidity position give us tremendous financial flexibility.
As you know, the Board authorized a $750 million share repurchase program for 2013 with an annual maximum of $300 million. To date, we have not purchased any shares, but continued to evaluate the opportunity to do so. This authorization is another option to return value to shareholders. However, we also have other alternatives such as acquisitions, increasing our investment in ONEOK Partners or further increasing dividends.
Our 2011 guidance anticipates dividend increases of $0.04 per share twice a year during 2011. We increased the dividend in January and the Board will consider another one in July. This is consistent with our forecasted 50% to 60% dividend increase between 2011 and 2013. We are reaffirming ONEOK’s 2011 net income guidance in the range of $325 million to $360 million. We expect higher earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment that will offset the lower expected earnings in the energy services segment that John mentioned earlier.
Our financial guidance reflects standalone free cash flow of $235 million to $275 million, which includes the benefit from the bonus depreciation I mentioned earlier. This range does not include any share repurchases. So, obviously, if we were to repurchase shares under our authorized program, free cash flow would be reduced.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.

First quarter 2011 earnings were lower primarily because of higher operating costs. As Rob mentioned in his comments, operating expenses were higher this quarter due to share-based compensation costs. Because the distribution segment has most of ONEOK’s employees, it experienced the largest portion of the share-based compensation cost, which accounted for $4.6 million of the quarter-over-quarter operating expense difference.
Depreciation expense was higher due to our investment in automated meter reading devices in Oklahoma last year. We also had higher regulatory amortization expense because of various revenue writer recovery mechanisms, net margin was relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year. Natural gas volumes were lower in the first quarter due to warmer weather compared with the same period in 2010, however, this decrease was moderated by weather normalization mechanism.
Now, a brief regulatory update. In February, Oklahoma Natural Gas submitted its first annual performance-based rate filing. The application does not seek any modifications to customer rates that were put in place in January 2010, since Oklahoma Natural Gas’ return on equity is within the range approved by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Texas Gas Service made its annual gas reliability infrastructure program filing in the city of Austin and surrounding communities for approximately $1.6 million. If approved, the new rates will become effective in June.
We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. We expect to invest $25 million this year to continue installing automated meters. To date, we have completed 31% of this year’s planned installations in areas of Oklahoma and Texas that will result in the quickest recovery of expenses and return on capital as well as reduce expenses. Our 2010 investment of $31 million to install automated meters in Tulsa and Oklahoma City resulted in approximately 57% of Oklahoma Natural’s residential customers having automated meters. These meters are safer, more accurate and more efficient, while allowing us to earn a return on these investments, creating a win-win for the customers and the company.
Now, let’s turn to energy services. As expected our first quarter results were lower compared with the same quarter in 2010. This was driven primarily by lower realized seasonal storage natural gas price differentials, a decrease in transportation margins net of hedging, predominantly due to narrower Mid-Continent to Gulf Coast price differentials and a reduction in premium service margins.
Let me provide you some perspective on the market this year versus last year. We experienced wider seasonal storage price differentials in the first quarter last year compared with the first quarter this year. We also were able to place more hedges on locational differentials affecting our transportation positions for last year’s first quarter. Because there was ample liquidity in the marketplace in 2008, in early 2009 with these hedges in place for 2010. Since then, liquidity and volatility have been extremely limited and it has been difficult to place forward hedges.
This year’s business environment is extremely challenging. The increase in transportation top line capacity in recent years combined with an oversupply of situation from shale plays has narrowed significantly location and seasonal differentials from where they have been in the past years. As John mentioned earlier, we expect our 2011 operating income to be towards the low end of the $75 million to $125 million range we announced when we began our transportation and storage capacity realignment effort in 2009. For the remainder of 2011, we have hedged approximately 47% of our transportation margins and 54% of our storage margins. We plan to execute additional transportation and storage hedges based on the forward view of the market and the availability of market liquidity.
We have a plan to deliver earnings despite the flat forward gas price curves and low volatility. We plan to maintain our existing premium service customers while adding new ones, maximize earnings through effective optimization activities, grow our market share over the electric generation customers and work for producers to nuclear supply in constrained areas. We continue to make progress on realignment of our storage and transportation capacities to meet the requirements of our premium service customers.
As of April 30th, we currently have 72.6 Bcf of storage capacity under lease close to our goal of 65 Bcf by the end of 2012. And 1 Bcf per day of long-term transportation capacity with a goal of 1.1, 1.0 Bcf [ph] per day by the end of 2012.
A quick update on pipeline safety. At the beginning of this year, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued an advisory bulletin about the establishment of maximum allowable operating pressure or MAOP for regulated pipelines. This advisory required pipeline operators to rely on design construction, inspection, testing and other related historic data to determine MAOPs to verify and validate the accuracy and completeness of these records. All of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners business segments recently initiated their reviews for pipeline data and documentation used to establish our pipeline MAOPs. And we will be validating that information as we go forward with this process.
John, that concludes my remarks.

Now, a couple of final comments before we take your questions. We are confident of our 2011 financial guidance ranges for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
We expect ONEOK Partners’ strong performance in the first quarter with expected volume growth to continue throughout the year and offset lower anticipated results in energy services. As Pierce mentioned, energy services has a path forward in a very difficult market consisting of tighter seasonal storage and basis spreads and lower price volatility, all due to the oversupply of natural gas because of the emergence of shale plays.
However, the shale plays have benefited ONEOK Partners, affording us the opportunity to invest capital to build critical gathering and processing and natural gas liquids infrastructure, to serve natural gas producers, processors and customers. The abundance of natural gas has also brought price stability to consumers making natural gas a preferred and environmentally attractive fuel for home heating, electric power generation and in certain applications, transportation.
Lower natural gas prices also make the NGLs coming from these shale plays very attractive feedstocks for the petrochemical industry. As illustrated by the expansions Terry just mentioned, that’s good for us, but more importantly, it’s good for the country. And the overall global competitiveness of the U.S. petrochemical industry and why we are so enthusiastic about natural gas liquids supply and demand.
We are on track, both cost and timing with our projects. As Terry mentioned, we have applied the lessons learned from our first set of projects, which will benefit from our overall project execution. In all of our projects which now total almost $3 billion with the new ones we announced this week are consistent with our vision to create value for our customers and investors, enabling us to grow earnings and provide our owners with attractive returns. And of course, finally, I would like to thank our employees across more than a dozen states for their dedication and commitment, which create value everyday for our investors and customers.
I appreciate their efforts and know that our success as a company depends on their contributions. At this time, we are now ready to take your questions.

Those arrangements can come in a number of different forms. They can address pricing, they can address dedication. Those are the kinds of conversations we have not had with them historically. They typically have been a short-term buyer of ethane. Given these large capital investments, it absolutely takes a long-term view. They have to have a long-term point of view in order to make these investments work. And they clearly are getting more and more comfortable with supply. I think that some of this talk about longer term contracts may be a bit overblown. I think they have and are getting more confident in the supply picture, so they don’t absolutely have to have long-term supply contracts for ethane to make these things work. I think they are kind of sort of realizing that.
They are getting more confident as the NGL infrastructure like these projects we recently announced continue to get built. That is the endorsement of the supply, that’s what’s providing them with some comfort. So, clearly they are thinking differently than they have in the past that’s of course beneficial to us.

We appreciate your continued investment and interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me are Rob Martinovich, Chief Financial Officer for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, who will review our quarterly results and updated guidance; Terry Spencer, ONEOK Partners’ Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss the partnerships’ operating results; and Pierce Norton, ONEOK’s Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss the performance of our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services segments.
As we begin the call this morning, in my remarks, I will provide some perspective on our second quarter financial results and updated guidance, and discuss the impact of our share based compensation programs on our results.
I’ll also comment on the acquisition market in the context of the recent Southern Union transaction, and then conclude with an update on our efforts to deal with a recently enacted Oklahoma law requiring us to have a classified board.
So, let’s start with the second quarter financial performance. ONEOK Partners’ second quarter performance was exceptional. Our natural gas liquids business continues to benefit from favorable NGL price differentials and by having more fractionation and transportation capacity available to use for optimization activities.
While the wider natural gas liquid differentials played a key role in the natural gas liquids business exceeding our expectations, it is more important to note that the base business, the fee-based exchange services business, exceeded our plan as we continue to add new NGL volumes to our system.
The point is that our natural gas liquids business, in particular our key fee-based earnings component, exchange services, performed well without those unprecedented wide differentials. That is important because we recognize that as we and others add transportation capacity between the two NGL market centers, the bases will contract.
While we have built a business capable of capturing the upside present in the market, we have most importantly built one that creates growing value based on providing fee-based services to the market. It has been gratifying to see our investments and strategies pay off for our customers and investors, not only in the first half of the year but also in our expectations for the full year and beyond.
At the ONEOK level, we believe the partnership’s continued strong performance will cover the shortfall we are experiencing in other parts of the company this year. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment performed as we expected.
However, the largest portion of the share-based costs, the company incurred in the first half of the year, were allocated to this segment because it has the largest number of employees. This resulted in lower second quarter earnings and an adjustment to the 2011 operating income guidance in the distribution segment. Without these expenses, this segment would be meeting its plan. More on the share-based expenses in a moment.
Energy Services’ quarterly results were disappointing. While the Energy Services team has worked hard and done a good job, realigning its leased storage and transportation capacity to meet the needs of premium service customers to reduce earnings volatility, extremely challenging market conditions have more than offset their efforts. Low natural gas prices and volatility due to a supply surplus as a result of shale gas plays have tightened seasonal storage and location price differentials to unprecedentedly narrow levels.
While we are not pleased with Energy Services’ results or its revised expectations, they are based on the current market with low prices and narrow basis differentials resulting in our not being able to meet the original guidance for this segment. Pierce will update you on our efforts to address these issues.
Despite our reduced expectations for Energy Services, we are confident in our ability to achieve our revised 2011 guidance at ONEOK. We believe that the continued performance at the partnership will offset the weaker performance at energy services.
Now some perspective on the share-based costs that affected our second quarter results, primarily in the Natural Gas Distribution segment. As you know, the ONEOK share price has increased significantly this year.
Our employee stock award plan awards one share of stock to each employee whenever we hit an all-time high in $1 increments. This program is part of our total compensation package and was created to reward employees for their contributions in creating shareholder value and to align their interest with shareholders.
Since the program’s inception in 2004, we’ve awarded 50 shares of ONEOK stock to employees and 20 shares so far this year, 19 in the first six months and a 20th share in early July. It is important to note that employees went three and a half years from May of 2007 until December of 2010 without an award.
As the cost for these awards amounted this year, a suggestion was made to me to terminate the program to address these rising costs and unplanned expenses. We considered this suggestion but decided to continue the program for several reasons.
First, while the expense is not insignificant, it is a small price to pay for the value our employees have created, which is more than $2 billion in share price appreciation since the beginning of this year. Second, the program did what it was supposed to do, align employees’ interest with shareholders.
And finally and perhaps more importantly, what would it say about us as a company and as a leadership team if when the program starts to significantly reward employees, we terminate it. It’s our leadership teams’ responsibility to find ways to overcome these costs and with the help of our employees, we’re looking for ways to do just that through cost savings or revenue growth within the company.
At this time, Rob will now review ONEOK Partners’ financial highlights and then he will hand it off to Terry, so that he may review the partnership’s operating performance. Rob?

In the second quarter, ONEOK Partners reported a 63% year-over-year increase in net income. Distributable cash flow increased 48% compared with the second quarter last year resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.44 times.
In July, ONEOK Partners completed a two-for-one split of the partnership’s common units and Class B units. This split enhances liquidity and makes our units more accessible to a broader base of potential investors.
Also in July, we increased the distribution by $0.01 per unit on the split adjusted basis or $0.02 per unit on a pre-split basis, twice the amount we had in 2011 guidance due to the strong NGL performance that Terry will discuss in a moment. Pending board approval, the partnership now anticipates increase in the distribution $0.01 per unit per quarter for the remainder of 2011, building on the second quarter 2011 distribution increase which marks the 19th increase since ONEOK became sole general partner five years ago, a 46% increase.
We’ve updated the partnership’s 2011 earnings guidance to a range of $630 million to $660 million to reflect higher than anticipated earnings in the natural gas liquids segment. We increased our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $1.3 billion to reflect the partnership’s purchase of the Bushton plant leased equipment for approximately $94 million, plus acceleration of G&P infrastructure projects in the Bakken Shale. This breaks down to $1.2 billion in growth capital and $102 million in maintenance capital.
We now estimate the partnership’s 2011 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $735 million to $765 million compared with its previous range of $625 million to $675 million.
We are still confident in the three-year financial plan guidance on EBITDA and distribution growth we provided last October and expect to update that three-year plan in September at our Investor Day. We will also release our 2012 financial guidance at that time.
We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, which is the most sensitive to commodity price changes. Our news release contains information on the updated hedges.
At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $432.2 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 54% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.85.
Earlier this week, ONEOK Partners entered into a new $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in August 2016, expanding the capacity and flexibility of our previous agreement. Finally, we still do not anticipate any additional financing this year, but we’ll continue to monitor the capital markets and be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities.
Now, Terry will review the partnership’s operating performance.

The partnership had an exceptional second quarter. Operating income increased almost 40%, driven primarily by higher optimization margins in the natural gas liquids segment due to wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, due to increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activity.
Earnings also increased as a result of contract renegotiations for some of our NGL exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins in our NGL business, as well as higher commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
This morning, I’ll discuss our operating performance and updated 2011 guidance, discuss our outlook of the NGL markets, and close with a status report on our growth projects.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s second quarter financial results were higher than the same period in 2010 due primarily to higher net realized commodity prices and changes in contract terms.
We increased slightly this segment’s operating income guidance for 2011 reflecting, lower than expected gathering and processing volumes compared with our original 2011 guidance. Offsetting the operating income reduction are higher earnings from our equity investments.
We now expect processed volumes to be up 3% over last year and gathered volumes to be down 3% compared with last year. These estimates reflect adjustments in drilling schedules by a Western Oklahoma producer, weather-related outages and continued declines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, offset by volume growth in the Williston basin and Cana-Woodford. The Powder River volumes represent approximately 12% of our total gathered volumes but generate less than 4% of our gathering and processing segment’s net margin.
The natural gas pipeline segment’s second quarter results were lower compared with the second quarter last year due to increased operating expenses and lower transportation margins from narrower regional natural gas price differentials that decreased interruptible volumes and contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission.
Northern Border’s earning were up more than 30% as it maintained its competitive position by transporting Canadian sourced supply to markets in the Midwestern United States. Most, if not all, of Northern Border’s capacity is contracted through October 2012.
We reduced this segment’s operating income to reflect narrower natural gas price location differentials that have lowered the demand for interruptible transportation services on Midwestern and on the balance of our transmission pipelines.
We do expect higher earnings from our 50% interest in Northern Border pipeline. Almost 85% of our wholly-owned pipelines’ subscribed capacity serves end users such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. Approximately 82% of our pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity is contracted under firm long-term contracts.
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to benefit from more available fractionation and transportation capacity for optimization activities and favorable NGL price differentials. Contract re-negotiations associated with our exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins from wider price spreads between normal butane and isobutane also helped earnings.
Excluding the impact from these favorable differentials, our base business exceeded our expectations. We fractionated approximately 541,000 barrels per day including barrels fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter. We expect fractionation capacity to remain tight but gradually become more available as new frac capacity comes on line over the next few years.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were 432,000 barrels per day and exclude the Overland Pass volumes that were de-consolidated last September. If you back out the Overland Pass barrels for the second quarter of last year, NGL gathered volumes were up 15% and up 9% compared with the first quarter as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent.
Arbuckle Pipeline volumes have increased more than 160,000 barrels per day versus current capacity of 180,000 barrels per day that will increase to 240,000 barrels per day in 2012.
We increased our operating income guidance for this segment significantly to reflect higher than expected NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials and increased NGL transportation capacity available for our optimization activities. For the remainder of 2011, we have assumed a $0.15 per gallon Conway to Mont Belvieu average ethane price differential.
Now, an update on our projects. In May, we announced plans to build the 570-mile Sterling III pipeline and the 75,000 barrel per day Mont Belvieu II fractionators, enabling us to serve the rapid NGL supply growth within our footprint. Producers continued to aggressively drill in a number of unconventional NGL-rich resource plays in the Mid-Continent and Rockies.
As a result, many new natural gas processing plants are being constructed in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to process NGL-rich natural gas that’s being produced in the Cana-Woodford Shale, the Granite Wash, the Woodford Shale, and now the emerging Mississippian Lime formation. Development also continues in the Rockies, specifically in the Bakken and Niobrara plays.
Due to this strong supply growth, NGL prices in the Mid-Continent market center at Conway, Kansas, are significantly lower relative to prices at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Current NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu for ethane exceed $0.20 per gallon. These wide differentials have steadily trended upward climbing from about $0.03 per gallon in 2005 to more than $0.15 per gallon for much of this year.
Another factor driving the wide location price differential is strong ethane demands from the petrochemical sector located primarily on the Gulf Coast due to the price advantage ethane has had over other feedstocks.
A number of petrochemical companies have announced additional heavy-to-light feed conversions, expansions of existing plants and construction of new world scale petrochemical plants on the Gulf Coast that will add more than 400,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane cracking capacity by 2017.
Consequently, pipeline capacity between the two NGL market centers remains constrained. NGL producers need more capacity to accommodate their growing NGL volumes and the producers supplying their plants continue to drill in NGL-rich plays. The current wide NGL price differential exceeds the level necessary to support a new pipeline.
As new capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu is developed, we believe the price differentials will narrow considerably, possibly to the $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon range over the next few years. We believe that now is the ideal time to contract capacity on a new pipeline, while NGL price location differentials are high and demand for capacity is high.
Our existing Sterling I and II Pipelines, which transport NGL purity products, are near capacity today. And our Arbuckle Pipeline, which transports unfractionate NGLs from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast, is expected to approach its capacity in 2012.
Our new Sterling III Pipeline will nearly double our existing NGL transportation capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu and provide our NGL infrastructure with added flexibility as all three Sterling pipelines will be able to transport either unfractionated NGLs or purity NGL products.
The Mont Belvieu II fractionator is integral to our strategy of providing our customers with a full range of services. We received our air quality permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and construction is now underway. We continue to secure supply commitments for both Sterling III and Mont Belvieu II and expect to have substantially all of the available capacity committed well before these assets go into service.
Turning to our Bakken projects. We are investing approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion to build three new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure and the 500 plus mile, 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and the Overland Pass pipeline.
Despite flooding and highway restrictions, our projects remain on schedule. We expect our first processing plant, Garden Creek, to be in service by the end of this year and the Stateline I and II plants to be in service in 2012 and 2013 respectively. The Bakken NGL pipeline is also on time and on budget with engineering and design, right away acquisition and ground surveying moving ahead.
In addition to growth projects we have already announced, we are continuing to evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects including investments in natural gas pipelines, processing plants and NGL storage facilities.
John, that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK’s second quarter net income increased by 32%, driven primarily by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners.

ONEOK’s second quarter net income increased by 32%, driven primarily by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. Operating costs were higher primarily due to increased share-based compensation and other benefit costs.
Share-based compensation costs include stocks issued to employees and directors under the company’s long-term incentive plans and the employee stock award program that John mentioned that awards one share of stock each time ONEOK stock closes at or above a new $1 benchmark. Through the first six months of 2011, we have awarded an unprecedented 19 shares of stock at a cost of $8.9 million, a relatively small price to pay we believe, for creating the additional shareholder value that John mentioned.
In May, ONEOK executed a $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with Barclays Capital. The repurchase will be funded by available cash and short-term borrowings.
This repurchase is part of a $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, with an annual maximum of $300 million authorized by our board last fall. Based on the repurchase of shares and the issuance of shares under our share-based compensation programs, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2011 to be approximately 107 million, a net decrease of approximately 1 million shares compared with the average for 2010.
ONEOK’s year-to-date 2011 standalone cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $153.2 million. This includes the benefit of bonus depreciation which will continue to benefit us through 2012. With the partnership’s updated 2011 distribution level, ONEOK will receive approximately $333 million in distributions this year, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK’s income taxes on the distributions from the LP units it owns are deferred contributing to ONEOK’s strong cash flow.
We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2011. Net income is expected to be in the range of $325 million to $345 million compared with its previous range of $325 million to $360 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment offset partially by lower expected earnings in the Distribution and Energy Services segments.
Our updated standalone cash flow before changes in working capital is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $180 million to $210 million versus our previous guidance range of $235 million to $275 million. The change reflects our revised ONEOK earnings guidance.
The standalone cash flow includes the benefit from the bonus depreciation I mentioned earlier. We anticipate standalone cash flow before changes in working capital to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $150 million to $200 million per year over the next three years. Embedded within that expectation are the more aggressive dividend growth and the targeted payout ratio we provided last fall.
In July, we increased our dividend by $0.04 a share which represents an 8% increase since the beginning of the year and a 17% increase since last fall when we announced plans to increase the dividend by 50% to 60% over a three-year period while maintaining a 60% to 70% payout ratio.
ONEOK’s liquidity position is very strong. At the end of the second quarter on a standalone basis, we had $526.6 million of commercial paper outstanding, $45.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $302.3 million of natural gas and storage, and $671.4 million available under our new credit facilities. Our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio at June 30th was 42%.
ONEOK’s significant cash flow and excellent liquidity position continues to give us tremendous financial flexibility for dividend increases, share repurchases, purchasing additional ONEOK Partners’ units and acquisitions.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.

293889,118244828,151738,"ONEOK Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let’s start with our Distribution segment. Similar to the first quarter of this year, second quarter 2011 earnings were lower because of higher operating cost, primarily the share-based compensation cost previous",941,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let’s start with our Distribution segment. Similar to the first quarter of this year, second quarter 2011 earnings were lower because of higher operating cost, primarily the share-based compensation cost previously mentioned.
Because the Distribution segment has the most ONEOK employees, it was allocated the largest portion of these share-based compensation costs which accounted for $5.5 million of the quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase and more than $11 million of the year-to-date increase. As John mentioned, absent these costs, the segment performed as we expected it would.
Net margin was relatively unchanged compared to the same period last year. The Distribution segment operating income guidance for 2011 has been updated to $218 million to reflect the higher year-to-date share-based compensation and employee-related benefits cost. Our revenues for this segment remains strong and are on plan.
Now, a brief regulatory update. In July, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission approved Oklahoma Natural Gas’ first annual performance-based rate filing. We had not sought any modifications to the customer’s rate since our return on equity was within the range approved by the Commission. In May, the Commission also approved Oklahoma Natural Gas’ energy efficiency application allowing us to recover cost and receive performance incentives for various energy efficiency programs.
In Texas, the annual filing of our Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program, known as GRIP, was approved for $1.5 million in May for Austin jurisdiction with new rates taking effect in June. We are waiting to hear from the City of El Paso on our $1.1 million GRIP filing there. Upon approval, these new rates would take effect in August.
We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. Year-to-date in 2011, the Distribution segment invested $109 million of capital compared with a $78 million for the same period last year. The increase is due to the timing of routine construction activities in 2011 as well as the earlier installation of automated meters in 2011 compared with 2010.
This year, we are reinvesting $25 million to install these automated meters. We’ve completed 50% of this year’s planned installations in areas of Oklahoma and Texas. These meters are safer, more accurate and more efficient and allow us to return on investments creating a win-win for the customers and the company.
Now, let’s turn to Energy Services. Our second quarter results were lower compared with the same quarter in 2010, primarily because of lower transportation margins, net of hedging due to lower hedge settlements in 2011 compared with 2010. In last year’s first and second quarters, we benefited from the transportation hedges we placed in 2008 and earlier in 2009 when there was ample liquidity in the marketplace. Since then, liquidity and volatility have been extremely limited and it is currently disadvantageous for us to place forward hedges.
For the remainder of 2011, we have hedged approximately 41% of our transportation margins and 64% of our storage margin. We expect the midpoint of our 2011 operating income to be $42 million, lower than our previous guidance of $91 million and the $75 million to $125 million range we expected for this business.
This segment continues to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions that are the results of an increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years and abundance of supply of natural gas from the development of shale plays. This has resulted in significantly narrowed location and seasonal storage differentials from where they had been in past years.
In our initial guidance, we expected locations spreads to widen to 2010 levels. But in fact, they have narrowed driven by market conditions. We are also experiencing lower seasonal storage spreads compared to those we’d forecasted given stronger supplier growth and warmer than normal weather.
As I mentioned last quarter, we have a plan to help address these adverse market conditions. Here’s where we stand on those efforts.
Number one, maintaining our existing premium services customers and while adding new ones. We have retained more than 90% of our customers by maintaining a strong long-term relationship. However, the fees we charge are lower due to low prices of natural gas.
Number two, maximizing earnings through reflective optimization activities. With extremely low and narrow location spreads and seasonal spreads, our opportunities to optimize in the daily marketplace have been somewhat limited. The spreads we’re experiencing are much tighter than we expected, which still allows for opportunities to optimize but at lower margins. Regardless, we are looking for niche opportunities to do so every day.
Number three, growing our market share with electric generation customers. With the extreme heat in the Central U.S., we, as our competitors, are actively selling gas to growing electric generation customer base. We have been successful in this endeavor but at a very competitive environment, the margins are limited.
Number four, work with producers to move their supply in constrained areas. Our efforts continue and have been successful. However, producers are focused on 2012 and 2013, not 2011.
We’re also rebasing our cost structure, assessing how much capacity we need to contract for, what we need, what we don’t need and where and renegotiating transportation and storage rates whenever and wherever possible.
By the end of the 2012, more than 20% of our leased transportation and store capacity will be up for renegotiation and more than 80% by 2015, giving us additional opportunities to realign our market positions and more importantly rebase our cost structure. Rest assured that this management team is focused on doing what we can to adapt our strategy to these challenging market conditions.
John, that concludes my remarks.

What did we think of the proposed transactions? Could we, would we submit a bid? And now that the transaction appears to have concluded, would we be interested in acquiring any of Southern Union’s assets? Here are the facts.
We, along with a long list of others, have had several discussions with Southern Union management over the years about a potential transaction, with my last conversation being less than a week before the initial transaction announcement. And yes, we were prepared to submit a competing bid before the first counter offer was made.
However, as the price of the transaction increased, it did not make economic sense for us. Simply put, our current growth and future opportunities at ONEOK Partners are more accretive than acquiring Southern Union at the prices being contemplated.
At the right price, Southern Union would have been a great fit for us. Is it a good deal as now proposed? That’s for the management of the other parties involved in the transaction to answer. As you know, we are a disciplined buyer of assets and measure acquisition opportunities against our other growth alternatives, which for us are our current and future internal growth projects from a return and value creation standpoint as well as a strategic fit.
Having said that, if certain Southern Union assets become available for purchase, we are interested.
The final point I’d like to touch on involves a recent and unwelcome change in our corporate governance at ONEOK. ONEOK is incorporated in the State of Oklahoma and we recently learned that the Oklahoma Legislature in 2010 passed last-minute legislation requiring all large publicly traded companies incorporated in Oklahoma to have classified, or staggered, boards of directors. As a result, the directors of ONEOK have been classified automatically by the Oklahoma statute into three classes with staggered terms.
This law runs counter to the wishes of our Board and our shareholders. In 2008, our Board recommended and our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the elimination of our classified Board and the institution of the annual election of directors. Despite the Oklahoma law change, we continue to believe that the annual election of directors is good governance and that companies should be able to work with their shareholders to determine which board structure is appropriate.
Obviously, we are disappointed that the legislature took this action and did so in a manner that did not afford us, as the largest publicly company in the state, the opportunity to participate in a debate regarding the advisability of this legislation.
I have spoken to Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin twice about the issue and she said she is committed to working with ONEOK and the Oklahoma Legislature to resolve this situation. This legislation by the way was passed before Governor Fallin became governor. We will keep you updated on our progress.
And finally, as always, I’d like to thank our 4,800 employees who create value every day for our investors and customers through their dedication and commitment to excellence. Our success as a company depends upon their contributions and I appreciate their efforts.
We are now ready to take your questions.

Good morning. Many thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
Joining me on the call this morning are Rob Martinovich, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners’ Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly results and updated earnings guidance; Terry Spencer, ONEOK Partners’ Chief Operating Officer, who will review the partnership’s operating results and update you on growth projects; and Pierce Norton, ONEOK’s Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK’s other two segments, Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services.
On this morning’s conference call, I’ll briefly review our third quarter financial results and revised guidance, discuss the acquisition market, and conclude with some perspective on how we intend to use the free cash that ONEOK generates.
Let’s start with our third quarter financial performance at ONEOK Partners, which was exceptional. Our natural gas liquids business continues to benefit from historically wide NGL price differentials and our having more fractionation and transportation capacity available to use for optimization activities. This continued strong performance in our NGL optimization business has led us to increase our 2011 guidance at ONEOK Partners and ONEOK.
While our uniquely well-positioned NGL assets enable us to capture these wide differentials, other factors contributed to the partnership’s strong third quarter performance. Higher NGL and condensate prices, higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, and higher natural gas volumes processed, particularly in the Williston Basin where we’re investing billions of dollars in new plans and infrastructure, all played a part in the partnership’s strong third quarter performance.
The growth in our base business as evidenced by volume growth is important, since we do not believe that these wide NGL differentials are sustainable over the long term, as new pipelines, such as our Sterling III NGL line, and other factors will eventually alleviate these transportation constraints resulting in narrow differentials.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment again performed as expected, essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis and down slightly for the nine-month period, primarily because of the higher share-based costs we highlighted last quarter.
Our Energy Services segment continues to face a challenging market environment, again, experiencing the impact of low natural gas prices and low volatility, which has narrowed location differentials and seasonal storage spreads. Our ability to achieve our year-end guidance in this segment depends on what happens in the natural gas markets during the next two months, and Pierce will discuss this issue in more detail a bit later.
Now, Rob will review ONEOK Partners’ financial highlights, and then Terry will review the partnership’s operating performance. Rob?

For the first nine months of 2011, net income increased 61% versus the same period in 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.62 times. For the first nine months of 2011, distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the same period last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.46 times.
The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels resulting in the coverage ratio of 1.45 times, we do not believe these current wide NGL price differentials are sustainable long term.
In 2008, we utilized the incremental distributable cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize the incremental distributable cash flow likewise in 2011 to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program. We increased the distribution $0.01 per unit for the third quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.01 for the fourth quarter. The third quarter increase marked the 20th increase since ONEOK became sole general partner five years ago, a 49% increase.
With the strong performance in the NGL segment, we’ve increased the partnership’s 2011 earnings guidance to a range of $740 million to $770 million, compared with its previous range of $630 million to $660 million. We also estimated the partnership’s 2011 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, compared with its previous range of $735 million to $765 million. We updated our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $1.2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.1 billion in growth capital and $97 million in maintenance capital.
We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, which is the most sensitive to commodity price changes. Our news release contains information on these hedges.
At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $128 million in cash, and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capital ratio of 54% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4%. Finally, we still do not anticipate any additional financing this year. However, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities.
Now, Terry will review the partnership’s operating performance.

This morning I’ll discuss our outstanding operating performance and updated 2011 guidance, briefly review our NGL market outlook, and close with the status report on our growth projects.
The partnership had an exceptional third quarter. Operating income increased by more than 50%, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.
Earnings also increased as a result of contract renegotiations for some of our NGL exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins in our NGL business, as well as higher NGL and condensate prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
Even though the business continues to benefit from these favorable price differentials and higher commodity prices, our base business continues to grow. In the quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. More on that in a moment.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s third quarter financial results were higher than the same period in 2010 due primarily to higher net realized NGL and condensate prices and higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin. We decreased slightly the segment’s operating income guidance for 2011 reflecting higher operating costs, offset partially by higher earnings from our equity investments. We still expect processed volumes to be up 3% over last year and gathered volumes to be down 4% compared with last year.
These revised estimates reflect adjustments in drilling schedules by a Western Oklahoma producer, weather-related outages that occurred in the first quarter of this year, and continued declines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, offset by volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford. The Powder River volumes represent approximately 12% of our total gathered volumes, but account for less than 4% of our gathering and processing segment’s net margin.
The natural gas pipeline segment’s third quarter results were lower compared with the third quarter last year due to lower transportation margins from narrower regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across our pipelines. Northern Border’s earnings were slightly lower due to selling a portion of this capacity at lower annual maximum rates compared with higher premium seasonal rates in the same period last year. Most, if not all, of Northern Border’s capacity is contracted through October 2012.
Equity earnings for the first nine months of this year are up 17%. We revised this segment’s 2011 operating income guidance to reflect higher operating cost and narrower natural gas price location differentials that have reduced the demand for contracted capacity on Midwestern and for interruptible transportation services on the balance of our transmission pipelines.
However, as we said before, almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly-owned pipes serves end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials. We do expect higher earnings from our 50% interest in Northern Border Pipeline due primarily to its continued low cost structure and market connectivity. In spite of the narrow price differentials environment, this business, due to its highly contracted capacity, continues to generate stable earnings. Approximately 80% of our own pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity are contracted under firm long-term contracts.
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to benefit from record high NGL price differentials, and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. This segment also benefited from successful contract renegotiations associated with our exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins from wider price spreads between normal butane and iso-butane also helped earnings.
We fractionated 6% more volume during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 529,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter. We expect fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 15% during the quarter compared with the same period last year after adjusting for the sale of the 49% interest in Overland Pass Pipeline that occurred in September last year, averaging 443,000 barrels per day during the quarter as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent.
Arbuckle Pipeline volumes increased to more than 160,000 barrels per day versus current capacity of 180,000 barrels per day. Arbuckle capacity will increase to 240,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2012 to accommodate the continued need to serve Mid-Continent NGL producers via our major NGL gathering system expansion, where more than 230 miles of new pipelines are currently under construction in the Granite Wash and Cana-Woodford shale play.
We increased our operating income guidance for this segment again to reflect wider NGL price differentials. For the fourth quarter 2011, we have assumed an average of $0.41 per gallon for the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential. As we disclosed during our investor conference in September, we are assuming an average $0.12 per gallon Conway to Belvieu ethane price differential in 2012. While this average may appear conservative, our experience tells us that the current wide differentials we are experiencing today may not be sustainable for a number of reasons.
Our previously mentioned Arbuckle Pipeline capacity expansion will bring more new capacity to the Mont Belvieu market. Customers in Conway may seek short-term solutions, such as rail or other transportation alternatives until additional new transportation capacity. Our Sterling III line, for instance, comes online in 2013. Potential ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent due to weak Conway pricing could reduce ethane supplies to Conway. Petchems may switch from ethane to other NGL feedstocks, such as propane, reducing ethane demand and narrowing differentials. Traditional late fourth quarter inventory management by petchems and others may result in reduced ethane demand. And finally, a softening of the currently strong ethylene economics could also reduce ethane demand.
Now an update on our projects. The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline by adding additional pump stations, referred to as Sterling I, is expected to be completed by the end of this month and will add 15,000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu. The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline and the 75,000 barrel per day Mont Belvieu II fractionator are progressing as planned. We continue to secure supply commitments for both projects, with approximately two-thirds committed on Sterling III and two-thirds committing for Mont Belvieu II. We expect to have substantially all the available capacity committed well before these assets go into service in 2013.
Now turning to our Bakken projects. We are investing almost $2 billion to build three new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure, and the 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and the Overland Pass Pipeline. These projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular the flaring of NGL-rich natural gas.
Our natural gas processing plants under construction remain on schedule and on budget. We expect our first new processing plant Garden Creek to be in service by the end of this year, and the Stateline I and II plants to be in service in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Bakken NGL pipeline is also on time and on budget with engineering design and right of way acquisition moving ahead.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in natural gas pipelines and processing plants and NGL storage facilities. Now, that backlog totals more than $1 billion and it’s growing. Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability, and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market.
As we’ve done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable. We expect these projects will generate attractive returns incremental to our updated three-year outlook that we provided in September.
John, that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK’s third quarter net income increased by 9%, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. Results in the distribution segment were relatively flat year-over-year, while energy services had lower results due primarily to lower transportation margins from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials.
ONEOK’s year-to-date 2011 standalone cash flow before changes in the working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $175.7 million. We expect to end the year in a range of approximately $210 million to $240 million, higher than the previous guidance range of $180 million to $210 million due primarily to revisions in depreciation estimates, including bonus depreciation following the filing of our 2010 tax returns.
With the partnership’s 2011 cash distribution level, ONEOK will receive approximately $333 million in distributions this year, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK’s income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners’ LP units it owns are deferred, contributing to ONEOK’s strong cash flow.
We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2011. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $365 million, compared with its previous range of $325 million to $345 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the distribution segment.
In October we declared a dividend for the third quarter of $0.56 this year, a 17% increase since September 2010. ONEOK’s liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the third quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $650 million of commercial paper outstanding, $20.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $415.3 million of natural gas and storage, and $548 million available under our new credit facility. At the end of the third quarter, our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio was 43%.
ONEOK’s significant cash flow and excellent liquidity position continue to give us tremendous financial flexibility for acquisitions, dividend increases, purchasing additional ONEOK Partners’ units and share repurchases.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Let’s start with our natural gas distribution segment. Third quarter 2011 earnings were relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year.

Third quarter 2011 earnings were relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year. Year-to-date results are lower because of higher operating costs, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on our previous conference calls amounting to approximately $10 million year-to-date. The distribution segment’s operating income guidance for 2011 has been updated $209 million primarily to reflect anticipated higher employee-related expenses.
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, we filed an application in September to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million and expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. The capital recovery mechanism allows for the recovery of and the ability to earn a return on incremental safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases.
Also in Kansas, as discussed at our September Investor Meeting, we plan to file a rate case in mid-2012. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits for our customers and our shareholders. Through the third quarter this year, we’ve invested $177 million of capital compared with $146 million for the same period last year. The increase is due to the continued installation of automated meters, as well as continued investments for pipeline integrity and replacement projects. Finally, the United Steelworkers ratified a new five-year contract on October 29, which represents approximately 400 Kansas gas service employees.
Now let’s turn to energy services. This segment’s challenges continue. Our third quarter results were lower compared with the same quarter in 2010, primarily because of lower transportation margins, net of hedging due to narrow realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. During the first nine months of 2010, we benefited from the transportation hedges we placed in 2008 and early 2009 when there was ample liquidity in the marketplace. Since then, liquidity and volatility have been extremely limited, and consequently, it has not been advantageous to place forward hedges.
We’re holding our 2011 operating income guidance at $42 million. As John mentioned, November and December will be critical months for this business to achieve its 2011 target. This segment continues to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions that are a result of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years and an oversupply of natural gas from the development of shale plays. This has resulted in significantly narrow location in season storage differentials from where they’ve been in past years. We continue to assess how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium service customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates.
By the end of 2012 more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal, and more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity by 2015, thereby providing an opportunity to renew these leases or renew at a lower rate. These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers’ needs, and more importantly, rebase our cost structure in the years ahead. We remain focused on adapting our strategy to meet these challenging market conditions.
Finally, an update in our environmental safety and health efforts. The U.S. Senate recently passed pipeline safety legislation to strengthen safety and environmental protection for all in natural gas transportation. A similar measure is now in House Subcommittee. These bills will expand pipeline integrity management requirements to utilize additional measures to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. pipeline systems.
ONEOK’s 2012 capital expenditure budget includes replacement of pipe in the natural gas distribution segment that was identified using a risk-based approach as a part of our pipeline integrity program. We’re also conducting extensive pipeline data reviews to verify the maximum allowable operating pressures for all of our regulated pipeline segments. All-in-all, many of the proposed revisions in the legislation make sense, and we continue our daily efforts to be responsible pipeline system operators focusing on both personnel and system safety.
John, that concludes my comments.
"
293889,118244848,183312,"ONEOK Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pierce. I’d like to make some final comments before we take your questions. The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets.

The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets. The answer remains, we’re interested. As I’ve said on several occasions, it’s our top priority for using our cash and balance sheet, either acquisitions that enable us to add a new platform for growth or ones that build on our existing lines of business. But the expectation for returns on any acquisition remain high, especially given our current slate of $3 billion plus announced projects and the $1 billion plus and growing backlog of unannounced growth projects that Terry just mentioned. All of those with very attractive returns, and certainly more attractive than some of the recently announced transactions.
This means that while we remain interested in acquiring the right assets at the right price, we do not feel a heightened sense of urgency that other buyers might, since we don’t need to make an acquisition to meet our very attractive three-year growth target.
We also continue to get questions about our uses of the free cash generated at ONEOK, which is approximately $200 million a year during the next three years. Our priorities remain acquisitions, dividend increases, additional investments in ONEOK Partners, and share repurchases. But our uses of cash are not determined by a formula or some set priority. We see these as dynamic and depending upon both the market and the opportunities that exist.
A case in point, in hindsight we would like to have completed our $300 million share repurchase earlier than we did this year, when our share price was, of course, lower. But at the time, we were involved in other opportunities that kept that repurchase from occurring earlier. Had those opportunities fallen into place, the share repurchase might have been smaller or even pushed back.
We also continue to validate that we are paying out the right amount of recurring earnings in the form of dividends. You recall that a year ago we increased our targeted dividend payout to a range of 60% to 70% from a previous range of 50% to 55% that was first established in 2006. Also when ONEOK Partners has equity needs, ONEOK evaluates investing in additional units versus other alternatives. ONEOK participated in 2008 and sat out the last two equity offerings, but has indicated an interest in future ONEOK Partners equity offerings.
The good news is that we have businesses that generate a lot of cash and a structure that gives us a lot of flexibility, and a variety of tools and options to deploy that cash. Over both the short and long term, we believe we have been prudent investors of that cash in ways that create value for our investors and other stakeholders.
Finally, I’d like to thank our employees who work safely and environmentally responsible everyday to create value for our investors and customers. When describing our NGL success at the partnership, I mentioned our uniquely positioned assets, higher prices and higher volumes, but I did not recognize the leadership team that makes and did make this all happen. And, of course, Terry leads that effort. Sheridan Swords is the President of that segment. Wes Christensen, our Senior Vice President responsible for operations of all of our assets and the partnership, and of course as everyone knows, you can’t capture spreads if you don’t have assets and our reliability creates significant value for our customers and our producers. And Randy Jordan, who is the quarterback that makes the calls on our optimization opportunities every day. And I might also add that this is the same team that is executing these billions of dollars worth of projects that we have underway. We never forget that our success as a company depends on the contributions of all of our employees, and I appreciate their efforts.
Operator, at this time we’re ready to take questions.

It depends on our next economic alternative. Those four - and I think history has proven that those four areas are areas where we have in the past made changes. We’ve acquired assets. We’ve increased the dividend significantly. We’ve invested in ONEOK Partners. We’ve done all those things. So - and we’ll continue to do those things.
Your comment about our peers and the acquisitions, I mean, I hear you, but at the same time we’ve got $3 billion of projects underway at attractive rates of return and we have over $1 billion - I guess I just increased it - of unannounced projects. And the returns on those projects are greater than if we were to go repeat an acquisition that one of our peers did at what the Street tells us those returns are. Obviously, those companies know their situation much better than we do, and they, like when we bought the Coke assets, may see something that neither we nor the Street sees.
So I’m not trying to say that they haven’t made good investments. I’m just saying relative to our next economic alternative, we’re always choosing what we think creates the most value. So I could sit here right now and tell you that, oh, yeah, we’d much rather do an acquisition than increase the dividend, for example, or buyback ONEOK Partners’ shares. But till that baby shows up, what are we going to do, keep the dividend where it is, not buy anymore ONEOK Partners? That’s kind of like you got to look at all that stuff at the same time.

But the vision of the company has been and remains to seek opportunities where we can further take advantage of our integrated operations. And by that what I mean is, we’ve for the last 10 years plus have been putting back together the pieces of the value chain to create that integrated model, because we believe it’s the - it provides the lowest cost to capital.
When you look at what energy services has done for us and what it does for us today, it keeps us engaged in the marketplace. It allows us to see and participate in the downstream business of natural gas beyond what we do inside our distribution business, or for that fact besides what we do inside the partnership. So we feel that what it does do is it does create value for the business through that integration activity.
The other thing - the other part of our vision, as you might recall, is that we seek to do those things - those - where we can take advantage of those capabilities that we’ve developed and also provide opportunity to develop capabilities we don’t have, which might create value in the future. We do the energy services business, the gas marketing business uniquely and differently than our competitors. And, yes, it is exposed to the volatility and the commodity price. But as we’ve talked about earlier, reducing costs we can continue to focus on creating value, and that’s the business that we think we can generate - that can generate between that $75 million and - I think it’s $70 million and $125 million, I can’t recall exactly.

Good morning. Many thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
Joining me on the call this morning are Rob Martinovich, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly results and updated earnings guidance; Terry Spencer, ONEOK Partners' Chief Operating Officer, who will review the partnership's operating results and update you on growth projects; and Pierce Norton, ONEOK's Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK's other 2 segments, natural gas distribution and energy services.
On this morning's conference call, I'll briefly review our third quarter financial results and revised guidance, discuss the acquisition market, and conclude with some perspective on how we intend to use the free cash that ONEOK generates.
Let's start with our third quarter financial performance at ONEOK Partners, which was exceptional. Our natural gas liquids business continues to benefit from historically wide NGL price differentials and our having more fractionation and transportation capacity available to use for optimization activities. This continued strong performance in our NGL operations -- optimization business has led us to increase our 2011 guidance at ONEOK Partners and ONEOK.
While our uniquely well-positioned NGL assets enabled us to capture these wide differentials, other factors contributed to the partnership's strong third quarter performance. Higher NGL and condensate prices, higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, and higher natural gas volumes processed, particularly in the Williston Basin where we're investing billions of dollars in new plants and infrastructure, all played a part in the partnership's strong third quarter performance.
The growth in our base business, as evidenced by volume growth, is important since we do not believe that these wide NGL differentials are sustainable over the long term, as new pipelines, such as our Sterling III NGL line, and other factors will eventually alleviate these transportation constraints resulting in narrower differentials.
Our natural gas distribution segment again performed as expected, essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, and down slightly for the 9-month period, primarily because of the higher share-based costs we highlighted last quarter.
Our energy services segment continues to face a challenging market environment, again, experiencing the impact of low natural gas prices and low volatility, which has narrowed location differentials and seasonal storage spreads. Our ability to achieve our year-end guidance in this segment depends on what happens in the natural gas markets during the next 2 months, and Pierce will discuss this issue in more detail a bit later.
Now, Rob will review ONEOK Partners' financial highlights, and then Terry will review the partnership's operating performance. Rob?"

Distributable cash flow increased",437,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners reported a 48% year-over-year increase in net income. For the first 9 months of 2011, net income increased 61% versus the same period in 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.62x. For the first 9 months of 2011, distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the same period last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.46x.
The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels resulting in the coverage ratio of 1.45x, we do not believe these current wide NGL price differentials are sustainable long term.
In 2008, we utilized the incremental distributable cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize the incremental distributable cash flow likewise in 2011 to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program. We increased the distribution $0.01 per unit for the third quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.01 for the fourth quarter. The third quarter increase marked the 20th increase since ONEOK became sole general partner 5 years ago, a 49% increase.
With the strong performance in the NGL segment, we've increased the partnership's 2011 earnings guidance to a range of $740 million to $770 million, compared with its previous range of $630 million to $660 million. We also estimated the partnership's 2011 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, compared with its previous range of $735 million to $765 million. We updated our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $1.2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.1 billion in growth capital and $97 million in maintenance capital.
We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, which is the most sensitive to commodity price changes. Our news release contains information on these hedges.
At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $128 million in cash, and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capital ratio of 54% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4. Finally, we still do not anticipate any additional financing this year. However, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities.
Now, Terry will review the partnership's operating performance."

This morning I'll discuss our outstanding operating performance and updated 2011 guidance, briefly review our NGL market outlook, and close with the status report on our growth projects.
The partnership had an exceptional third quarter. Operating income increased by more than 50%, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.
Earnings also increased as a result of contract renegotiations for some of our NGL exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins in our NGL business, as well as higher NGL and condensate prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
Even though the business continues to benefit from these favorable price differentials and higher commodity prices, our base business continues to grow. In the quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. More on that in a moment.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment's third quarter financial results were higher than the same period in 2010 due primarily to higher net realized NGL and condensate prices and higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin. We decreased slightly the segment's operating income guidance for 2011 reflecting higher operating costs, offset partially by higher earnings from our equity investments. We still expect processed volumes to be up 3% over last year and gathered volumes to be down 4% compared with last year.
These revised estimates reflect adjustments in drilling schedules by a Western Oklahoma producer, weather-related outages that occurred in the first quarter of this year, and continued declines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, offset by volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford. The Powder River volumes represent approximately 12% of our total gathered volumes, but account for less than 4% of our gathering and processing segment's net margin.
The natural gas pipeline segment's third quarter results were lower compared with the third quarter last year due to lower transportation margins from narrower regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across our pipelines. Northern Border's earnings were slightly lower due to selling a portion of this capacity at lower annual maximum rates compared with higher premium seasonal rates in the same period last year. Most, if not all, of Northern Border's capacity is contracted through October 2012.
Equity earnings for the first 9 months of this year are up 17%. We revised this segment's 2011 operating income guidance to reflect higher operating cost and narrower natural gas price location differentials that have reduced the demand for contracted capacity on Midwestern and for interruptible transportation services on the balance of our transmission pipelines. However, as we said before, almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly-owned pipes serves end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials.
We do expect higher earnings from our 50% interest in Northern Border Pipeline due primarily to its continued low cost structure and market connectivity. In spite of the narrow price differentials environment, this business, due to its highly-contracted capacity, continues to generate stable earnings. Approximately 80% of our own pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity are contracted under firm long-term contracts.
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to benefit from record high NGL price differentials, and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. This segment also benefited from successful contract renegotiations associated with our exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins from wider price spreads between normal butane and isobutane also helped earnings.
We fractionated 6% more volume during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 529,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter. We expect fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 15% during the quarter compared with the same period last year after adjusting for the sale of the 49% interest in Overland Pass Pipeline that occurred in September last year, averaging 443,000 barrels per day during the quarter as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent.
Arbuckle Pipeline volumes increased to more than 160,000 barrels per day versus current capacity of 180,000 barrels per day. Arbuckle capacity will increase to 240,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2012 to accommodate the continued need to serve Mid-Continent NGL producers via our major NGL gathering system expansion, where more than 230 miles of new pipelines are currently under construction in the Granite Wash and Cana-Woodford shale play.
We increased our operating income guidance for this segment again to reflect wider NGL price differentials. For the fourth quarter 2011, we have assumed an average of $0.41 per gallon for the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential. As we disclosed during our investor conference in September, we are assuming an average $0.12 per gallon Conway to Belvieu ethane price differential in 2012. While this average may appear conservative, our experience tells us that the current wide differentials we are experiencing today may not be sustainable for a number of reasons.
Our previously mentioned Arbuckle Pipeline capacity expansion will bring more new capacity to the Mont Belvieu market. Customers in Conway may seek short-term solutions, such as rail or other transportation alternatives until additional new transportation capacity, our Sterling III line, for instance, comes online in 2013. Potential ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent due to weak Conway pricing could reduce ethane supplies to Conway. Petchems may switch from ethane to other NGL feedstocks, such as propane, reducing ethane demand and narrowing differentials. Traditional late fourth quarter inventory management by petchems and others may result in reduced ethane demand. And finally, a softening of the currently strong ethylene economics could also reduce ethane demand.
Now an update on our projects. The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline by adding additional pump stations, referred to as Sterling I, is expected to be completed by the end of this month and will add 15,000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu. The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline and the 75,000 barrel per day Mont Belvieu II fractionator are progressing as planned. We continue to secure supply commitments for both projects, with approximately 2/3 committed on Sterling III and 2/3 committing for Mont Belvieu II. We expect to have substantially all the available capacity committed well before these assets go into service in 2013.
Now turning to our Bakken projects. We are investing almost $2 billion to build 3 new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure, and the 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and the Overland Pass Pipeline. These projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular, the flaring of NGL-rich natural gas.
Our natural gas processing plants under construction remain on schedule and on budget. We expect our first new processing plant, Garden Creek, to be in service by the end of this year, and the Stateline I and II plants to be in service in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Bakken NGL pipeline is also on time and on budget with engineering design and right-of-way acquisition moving ahead.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in natural gas pipelines and processing plants and NGL storage facilities. Now, that backlog totals more than $1 billion and it's growing. Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability, and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market.
As we've done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable. We expect these projects will generate attractive returns incremental to our updated 3-year outlook that we provided in September.
John, that concludes my remarks."

ONEOK's third quarter net income increased by 9%, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. Results in the distribution segment were relatively flat year-over-year, while energy services had lower results due primarily to lower transportation margins from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials.
ONEOK's year-to-date 2011 standalone cash flow before changes in the working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $175.7 million. We expect to end the year in a range of approximately $210 million to $240 million, higher than the previous guidance range of $180 million to $210 million due primarily to revisions in depreciation estimates, including bonus depreciation following the filing of our 2010 tax returns.
With the partnership's 2011 cash distribution level, ONEOK will receive approximately $333 million in distributions this year, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK's income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners' LP units it owns are deferred, contributing to ONEOK's strong cash flow.
We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2011. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $365 million, compared with its previous range of $325 million to $345 million. The updated guidance reflect higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the distribution segment.
In October we declared a dividend for the third quarter of $0.56 this year, a 17% increase since September 2010. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the third quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $650 million of commercial paper outstanding, $20.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $415.3 million of natural gas and storage, and $548 million available under our new credit facility. At the end of the third quarter, our standalone total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 43%.
ONEOK's significant cash flow and excellent liquidity position continue to give us tremendous financial flexibility for acquisitions, dividend increases, purchasing additional ONEOK Partners' units and share repurchases.

Third quarter 2011 earnings were relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year. Year-to-date results are lower because of higher operating costs, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on our previous conference calls amounting to approximately $10 million year-to-date. The distribution segment's operating income guidance for 2011 has been updated $209 million primarily to reflect anticipated higher employee-related expenses.
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, we filed an application in September to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million and expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. The capital recovery mechanism allows for the recovery of and the ability to earn a return on incremental safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases.
Also in Kansas, as discussed at our September Investor Meeting, we plan to file a rate case in mid-2012. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits for our customers and our shareholders. Through the third quarter this year, we've invested $177 million of capital compared with $146 million for the same period last year. The increase is due to the continued installation of automated meters, as well as continued investments for pipeline integrity and replacement projects. Finally, the United Steelworkers ratified a new 5-year contract on October 29, which represents approximately 400 Kansas gas service employees.
Now let's turn to energy services. This segment's challenges continue. Our third quarter results were lower compared with the same quarter in 2010, primarily because of lower transportation margins, net of hedging due to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. During the first 9 months of 2010, we benefited from the transportation hedges we placed in 2008 and early 2009 when there was ample liquidity in the marketplace. Since then, liquidity and volatility have been extremely limited, and consequently, it has not been advantageous to place forward hedges.
We're holding our 2011 operating income guidance at $42 million. As John mentioned, November and December will be critical months for this business to achieve its 2011 target. This segment continues to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions that are a result of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years and an oversupply of natural gas from the development of shale plays. This has resulted in significantly narrow location in season storage differentials from where they've been in past years. We continue to assess how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium service customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates.
By the end of 2012 more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal, and more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity by 2015, thereby providing an opportunity to renew these leases or renew at a lower rate. These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers' needs, and more importantly, rebase our cost structure in the years ahead. We remain focused on adapting our strategy to meet these challenging market conditions.
Finally, an update in our environmental safety and health efforts. The U.S. Senate recently passed pipeline safety legislation to strengthen safety and environmental protection for oil and natural gas transportation. A similar measure is now in the House Subcommittee. These bills will expand pipeline integrity management requirements to utilize additional measures to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. pipeline systems.
ONEOK's 2012 capital expenditure budget includes replacement of pipe in the natural gas distribution segment that was identified using a risk-based approach as a part of our pipeline integrity program. We're also conducting extensive pipeline data reviews to verify the maximum allowable operating pressures for all of our regulated pipeline segments. All-in-all, many of the proposed revisions in the legislation make sense, and we continue our daily efforts to be responsible pipeline system operators focusing on both personnel and system safety.
John, that concludes my comments."
293889,118244848,209129,"ONEOK Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pierce. I'd like to make some final comments before we take your questions. The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets. The answer remains, we're interested. As I've said",658,"Thank you, Pierce. I'd like to make some final comments before we take your questions. The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets. The answer remains, we're interested. As I've said on several occasions, it's our top priority for using our cash and balance sheet, either acquisitions that enable us to add a new platform for growth or ones that build on our existing lines of business. But the expectation for returns on any acquisition remain high, especially given our current slate of $3-billion-plus announced projects and the $1-billion-plus and growing backlog of unannounced growth projects that Terry just mentioned. All of those with very attractive returns, and certainly more attractive than some of the recently announced transactions.
This means that while we remain interested in acquiring the right assets at the right price, we do not feel a heightened sense of urgency that other buyers might, since we don't need to make an acquisition to meet our very attractive 3-year growth target.
We also continue to get questions about our uses of the free cash generated at ONEOK, which is approximately $200 million a year during the next three years. Our priorities remain acquisitions, dividend increases, additional investments in ONEOK Partners, and share repurchases. But our uses of cash are not determined by a formula or some set priority. We see these as dynamic and depending upon both the market and the opportunities that exist.
A case in point, in hindsight we would like to have completed our $300 million share repurchase earlier than we did this year, when our share price was, of course, lower. But at the time, we were involved in other opportunities that kept that repurchase from occurring earlier. Had those opportunities fallen into place, the share repurchase might have been smaller or even pushed back.
We also continue to validate that we are paying out the right amount of recurring earnings in the form of dividends. You recall that a year ago we increased our targeted dividend payout to a range of 60% to 70% from a previous range of 50% to 55% that was first established in 2006. Also when ONEOK Partners has equity needs, ONEOK evaluates investing in additional units versus other alternatives. ONEOK participated in 2008 and sat out the last 2 equity offerings, but has indicated an interest in future ONEOK Partners equity offerings.
The good news is that we have businesses that generate a lot of cash and a structure that gives us a lot of flexibility, and a variety of tools and options to deploy that cash. Over both the short and long term, we believe we have been prudent investors of that cash in ways that create value for our investors and other stakeholders.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees who work safely and environmentally responsible everyday to create value for our investors and customers. When describing our NGL success at the partnership, I mentioned our uniquely positioned assets, higher prices and higher volumes, but I did not recognize the leadership team that makes and did make this all happen. And, of course, Terry leads that effort. Sheridan Swords is the President of that segment. Wes Christensen, our Senior Vice President responsible for operations of all of our assets and the partnership. And of course as everyone knows, you can't capture spreads if you don't have assets. And our reliability creates significant value for our customers and our producers. And Randy Jordan, who is the quarterback that makes the calls on our optimization opportunities every day. And I might also add that this is the same team that is executing these billions of dollars worth of projects that we have underway. We never forget that our success as a company depends on the contributions of all of our employees, and I appreciate their efforts.

It sort of depends at a given point in time which one's at the top of the list is. So, to say today that a dividend increase is a higher priority than an acquisition, it depends. It depends on our next economic alternative. Those 4 -- and I think history has proven that those 4 areas are areas where we have, in the past, made changes. We've acquired assets. We've increased the dividend significantly. We've invested in ONEOK Partners. We've done all those things. So -- and we'll continue to do those things.
Your comment about our peers and the acquisitions, I mean, I hear you, but at the same time, we've got $3 billion of projects underway at attractive rates of return and we have over $1 billion -- I guess I just increased it -- of unannounced projects. And the returns on those projects are greater than if we were to go repeat an acquisition that one of our peers did at what the Street tells us those returns are. Obviously, those companies know their situation much better than we do, and they, like when we bought the Coke assets, may see something that neither we nor the Street sees. So I'm not trying to say that they haven't made good investments. I'm just saying relative to our next economic alternative, we're always choosing what we think creates the most value. So I could sit here right now and tell you that, ""Oh, yes, we'd much rather do an acquisition than increase the dividend,"" for example, or ""buyback ONEOK Partners' shares."" But till that baby shows up, what are we going to do? Keep the dividend where it is? Not buy anymore ONEOK Partners? So it's kind of like that you got to look at all that stuff at the same time.

When you look at what energy services has done for us and what it does for us today, it keeps us engaged in the marketplace. It allows us to see and participate in the downstream business of natural gas beyond what we do inside our distribution business, or for that fact besides what we do inside the partnership. So we feel that what it does do is it does create value for the business through that integration activity. The other thing -- the other part of our vision, as you might recall, is that we seek to do those things -- those -- where we can take advantage of those capabilities that we've developed and also provide opportunity to develop capabilities we don't have, which might create value in the future. We do the energy services business, the gas marketing business uniquely and differently than our competitors. And, yes, it is exposed to the volatility and the commodity price.

Our natural gas liquids business continues to benefit from historically wide NGL price differentials and our having more fractionation and transportation capacity available to use for optimization activities. This continued strong performance in our NGL operations -- optimization business has led us to increase our 2011 guidance at ONEOK Partners and ONEOK.
While our uniquely well-positioned NGL assets enabled us to capture these wide differentials, other factors contributed to the partnership's strong third quarter performance. Higher NGL and condensate prices, higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, and higher natural gas volumes processed, particularly in the Williston Basin where we're investing billions of dollars in new plants and infrastructure, all played a part in the partnership's strong third quarter performance.
The growth in our base business, as evidenced by volume growth, is important since we do not believe that these wide NGL differentials are sustainable over the long term, as new pipelines, such as our Sterling III NGL line, and other factors will eventually alleviate these transportation constraints resulting in narrower differentials.
Our natural gas distribution segment again performed as expected, essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, and down slightly for the 9-month period, primarily because of the higher share-based costs we highlighted last quarter.
Our energy services segment continues to face a challenging market environment, again, experiencing the impact of low natural gas prices and low volatility, which has narrowed location differentials and seasonal storage spreads. Our ability to achieve our year-end guidance in this segment depends on what happens in the natural gas markets during the next 2 months, and Pierce will discuss this issue in more detail a bit later.
Now, Rob will review ONEOK Partners' financial highlights, and then Terry will review the partnership's operating performance. Rob?"

For the first 9 months of 2011, net income increased 61% versus the same period in 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.62x. For the first 9 months of 2011, distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the same period last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.46x.
The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels resulting in the coverage ratio of 1.45x, we do not believe these current wide NGL price differentials are sustainable long term.
In 2008, we utilized the incremental distributable cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize the incremental distributable cash flow likewise in 2011 to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program. We increased the distribution $0.01 per unit for the third quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.01 for the fourth quarter. The third quarter increase marked the 20th increase since ONEOK became sole general partner 5 years ago, a 49% increase.
With the strong performance in the NGL segment, we've increased the partnership's 2011 earnings guidance to a range of $740 million to $770 million, compared with its previous range of $630 million to $660 million. We also estimated the partnership's 2011 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, compared with its previous range of $735 million to $765 million. We updated our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $1.2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.1 billion in growth capital and $97 million in maintenance capital.
We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, which is the most sensitive to commodity price changes. Our news release contains information on these hedges.
At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $128 million in cash, and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capital ratio of 54% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4. Finally, we still do not anticipate any additional financing this year. However, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities.
Now, Terry will review the partnership's operating performance."

This morning I'll discuss our outstanding operating performance and updated 2011 guidance, briefly review our NGL market outlook, and close with the status report on our growth projects.
The partnership had an exceptional third quarter. Operating income increased by more than 50%, driven primarily by higher margins in the natural gas liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and increased fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.
Earnings also increased as a result of contract renegotiations for some of our NGL exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins in our NGL business, as well as higher NGL and condensate prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
Even though the business continues to benefit from these favorable price differentials and higher commodity prices, our base business continues to grow. In the quarter, natural gas volumes processed increased, as did NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. More on that in a moment.
The natural gas gathering and processing segment's third quarter financial results were higher than the same period in 2010 due primarily to higher net realized NGL and condensate prices and higher natural gas volumes processed, specifically in the Williston Basin. We decreased slightly the segment's operating income guidance for 2011 reflecting higher operating costs, offset partially by higher earnings from our equity investments. We still expect processed volumes to be up 3% over last year and gathered volumes to be down 4% compared with last year.
These revised estimates reflect adjustments in drilling schedules by a Western Oklahoma producer, weather-related outages that occurred in the first quarter of this year, and continued declines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, offset by volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford. The Powder River volumes represent approximately 12% of our total gathered volumes, but account for less than 4% of our gathering and processing segment's net margin.
The natural gas pipeline segment's third quarter results were lower compared with the third quarter last year due to lower transportation margins from narrower regional natural gas price differentials that decreased contracted capacity on Midwestern gas transmission and interruptible volumes across our pipelines. Northern Border's earnings were slightly lower due to selling a portion of this capacity at lower annual maximum rates compared with higher premium seasonal rates in the same period last year. Most, if not all, of Northern Border's capacity is contracted through October 2012.
Equity earnings for the first 9 months of this year are up 17%. We revised this segment's 2011 operating income guidance to reflect higher operating cost and narrower natural gas price location differentials that have reduced the demand for contracted capacity on Midwestern and for interruptible transportation services on the balance of our transmission pipelines. However, as we said before, almost 90% of the contracted capacity on our wholly-owned pipes serves end users directly, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generators that need the natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of regional price differentials.
We do expect higher earnings from our 50% interest in Northern Border Pipeline due primarily to its continued low cost structure and market connectivity. In spite of the narrow price differentials environment, this business, due to its highly contracted capacity, continues to generate stable earnings. Approximately 80% of our own pipeline capacity and 100% of our storage capacity are contracted under firm long-term contracts.
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to benefit from record high NGL price differentials, and having more fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities. This segment also benefited from successful contract renegotiations associated with our exchange services activities and higher isomerization margins from wider price spreads between normal butane and isobutane also helped earnings.
We fractionated 6% more volume during the quarter compared with the same period last year, averaging 529,000 barrels per day, which includes volumes fractionated at the target facility from the fractionation services agreement that began during the second quarter. We expect fractionation capacity to remain tight, but gradually become more available as new fractionators come online over the next few years.
NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 15% during the quarter compared with the same period last year after adjusting for the sale of the 49% interest in Overland Pass Pipeline that occurred in September last year, averaging 443,000 barrels per day during the quarter as a result of increased volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline and in the Mid-Continent.
Arbuckle Pipeline volumes increased to more than 160,000 barrels per day versus current capacity of 180,000 barrels per day. Arbuckle capacity will increase to 240,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2012 to accommodate the continued need to serve Mid-Continent NGL producers via our major NGL gathering system expansion, where more than 230 miles of new pipelines are currently under construction in the Granite Wash and Cana-Woodford shale play.
We increased our operating income guidance for this segment again to reflect wider NGL price differentials. For the fourth quarter 2011, we have assumed an average of $0.41 per gallon for the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential. As we disclosed during our investor conference in September, we are assuming an average $0.12 per gallon Conway to Belvieu ethane price differential in 2012. While this average may appear conservative, our experience tells us that the current wide differentials we are experiencing today may not be sustainable for a number of reasons.
Our previously mentioned Arbuckle Pipeline capacity expansion will bring more new capacity to the Mont Belvieu market. Customers in Conway may seek short-term solutions, such as rail or other transportation alternatives until additional new transportation capacity, our Sterling III line, for instance, comes online in 2013. Potential ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent due to weak Conway pricing could reduce ethane supplies to Conway. Petchems may switch from ethane to other NGL feedstocks, such as propane, reducing ethane demand and narrowing differentials. Traditional late fourth quarter inventory management by petchems and others may result in reduced ethane demand. And finally, a softening of the currently strong ethylene economics could also reduce ethane demand.
Now an update on our projects. The expansion of our Mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu NGL distribution pipeline by adding additional pump stations, referred to as Sterling I, is expected to be completed by the end of this month and will add 15,000 barrels per day of additional capacity to ship purity NGL products south to Mont Belvieu. The 570-mile Sterling III pipeline and the 75,000 barrel per day Mont Belvieu II fractionator are progressing as planned. We continue to secure supply commitments for both projects, with approximately 2/3 committed on Sterling III and 2/3 committing for Mont Belvieu II. We expect to have substantially all the available capacity committed well before these assets go into service in 2013.
Now turning to our Bakken projects. We are investing almost $2 billion to build 3 new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure, and the 500-plus-mile 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline along with the expansions of the Bushton fractionator and the Overland Pass Pipeline. These projects are expected to resolve some of the challenges producers are facing in the Williston Basin, in particular, the flaring of NGL-rich natural gas.
Our natural gas processing plants under construction remain on schedule and on budget. We expect our first new processing plant, Garden Creek, to be in service by the end of this year, and the Stateline I and II plants to be in service in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Bakken NGL pipeline is also on time and on budget with engineering design and right-of-way acquisition moving ahead.
We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in natural gas pipelines and processing plants and NGL storage facilities. Now, that backlog totals more than $1 billion and it's growing. Some of these investments will create additional redundancy and reliability, and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers, while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers and processors need to get their products to market.
As we've done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and/or customer commitments to make them economically viable. We expect these projects will generate attractive returns incremental to our updated 3-year outlook that we provided in September.
John, that concludes my remarks."

ONEOK's third quarter net income increased by 9%, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. Results in the distribution segment were relatively flat year-over-year, while energy services had lower results due primarily to lower transportation margins from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials.
ONEOK's year-to-date 2011 standalone cash flow before changes in the working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $175.7 million. We expect to end the year in a range of approximately $210 million to $240 million, higher than the previous guidance range of $180 million to $210 million due primarily to revisions in depreciation estimates, including bonus depreciation following the filing of our 2010 tax returns.
With the partnership's 2011 cash distribution level, ONEOK will receive approximately $333 million in distributions this year, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK's income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners' LP units it owns are deferred, contributing to ONEOK's strong cash flow.
We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2011. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $365 million, compared with its previous range of $325 million to $345 million. The updated guidance reflect higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the distribution segment.
In October we declared a dividend for the third quarter of $0.56 this year, a 17% increase since September 2010. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the third quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $650 million of commercial paper outstanding, $20.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $415.3 million of natural gas and storage, and $548 million available under our new credit facility. At the end of the third quarter, our standalone total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 43%.
ONEOK's significant cash flow and excellent liquidity position continue to give us tremendous financial flexibility for acquisitions, dividend increases, purchasing additional ONEOK Partners' units and share repurchases.
Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK's operating performance."

Third quarter 2011 earnings were relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year. Year-to-date results are lower because of higher operating costs, primarily the share-based compensation cost discussed on our previous conference calls amounting to approximately $10 million year-to-date. The distribution segment's operating income guidance for 2011 has been updated $209 million primarily to reflect anticipated higher employee-related expenses.
Now a brief regulatory update. In Kansas, we filed an application in September to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million and expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. The capital recovery mechanism allows for the recovery of and the ability to earn a return on incremental safety-related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases.
Also in Kansas, as discussed at our September Investor Meeting, we plan to file a rate case in mid-2012. We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by investing in projects that provide benefits for our customers and our shareholders. Through the third quarter this year, we've invested $177 million of capital compared with $146 million for the same period last year. The increase is due to the continued installation of automated meters, as well as continued investments for pipeline integrity and replacement projects. Finally, the United Steelworkers ratified a new 5-year contract on October 29, which represents approximately 400 Kansas gas service employees.
Now let's turn to energy services. This segment's challenges continue. Our third quarter results were lower compared with the same quarter in 2010, primarily because of lower transportation margins, net of hedging due to narrower realized price location differentials, and lower hedge settlements in 2011. During the first 9 months of 2010, we benefited from the transportation hedges we placed in 2008 and early 2009 when there was ample liquidity in the marketplace. Since then, liquidity and volatility have been extremely limited, and consequently, it has not been advantageous to place forward hedges.
We're holding our 2011 operating income guidance at $42 million. As John mentioned, November and December will be critical months for this business to achieve its 2011 target. This segment continues to face extraordinarily challenging market conditions that are a result of the increase in transportation pipeline capacity in recent years and an oversupply of natural gas from the development of shale plays. This has resulted in significantly narrow location in season storage differentials from where they've been in past years. We continue to assess how much transportation and storage capacity we need to service our premium service customers, and look for opportunities to renegotiate transportation and storage rates.
By the end of 2012 more than 20% of our leased storage capacity and 15% of our leased transportation capacity will be up for renewal, and more than 90% of the storage capacity and 75% of the transport capacity by 2015, thereby providing an opportunity to renew these leases or renew at a lower rate. These explorations also give us additional opportunities to realign our capacity with customers' needs, and more importantly, rebase our cost structure in the years ahead. We remain focused on adapting our strategy to meet these challenging market conditions.
Finally, an update in our environmental safety and health efforts. The U.S. Senate recently passed pipeline safety legislation to strengthen safety and environmental protection for oil and natural gas transportation. A similar measure is now in the House Subcommittee. These bills will expand pipeline integrity management requirements to utilize additional measures to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. pipeline systems.
ONEOK's 2012 capital expenditure budget includes replacement of pipe in the natural gas distribution segment that was identified using a risk-based approach as a part of our pipeline integrity program. We're also conducting extensive pipeline data reviews to verify the maximum allowable operating pressures for all of our regulated pipeline segments. All-in-all, many of the proposed revisions in the legislation make sense, and we continue our daily efforts to be responsible pipeline system operators focusing on both personnel and system safety.
John, that concludes my comments."
293889,118244848,279149,"ONEOK Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pierce. I'd like to make some final comments before we take your questions. The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets. The answer remains, we're interested. As I've said",658,"Thank you, Pierce. I'd like to make some final comments before we take your questions. The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets. The answer remains, we're interested. As I've said on several occasions, it's our top priority for using our cash and balance sheet, either acquisitions that enable us to add a new platform for growth or ones that build on our existing lines of business. But the expectation for returns on any acquisition remain high, especially given our current slate of $3-billion-plus announced projects and the $1-billion-plus and growing backlog of unannounced growth projects that Terry just mentioned. All of those with very attractive returns, and certainly more attractive than some of the recently announced transactions.
This means that while we remain interested in acquiring the right assets at the right price, we do not feel a heightened sense of urgency that other buyers might, since we don't need to make an acquisition to meet our very attractive 3-year growth target.
We also continue to get questions about our uses of the free cash generated at ONEOK, which is approximately $200 million a year during the next 3 years. Our priorities remain acquisitions, dividend increases, additional investments in ONEOK Partners, and share repurchases. But our uses of cash are not determined by a formula or some set priority. We see these as dynamic and depending upon both the market and the opportunities that exist.
A case in point, in hindsight we would like to have completed our $300 million share repurchase earlier than we did this year, when our share price was, of course, lower. But at the time, we were involved in other opportunities that kept that repurchase from occurring earlier. Had those opportunities fallen into place, the share repurchase might have been smaller or even pushed back.
We also continue to validate that we are paying out the right amount of recurring earnings in the form of dividends. You recall that a year ago we increased our targeted dividend payout to a range of 60% to 70% from a previous range of 50% to 55% that was first established in 2006. Also when ONEOK Partners has equity needs, ONEOK evaluates investing in additional units versus other alternatives. ONEOK participated in 2008 and sat out the last 2 equity offerings, but has indicated an interest in future ONEOK Partners equity offerings.
The good news is that we have businesses that generate a lot of cash and a structure that gives us a lot of flexibility, and a variety of tools and options to deploy that cash. Over both the short and long term, we believe we have been prudent investors of that cash in ways that create value for our investors and other stakeholders.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees who work safely and environmentally responsible everyday to create value for our investors and customers. When describing our NGL success at the partnership, I mentioned our uniquely positioned assets, higher prices and higher volumes, but I did not recognize the leadership team that makes and did make this all happen. And, of course, Terry leads that effort. Sheridan Swords is the President of that segment. Wes Christensen, our Senior Vice President responsible for operations of all of our assets and the partnership. And of course as everyone knows, you can't capture spreads if you don't have assets. And our reliability creates significant value for our customers and our producers. And Randy Jordan, who is the quarterback that makes the calls on our optimization opportunities every day. And I might also add that this is the same team that is executing these billions of dollars worth of projects that we have underway. We never forget that our success as a company depends on the contributions of all of our employees, and I appreciate their efforts.

I mean, obviously, it's a strength for us right now as we sit here, and particularly in reference to the comments about acquisition and additional capital, of course, a lot of that additional capital we see at ONEOK Partners. But at ONEOK, we remain very engaged and active in opportunities to spend cash, and we'll probably, if we find the right opportunities, spend more than the cash we got, which means we'll be out to the banks to borrow money at ONEOK. So I think we've prepared ourselves with this balance sheet to be flexible so that we can transact when the right opportunity presents itself. So until that happens, I see us pretty much standing path. But let me ask Rob if he has anything he would like to add."

It sort of depends at a given point in time which one's at the top of the list is. So, to say today that a dividend increase is a higher priority than an acquisition, it depends. It depends on our next economic alternative. Those 4 -- and I think history has proven that those 4 areas are areas where we have, in the past, made changes. We've acquired assets. We've increased the dividend significantly. We've invested in ONEOK Partners. We've done all those things. So -- and we'll continue to do those things. Your comment about our peers and the acquisitions, I mean, I hear you, but at the same time, we've got $3 billion of projects underway at attractive rates of return and we have over $1 billion -- I guess I just increased it -- of unannounced projects. And the returns on those projects are greater than if we were to go repeat an acquisition that one of our peers did at what the Street tells us those returns are. Obviously, those companies know their situation much better than we do, and they, like when we bought the Coke assets, may see something that neither we nor the Street sees. So I'm not trying to say that they haven't made good investments. I'm just saying relative to our next economic alternative, we're always choosing what we think creates the most value. So I could sit here right now and tell you that, ""Oh, yes, we'd much rather do an acquisition than increase the dividend,"" for example, or ""buyback ONEOK Partners' shares."" But till that baby shows up, what are we going to do? Keep the dividend where it is? Not buy anymore ONEOK Partners? So it's kind of like that you got to look at all that stuff at the same time.

But the vision of the company has been and remains to seek opportunities where we can further take advantage of our integrated operations. And by that, what I mean is we've, for the last 10 years plus, have been putting back together the pieces of the value chain to create that integrated model, because we believe it's the -- it provides the lowest cost to capital. When you look at what energy services has done for us and what it does for us today, it keeps us engaged in the marketplace. It allows us to see and participate in the downstream business of natural gas beyond what we do inside our distribution business, or for that fact besides what we do inside the partnership. So we feel that what it does do is it does create value for the business through that integration activity. The other thing -- the other part of our vision, as you might recall, is that we seek to do those things -- those -- where we can take advantage of those capabilities that we've developed and also provide opportunity to develop capabilities we don't have, which might create value in the future. We do the energy services business, the gas marketing business uniquely and differently than our competitors. And, yes, it is exposed to the volatility and the commodity price. But as we've talked about earlier, by reducing costs, we can continue to focus on creating value, and that's the business that we think we can -- that can generate between that $75 million and -- I think it's $70 million and $125 million, I can't recall exactly.
