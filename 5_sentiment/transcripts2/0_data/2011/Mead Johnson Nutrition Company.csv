As you read in our press release, we concluded our 2010 on a very strong note and delivered another year of record sales and earnings. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter were up 19% from 2009 bringing our full-year EPS to $2.42 per share up 9% from the prior year. We accomplish many important goals in 2010, the most notable of which include over 9% constant dollar sales growth, the highest level scene in the last five years. Most encouragingly, it was 5% volume growth that drove the global sales increase. The increase was led by our Asia/Latin America segment which posted 16% growth excluding foreign exchange. We invested heavily behind advertising and promotion and in sales force expansion in the key gross market, which led to solid market share gains across the American market of Asia and Latin America. Our 
U.S. business grew despite continued decline in the first and formula consumption, fueled by successful new product launches including our patented Jewel prebiotics, unique packaging system and a newborn product formulated for the first three months of life.
In June, we launched our first joint venture as a public company with Almarai, the leading regional food and dairy producer serving markets in the Middle East. Sales into the market started in the fourth quarter, although we are still in an investment mode with this JV, this demonstrates our commitment to fueling long-term growth and expanding Mead Johnson's global presence. 
Sales outside the U.S. came to represent 68% of the company total up from 65% in 2009, and 62% in 2008. We opened a new Pediatric Nutrition Institute or PNI in Evansville, Indiana, which gives us the capability of scaling up new manufacturing processes without disrupting our operating plans. We also broke ground on a new PNI in Guangzhou, China, which is set to open later this year and service base of product government in this critical market. 
We set new productivity record that helped to mitigate the impact of higher dairy and commodity cost on our gross margins. We set our earnings record while absorbing a $24 million hit from the January 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, along with the $11 million in incremental non-cash pension expense and $18 million in shares service cost overland. And as a result of our November 2009 debt refinancing, interest expense was nearly cut in half and we drove further reductions in our effective tax rate from 30% in 2009 to only 29% in 2010 both contributing strongly to our earnings improvement.
Finally, we made significant progress in building our stand-alone infrastructure, establishing critical capabilities necessary for us to operate independently. Following significant actions by our large number of our associates around the world, we completed the design of our global SAP technology platform during 2010. And went live with the new system in North America during the fourth quarter.
Let's now turn our focus to our regional segments. The impressive growth in Asia and Latin America was led by China and Hong Kong which together, reported sales of $745 million in 2010 and now account to 24% of our global revenues. By the end of 2010, we were fully resort in a 193 cities in china. In 2011, we expect to expand our China geographic footprint into additional 50 cities through our disciplined set change programs. In our Asia/Latin America growth beyond china. We saw strong gains in many markets including Malaysia and Singapore, as well as in key Latin America markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. 
Earlier this month I traveled to Mexico City, where I have the pleasure of opening our new Latin American regional headquarters office, as well as our new Latin America Pediatric Nutrition Institute. This is our third PNI research facility. Our important investment in Latin America will help accelerate our growth and allows strengthen innovation and product development for infants and children in the region. 
Those in the United States increased 5% in the fourth quarter partially offset by a declining euro. I'll talk about our U.S. business in more details shortly but let me the first highlight some of the factors that influenced sales in Europe, which account for about 4% of our global business. 
The decline in Europe was largely attributable to the timing of shipments into certain markets. However, we are seeing some evidence in the drop of birthrates in key markets like Spain, but particularly important to us. Further there's a shift to the lower price food store channel away from pharmacist, where our infant formula Nutramigen and other specialty products are sold. Turning back to the U.S., we're pleased with the 5% sales growth in the quarter. That's solid progress compared to that 3% real growth we delivered in the third quarter particularly in light of the continued drop in the overall U.S. market. The CDC recently released new information that indicates that U.S. births were down 4% in the first half of 2010 relative to the first half of 2009. That's an acceleration from the 2.6% drop seen in 2009. WIC infant front participation data is more current and is now available through October 2010.
The data shows the birth is still declining with lower WIC infant participation in the third and early fourth quarters.
Lowest consumption from extended breast-feeding or earliest transition to cow's milk is also being seen. We continue to believe that the U.S. birthrate will ultimately rebound. There are signs of an improving economy that will ultimately lead to higher birth. The continued high unemployment in the U.S., as well as the natural lag between planning a pregnancy and the birth would suggest that birth will decline in 2011, and that we won't see any recovery until 2012 at the earliest. The contraction in the U.S. market has massed the continued gain in our market share during the fourth quarter that we started to see following the product and packaging innovation launched in the second and third quarters, along with the spike due to competitive product recoil late September. That competitor is now back on show, but we currently expect 2011 market share on average to be higher than2010 and offset a lower number of birth and reduced formula consumption.
Let's turn our attention to our outlook for 2011. We expect to produce another year of sales and earnings growth, and are initiating  2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, up from $2.42 per share in 2010.
These assumptions underlying these non-GAAP estimate include a sales increases of 7% to 8% excluding foreign exchange. At this early point in the year, we anticipate that the top line growth will be more heavily weighted towards volume than price. Finally, you will see us continuing increase investments behind demand generation and new products innovation to fuel future growth.
I'll turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and we'll return to wrap up and take your questions."

I'd like to start our 2010 financial results and provide some color on cash flow and also a bit more detail on 2011. Since Steve covered sales growth by segment, let me focus on the cost and margin side of the equation. First, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 62.3%, down from the 63.4% reported both in the third quarter and on a full-year basis. 
Higher dairy and commodity cost were at work. We saw soft prices for milk increased during the second quarter and it takes about six months for these to work through our cost of good sold. our children's attrition product, largely sold in Asia and Latin America, contain a higher percentage of dairy by weight . and a impact is more pronounced under this emerging market segment.
In 2011, commodity costs are expected to increase on average in the high single-digits. Led by higher dairy prices, other agricultural raw materials, and packaging.
Over the last two months, we've seen milk price increases of 5% to as much as 15%. We expect this balance, higher commodity cost with strong productivity in some pricing resulting in gross margin averaging 63.5% in line with 2010.
Operating expenses reached almost 41% of sales in the fourth quarter. The highest level of any quarter this past year and above the 39.4% for the full-year. The shares of this cost overlap came in at $11 million, more than double the level of payment in the third quarter. As a reminder, this overlap represent the temporary duplication of the IT, finance and indirect procurement costs, as we transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to IBM. We 
successfully launched SAP in our North American market and as a result, started to use IBM service to a greater extent during the fourth quarter. We will roll out SAP in our international market throughout 2011 and charges from IBM will increase as a result. 
On a full-year basis, the overlap is expected to grow from $18 million in 2010 to as much as $24 million in 2011 causing us about $0.02 in earnings.
We expect to be completely off the Bristol-Myers share service in IT technology platform by the end of this year.
Our total share service costs overlap over 2010 and 2011 is expected to fall in the range of $40 million to $42 million in line with our prior projection.
While operating expenses will be stressed a bit by the increase of shared service costs and a few other item, I'll discuss in a minute, we will start to leverage over G&A structure in 2011. While allowing for continued high levels of investment and demand generation.
We expect total operating expenses to center around 39.5% of sales. We will see greater G&A leverage reflected in 2012 and beyond after the completion of our SAP projects.
Let me highlight the overall impact from foreign exchange in our financial results. In 2010, sales increased by 2% for the full year from foreign exchange. The biggest contributor was the weakening of the dollar, most notably in Asia. This favorable impact was muted by the January 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar that took a full point of our sales growth over the course of the year, and reduced earnings on a pretax basis by $24 million versus 2009 or $0.08 per share.
Unfortunately, we are facing further headwinds from the bolivar as we enter 2011. In last year's devaluation, the Venezuelan government introduced a dual exchange rate. The first rate for the 2.6 bolivars per dollar was for importing essential goods, including much of our product line. The second, set at 4.3 bolivars per dollar applied to all other good, as well as profits realized in country.
In December 31st, Venezuela eliminated the Dual rate structure and converged the essentials rate to 4.3 bolivars per dollar. 
You will see $0.02 of reduced earnings in 2011 relative to 2010 just from this section alone
Please note that under current market rate, foreign exchange should add about a point and a half to top line growth in 2011.
After the bolivar exchange rate unification, the bottom line impact is a $0.01 or $0.02 of additional earning.
As Steve mentioned earlier, lower interest expense and a reduced tax rate contributed to earnings growth for 2010. We refinanced our debt in late 2009 and also swapped $700 million of our $1.5 billion in six rate notes of floating interest rates. This swaps allowed us to benefit from the low interest rate environment in 2010. When rates starting to rise, we took advantage of the appreciative value of the swap and then $100 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense should increase from $49 million into the low to mid-$50 million range, depending on weather we unwind the $500 million and remaining six floating interest swaps.
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $596 million in cash. Up $35 million from December of 2009. That's after retiring $120 million in debt outstanding against our revolving credit facility in the first quarter, $50 million in contribution to our frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., a dividend increase of 12.5% and $172 million in cash use for capital expenditures, up 80% versus 2009.
Investments in our IT technology platform and new packaging lines were the key driver of the increase. Note that on an accrued basis, reflecting actual work performed during the year, capital spending was $143 million consistent with our $150 million guidance. Accrued capital expenditures for 2011 are currently expected to be about $125 million. Capital spending necessary for our SAP build out will continue through the year. Importantly, there are two non-cash expenses that will reduce earnings per share by a total of $0.09 in 2011 relative to 2010. First, depreciation and amortization expense totaled $65 million in 2010. We expect that to grow to $75 million, largely as a result of our capital investment in IT. The majority of the $10 million DNA increase, which equates to about $0.04 per share will be seen in operating expenses, as our new IT system support many business processes like sales management, order to cash, accounting and indirect procurement.
Secondly, non-cash compensation expense will perform its base equity reward would increase from $20 million to about $35 million, equivalent to another $0.05 in earnings per share. The majority of our annual equity awards are in the form of option and performance share. With the expense recognized over their three-year vesting period.
As each year has passed since our 2009 IPO, we recognize the expense from an additional award. Though the buildup to three-full years of equity award from 2009, 2010, and 2011 will be reflected in stock-based compensation expense for the first time. Our higher stock price is also a factor. Note that we should not see increases in equity expense of this magnitude in 2012 and beyond with our current three-year equity award cycle.
We made solid progress in 2010 managing controllable working capital, which we defined as trade receivable, inventory and accounts payable. Given our high growth rate, we measure ourselves and percentage of sales basis checkout. We reduced average working capital to 8.7% of sales in 2010 from 12.4% in 2009 and almost 15% in 2008.
This strong result will deliver us inventory and accounts payable management received strong focus and help us achieve performance significantly better than the 11.4% average seen by our peers.
Let me wrap up my prepared remarks by pointing out the detail on our initial 2011 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $2 and $0.55 to $2 and $0.65 per share. This is based on constant dollar sales growth of 7% to 8% with midteen in Asia and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in North America euro. Foreign exchange would add another 1.5% at today's rates. We are currently assuming gross margin to center around 63.5% in line with 2010. 
Operating expenses measured as a percent of sale should be relatively flat at about 39.5% after absorbing $0.09 in added non-cash expense for G&A along with equity-based compensation. 
And finally, the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to fall between 28% and 29%. All in all, we've targeted another strong year of performance. Before I turn the call back to Steve, let me offer my thanks to Kathryn for her dedication service to Mead Johnson.

We have a very strong position in the algae management sector particularly with our new brand. And we have a growing presence in a few selected markets in the premium routine and some formula segment. Nevertheless, the region is seeing many of the same fundamental changes that we've seen in North America with lower birth, and lower consumption. It's also a very competitive region and as you stated Ed, there is something of a shift due to the challenging economy from the pharmacist to the food channel, where lower-price offerings are available.

As you read in our press release we concluded 2010 on a very strong note and delivered another year of record sales and earnings. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share in the Q4 were up 19% from 2009 brining our full year EPS to $2.42 per share, up 9% from the prior year. We accomplished many important goals in 2010, the most notable of which include over 9% constant dollar sales growth, the highest level seen in the last five years. Most encouragingly, it was 5% volume growth that drove the global sales increase. The increase was led by our Asia/Latin America segment, which posted 16% growth excluding foreign exchange.
We invested heavily behind advertising and promotion and in sales force expansion in key growth markets, which led to solid market share gains across the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Our US business grew despite continued declines in both births and formula consumption fueled by successful new product launches including our patented dual prebiotics, unique packaging system, and a newborn product formulated for the first three months of life.
In June we launched our first joint venture as a public company with Almarai, the leading regional food and dairy producer serving markets in the Middle East. Sales into the markets started in the Q4. Although we are still in an investment mode with this JV, this demonstrates our commitment to fueling long-term growth and to expanding Mead Johnson’s global presence. Sales outside the US came to represent 68% of the company’s total, up from 65% in 2009 and 62% in 2008.
We opened a new pediatric nutrition institute, or PNI, in Evansville, Indiana, that gives us the capability of scaling up new manufacturing processes without disrupting our operating plans. We also broke ground on a new PNI in Guangzhou, China, which is set to open late this year and serve as a base for product development in this critical market. We set new productivity records that helped to mitigate the impact of higher dairy and commodity costs on our gross margins. We set our earnings record while absorbing a $24 million hit from the January, 2010, devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar along with $11 million in incremental, non-cash pension expense and $18 million in shared service costs overlap. And, as a result of our November, 2009, debt refinancing, interest expense was nearly cut in half and we drove further reductions in our effective tax rate from 30% in 2009 to under 29% in 2010, both contributing strongly to our earnings improvement.
Finally, we made significant progress in building our standalone infrastructure, establishing critical capabilities necessary for us to operate independently. Following significant effort by a large number of our associates around the world, we completed the design of our global SAP technology platform during 2010 and went live with the new system in North America during the Q4.
Let’s now turn our focus to our regional segments. The impressive growth in Asia and Latin America was led by China and Hong Kong, which together reported sales of $745 million in 2010, and now account for 24% of our global revenues. By the end of 2010 we were fully resourced in 193 cities in China. In 2011 we expect to expand our China geographic footprint into an additional 50 cities through our disciplined step change program. But our Asia/Latin America growth goes beyond just China. We saw strong gains in many markets including Malaysia and Singapore as well as in key Latin American markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.
Earlier this month I traveled to Mexico City where I had the pleasure of opening our new Latin America regional headquarters office as well as our new Latin America pediatric nutrition institute. This is our third PNI research facility. Our important investments in Latin America will help accelerate our growth and allow us to strengthen innovation and product development for infants and children in the region.
Sales in the United States increased 5% in the Q4, partially offset by a decline in Europe. I’ll talk about our US business in more detail shortly, but let me first highlight some of the factors that influenced sales in Europe, which account for about 4% of our global business. The decline in Europe was largely attributable to the timing of shipments in certain markets. However, we are seeing some evidence of a drop in the birth rate in some key markets like Spain that are particularly important to us. Further, there is a shift to the lower-priced food store channel away from pharmacies where our infant formula, Nutramigen and other specialty products are sold.
Turning back to the US, we’re pleased with the 5% sales growth in the Q4. That’s solid progress compared to the 3% real growth we delivered in the Q3, particularly in light of the continued drop in the overall US market. The CDC recently released new information that indicates that US births were down 4% in the first half of 2010 relative to the first half of 2009. That’s an acceleration from the 2.6% drop seen in 2009. WIC infant participation data is more current, and is now available through October of 2010. The data shows that births are still declining with lower WIC infant participation in the Q3 and early Q4. Lower consumption from extended breastfeeding or earlier transition to cow’s milk is also being seen.
We continue to believe that the US birth rate will ultimately rebound. There are signs of an improving economy that should ultimately lead to higher births, but continued high unemployment in the US as well as the natural lag between planning a pregnancy and the birth will suggest that births will decline in 2011 and that we won’t see any recovery until 2012 at the earliest. The contraction in the US market has masked the continued gain in our market share during the Q4 that we started to see following the product and package innovations launched in the Q2 and Q3, along with a spike due to a competitor’s product recall in late September. That competitor is now back on-shelf but we currently expect 2011 market share on average to be higher than 2010 and offset a lower number of births and reduced formula consumption.
Let’s now turn our attention to our outlook for 2011. We expect to produce another year of sales and earnings growth and are initiating 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, up from $2.42 per share in 2010. The assumptions underlying this non-GAAP estimate include a sales increase of 7% to 8% excluding foreign exchange. At this early point in the year we anticipate that the top line growth will be more heavily weighted towards volume than price. Finally, you will see us continue to increase investments to (inaudible) demand generation and new product innovation to fuel future growth.
I’ll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and then we’ll return to wrap up and take your questions.

I’d like to start with our 2010 financial results, provide some color on cash flow and also a bit more detail on 2011.
As Steve covered sales growth by segment, let me focus on the costs and margins out of the equation. First, our gross margin in the Q4 was 62.3%, down from the 63.4% reported both in the Q3 and on a full-year basis. Higher dairy and commodity costs were at work. We saw spot prices for milk increase during the Q2, and it takes about six months for these to work through our cost of goods sold. Our children’s nutrition products, largely sold in Asia and Latin America, contain a higher percentage of dairy by weight so the impact was more pronounced on this emerging market segment. In 2011, commodity costs are expected to increase on average in the high single digits, led by higher dairy prices, other agricultural raw materials, and packaging. Over the last two months we’ve seen milk price increases of 5% to as much as 15%. We expect to balance higher commodity costs with strong productivity and some pricing, resulting in gross margins averaging 63.5% in line with 2010.
Operating expenses reached almost 41% of sales in the Q4, the highest level of any quarter this past year, and above the 39.4% for the full year. The shared service cost overlap came in at $11 million, more than double the level seen in the Q3. As a reminder, this overlap represents the temporary duplication of IT, Finance, and indirect procurement costs as we transition from Bristol Meyers Squibb to IBM. We successfully launched SAP in our North American markets, and as a result started to use IBM services to a greater extent during the Q4. We will roll out SAP in our international markets throughout 2011 and charges from IBM will increase as a result. On a full-year basis, the overlap is expected to grow from $18 million in 2010 to as much as $24 million in 2011, costing us about $0.02 in earnings. We expect to be completely off the Bristol Meyers shared service and IT technology platform by the end of this year. Our total shared service cost overlap over 2010 and 2011 is expected to fall in the range of $40 million to $42 million, in line with our prior projections. While operating expenses will be stressed a bit by the increase in shared service costs and a few other items I’ll discuss in a minute, we will start to leverage our G&A structure in 2011 while allowing for continued high levels of investment and demand generation. We expect total operating expenses to center around 39.5% of sales. We will see greater G&A leverage reflected in 2012 and beyond after the completion of our SAP projects.
Let me highlight the overall impact from foreign exchange on our financial results. In 2010 sales increased by 2% for the full year from foreign exchange. The biggest contributor was the weakening of the dollar, most notably in Asia. This favorable impact was muted by the January, 2010, devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, which took a full point off our sales growth over the course of the year and reduced earnings on a pre-tax basis by $24 million versus 2009, or $0.08 per share. Unfortunately we are facing further headwinds from the Bolivar as we enter 2011. In last year’s devaluation, the Venezuelan government introduced a dual exchange rate. The first rate, set at 2.6 Bolivars per dollar, was for importing essential goods including much of our product line. The second, set at 4.3 Bolivars per dollar, applied to all other goods as well as profits realized in-country. On December 31st, Venezuela eliminated the dual rate structure and converged the essentials rate to 4.3 Bolivars per dollar. We will see $0.02 of reduced earnings in 2011 relative to 2010 just from this action alone. Please note that under current market rates, foreign exchange should add about a point and a half to top line growth in 2011. After the Bolivar exchange rate unification, the bottom line impact is a penny or two of additional earnings.
As Steve mentioned earlier, lower interest expense and a reduced tax rate contributed to earnings growth in 2010. We refinanced our debt in late 2009 and also swapped $700 million of our $1.5 billion in fixed rate notes to floating interest rates. These swaps allowed us to benefit from the low interest rate environment in 2010. When rates started to rise we took advantage of the appreciated value of the swaps and unwound $200 million in the Q4. Interest expense should increase from $49 million into the low- to mid-$50 million range, depending on whether we unwind the $500 million in remaining fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps.
Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the year with $596 million in cash, up $35 million from December of 2009. That’s after retiring $120 million in debt outstanding against our revolving credit facility in the Q1, $50 million in contributions to our frozen defined benefit pension plan in the US, a dividend increase of 12.5%, and $172 million in cash used for capital expenditures, up 80% versus 2009. Investments in our IT technology platform and new packaging lines were the key drivers of the increase. Note that on an accrued basis reflecting actual (inaudible) performed during the year, capital spending was $143 million, consistent with our $150 million guidance. Accrued capital expenditures for 2011 are currently expected to be about $125 million. Capital spending necessary for our SAP build-out will continue through the year.
Importantly, there are two non-cash expenses that will reduce earnings per share by a total of $0.09 in 2011 relative to 2010. First, depreciation and amortization expense totaled $65 million in 2010. We expect that to grow to $75 million, largely as a result of our capital investments in IT. A majority of the $10 million G&A increase, which equates to about $0.04 per share, will be seen in operating expenses as our new IT systems support many business processes like sales management, order to cash, accounting, and indirect procurement. Secondly, non-cash compensation expense through performance-based equity awards, will increase from $20 million to about $35 million, equivalent to another $0.05 in earnings per share. The majority of our annual equity awards are in the form of options and performance shares, with the expense recognized over their three-year vesting period. As each year has passed since our 2009 IPO, we’ve recognized the expense from an additional award, so the buildup to three full years of equity awards from 2009, 2010, and 2011 will be reflected in stock-based compensation expense for the first time. Our higher stock price is also a factor. Note that we should not see increases in equity expense of this magnitude in 2012 and beyond with our current three-year equity award cycle.
We made solid progress in 2010 managing controllable working capital, which we define as trade receivables, inventory, and accounts payable. Given our high growth rates we measure ourselves on a percentage of sales basis. We reduced average working capital to 8.7% of sales in 2010, from 12.4% in 2009 and almost 15% in 2008. These strong results were delivered as inventory and accounts payable management received strong focus and helped us achieve performance significantly better than the 11.4% average seen by our peers.
Let me wrap up my prepared remarks by pulling together the details on our initial 2011 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. This is based on constant dollar sales growth of 7% to 8% with mid-teen growth in Asia/Latin America and low single-digit growth in North America/Europe. Foreign exchange would add another 1.5% at today’s rates. We are currently assuming gross margins to center around 63.5% in line with 2010. Operating expenses measured as a percent of sales should be relatively flat at about 39.5% after absorbing $0.09 in added non-cash expense for G&A along with equity-based compensation. And finally, the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to fall between 28% and 29%. All in all we’ve targeted another strong year of performance.
Before I turn the call back over to Steve, let me offer my thanks to Kathryn for her dedicated service to Mead Johnson. She’s done a great job establishing and leading our investor relations function over the last two years.

As I mentioned in the script that Europe accounts for about 4% of our business. The business has grown over time but represents a lower proportion of sales as a consequence of the rapid growth in our Asia/Latin American businesses. We have a very strong position in the allergy management sector, particularly with our Nutramigen brand, and we have a growing presence in a few selected markets in the premium routine infant formula segment. Nevertheless, the region is seeing many of the same fundamental changes that we see in North America, with lower births and lower consumption. It’s also a very competitive region, and as you stated, Ed, there is something of a shift due to the challenging economy from the pharmacies to the food channel where lower priced offerings are available. We will continue to evolve our strategy and our business model. In 2011 we’re riveted on the transformation to the new SAP technology platform, to the new distributor program and model, and to ensuring that we continue to grow the core parts of our business in selected areas. But don’t expect it to increase as a proportion of our business in the foreseeable future. Pete, do you want to take the inventory point?

In the United States, do you expect- Well first off, would you quantify what you think the benefit was of the recall? And then the second point on that same topic is do you think you can hold onto those sales? And if I could just add one further point to put all of the pieces of the question in play, what did Abbott do during the quarter in order to retain customers? I think it was all about lowering pricing on their ready-to-drink product and I want to know what kind of effect their pricing strategy has on Mead. Thank you.

Let me take the first part of the question and then I’ll turn it over to Steve. With regard to the impact in the US and market share, we believe- If you look at Nielsen data that you all can have access to, it looks like we picked up about two and a half points of market share in the Q4 relative to the Q3. Now, we can’t separate out how much of that is coming from the recall, how much of that is coming from our product innovation; both are at work. And as you recall, in the Q3 we mentioned we were seeing share gains prior to their recall. But if you look at the market on a retail basis it’s roughly $2.5 billion. 2.5% of that would imply something on the order of $60 million annually, or on a quarterly basis about $15 million. So that’s the impact of market share that we would see at retail in the Q4.

And they did a very good job of that. The pricing actions that they took, you’re absolutely right, was on their liquid products. So they dropped the price of liquids such that an equivalent feeding would cost what it would have done had powders been fully available, and we followed that action to make sure our liquids were competitive.
As they are now fully back in the market we are not seeing any unanticipated or extraordinary pricing actions. They’re clearly seeking to rebuild the equity of the business where it’s been impacted. And we’re very confident in the programs that we have in place and the innovations that we introduced toward the backend of 2010. We are seeing, as you are I’m sure from your Nielsen data, an improvement in our market share of between 2% and 3% in the Q4, and we expect to be able to hold an improved market share through 2011.

We don’t, as you know, talk about market share data explicitly on a country basis, but I can tell you that we are the number one by value in China currently. If you combine it with Hong Kong that number one status is underlined, and overall we would say 50% of our annual growth came from a market share improvement for the year, and perhaps as much as 75% of our Q4 growth from market share.

In fact, we discussed our China business yesterday with our Board of Directors and you know, without giving too much away I can say that there are many other waves of step change in the pipeline. And though there aren’t any more Beijing’s, Shanghai’s and Guangzhou’s to come along, you know, we’re still talking about very substantial cities that will allow us to increase penetration and presence for many years to come.

The other thing I would point out, too, is we’ve said in terms of our share repurchase program, where we have $300 million authorized by the Board, that the purpose of that program is to help offset dilution that may come from equity awards to employees.

As you read in our press release, we concluded 2010 on a very strong note and delivered another year of record sales and earnings. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter were up 19% from 2009 bringing our full-year EPS to $2.42 per share up 9% from the prior year. We accomplish many important goals in 2010, the most notable of which include over 9% constant dollar sales growth, the highest level scene in the last five years. Most encouragingly, it was 5% volume growth that drove the global sales increase. The increase was led by our Asia/Latin America segment which posted 16% growth excluding foreign exchange. We invested heavily behind advertising and promotion and in sales force expansion in the key gross markets, which led to solid market share gains across the American markets of Asia and Latin America. 
Our U.S. business grew despite continued decline in both birth and formula consumption, fueled by successful new product launches including our patented Jewel prebiotics, unique packaging system and a newborn product formulated for the first three months of life.
In June, we launched our first joint venture as a public company with Almarai, the leading regional food and dairy producer serving markets in the Middle East. Sales into the market started in the fourth quarter, although we are still in an investment mode with this JV, this demonstrates our commitment of fueling long-term growth and expanding Mead Johnson's global presence. 
Sales outside the U.S. came to represent 68% of the company total, up from 65% in 2009 and 62% in 2008. We opened a new Pediatric Nutrition Institute or PNI in Evansville, Indiana, that gives us the capability of scaling up new manufacturing processes without disrupting our operating plans. We also broke ground on a new PNI in Guangzhou, China, which is set to open late this year and serve as a base of product development in this critical market. 
We set new productivity records that helped to mitigate the impact of higher dairy and commodity cost on our gross margins. We set our earnings record while absorbing a $24 million hit from the January 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, along with the $11 million in incremental non-cash pension expense and $18 million in shares service cost overlap. And as a result of our November 2009 debt refinancing, interest expense was nearly cut in half and we drove further reductions in our effective tax rate from 30% in 2009 to only 29% in 2010 both contributing strongly to our earnings improvement.
Finally, we made significant progress in building our stand-alone infrastructure, establishing critical capabilities necessary for us to operate independently. Following significant effort by a large number of our associates around the world, we completed the design of our global SAP technology platform during 2010. And went live with the new system in North America during the fourth quarter.
Let's now turn our focus to our regional segments. The impressive growth in Asia and Latin America was led by China and Hong Kong which together, reported sales of $745 million in 2010 and now account to 24% of our global revenues. By the end of 2010, we were fully resort in a 193 cities in china. In 2011, we expect to expand our China geographic footprint into an additional 50 cities through our disciplined step change program. And our Asia/Latin America growth beyond just china. We saw strong gains in many markets including Malaysia and Singapore, as well as in key Latin America markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. 
Earlier this month I traveled to Mexico City, where I had the pleasure of opening our new Latin-American regional headquarters office, as well as our new Latin America Pediatric Nutrition Institute. This is our third PNI research facility. Our important investment in Latin America will help accelerate our growth and allow us to strengthen innovation and product development for infants and children in the region. 
Those in the United States increased 5% in the fourth quarter partially offset by a decline in Europe. I'll talk about our U.S. business in more details shortly but let me the first highlight some of the factors that influenced sales in Europe, which account for about 4% of our global business. 
The decline in Europe is largely attributable to the timing of shipments in certain markets. However, we are seeing some evidence in the drop of in the birthrate in key markets like Spain, that are particularly important to us. Further, there is a shift to the lower-price food store channel away from pharmacist, where our infant formula Nutramigen and other specialty products are sold. 
Turning back to the U.S., we're pleased with the 5% sales growth in the quarter. That's solid progress compared to the 3% real growth we delivered in the third quarter particularly in light of the continued drop in the overall U.S. market. The CDC recently released new information that indicates that U.S. births were down 4% in the first half of 2010 relative to the first half of 2009. That's an acceleration from the 2.6% drop seen in 2009. WIC infant participation data is more current and is now available through October 2010. The data shows the birth is still declining with lower WIC infant participation in the third and early fourth quarters.
Lower consumption from extended breast-feeding or earlier transition to cow's milk is also being seen. We continue to believe that the U.S. birthrate will ultimately rebound. There are signs of an improving economy that should ultimately lead to higher birth. The continued high unemployment in the U.S., as well as the natural lag between planning a pregnancy and the birth would suggest that birth will decline in 2011 and that we won't see any recovery until 2012 at the earliest. 
The contraction in the U.S. market has massed the continued gain in our market share during the fourth quarter that we started to see following the product and packaging innovations launched in the second and third quarters, along with the spike due to our competitive product recoil late September. That competitor is now back on show, but we currently expect 2011 market share on average to be higher than 2010 and offset a lower number of births and reduced formula consumption.
Let's now turn our attention to our outlook for 2011. We expect to produce another year of sales and earnings growth, and are initiating  2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, up from $2.42 per share in 2010.
The assumptions underlying these non-GAAP estimate  include a sales increase of 7% to 8% excluding foreign exchange. At this early point in the year, we anticipate that the top line growth will be more heavily weighted towards volume than price. 
Finally, you will see us continuing increase investments behind demand generation and new product innovation to fuel future growth.
I'll turn the call over to Pete, to provide you further highlights and we'll return to wrap up and take your questions."

I'd like to start with our 2010 financial results, provide some color on cash flow and also a bit more detail on 2011. Since Steve covered sales growth by segment, let me focus on the cost and margin side of the equation. 
First, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 62.3%, down from the 63.4% reported both in the third quarter and on a full-year basis. Higher dairy and commodity costs were at work. We saw spot prices for milk increase during the second quarter and it takes about six months for these to work through our cost of good sold. Our children's nutrition product, largely sold in Asia and Latin America, contain a higher percentage of dairy by weight. While the impact was more pronounced on this emerging market segment.
In 2011, commodity costs are expected to increase on average in the high single-digits. Led by higher dairy prices, other agricultural raw materials and packaging.
Over the last two months, we've seen milk price increases of 5% to as much as 15%. We expect this balance, higher commodity cost with strong productivity in some pricing resulting in gross margins averaging 63.5% in line with 2010.
Operating expenses reached almost 41% of sales in the fourth quarter. The highest level of any quarter this past year and above the 39.4% for the full-year. The shares of this cost overlap came in at $11 million, more than double the level seen in the third quarter. As a reminder, this overlap represents the temporary duplication of the IT, finance and indirect procurement costs, as we transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to IBM. 
We successfully launched SAP in our North American markets and as a result, started to use IBM services to a greater extent during the fourth quarter. We will roll out SAP in our international markets throughout 2011, and charges from IBM will increase as a result. 
On a full-year basis, the overlap is expected to grow from $18 million in 2010 to as much as $24 million in 2011, costing us about $0.02 in earnings. We expect to be completely off the Bristol-Myers share service in IT technology platform by the end of this year.
Our total share service cost overlap over 2010 and 2011 is expected to fall in the range of $40 million to $42 million in line with our prior projection.
While operating expenses will be stressed a bit by the increase in share of service costs and a few other items, I'll discuss in a minute, we will start to leverage over G&A structure in 2011. While allowing for continued high levels of investment and demand generation.
We expect total operating expenses to center around 39.5% of sales. We will see greater G&A leverage reflected in 2012 and beyond after the completion of our SAP projects.
Let me highlight the overall impact from foreign exchange on our financial results. In 2010, sales increased by 2% for the full year from foreign exchange. The biggest contributor was the weakening of the dollar, most notably in Asia. This favorable impact was muted by the January 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar that took a full point of our sales growth over the course of the year and reduced earnings on a pretax basis by $24 million versus 2009 or $0.08 per share.
Unfortunately, we are facing further headwinds from the bolivar as we enter 2011. In last year's devaluation, the Venezuelan government introduced a dual exchange rate. The first rate for the 2.6 bolivars per dollar was for importing essential goods, including much of our product line. The second, set at 4.3 bolivars per dollar applied to all other goods, as well as profits realized in country.
In December 31st, Venezuela eliminated the dual-rate structure and converged the essentials rate to 4.3 bolivars per dollar. You will see $0.02 of reduced earnings in 2011 relative to 2010 just from this section alone.
Please note that under our current market rate, foreign exchange should add about a point and a half to top line growth in 2011.  After the bolivar exchange rate unification, the bottom line impact is a $0.01 or $0.02 of additional earning.
As Steve mentioned earlier, lower interest expense and a reduced tax rate contributed to earnings growth for 2010. We refinanced our debt in late 2009 and also swapped $700 million of our $1.5 billion in six rate notes of floating interest rates. This swaps allowed us to benefit from the low interest rate environment in 2010. When rates start to surmise, we took advantage of the appreciative value of the swap and unwound $200 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense should increase from $49 million into the low to mid-$50 million range, depending on weather we unwind the $500 million and remaining six defloating interest swaps.
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $596 million in cash. Up $35 million from December of 2009. That's after retiring $120 million in debt outstanding against our revolving credit facility in the first quarter, $50 million in contribution to our frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., a dividend increase of 12.5% and $172 million in cash use for capital expenditures, up 80% versus 2009. Investments in our IT technology platform and new packaging lines were the key drivers of the increase. 
Note that on an accrued basis, reflecting actual work performed during the year, capital spending was $143 million consistent with our $150 million guidance. Accrued capital expenditures for 2011 are currently expected to be about $125 million. Capital spending necessary for our SAP build out will continue through the year. 
Importantly, there are two non-cash expenses that will reduce earnings per share by a total of $0.09 in 2011 relative to 2010. First, depreciation and amortization expense totaled $65 million in 2010. We expect that to grow to $75 million, largely as a result of our capital investments in IT. The majority of the $10 million DNA increase, which equates to about $0.04 per share, will be seen in operating expenses as our new IT system support many business processes like sales management, order to cash, accounting and indirect procurement.
Secondly, non-cash compensation expense will perform its base equity wards will increase from $20 million to about $35 million, equivalent to another $0.05 in earnings per share. The majority of our annual equity awards are in the form of option and performance shares. With the expense recognized over their three-year vesting period.
As each year has passed since our 2009 IPO, we recognize the expense from an additional award. Though the buildup to three-full years of equity awards from 2009, 2010, and 2011 will be reflected in stock-based compensation expense for the first time. Our higher stock price is also a factor. Note that we should not see increases in equity expense of this magnitude in 2012 and beyond with our current three-year equity award cycle.
We made solid progress in 2010 managing controllable working capital, which we defined as trade receivable, inventory and accounts payable. Given our high growth rates, we measure ourselves in a percentage of sales basis. We reduced average working capital to 8.7% of sales in 2010 from 12.4% in 2009 and almost 15% in 2008.
This strong results were delivered as inventory and accounts payable management received strong focus and help us achieve performance significantly better than the 11.4% average seen by our peers.
Let me wrap up my prepared remarks by pulling together the details on our initial 2011 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $2 and $0.55 to $2 and $0.65 per share. This is based on constant dollar sales growth of 7% to 8% with mid-teen growth in Asia, Latin America and low-single-digit growth in North America, Europe. Foreign exchange would add another 1.5% at today's rates. We are currently assuming gross margin to center around 63.5% in line with 2010. 
Operating expenses, measured as a percent of sale should be relatively flat at about 39.5% after absorbing $0.09 in added non-cash expense for G&A along with equity-based compensation. 
And finally, the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to fall between 28% and 29%. All in all, we've targeted another strong year of performance. Before I turn the call back to Steve, let me offer my thanks to Kathryn for her dedicated service to Mead Johnson.

As I mentioned in the script that Europe accounts were about 4% of our business. The business has grown over time but represents a lower proportion of sales as the consequence of the rapid growth in our Asia/Latin-American businesses. We have a very strong position in the allergy management sector, particularly with our Nutramigen brand. And we have a growing presence in a few selected markets in the premium routine and some formula segment. Nevertheless, the region is seeing many of the same fundamental changes that we see in North America with lower birth, and lower consumption. It's also a very competitive region and as you stated, Ed, there is something of a shift due to the challenging economy from the pharmacist to the food channel, where lower-price offerings are available. We will continue to evolve our strategy and our business model. In 2011 we riveted on the transformation to the new SAP technology platform to the new distributor program model. And ensuring that we continue to grow the core parts of our business in selected areas. But don't expect it to increase as a proportion of our business in the foreseeable future.

As you read in our press release, we concluded 2010 on a very strong note and delivered another year of record sales and earnings. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter were up 19% from 2009, bringing our full year EPS to $2.42 per share up 9% from the prior year. We accomplished many important goals in 2010, the most notable of which include over 9% constant dollar sales growth, the highest level seen in the last five years. Most encouragingly, it was 5% volume growth that drove the global sales increase. The increase was led by our Asia/Latin America segment which posted 16% growth excluding foreign exchange. We invested heavily behind advertising and promotion, and in sales force expansion in key gross markets, which led to solid market share gains across the American markets of Asia and Latin America. 
Our U.S. business grew despite continued declines in both births and formula consumption, fueled by successful new product launches including our patented Dual Prebiotics' unique packaging system and a newborn product formulated for the first three months of life.
In June, we launched our first joint venture as a public company with Almarai, the leading regional food and dairy producer serving markets in the Middle East. Sales into the market started in the fourth quarter.  Although we are still in an investment mode with this JV, this demonstrates our commitment of fueling long-term growth and to expanding Mead Johnson's global presence. 
Sales outside the U.S. came to represent 68% of the company total, up from 65% in 2009 and 62% in 2008. We opened a new Pediatric Nutrition Institute or PNI in Evansville, Indiana, that gives us the capability of scaling up new manufacturing processes without disrupting our operating plans. We also broke ground on a new PNI in Guangzhou, China, which is set to open late this year and serve as a base for product development in this critical market. 
We set new productivity records that helped to mitigate the impact of higher dairy and commodity costs on our gross margins. We set our earnings record while absorbing a $24 million hit from the January 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, along with a $11 million in incremental non-cash pension expense and $18 million in shared service cost overlap. And as a result of our November 2009 debt refinancing, interest expense was nearly cut in half, and we drove further reductions in our effective tax rate from 30% in 2009 to under 29% in 2010, both contributing strongly to our earnings improvement.
Finally, we made significant progress in building our stand-alone infrastructure, establishing critical capabilities necessary for us to operate independently. Following significant effort by a large number of our associates around the world, we completed the design of our global SAP technology platform during 2010 and went live with the new system in North America during the fourth quarter.
Let's now turn our focus to our regional segments. The impressive growth in Asia and Latin America was led by China and Hong Kong, which together reported sales of $745 million in 2010 and now account for 24% of our global revenues. By the end of 2010, we were fully resourced in 193 cities in China. In 2011, we expect to expand our China geographic footprint into an additional 50 cities through our disciplined step change program. But our Asia/Latin America growth goes beyond just China. We saw strong gains in many markets, including Malaysia and Singapore, as well as in key Latin America markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. 
Earlier this month I traveled to Mexico City, where I had the pleasure of opening our new Latin American regional headquarters office, as well as our new Latin America Pediatric Nutrition Institute. This is our third PNI research facility. Our important investment in Latin America will help accelerate our growth and allow us to strengthen innovation and product development for infants and children in the region. 
Sales in the United States increased 5% in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a decline in Europe. I'll talk about our U.S. business in more detail shortly, but let me the first highlight some of the factors that influenced sales in Europe, which account for about 4% of our global business. 
The decline in Europe is largely attributable to the timing of shipments in certain markets. However, we are seeing some evidence of a drop in the birthrate in key markets like Spain that are particularly important to us. Further, there is a shift to the lower-price food store channel away from pharmacies, where our infant formula Nutramigen and other specialty products are sold. 
Turning back to the U.S., we're pleased with the 5% sales growth in the fourth quarter. That's solid progress compared to the 3% real growth we delivered in the third quarter, particularly in light of the continued drop in the overall U.S. market. The CDC recently released new information that indicates that U.S. births were down 4% in the first half of 2010 relative to the first half of 2009. That's an acceleration from the 2.6% drop seen in 2009. WIC infant participation data is more current and is now available through October of 2010. The data shows that births are still declining with lower WIC infant participation in the third and early fourth quarters.
Lower consumption from extended breast-feeding or earlier transition to cow's milk is also being seen. We continue to believe that the U.S. birthrate will ultimately rebound. There are signs of an improving economy that should ultimately lead to higher births. But continued high unemployment in the U.S., as well as the natural lag between planning a pregnancy and the birth, would suggest that births will decline in 2011 and that we won't see any recovery until 2012 at the earliest. 
The contraction in the U.S. market has masked the continued gain in our market share during the fourth quarter that we started to see following the product and packaging innovations launched in the second and third quarters, along with a spike due to a competitor's product recall in late September. That competitor is now back on shelf, but we currently expect 2011 market share on average to be higher than 2010 and offset a lower number of births and reduced formula consumption.
Let's now turn our attention to our outlook for 2011. We expect to produce another year of sales and earnings growth and are initiating 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, up from $2.42 per share in 2010.
Key assumptions underlying this non-GAAP estimate  include a sales increase of 7% to 8% excluding foreign exchange. At this early point in the year, we anticipate that the top line growth will be more heavily weighted towards volume than price. 
Finally, you will see us continue to increase investments behind demand generation and new product innovation to fuel future growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights, and will return to wrap up and take your questions."

I'd like to start with our 2010 financial results, provide some color on cash flow and also a bit more detail on 2011. Since Steve covered sales growth by segment, let me focus on the cost and margin side of the equation. 
First, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 62.3%, down from the 63.4% reported both in the third quarter and on a full year basis. Higher dairy and commodity costs were at work. We saw spot prices for milk increase during the second quarter, and it takes about six months for these to work through our cost of good sold. Our children's nutrition products, largely sold in Asia and Latin America, contain a higher percentage of dairy by weight, so the impact was more pronounced on this emerging market segment.
In 2011, commodity costs are expected to increase on average in the high single digits. Led by higher dairy prices, other agricultural raw materials and packaging.
Over the last two months, we've seen milk price increases of 5% to as much as 15%. We expect to balance higher commodity costs with strong productivity and some pricing, resulting in gross margins averaging 63.5% in line with 2010.
Operating expenses reached almost 41% of sales in the fourth quarter, the highest level of any quarter this past year and above the 39.4% for the full year. The shared service cost overlap came in at $11 million, more than double the level seen in the third quarter. As a reminder, this overlap represents the temporary duplication of IT, finance and indirect procurement costs as we transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to IBM. 
We successfully launched SAP in our North American markets and as a result, started to use IBM services to a greater extent during the fourth quarter. We will roll out SAP in our international markets throughout 2011, and charges from IBM will increase as a result. 
On a full year basis, the overlap is expected to grow from $18 million in 2010 to as much as $24 million in 2011, costing us about $0.02 in earnings. We expect to be completely off the Bristol-Myers shared service and IT technology platform by the end of this year.  Our total shared service cost overlap over 2010 and 2011 is expected to fall in the range of $40 million to $42 million, in line with our prior projections.
While operating expenses will be stressed a bit by the increase in shared service costs and a few other items I'll discuss in a minute, we will start to leverage our G&A structure in 2011, while allowing for continued high levels of investment and demand generation.
We expect total operating expenses to center around 39.5% of sales. We will see greater G&A leverage reflected in 2012 and beyond after the completion of our SAP projects.
Let me highlight the overall impact from foreign exchange on our financial results. In 2010, sales increased by 2% for the full year from foreign exchange. The biggest contributor was the weakening of the dollar, most notably in Asia. But this favorable impact was muted by the January 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar that took a full point off our sales growth over the course of the year and reduced earnings on a pretax basis by $24 million versus 2009 or $0.08 per share.
Unfortunately, we are facing further headwinds from the bolivar as we enter 2011. In last year's devaluation, the Venezuelan government introduced a dual exchange rate. The first rate, set at 2.6 bolivars per dollar, was for importing essential goods, including much of our product line. The second, set at 4.3 bolivars per dollar, applied to all other goods, as well as profits realized in country.
In December 31st, Venezuela eliminated the dual-rate structure and converged the essentials rate to 4.3 bolivars per dollar. We will see $0.02 of reduced earnings in 2011 relative to 2010 just from this action alone.
Please note that under current market rates, foreign exchange should add about a point and a half to top line growth in 2011.  After the bolivar exchange rate unification, the bottom line impact is a $0.01 or $0.02 of additional earnings.
As Steve mentioned earlier, lower interest expense and a reduced tax rate contributed to earnings growth in 2010. We refinanced our debt in late 2009 and also swapped $700 million of our $1.5 billion in fixed rate notes with floating interest rates. These swaps allowed us to benefit from the low interest rate environment in 2010. When rates started to rise, we took advantage of the appreciated value of the swaps and unwound $200 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense should increase from $49 million into the low to mid-$50 million range, depending on whether we unwind the $500 million and remaining fixed to floating interest rate swaps.
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $596 million in cash, up $35 million from December of 2009. That's after retiring $120 million in debt outstanding against our revolving credit facility in the first quarter, $50 million in contributions to our frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., a dividend increase of 12.5% and $172 million in cash used for capital expenditures, up 80% versus 2009. Investments in our IT technology platform and new packaging lines were the key drivers of the increase. 
Note that on an accrued basis, reflecting actual work performed during the year, capital spending was $143 million, consistent with our $150 million guidance. Accrued capital expenditures for 2011 are currently expected to be about $125 million. Capital spending necessary for our SAP build-out will continue through the year. 
Importantly, there are two non-cash expenses that will reduce earnings per share by a total of $0.09 in 2011 relative to 2010. First, depreciation and amortization expense totaled $65 million in 2010. We expect that to grow to $75 million, largely as a result of our capital investments in IT. A majority of the $10 million G&A increase, which equates to about $0.04 per share, will be seen in operating expenses, as our new IT systems support many business processes like sales managements, order to cash, accounting and indirect procurement.
Secondly, non-cash compensation expense for performance-based equity awards will increase from $20 million to about $35 million, equivalent to another $0.05 in earnings per share. The majority of our annual equity awards are in the form of options and performance shares, with the expense recognized over their three-year vesting period.
As each year has passed since our 2009 IPO, we've recognized the expense from an additional award, though the buildup to three full years of equity awards from 2009, 2010, and 2011 will be reflected in stock-based compensation expense for the first time. Our higher stock price is also a factor. Note that we should not see increases in equity expense of this magnitude in 2012 and beyond with our current three-year equity award cycle.
We made solid progress in 2010 managing controllable working capital, which we define as trade receivables, inventory and accounts payable. Given our high growth rates, we measure ourselves on a percentage of sales basis. We reduced average working capital to 8.7% of sales in 2010 from 12.4% in 2009 and almost 15% in 2008.
These strong results were delivered as inventory and accounts payable management received strong focus and helped us achieve performance significantly better than the 11.4% average seen by our peers.
Let me wrap up my prepared remarks by pulling together the details on our initial 2011 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. This is based on constant dollar sales growth of 7% to 8% with mid-teen growth in Asia, Latin America and low single-digit growth in North America, Europe. Foreign exchange would add another 1.5% at today's rates. We are currently assuming gross margins to center around 63.5% in line with 2010. 
Operating expenses, measured as a percent of sales should be relatively flat at about 39.5% after absorbing $0.09 in added non-cash expense for G&A along with equity-based compensation. 
And finally, the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to fall between 28% and 29%. All in all, we've targeted another strong year of performance. Before I turn the call back to Steve, let me offer my thanks to Kathryn for her dedicated service to Mead Johnson.

As I mentioned in the script, that Europe accounts for about 4% of our business. The business has grown over time but represents a lower proportion of sales as a consequence of the rapid growth in our Asia/Latin American businesses. We have a very strong position in the allergy management sector, particularly with our Nutramigen brand. And we have a growing presence in a few selected markets in the PREMIUM, Routine, and Per Formula segments. Nevertheless, the region is seeing many of the same fundamental changes that we see in North America, with lower birth and lower consumption. It's also a very competitive region, and as you stated, Ed, there is something of a shift, due to the challenging economy from the pharmacies to the food channel, where lower-price offerings are available. We will continue to evolve our strategy and our business model. In 2011, we riveted on the transformation to the new SAP technology platform to the new distributor program model.

This is the highest quar",801,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Well, 2011 is off to a great start. As you've likely read in our press release, in the first quarter, sales of $900 million grew by 18% or 15% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the highest quarterly growth recorded for many years and is testimony to our strategy. 
Our growth was led by the strength of our business in emerging markets, but also by improved performance in the U.S. In addition, strong gross margins, the timing of demand generation investments and the slightly lower tax rate versus 2010 each contributed to impressive financial results. 
The fundamental drivers in our strategy and operations have not changed, so I'll keep my comments brief and only address key highlights. Sales for the Asia/Latin America markets grew at a rate of 27% or 22% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This segment now accounts for over 64% of sales, up from 60% in the first quarter of 2010. This exceptional performance was led by China and Hong Kong, where sales grew well in excess of our segment average and where we continue to see gains in market share. 
I recently took several secondary cities in China that we have entered by our systematic step change program. As you may recall, this step change program expands our direct presence into more cities, with a full complement of advertising and promotional support and the addition of medical and trade sales staff. At year end 2010, we had a direct presence in 193 cities and intend to expand into at least another 50 this year. 
I traveled to both the western and eastern regions of China and was struck by the rapid development of world-class infrastructure and by the obvious strength of economic activity. We visited several leading hospitals and visited many retail outlets, including branches of international chains. The category in which Mead Johnson competes is growing very strongly in all of these cities, and our own brands are performing well ahead of expectations. 
While the step change program expands our geographic footprint, we are pleased that 80% of our growth continues to come from cities where we had a full presence in the prior year quarter. 
Our brand equity, science and product quality, geographic footprint expansion and strong execution have all contributed to Mead Johnson achieving market share leadership in China/Hong Kong, and we continue to believe that significant growth will be sustained for many years. 
While China is our largest business outside the U.S., I want to highlight that nearly all of our Latin America markets posted double-digit growth. 
In the North America/Europe segment, both recorded and constant dollar sales grew by 5%. Sales in the U.S. increased at a rate above the segment average but were partially offset by lower sales in Europe, distorted by our transition to a new distribution model. We're very pleased with a strong U.S. performance as it was largely driven by higher market share from product and packaging innovation, as well as a benefit from a competitive product recall last September. 
We've seen encouraging support from consumers, healthcare professionals and the retail trade for our patented newborn infant formula, our Dual Prebiotics plan in the new packaging system comprised of a plastic system comprised of a plastic tab with a retail value box. 
Keep in mind that year-over-year shared comparisons will get tougher in the second half of 2011 since our key competitor is back on shelf, and we will loose the benefit of the parents who switched to Enfamil last fall as their babies age out of the category. 
Additionally, we continue to be pressured by the lower birth rate and reduced consumption in the U.S. The most recent shows that the number of infants participating in the program continues to fall. On a full year basis, our sales in the U.S. are expected to grow slightly as higher market share offsets these downward pressures on the category. 
For the full year, we now anticipate constant dollar global sales growth of around 10% based on our strong performance in the quarter, particularly in emerging markets, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.62 to $2.70 per share. EPS in the remaining quarters of the year will be lower on average than the first quarter, reflecting headwinds from higher dairy costs and increased operating expenses. 
Advertising and promotion spending ran at a low level in the first quarter due to the phasing of key activities so much of the planned increase in operating expense is yet to come. We'll continue to invest in our strong momentum and look for additional growth opportunities in our priority markets. I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and will return to wrap up and take our questions."

Let me add a few more details on our Q1 financial results. The 15% increase in constant dollar sales was comprised of 4% from pricing and volume gains of 11%. As has been the case for many quarters, all of the pr",970,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me add a few more details on our Q1 financial results. The 15% increase in constant dollar sales was comprised of 4% from pricing and volume gains of 11%. As has been the case for many quarters, all of the price growth came from our Asia/Latin America segment. 
We took increased pricing in select markets during the quarter and also realized the carryover of inflationary increases taken in other markets during the second half of last year. 
Volume gains of 15% in the Asia/Latin America segment were very broad-based across most markets, while the 5% in North America/Europe was largely driven by the strength of our U.S. business. Note that about 2 points of our Asia/Latin America sales growth was due to snow-related delivery delays in China late last December. That moved sales recognition from the fourth quarter to the current quarter. For the company in total, that was equivalent to just over one point of sales growth or about $0.02 per share in added earnings. 
Keep in mind that sales comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of this year. Over the first 6 months of 2010, we delivered constant dollar sales growth of 5%, jumping to 13% in the second half. As a result, our full year sales growth estimate of around 10% for 2011 is below the 15% delivered in the first quarter. Note that we currently expect about a 1/3-2/3 split between pricing and volume for the full year. 
Turning to foreign exchange, we expect currency fluctuation to add about 2 points to sales growth for the full year. However, we won't see any benefit to our bottom line. In fact, foreign exchange movement adversely affected our bottom line in the first quarter. 
The dollar fell slightly or was flat against most currencies over the last 3 months. In general, a weakening dollar increases sales and earnings. One of the key exceptions is the euro where we have costs which exceed revenues. Our business in Europe is relatively small, and most of the capacity for our Dutch plant is exported to Asia. As a result of the short position, earnings dropped when the dollar weakened against the euro, and that was the scenario we faced in the first quarter as the dollar fell by 6%. This factor, coupled with the devaluation of the Vietnam dong resulted in a balance sheet remeasurement that reduced pretax earnings by over $8 million or $0.03 per share. Note that the impact is evident in other expenses on our income statement.
Gross margins came in at 64.4% for the first quarter, flat with the prior year and up 210 basis points from the fourth quarter. We saw a temporary benefit in our cost of goods sold from lower dairy stock prices in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, there is a natural lag of about 7 months before stock price fluctuation show up in our product costs, reflecting pricing mechanisms in supply contracts in our normal inventory turns. 
We are facing higher dairy prices in our cost of goods sold for the rest of the year, and that will bring full year gross margins to give or take 63.3%. That's a drop of about 20 basis points versus our prior guidance, which anticipated average 2011 gross margins of 63.5%. 
Over the last 3 months, we have seen global dairy prices continue to increase. They have stabilized a bit in the last month but we will continue to watch commodity costs closely and take our own pricing actions where appropriate. 
Operating expenses were 37.9% from the first quarter, below the 39.5% anticipated for the full year, largely from timing of advertising and promotion spend. A&P can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of product launches or promotional campaigns. A&P stood at 12.4% in Q1, 160 basis points below the 14% expected for the full year. 
As Steve mentioned, we will continue to maintain an A&P and sales force spending as a percentage of sales in line with our higher sales growth. We use this as an opportunity to help fuel additional demand generation investments. This factor, coupled with the FX balance sheet remeasurement spend mentioned earlier will keep full year operating expenses at our January projection of 39.5%. 
Our effective tax rate or ETR, came in at 29.4%, down from 31% from the first quarter of 2010. Please note that we previously expected the full year rate to range from 28% to 29%. We now believe that we'll be at or slightly above 29% as our earnings mix have shifted towards markets that carry higher ETRs. Compared to the midpoint of our prior range, the increased tax rate reduces 2011 earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Pulling all this information together, we now expect 2011 earnings to range between $2.62 to $2.70 per share, up from the $2.55 to $2.65 anticipated 3 months ago. Stronger sales growth in emerging markets is the key driver, partially offset by the impact of higher dairy costs, foreign exchange, higher investments for sustainable growth and a slight increase in our effective tax rate. 
Finally, our cash balance stood at $709 million, up from $596 million in December. That strong performance, given that we repurchased 400,000 shares in the quarter, consuming $24 million of cash. Although the timing and amount of future share repurchases may vary, our program is designed to help reduce the dilutive impact of employee equity awards. When coupled with the 16% increase in our quarterly dividend, we are returning a meaningful portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. For the full year, capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense are expected to be about $125 million and $75 million, respectively. With that, let me now turn the call back to Steve."

I think that clearly, your question is likely focused on China and what may happen there.

That was due to the fact that there was some heavy snow, particularly in eastern and northern China in late December, and we had a lot of goods that have been shipped but had not been yet received and we didn't recognize the sales on that until the first quarter so that's 2 points of it. In addition, David, there was one other factor I would point out. In Venezuela, you may recall in January 1, 2010, the government devalued the currency significantly and put in some new control. And as a result of that dislocation plus the fact that we were transitioning product registrations down there from BMS to Mead Johnson, our sales were abnormally light in the first quarter of last year. That added about another 4 points to sales growth in the quarter. So absent those, it's probably closer to '12. The other thing I would point out is keep in mind, if you look at the quarterly sales from 2010, we did see that very significant increase, and this was true not only in the United States but also in North America/Europe but also in Asia/Latin America. So the comparisons are just a bit easier this quarter than I think that happened. That doesn't allow the fact that we had very, very good performance in the year in terms of volume growth in Asia/Latin America but just an easier comparison as well."

As you know, they take a very disciplined approach to that, and we will not expand that number unless we're absolutely confident of our ability to be successful in all of the cities in which we operate. You're right, I was struck in my visit. I spent many years living in Asia, I've actually been in China market 50x by I haven't been to a number of these so-called secondary cities. And I was absolutely struck not only by their size, by their quality of infrastructure, by the obvious economic activity but also by the rapid momentum of the international brands in our categories and most particularly of course, our own brands. Most surprisingly, parents in those cities aspire just as parents in the bigger cities, they aspire for their children to be successful in life and nutrition plays a critical role in that. And they are rapidly entering the middle class, and therefore are able to afford a product for the several years. I was reassured that our strategy was right, and I was also reassured that our confidence in sustainable growth was well placed."

What we call the influence model of the 3-pillar demand creation strategy is direct-to-consumer through the healthcare, professional and in partnership with retailers and pharmacies.

We continue to see very, very strong growth throughout Latin America. Mexico delivered double-digit growth, which is quite impressive if you consider the fact that half of the business there is milk modifiers, our choco milk and calcitonin brands, which that segment is not growing for any purposes. So we're growing very, very heavily with our Enfa brand there, not only infant formula but also the growing-up milks. The rest of Latin America performed superbly. Great growth in Brazil. When we look at Central America, Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, very, very strong double-digit growth. On Asia, I would also say of particular note in terms of growth Malaysia, Singapore. Singapore's a bit small but very, very strong performance there. Probably, the markets where there's, they're a bit more challenged, I would say, tend to be the ones and this is not new information but more price-sensitive markets. So the Philippines, in particular, we sell a premium brand in Enfa. We have a midtier brand in Lactum. But where the growth occurring in that market is occurring all even outside the categories where we compete. So full cream milk or filled milk, which are less nutritious substitutes for the products that we would sell. That segment of the market, which is lower-priced than where we compete, had tended to grow quite rapidly at the expense of declines for where we do compete. So a little tougher comparisons for the Philippines there although we are picking up share for particularly for our Enfa brand in that market."

I know you've been following us for a relatively short period of time. What we've seen is a significant reduction in the birth rate in the United States over 2-, 3-year period, and a reduction in consumption, driven by reform in the WIC Program and by the weak economic conditions. What we're reporting today and have been talking about for a couple of quarters now is our market share growth within that weaker market, driven primarily by our innovations and by our improved demand creation activities but also benefiting from the competitive recall back last September. So what we've referenced this morning is continued pessimism, if you like, about the category. We do not expect with the start to rise again, at least until 2012, potentially even later, but we are determined to continue to maintain a strong market share in the category so that when the birth rate does recover, as it will, we are in the strongest possible position. We're largely dependent on competing within a lower-volume category, and we often get a question on price. So I will make just one comment on price. We did announce to the retail channel yesterday that we will be taking price increase in the United States on our core routine products later this year. We have not taken a price increase for several years and clearly, we've introduced a number of product improvements since then and seen commodity costs continue to rise.

They will treat 8 liquid ounces of equivalent with 8 powder ounces. And so that is not -- we have not raised pricing at all. Part of what goes through there as well too, is we do have a favorable product mix coming in the U.S., and that while our routine business is doing exceptionally strong, we also are seeing very good growth with our solutions products, essentially as the partially hydrolyzed formula, which carries a higher price point associated with it too. So that is part of what they have in their numbers. And definitely, with regard to the market share data, we have Nielsen cover it a different way for us. We do believe that Nestle's fair share of market share after the Abbott recall, they didn't get any more than that, and I think some of the latest data that we have seen would suggest that maybe that's dropped off just a tad. But they have not disproportionately benefited from it. I hope that, that helps you."

This is the highest q",800,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Well, 2011 is off to a great start. As you have likely read in our press release, in the first quarter, sales of $900 million grew by 18% or 15%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the highest quarterly growth recorded for many years and is testimony to our strategy. 
Our growth was led by the strength of our business in emerging markets, but also by improved performance in the U.S. In addition, strong gross margins, the timing of demand-generation investments and the slightly lower tax rate versus 2010 each contributed to impressive financial results. 
The fundamental drivers in our strategy and operations have not changed, so I'll keep my comments brief and only address key highlights. Sales for the Asia/Latin America markets grew at a rate of 27% or 22%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This segment now accounts for over 64% of sales, up from 60% in the first quarter of 2010. This exceptional performance was led by China and Hong Kong, where sales grew well in excess of our segment average and where we continue to see gains in market share. 
I recently took several secondary cities in China that we have entered by our systematic step change program. As you may recall, this step change program expands our direct presence into more cities, with a full complement of advertising and promotional support and the addition of medical and trade sales staff. At year end 2010, we had a direct presence in 193 cities and intend to expand into at least another 50 this year. 
I traveled to both the western and eastern regions of China and was struck by the rapid development of world-class infrastructure and by the obvious strength of economic activity. We visited several leading hospitals and visited many retail outlets, including branches of international chains. The category in which Mead Johnson competes is growing very strongly in all of these cities, and our own brands are performing well ahead of expectations. 
While the step change program expands our geographic footprint, we are pleased that 80% of our growth continues to come from cities where we had a full presence in the prior year quarter. Our brand equity, science and product quality, geographic footprint expansion and strong execution have all contributed to Mead Johnson achieving market share leadership in China/Hong Kong, and we continue to believe that significant growth will be sustained for many years. While China is our largest business outside the U.S., I want to highlight that nearly all of our Latin America markets posted double-digit growth. 
In the North America/Europe segment, both recorded and constant dollar sales grew by 5%. Sales in the U.S. increased at a rate above the segment average, but were partially offset by lower sales in Europe, distorted by our transition to a new distribution model. We're very pleased with the strong U.S. performance, as it was largely driven by higher market share from product and packaging innovation, as well as a benefit from a competitive product recall last September. 
We've seen encouraging support from consumers, healthcare professionals and the retail trade for our patented newborn infant formula, our Dual Prebiotic plan in the new packaging system comprised of a plastic tub with a refill value box. 
Keep in mind that year-over-year share comparisons will get tougher in the second half of 2011 since our key competitor is back on shelf, and we will loose the benefit of the parents who switched to Enfamil last fall, as their babies age out of the category. 
Additionally, we continue to be pressured by the lower birth rate and reduced consumption in the U.S. The most recent WIC base that shows that the number of infants participating in the program continues to fall. On a full year basis, our sales in the U.S. are expected to grow slightly as higher market share offsets these downward pressures on the category. 
For the full year, we now anticipate constant dollar global sales growth of around 10% based on our strong performance in the quarter, particularly in emerging markets, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.62 to $2.70 per share. EPS in the remaining quarters of the year will be lower on average than the first quarter, reflecting headwinds from higher dairy costs and increased operating expenses. 
Advertising and promotion spending ran at a low level in the first quarter due to the phasing of key activities. So much of the planned increase in operating expense is yet to come. We will continue to invest in our strong momentum and look for additional growth opportunities in our priority markets. I'll now turn the call over to Pete, to provide you further highlights and will return to wrap up and take your questions."

Let me add a few more details on our Q1 financial results. The 15% increase in constant dollar sales was comprised of 4% from pricing and the volume gains of 11%. As has been the case for many quarters, all of th",971,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me add a few more details on our Q1 financial results. The 15% increase in constant dollar sales was comprised of 4% from pricing and the volume gains of 11%. As has been the case for many quarters, all of the price growth came from our Asia/Latin America segment. 
We took increased pricing in select markets during the quarter and also realized the carryover of inflationary increases taken in other markets during the second half of last year. 
Volume gains of 15% in the Asia/Latin America segment were very broad-based across most markets, while the 5% in North America/Europe was largely driven by the strength of our U.S. business. Note that about 2 points of our Asia/Latin America sales growth was due to snow-related delivery delays in China late last December. That moved sales recognition from the fourth quarter to the current quarter. For the company in total, that was equivalent to just over one point of sales growth or about $0.02 per share in added earnings. 
Keep in mind that sales comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of this year. Over the first 6 months of 2010, we delivered constant dollar sales growth of 5%, jumping to 13% in the second half. As a result, our full year sales growth estimate of around 10% for 2011 is below the 15% delivered in the first quarter. Note that we currently expect about a 1/3-2/3 split between pricing and volume for the full year. 
Turning to foreign exchange, we expect currency fluctuation to add about 2 points to sales growth for the full year. However, we won't see any benefits to our bottom line. In fact, foreign exchange movement adversely affected our bottom line in the first quarter. 
The dollar fell slightly or was flat against most currencies over the last 3 months. In general, a weakening dollar increased the sales and earnings. One of the key exceptions is the euro, where we have costs which exceed revenues. Our business in Europe is relatively small, and most of the capacity for our Dutch plant is exported to Asia. As a result of the sharp position, earnings dropped when the dollar weakened against the euro, and that was the scenario we faced in the first quarter as the dollar fell by 6%. This factor, coupled with the devaluation of the Vietnam dong resulted in a balance sheet remeasurement that reduced pretax earnings by over $8 million or $0.03 per share. Note that the impact is evident in other expenses on our income statement.
Gross margins came in at 64.4% for the first quarter, flat with the prior year and up 210 basis points from the fourth quarter. We saw a temporary benefit in our cost of goods sold from lower dairy stock prices in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, there is a natural lag of about 7 months before stock price fluctuation show up in our product costs, reflecting pricing mechanisms in supply contracts in our normal inventory turns. 
We are facing higher dairy prices in our cost of goods sold for the rest of the year, and that will bring full year gross margins to give or take 63.3%. That's a drop of about 20 basis points versus our prior guidance, which anticipated average 2011 gross margins of 63.5%. 
Over the last 3 months, we have seen global dairy prices continue to increase. They have stabilized a bit in the last month, but we will continue to watch commodity costs closely and take our own pricing actions where appropriate. 
Operating expenses were 37.9% from the first quarter, below the 39.5% anticipated for the full year, largely from timing of advertising and promotion spend. A&P can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of product launches or promotional campaigns. A&P stood at 12.4% in Q1, 160 basis points below the 14% expected for the full year. 
As Steve mentioned, we will continue to maintain A&P and sales force spending as a percentage of sales in line with our higher sales growth. We use this as an opportunity to help fuel additional demand generation investments. This factor, coupled with the FX balance sheet remeasurement spend mentioned earlier, will keep full year operating expenses at our January projection of 39.5%. 
Our effective tax rate or ETR, came in at 29.4%, down from 31% in the first quarter of 2010. Please note that we previously expected the full year rate to range from 28% to 29%. We now believe that we'll be at or slightly above 29% as our earnings mix has shifted toward markets that carry higher ETRs. Compared to the midpoint of our prior range, the increased tax rate reduces 2011 earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Pulling all this information together, we now expect 2011 earnings to range between $2.62 to $2.70 per share, up from the $2.55 to $2.65 anticipated 3 months ago. Stronger sales growth in emerging market is the key driver, partially offset by the impact of higher dairy costs, foreign exchange, higher investments for sustainable growth and a slight increase in our effective tax rate. 
Finally, our cash balance stood at $709 million, up from $596 million in December. That strong performance, given that we repurchased 400,000 shares in the quarter, consuming $24 million of cash. Although the timing and amount of future share repurchases may vary, our program is designed to help reduce the dilutive impact of employee equity awards. When coupled with the 16% increase in our quarterly dividend, we are returning a meaningful portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. For the full year, capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense are expected to be about $125 million and $75 million, respectively. With that, let me now turn the call back to Steve."

So that's 2 points of it. In addition, David, there was one other factor I would point out. In Venezuela, you may recall, on January 1, 2010, the government devalued the currency significantly and put in some new controls. And as result of that dislocation plus the fact that we were transitioning product registrations down there from BMS to Mead Johnson, our sales were abnormally light in the first quarter of last year. That added about another 4 point to sales growth in the quarter. So absent those, it's probably closer to '12. The other thing I would point out is, keep in mind, if you look at the quarterly sales from 2010, we did see that very significant increase, and this was true not only in the United States but also in North America/Europe but also in Asia/Latin America. So the comparisons are just a bit easier this quarter than I think that have been. That doesn't allow the fact that we had very, very good performance in the year in terms of volume growth in Asia/Latin America, but it's just an easier comparison as well."

Well, as you know, they take a very disciplined approach to that, and we will not expand that number unless we're absolutely confident of our ability to be successful in all the cities in which we operate. You're right, I am -- I was struck in my visit. I spent many years living in Asia, where I've been to China more than 50 times, but I haven't been to a number of these so-called secondary cities. And I was absolutely struck not only by their size, by the quality of infrastructure, by the obvious economic activity, but also by the rapid momentum of the international brands in our categories and most particularly, of course, our own brands. Most surprisingly, parents in those cities aspire, just as parents in the bigger cities, they aspire for their children to be successful in life, and nutrition plays a critical role in that. And they are rapidly entering the middle class, and therefore are able to afford our product for the several years. So I was reassured that our strategy was right, and I was also reassured that our confidence in sustainable growth was well-placed."

So we're growing very, very heavily with our Enfa brand there, not only infant formula but also the growing-up milks. The rest of Latin America performed superbly. Great growth in Brazil. When we look at Central America, Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, very, very, very strong double-digit growth. On Asia, I would also say markets of particular note in terms of growth were Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore's a bit small but very, very strong performance there. Probably, the markets where there's a bit more challenged, I would say, tend to be the ones that, and this is not new information, but more price-sensitive markets. So the Philippines, in particular, we sell a premium brand in Enfa. We have a mid-tier brand in Lactum. But where the growth is occurring in that market is occurring all even outside the categories where we compete, so full cream milk or filled milk, which are less nutritious substitutes for the products that we would sell. That segment of the market, which is lower-priced than where we compete, had tended to grow quite rapidly at the expense of declines for where we do compete. So a little tougher comparisons for the Philippines there, although we are picking up share for particularly for our Enfa brand in that market."

I know you've been following us for a relatively short period of time. What we've seen is that a significant reduction in the birth rate in the United States over a 2-, 3-year period, and a reduction in consumption, driven by reform in the WIC Program and by the weak economic conditions. What we're reporting today and have been talking about for a couple of quarters now is our market share growth within that weaker market, driven primarily by our innovations and by our improved demand creation activities, but also benefiting from the competitive recall back last September. So what we've referenced this morning is continued pessimism, if you like, about the category. We do not expect that births to start to rise again, at least until 2012, potentially even later. But we are determined to continue to maintain a strong market share in the category, so that when the birth rate does recover, as it will, we are in the strongest possible position. We're largely dependent on competing within a lower-volume category, and we often get a question on price. So I will make just one comment on price. We did announce to the retail channel yesterday that we will be taking a price increase in the United States on our core routine products later this year. We have not taken a price increase for several years, and clearly, we've introduced a number of product improvements since then and seen commodity costs continue to rise.

They will treat 8 liquid ounces of equivalent with 8 powder ounces. And so, that is not -- we have not raised pricing at all. Part of what goes through there as well, too, is we do have a favorable product mix coming in the U.S. And that while our routine business is doing exceptionally strong, we also are seeing very good growth with our solutions products, essentially, it's the partially hydrolyzed formula, which carries a higher price point associated with it, too. So that is part of what they have in their numbers. And definitely, with regard to the market share data, we have Nielsen cover it a different way for us. We do believe that Nestle's fair share of market share after the Abbott recall, they didn't get any more than that, and I think some of the latest data that we've seen would suggest that maybe that's dropped off just a tad. But they have not disproportionately benefited from it. I hope that, that helps you."

Well, 2011 is off to a great start. As you have likely read in our press release, in the first quarter, sales of $900 million grew by 18%, or 15% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the highest q",800,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Well, 2011 is off to a great start. As you have likely read in our press release, in the first quarter, sales of $900 million grew by 18%, or 15% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the highest quarterly growth recorded for many years and is testimony to our strategy. 
Our growth was led by the strength of our business in emerging markets, but also by improved performance in the U.S. In addition, strong gross margins, the timing of demand-generation investments and the slightly lower tax rate versus 2010 each contributed to impressive financial results. 
The fundamental drivers in our strategy and operations have not changed, so I'll keep my comments brief and only address key highlights. Sales for the Asia/Latin America markets grew at a rate of 27% or 22%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This segment now accounts for over 64% of sales, up from 60% in the first quarter of 2010. This exceptional performance was led by China and Hong Kong, where sales grew well in excess of our segment average and where we continue to see gains in market share. 
I recently took several secondary cities in China that we have entered by our systematic step change program. As you may recall, this step change program expands our direct presence into more cities, with a full complement of advertising and promotional support and the addition of medical and trade sales staff. At year end 2010, we had a direct presence in 193 cities and intend to expand into at least another 50 this year. 
I traveled to both the western and eastern regions of China and was struck by the rapid development of world-class infrastructure and by the obvious strength of economic activity. We visited several leading hospitals and visited many retail outlets, including branches of international chains. The category in which Mead Johnson competes is growing very strongly in all of these cities, and our own brands are performing well ahead of expectations. 
While the step change program expands our geographic footprint, we are pleased that 80% of our growth continues to come from cities where we had a full presence in the prior year quarter. Our brand equity, science and product quality, geographic footprint expansion and strong execution have all contributed to Mead Johnson achieving market share leadership in China/Hong Kong, and we continue to believe that significant growth will be sustained for many years. While China is our largest business outside the U.S., I want to highlight that nearly all of our Latin America markets posted double-digit growth. 
In the North America/Europe segment, both reported and constant dollar sales grew by 5%. Sales in the U.S. increased at a rate above the segment average, but were partially offset by lower sales in Europe, distorted by our transition to a new distribution model. We're very pleased with the strong U.S. performance, as it was largely driven by higher market share from product and packaging innovation, as well as a benefit from a competitor's product recall last September. 
We've seen encouraging support from consumers, healthcare professionals and the retail trade for our patented newborn infant formula, our Dual Prebiotic plan and the new packaging system comprised of a plastic tub with a refill value box. 
Keep in mind that year-over-year share comparisons will get tougher in the second half of 2011 since our key competitor is back on shelf, and we will lose the benefit of the parents who switched to Enfamil last fall, as their babies age out of the category. 
Additionally, we continue to be pressured by the lower birth rate and reduced consumption in the U.S. The most recent WIC data that shows that the number of infants participating in the program continues to fall. On a full year basis, our sales in the U.S. are expected to grow slightly as higher market share offsets these downward pressures on the category. 
For the full year, we now anticipate constant dollar global sales growth of around 10% based on our strong performance in the quarter, particularly in emerging markets, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.62 to $2.70 per share. EPS in the remaining quarters of the year will be lower on average than the first quarter, reflecting headwinds from higher dairy costs and increased operating expenses. 
Advertising and promotion spending ran at a low level in the first quarter due to the phasing of key activities. So much of the planned increase in operating expense is yet to come. We will continue to invest in our strong momentum and look for additional growth opportunities in our priority markets. I'll now turn the call over to Pete, to provide you further highlights and will return to wrap up and take your questions."

Let me add a few more details on our Q1 financial results. The 15% increase in constant dollar sales was comprised of 4% from pricing and volume gains of 11%. As has been the case for many quarters, all of the pr",970,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me add a few more details on our Q1 financial results. The 15% increase in constant dollar sales was comprised of 4% from pricing and volume gains of 11%. As has been the case for many quarters, all of the price growth came from our Asia/Latin America segment. 
We took increased pricing in select markets during the quarter and also realized the carryover of inflationary increases taken in other markets during the second half of last year. 
Volume gains of 15% in the Asia/Latin America segment were very broad-based across most markets, while the 5% in North America/Europe was largely driven by the strength of our U.S. business. Note that about 2 points of our Asia/Latin America sales growth was due to snow-related delivery delays in China late last December. That moved sales recognition from the fourth quarter to the current quarter. For the company in total, that was equivalent to just over one point of sales growth or about $0.02 per share in added earnings. 
Keep in mind that sales comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of this year. Over the first 6 months of 2010, we delivered constant dollar sales growth of 5%, jumping to 13% in the second half. As a result, our full year sales growth estimate of around 10% for 2011 is below the 15% delivered in the first quarter. Note that we currently expect about a 1/3-2/3 split between pricing and volume for the full year. 
Turning to foreign exchange, we expect currency fluctuation to add about 2 points to sales growth for the full year. However, we won't see any benefit to our bottom line. In fact, foreign exchange movement adversely affected our bottom line in the first quarter. 
The dollar fell slightly or was flat against most currencies over the last 3 months. In general, a weakening dollar increased the sales and earnings. One of the key exceptions is the euro, where we have costs which exceed revenues. Our business in Europe is relatively small, and most of the capacity for our Dutch plant is exported to Asia. As a result of this sharp position, earnings drop when the dollar weakens against the euro, and that was the scenario we faced in the first quarter as the dollar fell by 6%. This factor, coupled with the devaluation of the Vietnam dong resulted in a balance sheet remeasurement that reduced pretax earnings by over $8 million or $0.03 per share. Note that the impact is evident in other expenses on our income statement.
Gross margins came in at 64.4% for the first quarter, flat with the prior year and up 210 basis points from the fourth quarter. We saw a temporary benefit in our cost of goods sold from lower dairy spot prices in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, there is a natural lag of about 7 months before spot price fluctuations show up in our product costs, reflecting pricing mechanisms in supply contracts in our normal inventory turns. 
We are facing higher dairy prices in our cost of goods sold for the rest of the year, and that will bring full year gross margins to give or take 63.3%. That's a drop of about 20 basis points versus our prior guidance, which anticipated average 2011 gross margins of 63.5%. 
Over the last 3 months, we have seen global dairy prices continue to increase. They have stabilized a bit in the last month, but we will continue to watch commodity costs closely and take our own pricing actions where appropriate. 
Operating expenses were 37.9% from the first quarter, below the 39.5% anticipated for the full year, largely from timing of advertising and promotion spend. A&P can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of product launches or promotional campaigns. A&P stood at 12.4% in Q1, 160 basis points below the 14% expected for the full year. 
As Steve mentioned, we will continue to maintain A&P and sales force spending as a percentage of sales in line with our higher sales growth. We use this as an opportunity to help fuel additional demand generation investments. This factor, coupled with the FX balance sheet remeasurement spend mentioned earlier, will keep full year operating expenses at our January projection of 39.5%. 
Our effective tax rate or ETR, came in at 29.4%, down from 31% in the first quarter of 2010. Please note that we previously expected the full year rate to range from 28% to 29%. We now believe that we'll be at or slightly above 29% as our earnings mix has shifted toward markets that carry higher ETRs. Compared to the midpoint of our prior range, the increased tax rate reduces 2011 earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Pulling all this information together, we now expect 2011 earnings to range from $2.62 to $2.70 per share, up from the $2.55 to $2.65 anticipated 3 months ago. Stronger sales growth in emerging markets is the key driver, partially offset by the impact of higher dairy costs, foreign exchange, higher investments for sustainable growth and a slight increase in our effective tax rate. 
Finally, our cash balance stood at $709 million, up from $596 million in December. That strong performance, given that we repurchased 400,000 shares in the quarter, consuming $24 million of cash. Although the timing and amount of future share repurchases may vary, our program is designed to help reduce the dilutive impact of employee equity awards. When coupled with the 16% increase in our quarterly dividends, we are returning a meaningful portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. For the full year, capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense are expected to be about $125 million and $75 million, respectively. With that, let me now turn the call back to Steve."

So that's 2 points of it. In addition, David, there was one other factor I would point out. In Venezuela, you may recall, on January 1, 2010, the government devalued the currency significantly and put in some new controls. And as result of that dislocation plus the fact that we were transitioning product registrations down there from BMS to Mead Johnson, our sales were abnormally light in the first quarter of last year. That added about another full point to sales growth in the quarter. So absent those, it's probably closer to 12. The other thing I would point out is, keep in mind, if you looked at the quarterly sales from 2010, we did see that very significant increase, and this was true not only in the United States but also -- in North America/Europe but also in Asia/Latin America. So the comparisons are just a bit easier this quarter than I think they have been. That doesn't belie the fact that we had very, very good performance in the year in terms of volume growth in Asia/Latin America, but it's just an easier comparison as well."

Well, as you know, they take a very disciplined approach to that, and we will not expand that number unless we're absolutely confident of our ability to be successful in all the cities in which we operate. You're right, I am -- I was struck in my visit. I spent many years living in Asia, I've been to China more than 50 times, but I haven't been to a number of these so-called secondary cities. And I was absolutely struck not only by their size, by the quality of infrastructure, by the obvious economic activity, but also by the rapid momentum of the international brands in our category and most particularly, of course, our own brands. Not surprisingly, parents in those cities aspire, just as parents in the bigger cities, they aspire for their children to be successful in life, and nutrition plays a critical role in that. And they are rapidly entering the middle class, and therefore are able to afford our product for the several years. So I was reassured that our strategy was right, and I was also reassured that our confidence in sustainable growth was well-placed."

We continue to see very, very strong growth throughout Latin America.

So we're growing very, very heavily with our Enfa brand there, not only infant formula but also the growing-up milks. The rest of Latin America performed superbly. Great growth in Brazil. When we look at Central America, Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, very, very, very strong double-digit growth. And then in Asia, I would also say markets of particular note in terms of growth were Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore's a bit small but very, very strong performance there. Probably, the markets where there's --  they're a bit more challenged, I would say, tend to be the ones that, and this is not new information, but more price-sensitive markets. So the Philippines, in particular, we sell a premium brand in Enfa. We have a mid-tier brand in Lactum. But really the growth that's occurring in that market is occurring all even outside the categories where we compete, so full cream milk or filled milk, which are less nutritious substitutes for the products that we would sell. That segment of the market, which is lower-priced than where we compete, had tended to grow quite rapidly at the expense of declines for where we do compete. So a little tougher comparisons for the Philippines there, although we are picking up share for -- particularly for our Enfa brand in that market."

What we've seen over the last couple of years -- I know you've been following us for a relatively short period of time. What we've seen is that a significant reduction in the birth rate in the United States over a 2-, 3-year period, and a reduction in consumption, driven by reform in the WIC Program and by the weak economic conditions. What we're reporting today and have been talking about for a couple of quarters now is our market share growth within that weaker market, driven primarily by our innovations and by our improved demand creation activities, but also benefiting from the competitive recall back last September. So what we've referenced this morning is continued pessimism, if you like, about the category. We do not expect births to start to rise again, at least until 2012, potentially even later. But we are determined to continue to maintain a strong market share in the category, so that when the birth rate does recover, as it will, we are in the strongest possible position. We're largely dependent on competing within a lower-volume category, and we often get a question on price. So I will make just one comment on price. We did announce to the retail channel yesterday that we will be taking a price increase in the United States on our core routine products later this year. We have not taken a price increase for several years, and clearly, we've introduced a number of product improvements since then and seen commodity costs continue to rise. But through our advertising and promotional programs, we will make sure that we're continuing to drive demand and that we are competitive."

They will treat 8 liquid ounces of equivalent with 8 powder ounces. And so, that is not -- we have not raised pricing at all. Part of what goes through there as well, too, is we do have a favorable product mix coming in the U.S. And that while our routine business is doing exceptionally strong, we also are seeing very good growth with our solutions products, essentially, it's the partially hydrolyzed formula, which carries a higher price point associated with it, too. So that is part of what they have in their numbers. And definitely, with regard to the market share data, we have Nielsen cover it a different way for us. We do believe that Nestle got its fair share of market share after the Abbott recall, they didn't get any more than that, and I think some of the latest data that we've seen would suggest that maybe that's dropped off just a tad. But they have not disproportionately benefited from it. Hopefully that helps you."

At our recent Investor Meeting, I was asked what factors I consider to be important in leading a successful global company. I shared a number of thoughts, including the needs to ensure that we, as the executive leaders understand the dynamic nature of the business, avoid the risk of isolation from the marketplace, and travel regularly to review our businesses and meet with the members of our worldwide team. Pete and I are here with the entire management committee to review our operations and the execution of our strategies across Asia, our largest and fastest growing region, and where 6 of our top 10 markets are located. 
As you likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered exceptional sales growth of 22% on a reported basis in the second quarter or 18% measured in constant dollars with strong performance in both operating segments. 
Non-GAAP earnings was $0.72 per share, up 14% from the prior year, came from both strong sales growth and robust gross margins, offset in part by growing investments in demand generation, operating costs to support our growth and a higher effective tax rate that Pete will address shortly. 
Turning to ARPU operating segments, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on key performance highlights. Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis, and 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. China and Hong Kong continued to lead sales growth in this segment. The majority of our growth in China came from market share gains, and in our established cities. 
While we project strong growth continuing in China, we do not expect to continue to gain share at this rate indefinitely, given the competitive nature of the market. Our emerging market growth story isn't based on China/Hong Kong alone, nor indeed solely on our strong Asia performance. 
In Latin America, nearly all our markets are growing at strong double-digit rates. I recently returned from a visit to Peru and Columbia, where Mead Johnson holds the number 1 and number 2 positions repectively. And where we are confident of being able to deliver sustainable growth, driven by favorable economic and demographic trends, and the proven strength of our business model and strategies. 
In the North America/Europe segment, second quarter sales growth was 8% on a constant dollar basis, up from 5% in the first quarter. There are 2 key factors behind this increase that are important to emphasize. First, the second quarter of 2010 was the lowest quarterly sales level of the year for this segment and reflects the period before the launch of key product innovations in the U.S. 
Second, in the seocnd quarter of this year, we saw our -- to a sales growth from pipeline sales, as more U.S retail outlets adopted our new born product and the value box refill system. While we are greatly encouraged by the improvement in our year-over-year U.S. market share, we remain concerned by the continuing decline in the market. We have not yet seen any convincing signs that the U.S. birthrate has bottomed out. indeed, since our last conference call, the Center for Disease Control issued provisional data to the second half of 2010 that showed a further birthrate decline of over 2% versus 2009. While that's a lower rate of decline, then the 4% drop in the first half of 2010, the most recent information we have through April comes from the number of infants enrolled in the week program. And that shows the continued drop in participation. A sign that other -- birth in 2011 maybe lower by a further 2%. So the bottomline is that we expect tough market conditions in the U.S. for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012. Finally, while our market share performance is  in large part, due to the success of innovations, remember that our key competitor in the U.S. faced a significant product recall starting in the third quarter of 2010, resulting in increased demand for Enfamil. So we face a much tougher sales comparison for North America/Europe in the second half of the year. Our competitor has already recovered some of its share loss. Nevertheless, we continue to expect that our product innivation will contribute to higher share in the second half of 2011, than we reported prior to their recall. Turning now to our full year outloook. Our strong performance in the second quarter leads us to increase our sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect annual sales to grow on a constant dollar basis by up to 14% versus the prior year, with another 3% from foreign echange. We expect to see annual sales growth in the very high teens, in Asia and Latin America, and low single digits in North America/Europe. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.75. This reflects an improved sales outlook, but also, the headwinds we face in the second half from higher dairy and commodity costs, along with our continued commitment to invest behind our strong sales momentum, and to support sustainable success. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and I will return to wrap-up and take your questions."

It's Steve me and here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures.

It's Steve me and here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures. 
First, we delivered a 22% increase in reported sales in the second quarter, with 18% constant dollar growth and 4% from foreign exchange. Please note that there was no benefit from currency and on our bottom line in the quarter, as gains from the remeasurement of our balance sheet added about $0.03 to earnings in 2010. 
At a full-year basis, we expect currency to add 3% to sales growth. As you can see in our press release, the 18% constant dollar sales growth from the second quarter was driven by a 17% from volume and 1% from pricing. 
Steve addressed the key drivers of our strong volume growth so I'll focus on pricing in my remarks. The 1% price increase for the company was fully expected and reflects in part a returns reserve for our Europe operations, as we completed the transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to wholly independent distribution. It also is the result of the timing of promotional programs in some market this quarter, along with a lower level of support in Asia and the U.S. in the second quarter of 2010. 
In particular, please note that promotional spending in the U.S. market did not increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter. On a year-to-date basis, price increases have averaged 3%. Most of this is been associated with the carryover benefit of price increases taken last year. 
In the second half, price increases are expected to again fall in the 3% to 4% rage on average, but will largely result from new rather than carryover pricing. We announced the 4% price increase for the U.S. effective August 1st, but we're cautious that this early date on how much of this will fall through to benefit our bottom line in 2011. 
We remain committed to balancing our premium price strategy with our need to offer a competitive value proposition to consumers in a weak U.S. economy. On a full-year basis, our expectations for pricing have not changed since last quarter's conference call. Pricing is estimated to contribute about 3% to growth on average in 2011, with the majority of the increase coming from Asia and Latin America. 
Our gross margin of 64.7% was roughly in line with the first quarter and an increase of 120 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. The solid performance versus 2010 is driven by a number of factors including better fixed cost absorption from volume growth, along with a favorable country mix. 
One mix example results from increased market share in the United States. The share gain is coming from our non-weak U.S. Business, which generates one of the highest gross margin in the company. 
On a full-year basis, we expect gross margin to be around 63.2%, down from the 64.6% in the first half. We have seen significant increases in spot commodity prices for dairy, packaging and select agricultural products over the last six months that will flow through our cost of goods sold in the second half of the year. 
Our full year gross margin estimate has slipped by 10 basis points versus our prior guidance. This reflects a further increase in North American dairy prices over the last 3 months as milk exports from the United States to Asia has picked up. 
Conversely some very prices in Asia and Europe has modulated slightly, but the net impact is the slight headwind to late year gross margin compared to our earlier expectations. 
Also note that manufacturing productivity remains on track to deliver savings of at least 3% of cost of goods sold. That goes a long way toward helping us to offset commodity price pressures and allows us to maintain full-year gross margins close to the level seen in 2010. 
Operating expenses in the second quarter were 40.2% of sales, up from 37.9% in the first quarter and 39.2% in the prior year. Focusing on a sequential comparison, operating expenses grew by $34 million versus the first quarter. We significantly increased advertising and promotion spending and also made further investments in sales force expansion, research and development and marketing, including the launch of our new U.S. social media app called Expecting Baby by Enfamil. Expected moms can now track and share their experiences with family and friends via Twitter and Facebook during their pregnancy. 
Several other factors contributed to higher expenses in the second versus the first quarter including an increase in our stock-based compensation expense, which was fully expected. You may recall 2011 is the first year since our IPO that we have a full complement of equity awards in place. 
Also at work where higher performance based compensation accruals from strong sales and traffic growth, increased distribution expenses, driven by higher fuel costs. And the initial funding of the Mead Johnson nutrition foundation, which mission is to help support the world's most vulnerable infants and children. While there will be puts and takes in any individual category of spending, operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters is measured in dollars should be within striking distance of the second quarter run rate. 
As a result, we anticipate total operating expenses on a full-year basis at about 39.7% of sales, 20 basis points higher than our previous guidance. We are pleased with the returns we're seeing on our demand generation investments and we'll continue to invest more dollars on strengthening sales. Advertising and promotion spending should run about 14% of sales for the full year. 
During the second quarter, we successfully went live with our new SAP platform in both Latin America and Europe. We now have more than half of our business operating on SAP and the rest will be completed by the end of the year. We continue to expect some leverage from general and administrative expenses when we moved into 2012. 
Turning to taxes, our effective taxes or ETR for the quarter came in just under 30%. Compared to 24.8% last year. Remember that we reestimate that full-year projection each quarter and has to true up our year-to-date numbers accordingly. That introduces volatility into quarterly tax rates and drove this unfavorable comparison as the second quarter 2010 was unusually low. 
On a full-year basis, we expect an ETR between 29% and 29.5%, up from 28.6% in 2010. Strong growth in countries where we repatriated earnings back to the United States thereby subjecting them to a 35% tax rate is the driver year. 
Turning to our balance sheet, cash at the end of June stood at $704 million. We repurchased about 460,000 shares of our stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 860,000 shares, consuming $54 million in cash. 
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense for the full year remain unchanged at $125 million and $75 million respectively. We entered into a new 5-year revolving credit facility in June. This was a good deal for us, increasing our revolver capacity from about $400 million to $500 million, extending the terms to 2016, reducing our borrowing rate about 100 basis points, relative to the prior revolver put in place at the time of our IPO. 
Our strong cash flow in combination with this facility provides the company with excellent liquidity. You may recall that we unwound $200 million of fixed to floating interest rates swaps with a gain of about $17 million in late 2010. 
In mid-July, we unwound the remaining $500 million in swaps for an additional gain of about $24 million. By unwinding the swaps, we effectively lock in their appreciated value, eliminated any future exposure to floating interest rate and now have a portfolio of only 6 rate notes. 
The gains from unwinding our not recognize the upfront but over the remaining life of the underlying notes. As a result, net interest expense should increase by $3 million in the second half of the year versus the first half. 
Finally, let me wrap up with a summary of our latest EPS guidance of $2.70 to $2.75 per share, up from $2.52 to $2.70, the last time we spoke. Higher sales growth is the single biggest factor at work with constant dollars sale expected to grow up to 14% compared with our prior estimate of 10% for the year. 
Foreign exchange is currently estimated to add another 3 points to sales growth. Our revised estimates also incorporate gross margin of 53.2%, down 10 basis points versus our previous estimate, largely reflecting further dairy costs pressure in North America. 
Operating expenses of 39.7%, up 20 basis point, driven by higher demand generation investments, distribution costs and incentive accruals among other factors. Taxes are expected to run between 29% and 29.5%, slightly higher than our previous forecast on earnings mix. And higher interest expense of about $3 million in the second half of the year. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

As you know, the Chinese government is sensitive to high inflation and the result social pressure it may create reported in the China newspaper that the government met with multinational companies including Mead Johnson. But in our category, we believe they're much more focused on food, safety and quality and we are partnering with them on those topics and establishing the right standards. They did raise potential price controls several years ago, but they didn't materialize for our industry.

At a recent Investor Meeting, I was asked what factors I consider to be important in leading a successful global company. I shared a number of thoughts, including the need to ensure that we, as the executive leaders, understand the dynamic nature of the business, avoid the risk of isolation from the marketplace, and travel regularly to review our businesses and meet with the members of our worldwide team. Pete and I are here with the entire management committee to review our operations and the execution of our strategies across Asia, our largest and fastest growing region, and where 6 of our top 10 markets are located. 
As you likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered exceptional sales growth of 22% on a reported basis in the second quarter or 18% measured in constant dollars, with strong performance in both operating segments. 
Non-GAAP earnings was $0.72 per share, up 14% from the prior year, came from both strong sales growth and robust gross margins, offset in part by growing investments in demand generation, operating costs to support our growth, and a higher effective tax rate that Pete will address shortly. 
Turning to our 2 operating segments, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on key performance highlights. Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis, and 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. China and Hong Kong continue to lead sales growth in this segment. The majority of our growth in China came from market share gains and in our established cities. While we project strong growth continuing in China, we do not expect to continue to gain share at this rate indefinitely, given the competitive nature of the market. 
Our emerging market growth story isn't based on China/Hong Kong alone nor indeed solely on our strong Asia performance. In Latin America, nearly all our markets are growing at strong double-digit rates. I recently returned from a visit to Peru and Columbia, where Mead Johnson holds the #1 and #2 positions, respectively. And where we are confident of being able to deliver sustainable growth driven by favorable economic and demographic trends and the proven strength of our business model and strategies. 
In the North America/Europe segment, second quarter sales growth was 8% on a constant dollar basis, up from 5% in the first quarter. There are 2 key factors behind this increase that are important to emphasize. First, the second quarter of 2010 was the lowest quarterly sales level of the year for this segment and reflects the period before the launch of key product innovations in the U.S. Second, in the second quarter of this year, we saw our point to [ph] sales growth from pipeline sales as more U.S retail outlets adopted our newborn product and the value box refill system. 
While we are greatly encouraged by the improvement in our year-over-year U.S. market share, we remain concerned by the continuing decline in the market. We have not yet seen any convincing signs that the U.S. birthrate has bottomed out. Indeed, since our last conference call, the Center for Disease Control issued provisional data for the second half of 2010 that showed a further birthrate decline of over 2% versus 2009. While that's a lower rate of decline, then the 4% drop in the first half of 2010, the most recent information we have through April comes from the number of infants enrolled in the WIC program. And that shows a continued drop in participation. A sign that overall birth in 2011 may be lower by a further 2%. So the bottom line is that we expect tough market conditions in the U.S. for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012. 
Finally, while our market share performance is in large part due to the success of innovations, remember that our key competitor in the U.S. faced a significant product recall starting in the third quarter of 2010, resulting in increased demand for Enfamil. Though we faced a much tougher sales comparison for North America/Europe in the second half of the year, our competitor has already recovered some of its share loss. Nevertheless, we continue to expect that our product innovation will contribute to higher share in the second half of 2011 than we reported prior to their recall. 
Turning now to our full year outlook. Our strong performance in the second quarter leads us to increase our sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect annual sales to grow on a constant dollar basis by up to 14% versus the prior year, with another 3% from foreign exchange. We expect to see annual sales growth in the very high teens in Asia and Latin America and low single digits in North America/Europe. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.75. This reflects an improved sales outlook but also, the headwinds we face in the second half from higher dairy and commodity costs along with our continued commitment to invest behind our strong sales momentum and to support sustainable success. 
I will now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights, and I will return to wrap up and take your questions."

It's evening here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures. First, we delivered a 22% increase in reported sal",1510,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's evening here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures. 
First, we delivered a 22% increase in reported sales in the second quarter, with 18% constant dollar growth and 4% from foreign exchange. Please note that there was no benefit from currency on our bottom line in the quarter as gains from the remeasurement of our balance sheet added about $0.03 to earnings in 2010. On a full-year basis, we expect currency to add 3% to sales growth. As you can see in our press release, the 18% constant dollar sales growth from the second quarter was driven by a 17% from volume and 1% from pricing. 
Steve addressed the key drivers of our strong volume growth, so I will focus on pricing in my remarks. The 1% price increase for the company was fully expected and reflects in part a returns reserve for our year operations as we completed the transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to wholly independent distribution. It also is the result of the timing of promotional programs in some market this quarter, along with a lower level of support in Asia and the U.S. in the second quarter of 2010. In particular, please note that promotional spending in the U.S. market did not increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, price increases have averaged 3%. Most of this has been associated with the carryover benefit of price increases taken last year. In the second half, price increases are expected to again fall in the 3% to 4% range on average but will largely result from new, rather than carryover, pricing. 
We announced the 4% price increase for the U.S. effective August 1, but we're cautious that this early date on how much of this will fall through to benefit our bottom line in 2011. We remain committed to balancing our premium price strategy with our need to offer a competitive value proposition to consumers in a weak U.S. economy. 
On a full-year basis, our expectations for pricing have not changed since last quarter's conference call. Pricing is estimated to contribute about 3% to growth on average in 2011, with the majority of the increase coming from Asia and Latin America. 
Our gross margin of 64.7% was roughly in line with the first quarter and an increase of 120 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. The solid performance versus 2010 is driven by a number of factors, including better fixed cost absorption from volume growth, along with a favorable country mix. One mix example results from increased market share in the United States. The share gain is coming from our non-weak U.S. business, which generates one of the highest gross margin in the company. 
On a full-year basis, we expect gross margin to be around 63.2%, down from the 64.6% in the first half. We have seen significant increases in spot commodity prices for dairy, packaging and select agricultural products over the last 6 months that will flow through our cost of goods sold in the second half of the year. 
Our full year gross margin estimate has slipped by 10 basis points versus our prior guidance. This reflects a further increase in North American dairy prices over the last 3 months as milk exports from the United States to Asia had picked up. Conversely, some dairy prices in Asia and Europe has moderated slightly, but the net impact is the slight headwind to late year gross margin compared to our earlier expectations. 
Also note that manufacturing productivity remains on track to deliver savings of at least 3% of cost of goods sold. That goes a long way toward helping us to offset commodity price pressures and allows us to maintain full year gross margins close to the level seen in 2010. 
Operating expenses in the second quarter were 40.2% of sales, up from 37.9% in the first quarter and 39.2% in the prior year. Focusing on a sequential comparison, operating expenses grew by $34 million versus the first quarter. We significantly increased advertising and promotion spending and also made further investments in sales force expansion, research and development, and marketing, including the launch of our new U.S. social media app called ExpectingBaby by Enfamil. Expectant moms can now track and share their experiences with family and friends via Twitter and Facebook during their pregnancy. 
Several other factors contributed to higher expenses in the second versus the first quarter, including an increase in our stock-based compensation expense, which was fully expected. You may recall 2011 is the first year since our IPO that we have a full complement of equity awards in place. Also at work were higher performance-based compensation accrual from strong sales and profit growth, increased distribution expenses driven by higher fuel costs, and the initial funding of the Mead Johnson Nutrition Foundation, whose mission is to help support the world's most vulnerable infants and children. 
While there will be puts or takes in any individual category of spending, operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters as measured in dollars should be within striking distance of the second quarter run rate. As a result, we anticipate total operating expenses on a full year basis at about 39.7% of sales, 20 basis points higher than our previous guidance. 
We are pleased with the returns we're seeing on our demand-generation investments and we'll continue to invest more dollars on strengthening sales. Advertising and promotion spending should run about 14% of sales for the full year. 
During the second quarter, we successfully went live with our new SAP platform in both Latin America and Europe. We now have more than half of our business operating on SAP and the rest will be completed by the end of the year. We continue to expect some leverage from general and administrative expenses when we move into 2012. 
Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate or ETR for the quarter came in just under 30% compared to 24.8% last year. Remember that we reestimate the full year projection each quarter and has to true up our year-to-date numbers accordingly. That introduces volatility into quarterly tax rates and drove this unfavorable comparison as the second quarter of 2010 was unusually low. On a full-year basis, we expect an ETR between 29% and 29.5%, up from 28.6% in 2010. Strong growth in countries where we repatriate earnings back to the United States, thereby subjecting them to a 35% tax rate, is the driver here. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Cash at the end of June stood at $704 million. We repurchased about 460,000 shares of our stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 860,000 shares, consuming $54 million in cash. Capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense for the full year remain unchanged at $125 million and $75 million, respectively. 
We entered into a new 5-year revolving credit facility in June. This was a good deal for us, increasing our revolver capacity from about $400 million to $500 million, extending the term to 2016 and reducing our borrowing rate about 100 basis points relative to the prior revolver put in place at the time of our IPO. 
Our strong cash flow in combination with this facility provides the company with excellent liquidity. You may recall that we unwound $200 million of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a gain of about $17 million in late 2010. In mid-July, we unwound the remaining $500 million in swaps for an additional gain of about $24 million. By unwinding the swaps, we effectively lock in their appreciated value or limited any future exposure to higher floating interest rates and now have a portfolio of only 6 rate notes. The gains from unwinding our not recognized upfront but over the remaining life of the underlying notes. As a result, net interest expense should increase by $3 million in the second half of the year versus the first half. 
Finally, let me wrap up with a summary of our latest EPS guidance of $2.70 to $2.75 per share, up from $2.62 to $2.70 the last time we spoke. Higher sales growth is the single biggest factor at work, with constant dollar sale expected to grow up to 14% compared with our prior estimate of 10% for the year. Foreign exchange is currently estimated to add another 3 points to sales growth. Our revised estimates also incorporate gross margin of 63.2%, down 10 basis points versus our previous estimate, largely reflecting further dairy costs pressure in North America. Operating expenses of 39.7%, up 20 basis points, driven by higher demand-generation investments, distribution costs and incentive accruals among other factors. Taxes are expected to run between 29% and 29.5%, slightly higher than our previous forecast on earnings mix, and higher interest expense of about $3 million in the second half of the year. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

At a recent Investor Meeting, I was asked what factors I consider to be important in leading a successful global company. I shared a number of thoughts, including the need to ensure that we, as the executive leaders, understand the dynamic nature of the business, avoid the risk of isolation from the marketplace, and travel regularly to review our businesses and meet with the members of our worldwide team. Pete and I are here with the entire management committee to review our operations and the execution of our strategies across Asia, our largest and fastest growing region, and where 6 of our top 10 markets are located. 
As you likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered exceptional sales growth of 22% on a reported basis in the second quarter or 18% measured in constant dollars, with strong performance in both operating segments. 
Non-GAAP earnings was $0.72 per share, up 14% from the prior year, came from both strong sales growth and robust gross margins, offset in part by growing investments in demand generation, operating costs to support our growth, and a higher effective tax rate that Pete will address shortly. 
Turning to our 2 operating segments, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on key performance highlights. Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis, and 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. China and Hong Kong continue to lead sales growth in this segment. The majority of our growth in China came from market share gains and in our established cities. While we project strong growth continuing in China, we do not expect to continue to gain share at this rate indefinitely, given the competitive nature of the market. 
Our emerging market growth story isn't based on China/Hong Kong alone nor indeed solely on our strong Asia performance. In Latin America, nearly all our markets are growing at strong double-digit rates. I recently returned from a visit to Peru and Columbia, where Mead Johnson holds the #1 and #2 positions, respectively. And where we are confident of being able to deliver sustainable growth driven by favorable economic and demographic trends and the proven strength of our business model and strategies. 
In the North America/Europe segment, second quarter sales growth was 8% on a constant dollar basis, up from 5% in the first quarter. There are 2 key factors behind this increase that are important to emphasize. First, the second quarter of 2010 was the lowest quarterly sales level of the year for this segment and reflects the period before the launch of key product innovations in the U.S. Second, in the second quarter of this year, we saw a point or 2 of sales growth from pipeline sales as more U.S retail outlets adopted our newborn product and the value box refill system. 
While we are greatly encouraged by the improvement in our year-over-year U.S. market share, we remain concerned by the continuing decline in the market. We have not yet seen any convincing signs that the U.S. birthrate has bottomed out. Indeed, since our last conference call, the Center for Disease Control issued provisional data for the second half of 2010 that showed a further birthrate decline of over 2% versus 2009. While that's a lower rate of decline, then the 4% drop in the first half of 2010, the most recent information we have through April comes from the number of infants enrolled in the WIC program. And that shows a continued drop in participation. A sign that overall birth in 2011 may be lower by a further 2%. So the bottom line is that we expect tough market conditions in the U.S. for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012. 
Finally, while our market share performance is in large part due to the success of innovations, remember that our key competitor in the U.S. faced a significant product recall starting in the third quarter of 2010, resulting in increased demand for Enfamil. Though we face a much tougher sales comparison for North America/Europe in the second half of the year, our competitor has already recovered some of its share loss. Nevertheless, we continue to expect that our product innovation will contribute to higher share in the second half of 2011 than we reported prior to their recall. 
Turning now to our full year outlook. Our strong performance in the second quarter leads us to increase our sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect annual sales to grow on a constant dollar basis by up to 14% versus the prior year, with another 3% from foreign exchange. We expect to see annual sales growth in the very high teens in Asia and Latin America and low single digits in North America/Europe. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.75. This reflects an improved sales outlook but also, the headwinds we face in the second half from higher dairy and commodity costs along with our continued commitment to invest behind our strong sales momentum and to support sustainable success. 
I will now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights, and I will return to wrap up and take your questions."

It's evening here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures. First, we delivered a 22% increase in reported sal",1513,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's evening here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures. 
First, we delivered a 22% increase in reported sales in the second quarter, with 18% constant dollar growth and 4% from foreign exchange. Please note that there was no benefit from currency on our bottom line in the quarter as gains from the remeasurement of our balance sheet added about $0.03 to earnings in 2010. On a full-year basis, we expect currency to add 3% to sales growth. As you can see in our press release, the 18% constant dollar sales growth from the second quarter was driven by a 17% from volume and 1% from pricing. 
Steve addressed the key drivers of our strong volume growth, so I will focus on pricing in my remarks. The 1% price increase for the company was fully expected and reflects in part a returns reserve for our year [ph] operations as we completed the transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to wholly independent distribution. It also is the result of the timing of promotional programs in some markets this quarter, along with a lower level of support in Asia and the U.S. in the second quarter of 2010. In particular, please note that promotional spending in the U.S. market did not increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, price increases have averaged 3%. Most of this has been associated with a carryover benefit of price increases taken last year. In the second half, price increases are expected to again fall in the 3% to 4% range on average but will largely result from new, rather than carryover, pricing. 
We announced a 4% price increase for the U.S. effective August 1, but we're cautious that this early date on how much of this will fall through to benefit our bottom line in 2011. We remain committed to balancing our premium price strategy with our need to offer a competitive value proposition to consumers in a weak U.S. economy. 
On a full-year basis, our expectations for pricing have not changed since last quarter's conference call. Pricing is estimated to contribute about 3% to growth on average in 2011, with the majority of the increase coming from Asia and Latin America. 
Our gross margin of 64.7% was roughly in line with the first quarter and an increase of 120 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. The solid performance versus 2010 is driven by a number of factors, including better fixed cost absorption from volume growth, along with a favorable country mix. One mix example results from increased market share in the United States. The share gain is coming from our non-WIK U.S. business, which generates one of the highest gross margins in the company. 
On a full-year basis, we expect gross margin to be around 63.2%, down from the 64.6% in the first half. We have seen significant increases in spot commodity prices for dairy, packaging and select agricultural products over the last 6 months that will flow through our cost of goods sold in the second half of the year. 
Our full year gross margin estimate has slipped by 10 basis points versus our prior guidance. This reflects a further increase in North American dairy prices over the last 3 months as milk exports from the United States to Asia had picked up. Conversely, some dairy prices in Asia and Europe have moderated slightly, but the net impact is the slight headwind to late year gross margins compared to our earlier expectations. 
Also note that manufacturing productivity remains on track to deliver savings of at least 3% of cost of goods sold. That goes a long way toward helping us to offset commodity price pressures and allows us to maintain full year gross margins close to the level seen in 2010. 
Operating expenses in the second quarter were 40.2% of sales, up from 37.9% in the first quarter and 39.2% in the prior year. Focusing on a sequential comparison, operating expenses grew by $34 million versus the first quarter. We significantly increased advertising and promotion spending and also made further investments in sales force expansion, research and development, and marketing, including the launch of our new U.S. social media app called ExpectingBaby by Enfamil. Expected moms can now track and share their experiences with family and friends via Twitter and Facebook during their pregnancy. 
Several other factors contributed to higher expenses in the second versus the first quarter, including an increase in our stock-based compensation expense, which was fully expected. You may recall 2011 is the first year since our IPO that we have a full complement of equity awards in place. Also at work were higher performance-based compensation accrual from strong sales and profit growth, increased distribution expenses driven by higher fuel costs, and the initial funding of the Mead Johnson Nutrition Foundation, whose mission is to help support the world's most vulnerable infants and children. 
While there will be puts or takes in any individual category of spending, operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters as measured in dollars should be within striking distance of the second quarter run rate. As a result, we anticipate total operating expenses on a full year basis at about 39.7% of sales, 20 basis points higher than our previous guidance. 
We are pleased with the returns we're seeing on our demand-generation investments and we'll continue to invest more dollars on strengthening sales. Advertising and promotion spending should run about 14% of sales for the full year. 
During the second quarter, we successfully went live with our new SAP platform in both Latin America and Europe. We now have more than half of our business operating on SAP and the rest will be completed by the end of the year. We continue to expect some leverage from general and administrative expenses when we move into 2012. 
Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate or ETR for the quarter came in just under 30% compared to 24.8% last year. Remember that we reestimate the full year projection each quarter and have to true up our year-to-date numbers accordingly. That introduces volatility into quarterly tax rates and drove this unfavorable comparison as the second quarter of 2010 was unusually low. On a full-year basis, we expect an ETR between 29% and 29.5%, up from 28.6% in 2010. Strong growth in countries where we repatriate earnings back to the United States, thereby subjecting them to a 35% tax rate, is the driver here. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Cash at the end of June stood at $704 million. We repurchased about 460,000 shares of our stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 860,000 shares, consuming $54 million in cash. Capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense for the full year remain unchanged at $125 million and $75 million, respectively. 
We entered into a new 5-year revolving credit facility in June. This was a good deal for us, increasing our revolver capacity from about $400 million to $500 million, extending the term to 2016 and reducing our borrowing rate about 100 basis points relative to the prior revolver put in place at the time of our IPO. 
Our strong cash flow in combination with this facility provides the company with excellent liquidity. You may recall that we unwound $200 million of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a gain of about $17 million in late 2010. In mid-July, we unwound the remaining $500 million in swaps for an additional gain of about $24 million. By unwinding the swaps, we effectively locked in their appreciated value or limited any future exposure to higher floating interest rates and now have a portfolio of only fixed rate notes. The gains from unwinding our not recognized upfront but over the remaining life of the underlying notes. As a result, net interest expense should increase by $3 million in the second half of the year versus the first half. 
Finally, let me wrap up with a summary of our latest EPS guidance of $2.70 to $2.75 per share, up from $2.62 to $2.70 per share the last time we spoke. Higher sales growth is the single biggest factor at work, with constant dollar sale expected to grow up to 14% compared with our prior estimate of 10% for the year. Foreign exchange is currently estimated to add another 3 points to sales growth. Our revised estimates also incorporate gross margin of 63.2%, down 10 basis points versus our previous estimate, largely reflecting further dairy cost pressures in North America. Operating expenses of 39.7%, up 20 basis points, driven by higher demand-generation investments, distribution costs and incentive accruals among other factors. Taxes are expected to run between 29% and 29.5%, slightly higher than our previous forecast on earnings mix, and higher interest expense of about $3 million in the second half of the year. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

And you've got to be very careful not to confuse consumers and confuse the market by introducing change too frequently. We're very happy with the competitiveness of our product offerings right now across each of the segments in which we operate. And we will make sure we remain competitive."

We've completed another strong quarter, and as you likely read in this morning's press release, our results are in line with positive expectations shared with you at our investor day event 2 weeks ago, and our EPS came in at the top end of our preliminary estimate. Therefore, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on the key highlights of our strong sales and earnings results.
We delivered double-digit sales growth of 15% on reported basis in the third quarter, or about 11.5% measured in constant dollars. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share up 37% from the prior quarter came from strong sales growth in emerging markets, favorable foreign exchange impacts and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by continued investments in demand generation activities and nonrecurring manufacturing efficiencies. And as mentioned earlier this year, we're starting to see the gross margin impact of higher commodity costs. Pete will address the profit and margin in more detail in a few minutes. 
Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis or 25% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I should highlight that about 3% of sales growth for the segment came as the result of some retailers in Asia purchasing extra inventory in advance of the October transition to our new SAP technology platform. Excluding this factor, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, constant dollar sales in Asia/Latin America grew by 22%.
Our strongest performance continues to be in China and Hong Kong with growth well above the segment average. While many investors naturally focus on our performance in Greater China, we also have delivered double-digit constant dollar sales growth in the rest of Asia and Latin America in 2011. We've seen success in the execution of our strategies in most of our emerging markets. In the North America/Europe segment, third quarter sales were 7% lower on a reported basis or down 8% measured in constant dollars.
We expected this tough comparison due to, in large part, to lacking of competitors U.S. credit recall commencing in September 2010. Most importantly, our U.S. market share remains above third quarter 2010 and is evident that consumers value our many products innovations launched over the past year.
There was also some timing last year due to the sales in the last quarter including the phase out of one WIC contract in Indiana without the full phase-in on a new Mead Johnson contract in New England states. That should be completed in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, volume continues to be the key drivers sales growth at 7.5% for the company in total, and a strong 19% in Asia and Latin America. Higher pricing added 4% with both developed and emerging market segments seeing the benefit. We will continue to use pricing as well as productivity gains to manage gross margins as we move into 2012.
Turning now to our full-year outlook. We've maintained our constant dollar sales growth projection at about 14% versus the prior year, with another in 2.5% from foreign exchange. We expect to see annual sales growth slightly above 20% in Asia/Latin America with North America/Europe in the low single digits. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.73 to $2.78, up from the $2.70 to $2.75 from last quarter. Operating expenses of 39.7% of sales reflect our commitment to continue investing in demand generation activities to support sustainable sales of earnings growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and I will return to wrap up and take your questions."

As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures.

As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures. I will cover 3 key topics: first, the key drivers of our third quarter EPS improvement; second, those factors which impact fourth quarter and full-year EPS; and finally, some brief comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow.
Third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share were $0.21 higher than 2010. About $0.08 of this increase is related to foreign exchange impacts on our balance sheet. Many consumer goods companies operate in their major markets with self-contained local manufacturing and local currency costs, and thus, are not subject to any significant foreign exchange exposure for their balance sheet. We however, spray-dry our base infant formulas at centralized facilities. These plants invoiced in dollars of products shipped into other markets and have dollar cash and receivable accounts on their local currency books. As a result, they faced balance sheet remeasurement gains or losses on these accounts as exchange rates fluctuate. 
In the third quarter of last year, we saw a weakening dollar and recognized balance sheet remeasurement losses as a result. And in the third quarter of 2011 we've seen the opposite trend with the dollar strengthening against many currencies, leading to balance sheet remeasurement gains. Well that is one key factor affecting the year-over-year comparison.
The second factor is that we saw a 3% EPS hit from pension settlement expense in the third quarter of last year. This is the result of accounting rules which dictate that when lump-sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the plan's deferred losses need to be recognized immediately. Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low, so it doesn't take many retirees to generate the settlement expense.
In the first day quarters of 2011 however, we've seen lower lumps in payouts in 2010 and has not yet hit the threshold to recognize any pension settlement charges. Instead, we anticipate this expense will show up in the fourth quarter. Absent these 2 items, EPS grew by about $0.10 per share or about 17% in the quarter. Strong sales growth and a lower effective tax rate were offset by a low margin and a higher level of operating expenses. This quarter is gross margin of 61.6% was below our earlier expectations by almost 4 percentage points. We incurred one-time manufacturing inefficiencies at the plant that supplies Asia. Due to strong demand in this market which was further aggravated by our desire to build inventories in advance of the October launch of SAP in Asia, we rebalanced global inventories leading to higher airfreight costs. For operating at normal capacity now and this factor will not recur.
dairy and agricultural oil costs also came through as expected, also driving gross margins down relative to the mid-64% range seen in the first half of the year. As we showed at the investor day event, the largest increase in dairy costs in 2011 has been in the North America market, and pressure on market margins would be evident in the fourth quarter for the North America/Europe segment.
On a full-year basis, we currently expect margins to be slightly less than 63% and below the 63.2% expectations at last quarter. The third quarter manufacturing inefficiencies I just mentioned are the recent reduction
Absent foreign exchange impacts operating expenses grew by $45 million or $0.16 per share compared to the prior year quarter. Most of this is demand generation spend for marketing, salesforce, advertising and promotion along with research and development. We expect our spending levels in the fourth quarter to grow even further, reducing earnings by as much as $0.08 per share relative to the third quarter. On a full-year basis, we anticipate total operating expenses will be consistent with our previous guidance at about 39.7% of sales of which advertising and promotion spending should run around 14% of sales.
Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate, or ETR, came in about 24% as a non-GAAP basis compared to 31% of last year. Each quarter, we update our full-year tax rate and also true up our tax accruals to apply that latest rate estimate to pretax earnings generated year-to-date, not just in the current quarter. We now forecast the 2011 full-year rate to be just under 28%, about 100 basis points lower than our June estimate. That is due to a favorable country mix, higher manufacturing and R&D tax incentives and favorable adjustments to accounting tax provisions as we file our tax returns each September.
The drop in the 2011 tax rate increased EPS in the quarter by about $0.03 with $0.02 of that due to the benefit from first-half earnings. The key assumptions behind our full-year earnings guidance of $2.73 to $2.78 per share include 14% constant dollar sales growth plus an additional 2.5% from foreign exchange. Gross margin's slightly below 63%, operating expense up about 39.7% and effective tax rate just below 28% are also expected. Obviously, there are some considerable timing differences in our third-quarter results, but let me quickly highlight some of the factors affecting our fourth quarter.
A high-end of our EPS guidance would imply fourth quarter earnings of $0.51 per share. That's a drop in consecutive quarterly earnings of about $0.27 per share. 5 factors account for over 90% of the reduction. First, EPS was listed by about $0.03 in the third quarter of customer purchases in advance of our October SAP launch. Those shipments will reverse in the fourth quarter, leading to a consecutive earnings decline of a full $0.06. Second, we anticipate pension settlement expenses of $0.03 to come through in the fourth quarter. Third, we saw about $0.04 per share from balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter this year. Both will not repeat. In fact, the dollar has weakened a bit over the last few weeks and we now expect that been yourself balance sheet remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter. 
Those factors reduces the first quarter EPS by about $0.05. Fourth, we anticipate that operating expenses will grow in the fourth quarter by as much as $0.08 per share. And fifth, we will see a timing impact from unfavorable cost absorption of about $0.03. Production rates are down slightly in the second half relative to the run rate seen earlier in the year, and are lower than average rates we expect to see moving forward. 
There are number of other factors at work including higher dairy cost in North America and the unfavorable translation impact from the stronger dollar. Also note that the third quarter results included a benefit from a reduced tax rate on first-half earnings that will not recur. These are partially offset by the recovery from manufacturing inefficiencies seen in the third quarter. 
Finally, note that the $0.03 per share increase in our full-year earnings guidance reflects the net favorable foreign exchange impacts, the lower tax rates, partly offset by the manufacturing inefficiencies during the third quarter. Operating performance excluding these items is largely unchanged from our earlier expectations.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash at the end of September stood at $761 million, of which all about $21 million was held outside of the United States. Year-to-date free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations, less capital expenditures, stood at $383 million. We repurchased about 400,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 1.3 million shares, consuming $81.6 million in cash. Adding dividends, we have returned more than 60% of cash flow to shareholders so far this year. 
For the full year, capital spending is forecast at about $120 million, down slightly from our earlier estimate of $125 million due to the strengthening of U.S. dollar. Depreciation and amortization expense will be about $76 million. With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

Based on a year-to-date performance, that might imply something around 61% in the fourth quarter, so you're absolutely right. A couple of factors driving that, first, is the fact that we're going to be facing higher dairy costs in North America in particular. That's the biggest, that's still going through. It has peaked and started to drop a little, hasn't dropped significantly but there's the 6-month delay before what you see in stock prices and when it shows up on our CAGs. In addition, I mentioned that face that we're going to have lower production rates. We saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We're going to see a bigger impact of that in the fourth quarter and that just gets to the fact that when you look at our global production rates, first half are higher than second half. Some of that due to the Abbott recall. But even when we look at it on a normalized basis, we are seeing an impact in gross margins in Q4 which are really timing-driven. We might see some of that rollover in Q1. But on a full-year basis next year, it's not going to impact it. And then we get a benefits from favorable mix coming through, and also pricing in the coming year.

We've completed another strong quarter, and as you likely read in this morning's press release, our results were in line with the positive expectations shared with you at our investor day event 2 weeks ago, and our EPS came in at the top end of our preliminary estimate. Therefore, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on the key highlights of our strong sales and earnings results.
We delivered double-digit sales growth of 15% on a reported basis in the third quarter or about 11.5% measured in constant dollars. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share, up 37% from the prior quarter, came from strong sales growth in emerging markets, favorable foreign exchange impacts and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by continued investments in demand generation activities and nonrecurring manufacturing inefficiencies. And as mentioned earlier this year, we're starting to see the gross margin impact of higher commodity costs. Pete will address the profit and margin in more detail in a few minutes.
Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis or 25% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I should highlight that about 3% of sales growth for the segment came as the result that some retailers in Asia purchasing extra inventory in advance of the October transition to our new SAP technology platform. Excluding this factor, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, constant dollar sales in Asia/Latin America grew by 22%.
Our strongest performance continues to be in China and Hong Kong, with growth well above the segment average. While many investors naturally focus on our performance in Greater China, we also have delivered double-digit constant dollar sales growth in the rest of Asia and Latin America in 2011. We've seen success in the execution of our strategies in most of our emerging markets.
In the North America/Europe segment, third quarter sales were 7% lower on a reported basis or down 8% measured in constant dollars. We expected this tough comparison due, in large part, to lapping of competitor's U.S. product recall commencing in September of 2010. Most importantly, our U.S. market share remains above third quarter 2010 and is evident that consumers value our many products innovations launched over the past year.
There were also some timing factors at work that reduced U.S. sales for the last quarter, including the phase out of one WIC contract in Indiana without the full phase-in on a new Mead Johnson contract to New England states that should be completed in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, volume continued to be the key driver of sales growth at 7.5% for the company in total, and a strong 19% in Asia and Latin America. Higher pricing added 4%, with both developed and emerging market segments seeing the benefit. We will continue to use pricing as well as productivity gains to manage gross margins as we move into 2012.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've maintained our constant dollar sales growth projection at about 14% versus the prior year, with another 2.5% from foreign exchange. We expect to see annual sales growth slightly above 20% in Asia/Latin America with North America/Europe in the low single digits.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.73 to $2.78, up from the $2.70 to $2.75 from last quarter. Operating expenses of 39.7% of sales reflect our commitment to continue investing in demand generation activities to support sustainable sales and earnings growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and we'll return to wrap up and take your questions."

As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures. I will cover 3 key topics: first, the key drivers of our third quarter EPS improvement; second, those factors which impact fourth quarter and full year E",1337,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures. I will cover 3 key topics: first, the key drivers of our third quarter EPS improvement; second, those factors which impact fourth quarter and full year EPS; and finally, some brief comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow.
Third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share were $0.21 higher than 2010. About $0.08 of this increase is related to foreign exchange impacts on our balance sheet. Many consumer goods companies operate in their major markets with self-contained local manufacturing and local currency costs, and thus, are not subject to any significant foreign exchange exposure for their balance sheet. We however, spray dry our base infant formulas at centralized facilities. These plants, invoiced in dollars, for products shipped into other markets and have dollar cash and receivable accounts on their local currency books. As a result, they faced balance sheet remeasurement gains or losses on these accounts as exchange rates fluctuate.
In the third quarter of last year, we saw a weakening dollar and recognized balance sheet remeasurement losses as a result. And in the third quarter 2011, we have seen the opposite trend, with the dollar strengthening against many currencies leading to balance sheet remeasurement gains. Well, that is one key factor affecting the year-over-year comparison.
A second factor is that we saw a 3% EPS hit from pension settlement expense in the third quarter of last year. This is the result of accounting rules which dictate that when lump-sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the plan's deferred losses need to be recognized immediately. Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low, so it doesn't take many retirees to generate the settlement expense.
With the first 3 quarters of 2011, however, we have seen lower lump-sum payouts than in 2010, and have not yet hit the threshold to recognize any pension settlement charges. Instead, we anticipate this expense will show up in the fourth quarter. Absent these 2 items, EPS grew by about $0.10 per share or about 17% in the quarter. Strong sales growth and a lower effective tax rate were offset by low gross margins and a higher level of operating expenses.
This quarter's gross margin of 61.6% was below our earlier expectations by almost a full percentage point. We incurred onetime manufacturing inefficiencies at a plant that supplies Asia. Due to strong demand in these markets, which was further aggravated by our desire to build inventories in advance of the October SAP launch in Asia, we rebalanced global inventories leading to higher airfreight costs. We're operating at normal capacity now and this factor will not recur.
Higher dairy and agricultural oil costs came through as expected, also driving gross margins down relative to the mid-64% range seen in the first half of the year. As we showed at the investor day event, the largest increase in dairy costs in 2011 has been in the North America market. And further pressure on market margins will be evident in the fourth quarter for the North America/Europe segment.
On a full year basis, we currently expect gross margins to be slightly less than 63%, and below the 63.2% expectations set last quarter. The third quarter manufacturing inefficiencies I just mentioned are the reason for the reduction.
Absent foreign exchange and pension impacts, operating expenses grew by $45 million or $0.16 per share compared to the prior year quarter. Most of this is demand generation spend for marketing, sales force, advertising and promotion, along with research and development. We expect our spending levels in the fourth quarter to grow even further, reducing earnings by as much as $0.08 per share relative to the third quarter. On a full year basis, we anticipate total operating expenses will be consistent with our previous guidance at about 39.7% of sales, of which, advertising and promotion spending should run around 14% of sales.
Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate, or ETR, came in about 24% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 31% of last year. Each quarter, we update our full year tax rate and also true up our tax accruals to apply that latest rate estimate to pretax earnings generated year-to-date, not just in the current quarter. We now forecast the 2011 full year rate to be just under 28%, about 100 basis points lower than our June estimate. That is due to a favorable country mix, higher manufacturing and R&D tax incentives, and favorable adjustments to accounting tax provisions as we file our tax returns each September.
The drop in the 2011 tax rate increased EPS in the quarter by about $0.03 with $0.02 of that due to the benefit from first-half earnings. The key assumptions behind our full year earnings guidance of $2.73 to $2.78 per share include 14% constant dollar sales growth plus an additional 2.5% from foreign exchange. Gross margin is slightly below 63%, operating expenses of about 39.7% and effective tax rate just below 28% are also expected.
Obviously, there are some considerable timing differences in our third-quarter results, but let me quickly highlight some of the factors affecting our fourth quarter. A high-end of our EPS guidance would imply fourth quarter earnings of $0.51 per share. That's a drop in consecutive quarterly earnings of about $0.27 per share. Five factors account for over 90% of the reduction.
First, EPS was listed by about $0.03 in the third quarter by customer purchases in advance of our October SAP launch. Those shipments will reverse in the fourth quarter leading to a consecutive earnings decline of a full $0.06. Second, we anticipate pension settlement expenses of $0.03 to come through in the fourth quarter. Third, we saw about $0.04 per share from balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter of this year. Those will not repeat. In fact, the dollar has weakened a bit over the last few weeks and we now expect $0.01 or so of balance sheet remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter. Well, those factors reduces consecutive quarterly EPS by about $0.05. Fourth, we anticipate that operating expenses will grow in the fourth quarter by as much as $0.08 per share. And fifth, we will see a timing impact from unfavorable fixed cost absorption of about $0.03. Production rates are down slightly in the second half relative to the run rate seen earlier in the year, and are lower than average rates we expect to see moving forward.
There are a number of other factors at work, including higher dairy cost in North America and the unfavorable translation impact from a stronger dollar. Also note that the third quarter results included a benefit from a reduced tax rate on first-half earnings that will not recur. These are partially offset by the recovery from manufacturing inefficiencies seen in the third quarter.
Finally, note that the $0.03 per share increase in our full year earnings guidance reflects the net favorable foreign exchange impacts, the lower tax rates, partly offset by the manufacturing inefficiencies during the third quarter. Operating performance, excluding these items, is largely unchanged from our earlier expectations.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash at the end of September stood at $761 million, of which, all but $21 million was held outside the United States. Year-to-date free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, stood at $383 million. We repurchased about 400,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 1.3 million shares, consuming $81.6 million in cash. Adding dividends, we have returned more than 60% of cash flow to shareholders so far this year.
For the full year, capital spending is forecast at about $120 million, down slightly from our earlier estimate of $125 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Depreciation and amortization expense will be about $76 million.
With that, help me turn the call back to Steve."

If you look at what we said, our gross margins on a full year basis, slightly below 63%. Based on the year-to-date performance, that might imply something around 61% in the fourth quarter, so you're absolutely right. A couple of factors driving that. First, is the fact we're going to be facing higher dairy costs in North America in particular. That's the biggest, that's still going through. It has peaked and started to drop a little. It hasn't dropped significantly, but there's the 6-month delay before what you see in spot prices and when it shows up in our COGS. In addition, I mentioned that fact that we're going to have lower production rates. We saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We're going to see a bigger impact of that in the fourth quarter, and that just gets to the fact that when you look at our global production rates, first half are higher than second half. Some of that due to the Abbott recall. But even when we look at it on a normalized basis, we are seeing an impact in gross margins in Q4, which are really timing-driven. We might see some of that rollover into Q1. But on a full year basis next year, it's not going to impact it. And then we get a benefit from favorable mix coming through, and also pricing in the coming year. The bottom line is that we wouldn't want you -- don't draw conclusion about full year gross margins based on that 61% or so in the first quarter."

We've completed another strong quarter, and as you likely read in this morning's press release, our results were in line with the positive expectations shared with you at our investor day event 2 weeks ago, and our EPS came in at the top end of our preliminary estimate. Therefore, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on the key highlights of our strong sales and earnings results.
We delivered double-digit sales growth of 15% on a reported basis in the third quarter or about 11.5% measured in constant dollars. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share, up 37% from the prior year quarter, came from strong sales growth in emerging markets, favorable foreign exchange impacts and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by continued investments in demand generation activities and nonrecurring manufacturing inefficiencies. And as mentioned earlier this year, we're starting to see the gross margin impact of higher commodity costs. Pete will address the profit and margin numbers in more detail in a few minutes.
Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis or 25% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I should highlight that about 3% of sales growth for the segment came as the result of some retailers in Asia purchasing extra inventory in advance of the October transition to our new SAP technology platform. Excluding this factor, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, constant dollar sales in Asia/Latin America grew by 22%.
Our strongest performance continues to be in China and Hong Kong, with growth well above the segment average. While many investors naturally focus on our performance in Greater China, we also have delivered double-digit constant dollar sales growth in the rest of Asia and Latin America in 2011. We've seen success in the execution of our strategies in most of our emerging markets.
In the North America/Europe segment, third quarter sales were 7% lower on a reported basis or down 8% measured in constant dollars. We expected this tough comparison due, in large part, to lapping a competitor's U.S. product recall commencing in September of 2010. Most importantly, our U.S. market share remains above third quarter 2010 and is evidence that consumers value our many products innovations launched over the past year.
There were also some timing factors at work that reduced U.S. sales for the last quarter, including the phase out of one WIC contract in Indiana without the full phase-in on a new Mead Johnson contract for New England states. That should be completed in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, volume continued to be the key driver of sales growth at 7.5% for the company in total and a strong 19% in Asia and Latin America. Higher pricing added 4%, with both developed and emerging market segments seeing the benefit. We will continue to use pricing as well as productivity gains to manage gross margins as we move into 2012.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've maintained our constant dollar sales growth projection at about 14% versus the prior year, with another 2.5% from foreign exchange. We expect to see annual sales growth slightly above 20% in Asia/Latin America with North America/Europe in the low single digits.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.73 to $2.78, up from the $2.70 to $2.75 range from last quarter. Operating expenses of 39.7% of sales reflect our commitment to continue investing in demand generation activities to support sustainable sales and earnings growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and will return to wrap up and take your questions."

As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures. I will cover 3 key topics: first, the key drivers of our third quarter EPS improvement; second, those factors which impact fourth quarter and full year E",1337,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures. I will cover 3 key topics: first, the key drivers of our third quarter EPS improvement; second, those factors which impact fourth quarter and full year EPS; and finally, some brief comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow.
Third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share were $0.21 higher than 2010. About $0.08 of this increase is related to foreign exchange impacts on our balance sheet. Many consumer goods companies operate in their major markets with self-contained local manufacturing and local currency costs, and thus, are not subject to any significant foreign exchange exposure for their balance sheet. We however, spray dry our base infant formulas at centralized facilities. These plants invoice in dollars for products shipped into other markets and have dollar cash and receivable accounts on their local currency books. As a result, they face balance sheet remeasurement gains or losses on these accounts as exchange rates fluctuate.
In the third quarter of last year, we saw a weakening dollar and recognized balance sheet remeasurement losses as a result. And in the third quarter 2011, we have seen the opposite trend, with the dollar strengthening against many currencies leading to balance sheet remeasurement gains. Well, that is one key factor affecting the year-over-year comparison.
A second factor is that we saw a $0.03 EPS hit from pension settlement expense in the third quarter of last year. This is the result of accounting rules which dictate that when lump-sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the plan's deferred losses need to be recognized immediately. Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low, so it doesn't take many retirees to generate the settlement expense.
With the first 3 quarters of 2011, however, we have seen lower lump-sum payouts than in 2010 and have not yet hit the threshold to recognize any pension settlement charges. Instead, we anticipate this expense will show up in the fourth quarter. Absent these 2 items, EPS grew by about $0.10 per share or about 17% in the quarter. Strong sales growth and a lower effective tax rate were offset by lower gross margins and a higher level of operating expenses.
This quarter's gross margin of 61.6% was below our earlier expectations by almost a full percentage point. We incurred onetime manufacturing inefficiencies at a plant that supplies Asia. Due to strong demand in these markets, which was further aggravated by our desire to build inventories in advance of the October SAP launch in Asia, we rebalanced global inventories, leading to higher airfreight costs. We're operating at normal capacity now and this factor will not recur.
Higher dairy and agricultural oil costs came through as expected, also driving gross margins down relative to the mid-64% range seen in the first half of the year. As we showed at the investor day event, the largest increase in dairy costs in 2011 has been in the North American market. And further pressure on market margins will be evident in the fourth quarter for the North America/Europe segment.
On a full year basis, we currently expect gross margins to be slightly less than 63%, and below the 63.2% expectation set last quarter. The third quarter manufacturing inefficiencies I just mentioned are the reason for the reduction.
Absent foreign exchange and pension impacts, operating expenses grew by $45 million or $0.16 per share compared to the prior year quarter. Most of this is demand generation spend for marketing, sales force, advertising and promotion, along with research and development. We expect our spending levels in the fourth quarter to grow even further, reducing earnings by as much as $0.08 per share relative to the third quarter. On a full year basis, we anticipate total operating expenses will be consistent with our previous guidance at about 39.7% of sales, of which advertising and promotion spending should run around 14% of sales.
Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate, or ETR, came in about 24% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 31% of last year. Each quarter, we update our full year tax rate and also true up our tax accruals to apply that latest rate estimate to pretax earnings generated year-to-date, not just in the current quarter. We now forecast the 2011 full year rate to be just under 28%, about 100 basis points lower than our June estimate. That is due to a favorable country mix, higher manufacturing and R&D tax incentives, and favorable adjustments to accounting tax provisions as we file our tax returns each September. The drop in the 2011 tax rate increased EPS in the quarter by about $0.03, with $0.02 of that due to the benefit from first-half earnings. 
The key assumptions behind our full year earnings guidance of $2.73 to $2.78 per share include 14% constant dollar sales growth plus an additional 2.5% from foreign exchange. Gross margin is slightly below 63%. Operating expenses of about 39.7% and effective tax rate just below 28% are also expected.
Obviously, there are some considerable timing differences in our third-quarter results, but let me quickly highlight some of the factors affecting our fourth quarter. A high-end of our EPS guidance would imply fourth quarter earnings of $0.51 per share. That's a drop in consecutive quarterly earnings of about $0.27 per share. Five factors account for over 90% of the reduction:
First, EPS was boosted by about $0.03 in the third quarter by customer purchases in advance of our October SAP launch. Those shipments will reverse in the fourth quarter, leading to a consecutive earnings decline of a full $0.06.
Second, we anticipate pension settlement expenses of $0.03 to come through in the fourth quarter.
Third, we saw about $0.04 per share from balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter of this year. Those will not repeat. In fact, the dollar has weakened a bit over the last few weeks and we now expect $0.01 or so of balance sheet remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter. Well, those factors reduces consecutive quarterly EPS by about $0.05. 
Fourth, we anticipate that operating expenses will grow in the fourth quarter by as much as $0.08 per share.
And fifth, we will see a timing impact from unfavorable fixed cost absorption of about $0.03. Production rates are down slightly in the second half relative to the run rates seen earlier in the year, and are lower than average rates we expect to see moving forward.
There are a number of other factors at work, including higher dairy cost in North America and the unfavorable translation impact from a stronger dollar. Also note that the third quarter results included a benefit from a reduced tax rate on first-half earnings that will not recur. These are partially offset by the recovery from manufacturing inefficiencies seen in the third quarter.
Finally, note that the $0.03 per share increase in our full year earnings guidance reflects the net favorable foreign exchange impacts, the lower tax rate, partly offset by the manufacturing inefficiencies during the third quarter. Operating performance, excluding these items, is largely unchanged from our earlier expectations.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash at the end of September stood at $761 million, of which all but $120 million was held outside the United States. Year-to-date free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, stood at $383 million. We repurchased about 400,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 1.3 million shares, consuming $81.6 million in cash. Adding dividends, we have returned more than 60% of cash flow to shareholders so far this year.
For the full year, capital spending is forecast at about $120 million, down slightly from our earlier estimate of $125 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Depreciation and amortization expense will be about $76 million.
With that, help me turn the call back to Steve."

If you look at what we said, gross margins on a full year basis slightly below 63%. Based on the year-to-date performance, that might imply something around 61% in the fourth quarter, so you're absolutely right. A couple of factors driving that. First is the fact we're going to be facing higher dairy costs in North America in particular. That's the biggest. That's still going through. It has peaked and started to drop a little. It hasn't dropped significantly, but there's the 6-month delay before what you see in spot prices and when it shows up in our COGS. In addition, I mentioned the fact that we're going to have lower production rates. We saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We're going to see a bigger impact of that in the fourth quarter, and that just gets to the fact that when you look at our global production rates, first half are higher than second half, some of that due to the Abbott recall. But even when we look at it on a normalized basis, we are seeing an impact in gross margins in Q4, which are really timing-driven. We might see some of that rollover into Q1. But on a full year basis next year, it's not going to impact it. And then we get a benefit from favorable mix coming through, and also pricing in the coming year. The bottom line is that we wouldn't want you -- don't draw a conclusion about full year gross margins based on that 61% or so in the first quarter."

We've completed another strong quarter, and as you likely read in this morning's press release, our results were in line with the positive expectations shared with you at our investor day event 2 weeks ago, and our EPS came in at the top end of our preliminary estimate. Therefore, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on the key highlights of our strong sales and earnings results.
We delivered double-digit sales growth of 15% on a reported basis in the third quarter or about 11.5% measured in constant dollars. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share, up 37% from the prior year quarter, came from strong sales growth in emerging markets, favorable foreign exchange impacts and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by continued investments in demand generation activities and nonrecurring manufacturing inefficiencies. And as mentioned earlier this year, we're starting to see the gross margin impact of higher commodity costs. Pete will address the profit and margin numbers in more detail in a few minutes.
Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis or 25% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I should highlight that about 3% of sales growth for the segment came as the result of some retailers in Asia purchasing extra inventory in advance of the October transition to our new SAP technology platform. Excluding this factor, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, constant dollar sales in Asia/Latin America grew by 22%.
Our strongest performance continues to be in China and Hong Kong, with growth well above the segment average. While many investors naturally focus on our performance in Greater China, we also have delivered double-digit constant dollar sales growth in the rest of Asia and Latin America in 2011. We've seen success in the execution of our strategies in most of our emerging markets.
In the North America/Europe segment, third quarter sales were 7% lower on a reported basis or down 8% measured in constant dollars. We expected this tough comparison due, in large part, to lapping a competitor's U.S. product recall commencing in September of 2010. Most importantly, our U.S. market share remains above third quarter 2010 and is evidence that consumers value our many products innovations launched over the past year.
There were also some timing factors at work that reduced U.S. sales for the last quarter, including the phase out of one WIC contract in Indiana without the full phase-in on a new Mead Johnson contract for New England states. That should be completed in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, volume continued to be the key driver of sales growth at 7.5% for the company in total and a strong 19% in Asia and Latin America. Higher pricing added 4%, with both developed and emerging market segments seeing the benefit. We will continue to use pricing as well as productivity gains to manage gross margins as we move into 2012.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've maintained our constant dollar sales growth projection at about 14% versus the prior year, with another 2.5% from foreign exchange. We expect to see annual sales growth slightly above 20% in Asia/Latin America with North America/Europe in the low single digits.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.73 to $2.78, up from the $2.70 to $2.75 range from last quarter. Operating expenses of 39.7% of sales reflect our commitment to continue investing in demand generation activities to support sustainable sales and earnings growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and will return to wrap up and take your questions."

As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures.

As a reminder, my comments will focus on non-GAAP figures. I will cover 3 key topics: first, the key drivers of our third quarter EPS improvement; second, those factors which impact fourth quarter and full year EPS; and finally, some brief comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow.
Third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share were $0.21 higher than 2010. About $0.08 of this increase is related to foreign exchange impacts on our balance sheet. Many consumer goods companies operate in their major markets with self-contained local manufacturing and local currency costs, and thus, are not subject to any significant foreign exchange exposure for their balance sheet. We however, spray dry our base infant formulas at centralized facilities. These plants invoice in dollars for products shipped into other markets and have dollar cash and receivable accounts on their local currency books. As a result, they face balance sheet remeasurement gains or losses on these accounts as exchange rates fluctuate.
In the third quarter of last year, we saw a weakening dollar and recognized balance sheet remeasurement losses as a result. And in the third quarter 2011, we have seen the opposite trend, with the dollar strengthening against many currencies leading to balance sheet remeasurement gains. Well, that is one key factor affecting the year-over-year comparison.
A second factor is that we saw a $0.03 EPS hit from pension settlement expense in the third quarter of last year. This is the result of accounting rules which dictate that when lump-sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the plan's deferred losses need to be recognized immediately. Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low, so it doesn't take many retirees to generate the settlement expense.
With the first 3 quarters of 2011, however, we have seen lower lump-sum payouts than in 2010 and have not yet hit the threshold to recognize any pension settlement charges. Instead, we anticipate this expense will show up in the fourth quarter. Absent these 2 items, EPS grew by about $0.10 per share or about 17% in the quarter. Strong sales growth and a lower effective tax rate were offset by lower gross margins and a higher level of operating expenses.
This quarter's gross margin of 61.6% was below our earlier expectations by almost a full percentage point. We incurred onetime manufacturing inefficiencies at a plant that supplies Asia. Due to strong demand in these markets, which was further aggravated by our desire to build inventories in advance of the October SAP launch in Asia, we rebalanced global inventories, leading to higher airfreight costs. We're operating at normal capacity now and this factor will not recur.
Higher dairy and agricultural oil costs came through as expected, also driving gross margins down relative to the mid-64% range seen in the first half of the year. As we showed at the investor day event, the largest increase in dairy costs in 2011 has been in the North American market. And further pressure on market margins will be evident in the fourth quarter for the North America/Europe segment.
On a full year basis, we currently expect gross margins to be slightly less than 63%, and below the 63.2% expectation set last quarter. The third quarter manufacturing inefficiencies I just mentioned are the reason for the reduction.
Absent foreign exchange and pension impacts, operating expenses grew by $45 million or $0.16 per share compared to the prior year quarter. Most of this is demand generation spend for marketing, sales force, advertising and promotion, along with research and development. We expect our spending levels in the fourth quarter to grow even further, reducing earnings by as much as $0.08 per share relative to the third quarter. On a full year basis, we anticipate total operating expenses will be consistent with our previous guidance at about 39.7% of sales, of which advertising and promotion spending should run around 14% of sales.
Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate, or ETR, came in about 24% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 31% of last year. Each quarter, we update our full year tax rate and also true up our tax accruals to apply that latest rate estimate to pretax earnings generated year-to-date, not just in the current quarter. We now forecast the 2011 full year rate to be just under 28%, about 100 basis points lower than our June estimate. That is due to a favorable country mix, higher manufacturing and R&D tax incentives, and favorable adjustments to accounting tax provisions as we file our tax returns each September. The drop in the 2011 tax rate increased EPS in the quarter by about $0.03, with $0.02 of that due to the benefit from first-half earnings. 
The key assumptions behind our full year earnings guidance of $2.73 to $2.78 per share include 14% constant dollar sales growth plus an additional 2.5% from foreign exchange. Gross margin is slightly below 63%. Operating expenses of about 39.7% and effective tax rate just below 28% are also expected.
Obviously, there are some considerable timing differences in our third-quarter results, but let me quickly highlight some of the factors affecting our fourth quarter. A high-end of our EPS guidance would imply fourth quarter earnings of $0.51 per share. That's a drop in consecutive quarterly earnings of about $0.27 per share. Five factors account for over 90% of the reduction:
First, EPS was boosted by about $0.03 in the third quarter by customer purchases in advance of our October SAP launch. Those shipments will reverse in the fourth quarter, leading to a consecutive earnings decline of a full $0.06.
Second, we anticipate pension settlement expenses of $0.03 to come through in the fourth quarter.
Third, we saw about $0.04 per share from balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter of this year. Those will not repeat. In fact, the dollar has weakened a bit over the last few weeks and we now expect $0.01 or so of balance sheet remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter. Well, those factors reduces consecutive quarterly EPS by about $0.05. 
Fourth, we anticipate that operating expenses will grow in the fourth quarter by as much as $0.08 per share.
And fifth, we will see a timing impact from unfavorable fixed cost absorption of about $0.03. Production rates are down slightly in the second half relative to the run rates seen earlier in the year, and are lower than average rates we expect to see moving forward.
There are a number of other factors at work, including higher dairy cost in North America and the unfavorable translation impact from a stronger dollar. Also note that the third quarter results included a benefit from a reduced tax rate on first-half earnings that will not recur. These are partially offset by the recovery from manufacturing inefficiencies seen in the third quarter.
Finally, note that the $0.03 per share increase in our full year earnings guidance reflects the net favorable foreign exchange impacts, the lower tax rate, partly offset by the manufacturing inefficiencies during the third quarter. Operating performance, excluding these items, is largely unchanged from our earlier expectations.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash at the end of September stood at $761 million, of which all but $120 million was held outside the United States. Year-to-date free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, stood at $383 million. We repurchased about 400,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 1.3 million shares, consuming $81.6 million in cash. Adding dividends, we have returned more than 60% of cash flow to shareholders so far this year.
For the full year, capital spending is forecast at about $120 million, down slightly from our earlier estimate of $125 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Depreciation and amortization expense will be about $76 million.
With that, help me turn the call back to Steve."

If you look at what we said, gross margins on a full year basis slightly below 63%. Based on the year-to-date performance, that might imply something around 61% in the fourth quarter, so you're absolutely right. A couple of factors driving that. First is the fact we're going to be facing higher dairy costs in North America in particular. That's the biggest. That's still going through. It has peaked and started to drop a little. It hasn't dropped significantly, but there's the 6-month delay before what you see in spot prices and when it shows up in our COGS. In addition, I mentioned the fact that we're going to have lower production rates. We saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We're going to see a bigger impact of that in the fourth quarter, and that just gets to the fact that when you look at our global production rates, first half are higher than second half, some of that due to the Abbott recall. But even when we look at it on a normalized basis, we are seeing an impact in gross margins in Q4, which are really timing-driven. We might see some of that rollover into Q1. But on a full year basis next year, it's not going to impact it. And then we get a benefit from favorable mix coming through, and also pricing in the coming year. The bottom line is that we wouldn't want you -- don't draw a conclusion about full year gross margins based on that 61% or so in the first quarter."
