I'm happy to report that 2010 turned out to be a much better year than anybody protected 12 months ago. Unfortunately, the momentum has continued into 2011. Our results suggest that the lodging recovery has held steady in the face of an uncertain and volatile world. REVPAR growth sustained its 10% clip even as comparisons became more challenging throughout the year. We enjoyed a tailwind in luxury brands and gateway cities powered ahead. Based on these results, we remain cautiously confident about the near term. Nevertheless, the rapidly unfolding events in Egypt remind us that the world is an uncertain plays. Our thoughts today are with the people of Egypt including our guests and associates.
As we look ahead, we remain bullish about our long-term prospects. Many refer to 2011 as the beginning of the two speed recovery. According to the line of thinking, the developed world will see moderates economic growth. In North America and Europe, the hotel industry may nonetheless be on the verge of a multi year surge on rates thanks to the basic laws of supply and demand. This is worth some explanation. 
Unlike residential or office real estate, hotel supply is unusually tight at this early stage in the cycle. And with construction financing almost nonexistent, virtually no new hotels are being built. Meanwhile, demand is already strong and likely to get stronger. Corporate profitability is high and businesses are out traveling in search of growth. Leisure demand is also building as wealthier households are in good financial shape. So based on tight supply and growing demand, we believe REVPAR has a good chance of rising from well below its historic trend to where it is today, to well above the trend lines in the coming years. In fact, the next three to four years will see the strongest growth in the rates in North America that we've seen in decades.
The second part of the two speed recovery is playing out in the emerging markets. We've talked at length about his huge secular growth trend in earlier calls. And today, we remain as bullish as ever in these markets as an extraordinary growth opportunity for Starwood. Rising wealth and growing demand for infrastructure, travel, and of course, hotels, has a long way to go up.
For the next few minutes, I'd like to cover three topics: The first, a quick review of the fourth quarter; second, an in-depth look at our approach to global brands; and third, an update on our 2011 outlook.  Let's start with are for quarter results. 
Worldwide REVPAR was up over 12% excluding foreign exchange wellhead of our Q3 guidance. Growth was balanced around most of the world. Outside North America, REVPAR growth was 11% compared to 10% in North America. Likewise, owned hotels around the world grew at 11%. Margins increased 170 basis points after adjusting for nonrecurring items in 2009. We continue to work hard to drive our hotels pass the levels of the profitability that they had reached before the downturn. This is what we're the path to peak initiatives and a focus on taking market share while holding our costs down.  Today, margins are still low. But as REVPAR builds, they'll continue moving in the right direction.
Our Vacation Ownership business also beat expectations. Rising consumer confidence is reflected in rising to work flows and close rates. Defaults in delinquencies are also improving. Remember, this business generated almost $500 million cash for the past two years. We expect it to throw off for cash in the coming years as well also, by this time next year, Bal Harbour will begin closing sales and returning cash.
So to conclude our discussion of the fourth quarter, we beat the high-end of our EBITDA guidance by $34 million and EPS by $0.14.
This is a great way to finish the year and put a foundation under what looks to be a prolonged lodging recovery.
So let's turn now to my second topic. I'd like to spend most of this call talking about our philosophy and approach to creating global lifestyle brands. Over the past several calls, we talked at length about our global advantage. The fact that we parlayed our decades-long legacy of cities around the world into being the most global hotel company with meaningful leads in China, India, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. With 70% of the world's economic growth expecting to come from emerging markets, I have a strong conviction that this is an important advantage for Starwood.
Equally important is our focus on building brands that will capture the loyalty and increasingly trend-savvy global travelers. Brands and innovation are what makes Starwood special in the eyes of associates, our guests and our owners. Throughout its history, Starwood earned stripes as a lodging industry renegade with game changing innovations like W, Heavenly Bed and Starwood preferred guests. Over the past several years, we've worked hard to forge a more aligned and disciplined culture. But even though we've grown up, we can still shake it up. We're right where we want to be with the right balance of Yin and Yang, intuitive branding and disciplined execution.
Before I joined Starwood, I often traveled more than 100 days per year staying in my share of nice hotels. But as a brand guy, I would describe so many of those hotels as generic or even soulless. The only way you could tell one brand from another was two walk outside and look at the sign of the building. A four or five-star hotel was a four or five-star hotel. At Starwood, we believe branding should be much more than that. Here's an example: Last week I was in San Diego for the Alice conference. I left the U.S. Grant, our luxury collection hotel, walked to the West and on the way to my reception at the W. These are all wonderful hotels. But what jumps out is how each is distinct from the other. Each hotel represents its own brand whether it's the 100 years of heritage at the beautifully restored U.S. Grant; the party vibe of the W's rooftop beach bar with a soothing, Zen like lobby at the gas lamp you can't escape that each of these hotels makes you feel different. That, in a nutshell is what we mean by lifestyle branding.
We aren't segmenting by price or stars and we foresee that the appeal of lifestyle brands will only increase in a world where travelers expect ever more from brands.
During our Investor Day, we discussed how the world is changing rapidly in ways that favor a global brand-led company like Starwood. Globalization and all that comes with it including billions of new travelers and generations connected via social networks translates into a truly global consumer base with unprecedented appetite for global brands.
I see this as the next stage in the long evolution of brands. When many of us baby boomers grew up in the 60s or 70s, brands were just a promise, a guarantee of safety, consistency and reliability. Ultimately, brands got so good at delivering consistency that consumers took it for granted. And got bored. Brands today can't just be reliable or even just generically nice. They need to deliver personality, purpose and personalization. Consumers look to brands to add something to their lives and to define who they are. So we work hard to understand our brand loyalists and use these insights to define each brand. W for trendsetters, Sheraton for Socials, Westin for balance-seekers, Le Méridien for creatives, Aloft for early adopters and so on. Distinct brands help us create emotional connections with our guests. Distinct brands also help us work with owners to align the right brand with the right project and to translate crisp brand positioning into it more value for their assets.
Our business model boils down to owning the hearts and minds of our guests and creating value for our owners.
The well spring of Starwood's and lifestyle brand strategy dates back to the launch of W in 1998. More recently, we've kept the flame of innovation burning brightly with the launch of Aloft in element. Innovation is also right in Sheraton. The Lincoln Sheraton, our lobby cybercafe for today's multi-tasking social traveler is now a central feature of almost every Sheraton around the world. An essential part of lifestyle branding is translating brand personality into design. In fact, I believe that bringing our brands to life in 3-D is one of Starwood's greatest innovations. Design is a sweet spot for us and something we take seriously. So despite the crisis and our focus on reducing costs, we made the investment to open the Starwood design center in Soho early last year. Our design team there and in our headquarters is comprised of leaders that have come to us from the world's most respected design-led brands including Armani, Nike and Starbucks.
But insights and personality, design and innovation are nothing without the human touch. Our brands depend on the efforts of our associates to delight our guests. So we start by selecting the right associates to represent our brands. We train them in the fundamentals of service delivered in the right brand voice and we work hard to remind our associates that they're central to the success of the company. Which in fact, they are.
The sum total of all that we do creates branded experiences, cues both overt and subtle reinforce what each brand is about. The goal is to appear to our guests lifestyle, emotions and aspirations and to compel them to come back again and again.
I can't talk about brand building, innovation or design without talking more about W. W came on the scene, or better said created a scene in New York back in 1998. For the first time, a Hotel combined the style of an independent boutique hotel with the substance of a branded business hotel. The first W was an immediate hit. What lies around the block, our biggest problem was replacing the force for the wear and tear. The original idea of W was to transform tired upscaled properties in to cool W's and charged upper upscale rates but as we've grown around the world with W flagships in Hong Kong, Barcelona, Santiago and South Beach, the brand has been pulled up-market with rates that put us squarely into luxury territory. And the growth continues. We believe that W will get to 50 hotels in half the time that it took Four Seasons. This is what can happen when you combine a game-changing brand with a powerful global platform.
We haven't stopped there. The way W redefined luxury respond the belief that we can do the same to shake up this stained select-service hotel. Aloft brand is done just that. Last month, trip advisor released survey results ranking two of our Aloft hotels in the top 10 trendiest hotels in the entire U.S. This was concluded some of the most buzzed-about new hotels. It's one thing for Manhattan hotspot to make a list like this but a select light server to be a Aloft in the Suburban Nashville? Or an airport hotel at the Aloft in Portland, Oregon? But this is exactly what we set out to do when we created Aloft: To bring style and design and an affordable price to unexpected places: Or as we like to say, style at a steal. Aloft is was created by and for next generation travelers, people who grew up with IKEA and the iPods expecting style and design everywhere they go.
And here's something else that's groundbreaking about Aloft. We launched it globally from Day One in Canada, China, India, the Emirates and Belgium. Globalization means that there is simultaneous demand for new brands, segmentation by geography is as outdated as segmentation by price. This helps to explain why Aloft is the fastest brand launch in hotel history. In a few months, we'll celebrate our 50th opening. Not bad for a brand that opened in stores during the worst recession in our lifetimes.
As you may also, we recently launched another first of its kind brand, Element, the world's first Leed certified hotel chain. We dubbed it our ""echo chic"" brand. It combines sustainability and style and already enjoys a cultlike following. Guest satisfaction scores for Element properties routinely reached levels normally associated with luxury hotels. And despite its small footprint, REVPAR index is ramping quickly. With Gen Y leading the charge in how we think about sustainability, we're looking to migrate the learnings from element which we consider our green innovation lab across our entire portfolio of brands. The brand may be small now, but its impact on the industry over the coming decade should be quite meaningful. In fact, Element helped Starwood earned a coveted spot as one of Newsweek's greatest companies.
Let's move on to the brands that helped inspire element, Westin. Westin is proof positive that the district brand personality in a mainstream Upper Upscale space can create a category killer. Building on the success of the iconic Heavenly Bed, Westin is all about wellness and renewal. The cachet of the Westin brand and its suite of restorative products like the Heavenly Bath, the heavenly Spa and a super foods menu allow it to all in wellness among hotel brands. And wellness is by no means a passing fad. It's a $2 trillion global industry driven by affluent consumers around the globe. In fact, Westin is enjoying global growth of more than 90% of its pipeline outside of the U.S.  In the past two years, we've opened eight lessons in China and India alone. And Westin opened strong right out of the gate with markets like Chen Jin China and Hyderabad India outperforming the concept of the first year. Back in the U.S. with a footprint half the size of other Upper Upscale brands, there's plenty of room to grow in North America once developers start building.
Another brand case study is Le Méridien with its European heritage and geographic reach, it complimented nicely our existing brands and footprint. When we bought the brand five years ago, it wasn't making money. We eliminated 85% of the G&A and by plugging it into our system, we grew revenues by 20% in the first year alone. The net result was first-year EBITDA of nearly $50 million. Not bad for a $300 million investment.  This acquisition showed how we can breathe life into languishing brand. We took a disparate group of hotels, many of which, were at best, generically nice and invented a brand for the creative class, a group not served by any global hotel brand. The creative class includes the growing ranks of architects, web designers and journalists and is estimated to number nearly in the tens of millions in the U.S. alone. Le Méridien brought art, music and culture and a European sensibility into the guest experience. We selectively added high-quality hotels to the portfolio and removed 30 properties that weren't up to the brand standards. Today, worldwide REVPAR index is at record highs and catching the interest of developers.
So now I'd like to turn to the Sheraton brand, our biggest brand and our biggest story. From my career in branded businesses, can tell you that it takes discipline and determination to bring us bring to a sense of personality to a brand that grew up in the area era of reliability. But we held the course over the past four years to re-create Sheraton. This entailed a $6 billion capital plan combined with de-flagging over 50 properties worldwide. Behind the discipline of our shared networks, there was a vision for creating a compelling lifestyle brand out of this global hospitality icon. Sheraton has the highest global awareness of any hotel brand and was the first global brand in most markets around the world. In short, Sheraton is the world's gathering place. This positioning appeals to today's social travelers and is a lifestyle brand that transcends generations and geographies. Sheraton appeals to what we call ""downstairs people"". They love to travel but don't want to sit alone in their rooms. That insight led us to redesign and Sheraton lobbies with the length and inviting space that gives new purpose to our lobbies and in much the same way living room does in W. Most important way, I'm thrilled to share with you the success of our Sheraton relaunch. The brand has seen record high guest satisfaction, record high meeting something likely to return, record high associating engagements for three years running. Sheraton also today boasts record high four star ratings and a higher percentage of those ratings than either Hilton or Marriott.
In 2010, this translated into a 210 basis point gain in REVPAR index in North America. This is a monumental move for unestablished brand base of 200 hotels. Finally, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sheraton's also the largest part of our global pipeline.
We've also revitalize the four points by Sheraton which today has seen record growth. The halo effect of Sheraton has certainly been helping four points around the world. Four Points personality is based on the insight that many personnel travelers are looking for honest, uncomplicated comfort in the form of great bed, cold beer, free water and wi-fi. In today's environment in North America, Four Points by Sheraton is a great conversion play for owners looking to get more value out of their assets. Oh and by the way, uncomplicated doesn't mean we can't have a sense of humor. Over the past few years, our Chief Beef Officer made appearances across our system.
And finally, let's turn to our Saint Regis and collection brands. Between the two, we have 100 luxury properties around the world almost 140 when you add the portfolio. That gives a substantially more luxury hotels than any other hotel company. Like W, our luxury brands benefit from their connection to Starwood platform. Take for instance our loyalty program, SPG. Because of our high end brands,  we're able to offer our members more luxury in more destinations around the globe. This is a big draw for our loyal members who account for nearly one in two guests in our hotels today.
And as we all know, wealth creation around the world is fueling new demand for luxury. In fact, 70% of our pipeline for Saint Regis and luxury collection is an emerging markets across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Looking back, this is exactly the opportunity that lead us to create the Saint Regis brand out of one single-owned hotel, the St. Regis New York. This legendary hotel defines luxury with its signature butler service. And whereas W made it's thumb and nose in tradition, Saint Regis respects it, but it's not afraid to reinterpret it. In just the past two years, Saint Regis has doubled its footprint and there's plenty of runway for future growth as Saint Regis Hotels debut in locations such as Lhasa in Tibet, Sonya in southern China, Waikiki Beach in Puerto Rico and Doha in Qatar. Places that not long ago you might not have associated as luxury destinations.
And finally, a few words about luxury collection. These high end hotels offer Indigenous experiences to sophisticated travelers exploring the world for something new. Luxury collection offers owners an independent iconic properties the chance to plug into a global reservation system, a sales force and of course SPG. The brand's conversion flexibility, not to mention its unique appeal, is reflected by recent openings at the liberty Hotel in Boston, that transformed urban jail, the Omaha resort in the Emirates, a luxury tent at Camp in the Desert; and the asked door will tell in Tianjin, the oldest luxury hotel in China.
So my goal over of the past few minutes has been to share with you some insight into our strategy behind our brands. To sum it up, Starwood's approach offers our guests and our owners a portfolio of brands. Each with the personality built on consumer insights and brought to life by design, innovation and energized associates. Our brand is reliable and all things to all people and is yesterday's news. Our portfolio of distinct brands for district travel occasions is a great foundation for tomorrow's growth. Through this commitment through differentiated lifestyle brands, we or looking to lead in delivering great experiences and in earning premium rates. 
So before I wrap up, let me move on to my third topic for today, our revised outlook for 2011. Business traveler remains strong. Our Monday to Thursday volumes are driving occupancies in the 90% range in most major metro markets. Our customers are telling us that they'll continue to travel in 2011 in search of precious growth for their own businesses. Some months ago, I described this as a travel-intensive recovery. I still believe that. Group business has also carried over the momentum we built in 2010 as a reminder 2010 group business at the beginning of last year was pacing down 20% but improve dramatically through 2010. Group pays for the 2011 also improved sequentially through 2010. So as a result, we're beginning 2011 with pace up double digits significantly ahead of last year's starting point. As expected for some time, booking windows now starting to lengthen. Nonetheless strong bookings and increasing sales will translate into revenues that are quickly rebounding towards 2007 levels. Would've taken that a year ago. And get this, December crushed the all-time record for monthly production. The real story in 2011 will be about rising rates. Corporate rate negotiations are still being finalized and they are still on track to single-digits the mix of room categories and clients should also support our ATR growth. Business travelers power 75% of revenues but leisure travel is also an important out of business, especially at resorts and tourist destinations. We've seen the leisure demand increases consumer confidence has improved and we take heart from the fact that affluent travelers something finance today are quite robust compared to a couple of years ago. As wood business travel, this affords us the opportunity to improve mix by for simple, phasing out some cut-rate Internet channels such as opaque.
So before I hand off to Vasant, I'd like to share some thoughts and 2011. Overall, I'm encouraged by our REVPAR trajectory in what appears to be the start of a multiyear recovery. For all the reasons we've been talking about, we remain bullish about our business over the long term. At the same time, we see a global economy that can be volatile and unpredictable. If current trends continue, we can expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011. With rate increases for group and corporate accounts and a better mix of business, REVPAR in 2011 will be increasingly driven by rate. This is in contrast to 2010 where REVPAR growth was driven by rising occupancy. Factoring all this in, we will deliver a baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion. 
With more on that, let me turn over the call to Vasant."
341584,117936130,98614,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits and good morning, everyone. As you have seen business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies both in the U.S. and internationally H",1889,"Thank you, Frits and good morning, everyone. As you have seen business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies both in the U.S. and internationally Healthy fee growth, a strong something SVO and good cost control resulted in EBITDA and EPS well ahead of our expectations. This sets the stage well for what we think will be the second year of a normal, cyclical recovery in 2011. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on business conditions around the world, our 2011 outlook, our balance sheet and at Bal Harbour. 
Despite tougher comparisons from 2009, North America was up double digits in the fourth quarter. We saw rate picking up and group business coming back strong. In the first half, the east: New York, Boston and other cities led the recovery. But as the year progressed, business picked up in the West Coast San Francisco, Seattle and across the country. At this time last year, we had indicated that late-breaking corporate transient business would make or break 2010. And as you know, corporate founding business came back strong. While make or break 2011 is red and the trends we saw in Q4 are promising. In 2010, we saw occupancy accounted for almost all the REVPAR growth in North America. We expect rate to drive 50% or more of REVPAR growth in 2011.
With 75% of corporate rate negotiations complete, we expect to finish with rates up in the high single digits. We will also continue to aggressively manage mixed improve rate realization through the year. Group business is also picking up as we would expect at this stage in the cycle. Group base is up in the double digits. Q4 new production was up almost 50% for all future years and up almost 50% for 2011. The lead pipeline remains strong with lead volume up almost 30% and size of leads up all-out 20%. With some volatility due to the weather, January momentum is good with REVPAR tracking in the double digits across the U.S. Low supply growth and the U.S. economy showing increasing signs of recovery point to 2011 shaping up as a second year of a normal cyclical recovery.
Outside the U.S., Asia continues to power ahead. Q4 REVPAR growth was up in the high teens across Asia, lead by China and China-related economies. We expected  some slowdown after the World Expo in Shanghai, but have not seen any as China grew 24%. China related economies like Australia are also booming. Our hotels in Australia are hitting all-time highs in profitability, even as the Aussie dollar parity with the U.S. dollar. Indonesia, south K ea, Vietnam also a double-digit growth. Thailand is recovering from the political turmoil and Japan remains the only soft spot. Free growth in 2010 approach 40% driven by 26% REVPAR growth and the rapid expansion of our hotel base in the region. Starwood-branded rooms operating in Asia are up over 80% since 2005. And as you know, we have a strong pipeline of future openings.
Moving to Europe, trends similar to the U.S. in northern and central Europe. Local currency REVPAR us up double digits with some volatility due to the unusual snow in December. Group basis also picking up and booking Windows are looking to normal. Despite the concerns about Spain, our business was fine in Q4 with outstanding performance all year by our new iconic W but Solana which really. That W is well on its way to becoming the leading hotel in Barcelona.
We are excited about the next major W opening in Europe, the W Leicester Square in London this February will also to tell. For opening costs associated with this opening, somebody who ported all leads earnings in Q1. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter in Europe, and the trend for the year will likely become more evident as we get into the second quarter. Like the U.S. with low supply growth and rate improvement, we expect 2011 to shape up as the second year of a normal cyclical recovery. As we have for the past few years, we have hedged about 50% of our euro exposure.
The Middle East and Africa is the only region that has not yet recovered fully. REVPAR was down slightly in Q4. Africa grew but the Middle East was down mostly due to the Gulf where we have a large presence. But we did see a recovery in the Gulf in November December and this appears to be continuing  into January. Occupancies in the Gulf or high rates have liked so far. The political turmoil in North Africa, especially Egypt is of course hurting our business. We have 16 hotels across North Africa and approximately $10 million to $12 million in fees in 2010. We expect that our fees will be hit in North Africa, but we may pick up some business if it shifts to the Gulf, for example. It is too early to tell how we will be impacted, but this is clearly a risk that needs to be closely monitored.
In Latin America, the South continues to boom. Brazil was up 18%, Argentina up 15% and Chile up 25% as it recovers from last year's earthquake. In Mexico, Mexico City was strong. The results continue to lag due to concerns but we're starting to see some improvement. Latin America is the local inflation and devaluation GAAP which is hurting margins of our hotels. We have large owned hotels in the region of this issue will depress our global own hotel margins in 2011 as it has in 2010. Local costs are going up to 5%, for example, in Argentina 2 to tie local inflation. But the currency weakening growth dollar has been roughly flat over the last three months.
Our hotel rates which are typically in dollars are not going up as fast as our costs. As a result of this disconnect, and despite significant efforts by our local teams to hold costs in line, our margins are under pressure. We expect this issue to persist as long as these currencies are not devalued relative to the state dollar concert with the local inflation trend. Our occasion business is stable. Close rates and pricing have tracked in line with expectations. Delinquency default rates continue to improve. We remain focused on cash generation in this business with select inventory adds and we expect to generate over $150 million in cash flow in 2011 on top of the $500 million we generated in '09 and '10.
At Bal Harbour, 2011 is a key year. The project is nearing completion. But Tom are getting a temporary significant occupancy in Q4 2011 and expect to start closing late in the fourth quarter. Capital record is $150 million in 2011. We will have expenses through the first three orders at Bal Harbour as we have had in prior years. Assuming we start closing in Q4, there may well be some revenue and income recognition in Q4 which is not included in our outlook. We will provide updates as the year progresses. There will also be some cash flow from closing but offset some of our capital spend on Bal Harbour this year.
We have contracts on more than half the condo inventory and hope to be 65% to 70% sold by the time we start closings. 2012 will be the big year for revenue and income recognition, and cash flow from Bal Harbour based on current plans. 
All this brings us to our overall outlook for 2011. The world remains an uncertain place with the risk of geopolitical and marcoeconomic shocks. the remain of a view that the scenario-based approach is the best way to plan for the future, we have prepared for worst-case outcomes. But based on what we see today we believe that a normal recovery scenario isn't playing out around the world. But also affects his normal recovery with normal global REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% of company operated hotels in local currency at 100 basis points higher as reported in dollars. 150 to 250 basis points of margin improvement in own hotel, 10% to 12% fee growth, a small increase in SVO giving us a 2011 EBITDA range of $975 movie to $1 billion and an EPS range of $1.55 to $1.65.
One point of REVPAR impacts EBITDA by approximately $15 million in. One point of shift in Forks rates globally relative to the dollar impacts EBITDA by $4 million to $5 million. We expect to open 70 to 80 hotels globally in 2011 with more than half outside the U.S. While our own margin improvements not hire three points to highlight the margin pressure at our own Latin American hotels due to the inflation devaluation, disconnect; second, this stage of the cycle, revenue which is what drives margin lags REVPAR, now almost 400 basis points in Q4, for example, and preopening costs associated with the W in London which will reduce Q1-own profits.
We will remain very focused on cost as we have been to drive our own margins back to peak levels.
We are setting up capital spending up to two years when we sharply reduce our capital to convert cash estimates that there's some catching up to do over the next couple of few years. Several significant renovations will be undertaken in 2011 including the grand in Florecnce, which are converting into a Saint Regis, the Alphonso 13 in Seville, the Westin gas lamp, the Sheraton and other small projects. Over an extended time frame, our maintenance capital spend has of owned hotels has averaged 7% to 8% of gross operating revenue ranging from 5% with the cycle turns down to highs of 10% when the cycle turns out. We expect to be at the high-end of the range for the next couple of years.
We're also stepping up spending in our major technology platforms to enhance functionality, to build a new platform in sales to refresh hardware. In addition, as you normally do expect to deploy capital to build our pipeline equity with the returns for it. Despite the increase in capital spending, we expect to be moderately positive on cash flow before any asset sales. All the time, as we continue to sell hotels, the capital needs of the business will decline.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We have significant cash inflows in the fourth quarter, $245 million from the tax refund, $75 million from a legal settlement, cash from the sale of a joint venture hotel and of course strong operating performance. As a result, our net debt excluding securitized receivables was down to $2 billion. At the end of the year we had cash in excess of approximately $650 million. Our liquidity and leverage positions continue to get stronger. Our ratios are well below covenant levels and we are evolving rapidly towards achieving an investment-grade reading hopefully before the end of 2011. With regard to asset sales, we continue to have a few assets on the market. As always, we will close deals where we get that right price, the franchise contract and the right buyer. And we will announce deals if and when they close. As in our practice, our asset does not assume any asset sales."

In terms of branding, there's a considerable amount of scale that goes to having a lodging brand. In other words, even as we add more hotels, while we need to add some local resources to support those brands specifically in markets, a lot of those costs are either fixed or they are part of the break even point pools that we have to invest in building brands on behalf of owners. So I don't think that the branding focus that we have is as much at odds with our P&L as it might seem. And what I want to emphasize in my words that we have been able to combine to focus on creativity and innovation of the discipline of the same side. And what you see in some creative and brand-driven organizations is a lack of balance in that way. And I think that right now, given where we are in terms of our corporate culture and the alignment of our senior teams around the world, we're in a very place, I think, to take advantage of that scale. When it comes to CapEx, as you know, we currently, today only own about 5% of our total base. And so the work that we've done has been largely focused on making sure that our owners are in a position that they're investing behind our brands in meaningful ways. And one of the things that we've talked about for sometime is the fact that over 60% of our hotels today continue to be hotels that were either opened or significantly renovated in the last three years. So we have a very strong base of hotels. We have the highest percentage of hotels for the brand Sheraton that are on brand and consistent with our standards than we've ever had. And I think that's born out by some of the other results and some of the other all-time highs that I was talking about during my discussion of branding"

Overall, makes those ad up to be a meaningful amount. If you looked at 2010, there weren't huge rate increases. Most of the increase on the rate side of REVPAR growth in 2010, and Jacobs split this out for you later, would've been driven by more of a mix than it would've been my absolute rate increase. So again that comment was more driven to a point to an example of how mix can change rates rather than itself being the key driver of that."

I would assume you're concerned first of all, I think its interesting and important to remember that our incentive fees in countries like China don't have a preferred return basis as Vastant was referring to earlier. So we would get to incentive fees early in the process. As you look at second-tier markets, it's also hard to make generalizations. There are some markets where, because of we're the first five store brand with the global connection in that market, those hotels do quite well and achive great rates than other markets that we are continuing to build out come in overtime. But we continue to be very impressed with the resiliency of the Chinese market. Vasant mentioned to you the ability for demand to absorb occupancy post-shanghai World Expo. The same thing was true after the Olympics in 2008. And so the pace of development in China continues to be very strong. We continue to see opportunities to sign new projects. And as you can see, the REVPAR numbers for 2010 is certainly borne that out."

I'm happy to report that 2010 turned out to be a much better year than anyone predicted 12 months ago. And fortunately, the momentum has continued into 2011. Our results suggest that the lodging recovery has held steady in the face of an uncertain and volatile world. 
REVPAR growth sustained its 10% cliff, even as comparisons became more challenging throughout the year. We enjoyed a tailwind in Luxury brands and gateway cities powered ahead. Based on these results, we remain cautiously confident about the near term. Nevertheless, the rapidly unfolding events in Egypt remind us that the world is an uncertain place. Our thoughts today are with the people of Egypt, including our guests and associates.
As we look ahead, we remain bullish about our long-term prospects. Many refer to 2011 as the beginning of the two-speed recovery. According to the line of thinking, the developed world will see moderate economic growth. In North America and Europe, the hotel industry may nonetheless be on the verge of a multiyear surge on rates, thanks to the basic laws of supply and demand. This is worth some explanation. 
Unlike residential or office real estate, hotel supply is unusually tight at this early stage in the cycle. And with construction financing almost nonexistent, virtually no new hotels are being built. Meanwhile, demand is already strong and likely to get stronger. Corporate profitability is high, and businesses are out traveling in search of growth. Leisure demand is also building, as wealthier households are in good financial shape. So based on tight supply and growing demand, we believe REVPAR has a good chance of rising from well below its historic trend line, where it is today, to well above the trend line in the coming years. In fact, the next three to four years could see the strongest real growth in the rates in North America that we've seen in decades.
The second part of the two-speed recovery is playing out in the emerging markets. We've talked at length about his huge secular growth trend in earlier calls. And today, we remain as bullish as ever in these markets as an extraordinary growth opportunity for Starwood. Rising wealth and growing demand for infrastructure, travel, and of course, hotels, has a long way to go up.
For the next few minutes, I'd like to cover three topics: The first, a quick review of the fourth quarter; second, an in-depth look at our approach to global brands; and third, an update on our 2011 outlook.
Let's start with are for quarter results. Worldwide REVPAR was up over 10%, excluding foreign exchange well ahead of our Q3 guidance. Growth was balanced around most of the world. Outside North America, REVPAR growth was 11% compared to 10% in North America. Likewise, owned hotels around the world grew at 11%. Margins increased 170 basis points after adjusting for nonrecurring items in 2009. 
We continue to work hard to drive our hotels past the levels of peak profitability that they have reached before the downturn. This is what we're calling our path to peak initiatives, and it focus on taking market share while holding our costs down.  Today, margins are still low. But as REVPAR builds, they'll continue moving in the right direction.
Our Vacation Ownership business also beat expectations. Rising consumer confidence is reflected in rising tour flows and close rates. Defaults in delinquencies are also improving. Remember, this business generated almost $0.5 billion in cash for the past two years. We expect it to throw up more cash in the coming years as well. Also, by this time next year, Bal Harbour will begin closing sales and returning cash.
So to conclude our discussion of the fourth quarter, we beat the high end of our EBITDA guidance by $34 million and EPS by $0.14. This is a great way to finish the year and put a foundation under what looks to be a prolonged lodging recovery.
So let's turn now to my second topic. I'd like to spend most of this call talking about our philosophy and approach to creating global lifestyle brands. Over the past several calls, we've talked at length about our global advantage. The fact that we parlayed our decades-long legacy in cities around the world into being the most global hotel company, with meaningful leads in China, India, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. With 70% of the world's economic growth expected to come from emerging markets, I have a strong conviction that this is an important advantage for Starwood.
Equally important is our focus on building brands that will capture the loyalty and increasingly brand-savvy global travelers. Brands and innovation are what makes Starwood special in the eyes of associates, our guests and our owners. Throughout its history, Starwood earned its stripes as a lodging industry renegade with game-changing innovations like W to Heavenly Bed and Starwood Preferred Guest. Over the past several years, we've worked hard to forge a more aligned and disciplined culture. But even though we've grown up, we can still shake it up. We're right where we want to be with the right balance of Yin and Yang, intuitive branding and disciplined execution.
Before I joined Starwood, I often traveled more than 100 days per year staying in my share of nice hotels. But as a brand guy, I would describe so many of those hotels as generic or even soulless. The only way you could tell one brand from another was two walk outside and look at the sign on the building. A four- or five-star hotel was a four- or five-star hotel. At Starwood, we believe branding should be much more than that. Here's an example, last week, I was in San Diego for the ALIS Conference. I left the US GRANT, our Luxury Collection hotel, walked through the Westin on my way to my reception at the W. These are all wonderful hotels, but what jumps out is how each is distinct from the other. Each hotel represents its brand, whether it's the 100 years of heritage at the beautifully restored US GRANT, the party vibe at the W's rooftop beach bar with a soothing Zen-like lobby at The Westin Gaslamp, you can't escape that each of these hotels makes you feel different. That, in a nutshell, is what we mean by lifestyle branding.
We aren't segmenting by price or stars, and we foresee that the appeal of lifestyle brands will only increase in a world where travelers expect ever more from brands.
During our Investor Day, we discussed how the world is changing rapidly in ways that favor a global brand-led company like Starwood. Globalization, and all that comes with it, including billions of new travelers and generations connected via social networks, translates into a truly global consumer base with unprecedented appetite for global brands.
I see this as the next stage in the long evolution of brands. When many of us baby boomers grew up in the 60s or 70s, brands were just a promise, a guarantee of safety, consistency and reliability. Ultimately, brands got so good at delivering consistency that consumers took it for granted and got bored. Brands today can't just be reliable or even just generically nice. They need to deliver personality, purpose and personalization. 
Consumers look to brands to add something to their lives and to define who they are. So we work hard to understand our brand loyalists and use these insights to define each brand; W for trendsetters, Sheraton for socials, Westin for balance-seekers, Le Méridien for creatives, Aloft for early adopters and so on. Distinct brands help us create emotional connections with our guests. Distinct brands also help us work with owners to align the right brand with the right project and to translate crisp brand positioning into it more value for their assets.  Our business model boils down to owning the hearts and minds of our guests and creating value for our owners.
The well spring of Starwood's and lifestyle brand strategy dates back to the launch of W in 1998. More recently, we've kept the flame of innovation up burning brightly with the launch of Aloft and Element. Innovation is also bright in Sheraton. The Link@Sheraton, our lobby cybercafe for today's multi-tasking social traveler, is now a central feature of almost every Sheraton around the world. An essential part of lifestyle branding is translating brand personality into design. In fact, I believe that bringing our brands to life in 3D is one of Starwood's greatest innovations. 
Design is a sweet spot for us and something we take seriously. So despite the crisis and our focus on reducing costs, we made the investment to open the Starwood Design Center in Soho early last year. Our design team there and in our headquarters is comprised of leaders that have come to us from the world's most respected design-led brands including Armani, Nike and Starbucks.
But insights and personality, design and innovation are nothing without the human touch. Our brands depend on the efforts of our associates to delight our guests. So we start by selecting the right associates to represent our brands. We train them in the fundamentals of service delivered in the right brand voice, and we work hard to remind our associates that they're central to the success of the company, which, in fact, they are.
The sum total of all that we do creates branded experiences; cues, both overt and subtle, reinforce what each brand is about. The goal is to appeal to our guests' lifestyle, emotions and aspirations, and to compel them to come back again and again.
I can't talk about brand building, innovation or design without talking more about W. W came on the scene, or better said, created a scene in New York back in 1998. For the first time, a hotel combined the style of an independent boutique hotel with the substance of a branded business hotel. The first W was an immediate hit. With lines around the block, our biggest problem was replacing the force for the wear and tear. The original idea of W was to transform tired upscale properties in to cool Ws and charged upper upscale rates, but as we've grown around the world with W flagships in Hong Kong, Barcelona, Santiago and South Beach, the brand has been pulled up-market, with rates that put us squarely into Luxury territory, and the growth continues. We believe that W will get to 50 hotels in half the time that it took Four Seasons. This is what can happen when you combine a game-changing brand with a powerful global platform.
We haven't stopped there. The way W redefined Luxury spawned the belief that we could do the same to shake up this state's Select Service segment. The Aloft brand has done just that. Last month, TripAdvisor released survey results ranking two of our Aloft hotels in the top 10 trendiest hotels in the entire U.S. This was concluded with some of the most buzzed-about new hotels. 
that's one thing for a Manhattan hotspot to make a list like this, but a select-service hotel like Aloft in suburban Nashville or an airport hotel like the Aloft in Portland, Oregon? But this is exactly what we set out to do when we created Aloft, to bring style and design at an affordable price to unexpected places, or as we like to say, style at a steal. Aloft was created by and for the next-generation travelers, people who grew up with IKEA and the iPods, expecting style and design wherever they go.
And here is something else that's groundbreaking about Aloft. We launched it globally from day one in Canada, China, India, the Emirates and Belgium. Globalization means that there's simultaneous demand for new brands. Segmentation by geography is as outdated as segmentation by price. This helps explain why Aloft has the fastest brand launch in hotel history. In a few months, we'll celebrate our 50th opening, not bad for a brand that opened its doors during the worst recession in our lifetimes.
As you may also know, we recently launched another first-of-its-kind brand, Element, the world's first LEED-certified hotel chain. We dubbed it our ""eco-chic brand."" It combines sustainability and style and already enjoys a cultlike following. Guest satisfaction scores for Element properties routinely reach levels normally associated with Luxury hotels. And despite its small footprint, REVPAR index is ramping quickly. With Gen Y leading the charge in how we think about sustainability, we're looking to migrate the learnings from Element, which we consider our green innovation lab, across our entire portfolio of brands. The brand may be small now, but its impact on the industry over the coming decade should be quite meaningful. In fact, Element helped Starwood earned a coveted spot as one of Newsweek's greenest companies.
Let's move on to the brands that helped inspire Element, Westin. Westin is proof positive that a district brand personality in a mainstream upper upscale space can create a category killer. Building on the success of the iconic Heavenly Bed, Westin is all about wellness and renewal. The cachet of the Westin brand and its suite of restorative products like the Heavenly Bath, the Heavenly Spa and a SuperFoods foods menu allow it to own wellness among hotel brands. 
And wellness is by no means a passing fad. It's a $2 trillion global industry, driven by affluent consumers around the globe. In fact, Westin is enjoying global growth with more than 90% of its pipeline outside of the U.S. In the past two years, we've opened eight Westins in China and India alone, and Westin opened strong right out of the gate with markets like Tian Jin, China and Hyderabad, India, outperforming the comp set in the first year. Back in the U.S., with a footprint half the size of other upper upscale brands, there's plenty of room to grow in North America once developers start building.
Another brand case study is Le Méridien, with its European heritage and geographic reach, it complemented nicely our existing brands and footprint. When we bought the brand five years ago, it wasn't making money. We eliminated 85% of the G&A. And by plugging it into our system, we grew revenues by 20% in the first year alone. The net result was first-year EBITDA of nearly $50 million, not bad for a $300 million investment.  
This acquisition showed how we can breathe life into languishing brand. We took a disparate group of hotels, many of which, were at best, generically nice and invented a brand for the creative class, a group not served by any global hotel brand. The creative class includes the growing ranks of architects, web designers and journalists and is estimated to number nearly in the tens of millions in the U.S. alone. Le Méridien brought art, music and culture and a European sensibility into the guest experience. We selectively added high-quality hotels to the portfolio and removed 30 properties that weren't up to the brand standards. Today, worldwide REVPAR index is at record highs and catching the interest of developers.
So now I'd like to turn to the Sheraton brand, our biggest brand and our biggest story. From my career in branded businesses, I can tell you that it takes discipline and determination to bring today's sense of personality to a brand that grew up in the era of reliability, but we held the course over the past four years to re-create Sheraton. This entailed a $6 billion capital plan combined with de-flagging over 50 properties worldwide. 
Behind the discipline of our Sheraton efforts, there was a vision for creating a compelling lifestyle brand out of this global hospitality icon. Sheraton has the highest global awareness of any hotel brand and was the first global brand in most markets around the world. In short, Sheraton is the world's gathering place. This positioning appeals to today's social travelers and is a lifestyle brand that transcends generations and geographies. Sheraton appeals to what we call ""downstairs people."" They love to travel but don't want to sit alone in their rooms. That insight led us to redesign our Sheraton lobbies with the Link, an inviting space that gives new purpose to our lobbies in much the same way living room does at W. Most important way, I'm thrilled to share with you the success of our Sheraton relaunch. The brand has seen record-high guest satisfaction, record-high meeting planners' likelihood to return, record-high associate engagement for three years running. Sheraton today also boasts record-high four-star ratings and a higher percentage of those ratings than either Hilton or Marriott.
In 2010, this translated into a 210-basis-point gain in REVPAR index in North America. This is a monumental move for an established brand base of 200 hotels. Finally, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sheraton is also the largest part of our global pipeline.
We've also revitalized the Four Points by Sheraton, which today has seen record growth. The halo effect of Sheraton is certainly helping Four Points around the world. Four Points' personality is based on the insight that many personnel travelers are looking for honest, uncomplicated comfort in the form of a great bed, cold beer, free water and Wi-Fi. In today's environment in North America, Four Points by Sheraton is a great conversion play for owners, looking to get more value out of their assets. Oh and by the way, uncomplicated doesn't mean we can't have a sense of humor. Over the past few years, our Chief Beer Officer made appearances across our system.
And finally, let's turn to our St. Regis and Luxury Collection brands. Between the two, we have 100 Luxury properties around the world almost 140 when you add in W's portfolio. That gives us substantially more luxury hotels than any other hotel company. Like W, our Luxury brands benefit from their connection to the Starwood platform. Take for instance our loyalty program, SPG. Because of our high-end brands,  we're able to offer our members more luxury and more destinations around the globe. This is a big draw for our loyal members who account for nearly one in two guests at our hotels today.
And as we all know, wealth creation around the world is fueling new demand for Luxury. In fact, 70% of our pipeline for St. Regis and Luxury Collection is in emerging markets across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Looking back, this is exactly the opportunity that led us to create the St. Regis brand out of one single-owned hotel, the St. Regis New York. This legendary hotel defines luxury with its signature butler service. And whereas W made it's thumb and nose at tradition, St. Regis respects it, but it's not afraid to reinterpret it. 
In just the past two years, St. Regis has doubled its footprint, and there's plenty of runway for future growth, as St. Regis Hotels debut in locations such as Lhasa in Tibet, Sanya in Southern China, Bahia Beach in Puerto Rico and Doha in Qatar. Places that, not long ago, you might not have associated as luxury destinations.
And finally, a few words about Luxury Collection. These high-end hotels offer indigenous experiences to sophisticated travelers exploring the world for something new. Luxury Collection offers owners of independent iconic properties the chance to plug into a global reservation system, a sales force and, of course, SPG. The brand's conversion flexibility, not to mention its unique appeal, is reflected by recent openings at the Liberty Hotel in Boston, a transformed urban jail; the Omaha Resort in the Emirates, a luxury tent at camp in the desert; and The Astor Hotel in Tianjin, the oldest luxury hotel in China.
So my goal over of the past few minutes has been to share with you some insight into our strategy behind our brands. To sum it up, Starwood's approach offers our guests and our owners a portfolio of brands, each with a personality, built on consumer insights and brought to life by design, innovation and energized associates. A brand that is reliable and all things to all people is yesterday's news. A portfolio of distinct brands for distinct travel occasions is a great foundation for tomorrow's growth. Through this commitment to differentiated lifestyle brands, we are looking to lead in delivering great experiences at earning-premium rates. 
So before I wrap up, let me move on to my third topic for today, our revised outlook for 2011. Business travel remains strong. Our Monday to Thursday volumes are driving occupancies in the 90% range in most major metro markets. Our customers are telling us that they'll continue to travel in 2011 in search of precious growth for their own businesses. 
Some months ago, I described this as a travel-intensive recovery. I still believe that. Group business has also carried over the momentum we built in 2010. As a reminder, 2010 Group business at the beginning of last year was pacing down 20%, but improved dramatically through 2010. Group pays for the 2011 also improved sequentially through 2010. So as a result, we're beginning 2011 with pace of double digits significantly ahead of last year's starting point. 
As expected for some time, booking windows are now starting to lengthen. Nonetheless, strong bookings and improving sales will translate into revenues that are quickly rebounding towards 2007 levels. Who would have taken that bet a year ago? And get this, December crushed the all-time record for monthly group production. The real story in 2011 will be about rising rates. Corporate rate negotiations are being finalized, and they're still on track to increase in high-single digits. 
The mix of room categories and clients should also support our ADR growth. Business travelers power 75% of our revenues, but leisure travel is also an important part of our business, especially at resorts and tourist destinations. We've seen the leisure demand increases as consumer confidence has improved and, we take heart from the fact that affluent travelers with finances today are quite robust compared to a couple of years ago. As with business travel, this affords us the opportunity to improve mix by, for example, phasing out some cut-rate Internet channels such as opaque [ph].
So before I hand off to Vasant, I'd like to share a few more thoughts on 2011. Overall, I'm encouraged by our REVPAR trajectory in what appears to be the start of a multiyear recovery. For all the reasons we've been talking about, we remain bullish about our business over the long term. At the same time, we see a global economy that can be volatile and unpredictable. If current trends continue, we could expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011. With rate increases for group and corporate accounts and a better mix of business, REVPAR in 2011 will be increasingly driven by rate. This is in contrast to 2010, where REVPAR growth was driven by rising occupancy. Factoring all this in, we would deliver a baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion. 
With more on that, let me turn over the call to Vasant."
341584,117936130,98845,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. As you have seen business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the U.S. and internationally",1929,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. As you have seen business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the U.S. and internationally. Healthy fee growth, a strong finish at SVO and good cost control resulted in EBITDA and EPS well ahead of our expectations. This sets the stage well for what we think will be the second year of a normal, cyclical recovery in 2011. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on business conditions around the world, our 2011 outlook, our balance sheet and at Bal Harbour. 
Despite tougher comparisons from 2009, North America was up double digits in the fourth quarter. We saw rate picking up and group business coming back strong. In the first half, the East, New York, Boston and other cities led the recovery. But as the year progressed, business picked up in the West, San Francisco, Seattle and across the country. At this time last year, we had indicated that late-breaking corporate transient business would make or break 2010. And as you know, corporate transient business came back strong, while make-or-break 2011 is red and the trends we saw in Q4 are promising. In 2010, occupancy accounted for almost all the REVPAR growth in North America. We expect rate to drive 50% or more of REVPAR growth in 2011.
With 75% of corporate rate negotiations complete, we expect to finish with rates up in the high single digits. We will also continue to aggressively manage mix to improve rate realization through the year. Group business is also picking up, as we would expect, at this stage in the cycle. Group base is up in the double digits. Q4 new production was up over 50% for all future years and up almost 50% for 2011. The lead pipeline remains strong with lead volume up almost 30% and size of leads, up 20%. With some volatility due to the weather, January momentum is good, with REVPAR tracking in the double digits across the U.S. Low supply growth and the U.S. economy showing increasing signs of recovery point to 2011 shaping up as a second year of a normal cyclical recovery.
Outside the U.S., Asia continues to power ahead. Q4 REVPAR growth was up in the high teens across Asia, led by China and China-related economies. We expect sums will be expected some slowdown after the World Expo in Shanghai, but we did not see any as China grew 24%. China-related economies like Australia are also booming. Our hotels in Australia are hitting all-time highs in profitability, even as the Aussie dollar is at parity with the U.S. dollar. Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam also a double-digit growth. Thailand is recovering from the political turmoil, and Japan remains the only soft spot. 
Fee growth in 2010 approached 40%, driven by 26% REVPAR growth and the rapid expansion of our hotel base in the region. Starwood-branded rooms operating in Asia are up over 80% since 2005. And as you know, we have a strong pipeline of future openings.
Moving to Europe, trends are not dissimilar to the U.S. in Northern and Central Europe. Local currency REVPARs were up double digits with some volatility due to the unusual snow in December. Group base is also picking up and booking windows are returning to normal. Despite the concerns about Spain, our business was fine in Q4 with outstanding performance all year by our new iconic W Barcelona, which we lease. The W is well on its way to becoming the leading hotel in Barcelona.
We are excited about the next major W opening in Europe, the W Leicester Square in London this February, which is also a leased hotel. Pre-opening costs associated with this opening will depress reported on-lease hotel earnings in Q1. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter in Europe, and the trend for the year will likely become more evident, as we get into the second quarter. Like the U.S. with low supply growth and rate improvement, we expect 2011 to shape up as the second year of a normal cyclical recovery. As we have for the past few years, we have hedged about 50% of our euro exposure.
The Middle East and Africa is the only region that has not yet recovered fully. REVPAR was down slightly in Q4. Africa grew but the Middle East was down, mostly due to the Gulf where we have a large presence. But we did see a recovery in the Gulf in November, December, and this appears to be continuing  into January. Occupancies in the Gulf are high, but rates have lagged so far. 
The political turmoil in North Africa, especially Egypt, is of course hurting our business. We have 16 hotels across North Africa and approximately $10 million to $12 million in fees in 2010. We expect that our fees will be hit in North Africa, but we may pick up some business, if it shifts to the Gulf, for example. It is too early to tell how we will be impacted, but this is clearly a risk that needs to be closely monitored.
In Latin America, the South continues to boom. Brazil was up 18%; Argentina, up 15%; and Chile, up 25%, as it recovers from last year's earthquake. In Mexico, Mexico City was strong. The results continue to lag due to crime concerns but is starting to see some improvement. The issue persisting in Latin America is the local inflation devaluation gap, which is hurting margins at our hotels. We have large owned hotels in the region, and this issue will depress our global owned hotel margins in 2011, as it has in 2010. Local costs are going up, 25%, for example, in Argentina due to high local inflation. But the currency into the weakening relative dollar has been roughly flat over the last three months.
Our hotel rates, which are typically in dollars, are not going up as fast as our costs. As a result of this disconnect, and despite significant efforts by our local teams to hold costs in line, our margins are under pressure. We expect this issue to persist as long as these currencies are not devalued relative to the dollar commensurate with the local inflation trend. 
Our Vacation and Ownership business is stable. Towards the closed rates and pricing, we have tracked in line with the expectations. Delinquency default rates continue to improve. We remain focused on cash generation in this business, with selective inventory adds. We expect to generate over $150 million in cash flow in 2011 on top of the $500 million we generated in '09 and '10.
At Bal Harbour, 2011 is a key year. The project is nearing completion. We're targeting a temporary certificate of occupancy in Q4 2011 and expect to start closing late in the fourth quarter. Capital required is $150 million in 2011. We will have expenses through the first three quarters for Bal Harbour, as we have had in prior years. Assuming we start closings in Q4, there may well be some revenue and income recognition in Q4, which is not included in our outlook. We will provide updates as the year progresses. There will also be some cash flow from closings that offset some of our capital spend on Bal Harbour this year.
We have contracts on more than half the condo inventory and hope to be 65% to 70% sold by the time we start closings. 2012 will be the big year for revenue and income recognition, and cash flow from Bal Harbour based on current plans. 
All this brings us to our overall outlook for 2011. The world remains an uncertain place with the risk of geopolitical and marcoeconomic shocks. We remain in the view that the scenario-based approach is the best way to plan for the future, we have prepared for worst-case outcomes, but based on what we see today, believe that a normal recovery scenario is playing out around the world. Our outlook reflects this normal recovery with global REVPAR growth of 7% to 9%  at of company-operated hotels in local currency and 100 basis points higher as reported in dollars. 150 to 250 basis points of margin improvement at owned hotel; 10% to 12% fee growth, a small increase at SVO, giving us a 2011 EBITDA range of $975 movie to $1 billion and an EPS range of $1.55 to $1.65.
One point of REVPAR impacts EBITDA by approximately $15 million in. One point will shift in Forex rates globally relative to the dollar impacts EBITDA by $4 million to $5 million. We expect to open 70 to 80 hotels globally in 2011, with more than half outside the U.S. While our own margin improvements are not higher. Three points I'll highlight here, margin pressure at our owned Latin American hotels due to the inflation devaluation, disconnect. Second, at this stage of the cycle, revenue which is what drives margins lag REVPAR, by almost 400 basis points in Q4, for example, and preopening costs associated with the W in London, which will reduce Q1-owned profits. We will remain very focused on cost, as we have been, to drive our own margins back to peak levels.
We are setting up capital spending up to two years, when we sharply reduce our capital to conserve cash. As you may expect, there is some catching up to do over the next couple of years. Several significant renovations will be undertaken in 2011, including the Grand in Florence, which are converting into a St. Regis, the Alfonso XIII in Seville, the Westin Gaslamp, the Sheraton Kauai and other smaller projects. 
Over an extended time frame, our maintenance capital spend at owned hotels has averaged 7% to 8% of gross operating revenue, ranging from 5% when the cycle turns down to highs of 10% when the cycle turns up. We expect to be at the high end of the range for the next couple of years.
We're also stepping up spending in our major technology platforms to enhance functionality, to build a new platform in sales and to refresh hardware. In addition, as we normally do, we expect to deploy capital to build our pipeline and assist owners with key money, loans or equity when the returns warrant it. Despite the increase in capital spending, we expect to be modestly positive on cash flow before any asset sales. All the time, as we continue to sell hotels, the capital needs of the business will decline.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We have significant cash inflows in the fourth quarter, $245 million from the tax refund, $75 million from a legal settlement, cash from the sale of a joint venture hotel and, of course, strong operating performance. As a result, our net debt, excluding securitized receivables, was down to $2 billion. At the end of the year we had cash in excess of working capital needs of approximately $650 million. 
Our liquidity and leverage positions continue to get stronger. Our ratios are well below covenant levels, and we are moving rapidly towards achieving an investment-grade rating, hopefully, before the end of 2011. With regard to asset sales, we continue to have a few assets on the market. As always, we will close deals where we get that right price, the right management-to-franchise contract and the right buyer, and we will announce deals if and when they close. As is our practice, our outlook does not assume any asset sales.
With that, let me turn this back to Jay."

So we continue to look for ways to pull up rates. I think that the REVPAR performance in Asia Pacific certainly points to our ability to do that. And likewise, as the markets in Africa and the Middle East rebound, which we expect that they will this year, particularly with rising commodity prices, that we should be able to put push rate there as well. So I think by and large, rates should do well in emerging markets. and a specific phenomenon in Latin America, I think, was pretty well-outlined by Vasant already."

Shaun, briefly though, on the real estate market, as we see it, clearly, the market fell off in a dramatic way in 2008 and 2009. We're delighted to see a recovery, but I would call it a partial recovery in the hotel transaction market today. And by that, I mean the real buyers today are from two places. They're from well-capitalized REITs who were looking for operating hotels, mostly in gateway cities that are well-financed and have no complication. The other buyers such as they exist, and we would call these on a rifle-shot basis, our high net-worth buyers from different markets around the world.

We remain committed to the asset-light strategy, but we think this market is still some time away from being a fully robust buy-and-sell market for hotels. So that's, Vasant, you want to add some color in the NOL?"

In terms of branding, there's a considerable amount of scale that goes to having a lodging brand. In other words, even as we add more hotels, while we need to add some local resources to support those brands specifically in markets, a lot of those costs are either fixed or they're part of the break-even fund pools that we have to invest in, in building brands on behalf of owners. And so, I don't think that the branding focus that we have is as much at odds with our P&L, as it might seem. And what I wanted to emphasize, in my words, that we have been able to combine the focus on creativity and innovation with the discipline on the same side. And what you see in some creative and brand-driven organizations is a lack of balance in that way. And I think that right now, given where we are in terms of our corporate culture and the alignment of our senior teams around the world, we're in a very good place, I think, to take advantage of that scale. When it comes to CapEx, as you know, we currently, today, only own about 5% of our total base. And so the work that we've done has been largely focused on making sure that our owners are in a position that they're investing behind our brands in meaningful ways. And one of the things that we've talked about for sometime is the fact that over 60% of our hotels today continue to be hotels that were either opened or significantly renovated in the last three years. So we have a very strong base of hotels. We have the highest percentage of hotels for the brand Sheraton that are on-brand and consistent with our standards than we've ever had. And I think that's born out by some of the other results and some of the other all-time highs that I was talking about during my discussion of branding"

But the point is, as you look at things like whether you have airline crews, in W hotels, what kind of business we taking in general from different channels, that overall mix, I think, does add up to being a meaningful amount. In fact, as you look at 2010, there weren't huge rate increases. Most of the increase on the rate side of REVPAR growth in 2010, and Jay could split this up maybe for you later, it would have been driven by more by mix than it would have been by absolute rate increase. So again, that comment was more driven to point to an example of how mix can change rates rather than itself being the key driver of that."

There are some markets where, because we're the first five-star brand with a global connection in that market, those hotels do quite well and achieve great rates. There are other markets that are continuing to build, where that will come in over time. But we continue to be very impressed with the resiliency of the Chinese market. Vasant mentioned to you the ability for demand to absorb occupancy post-Shanghai World Expo. The same thing was true after the Olympics in 2008. And so, the pace of development in China continues to be very strong. We continue to see opportunities to sign new projects.

I'm happy to report that 2010 turned out to be a much better year than anyone predicted 12 months ago. And fortunately, the momentum has continued into 2011. Our results suggest that the lodging recovery has held steady in the face of an uncertain and volatile world. 
REVPAR growth sustained its 10% cliff, even as comparisons became more challenging throughout the year. We enjoyed a tailwind as Luxury brands and gateway cities powered ahead. Based on these results, we remain cautiously confident about the near term. Nevertheless, the rapidly unfolding events in Egypt remind us that the world is an uncertain place. Our thoughts today are with the people of Egypt, including our guests and associates.
As we look ahead, we remain bullish about our long-term prospects. Many refer to 2011 as the beginning of a two-speed recovery. According to that line of thinking, the developed world will see moderate economic growth. In North America and Europe, the hotel industry may nonetheless be on the verge of a multiyear surge in rates, thanks to the basic laws of supply and demand. This is worth some explanation. 
Unlike residential or office real estate, hotel supply is unusually tight at this early stage in the cycle. And with construction financing almost nonexistent, virtually no new hotels are being built. Meanwhile, demand is already strong and likely to get stronger. Corporate profitability is high, and businesses are out traveling in search of growth. Leisure demand is also building, as wealthier households are in good financial shape. So based on tight supply and growing demand, we believe REVPAR has a good chance of rising from well below its historic trend line, where it is today, to well above the trend line in the coming years. In fact, the next three to four years could see the strongest real growth in rates in North America that we've seen in decades.
The second part of the two-speed recovery is playing out in the emerging markets. We've talked at length about his huge secular growth trend in earlier calls. And today, we remain as bullish as ever in these markets as an extraordinary growth opportunity for Starwood. Rising wealth and growing demand for infrastructure, travel, and of course, hotels, has a long way to go up.
For the next few minutes, I'd like to cover three topics: First, a quick review of the fourth quarter; second, an in-depth look at our approach to global brands; and third, an update on our 2011 outlook.
Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Worldwide REVPAR was up over 10%, excluding foreign exchange, well ahead of our Q3 guidance. Growth was balanced around most of the world. Outside North America, REVPAR growth was 11% compared to 10% in North America. Likewise, owned hotels around the world grew at 11%. Margins increased 170 basis points after adjusting for nonrecurring items in 2009. 
We continue to work hard to drive our hotels past the levels of peak profitability that they had reached before the downturn. This is what we're calling our path-to-peak initiatives, and they're focused on taking market share while holding our costs down. Today, margins are still low. But as REVPAR builds, they'll continue moving in the right direction.
Our Vacation Ownership business also beat expectations. Rising consumer confidence is reflected in rising tour flows and close rates. Defaults in delinquencies are also improving. Remember, this business generated almost $0.5 billion in cash over the past two years. We expect it to throw out more cash in the coming years as well. Also, by this time next year, Bal Harbour will begin closing sales and returning cash.
So to conclude our discussion of the fourth quarter, we beat the high end of our EBITDA guidance by $34 million and EPS by $0.14. This is a great way to finish the year and put a foundation under what looks to be a prolonged lodging recovery.
So let's turn now to my second topic. I'd like to spend most of this call talking about our philosophy and approach to creating global lifestyle brands. Over the past several calls, we've talked at length about our global advantage. The fact that we parlayed our decades-long legacy in cities around the world into being the most global hotel company, with meaningful leads in China, India, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. With 70% of the world's economic growth expected to come from emerging markets, I have a strong conviction that this is an important advantage for Starwood.
Equally important is our focus on building brands that will capture the loyalty and increasingly brand-savvy global travelers. Brands and innovation are what makes Starwood special in the eyes of associates, our guests and our owners. Throughout its history, Starwood earned its stripes as a lodging industry renegade with game-changing innovations like W to Heavenly Bed and Starwood Preferred Guest. Over the past several years, we've worked hard to forge a more aligned and disciplined culture. But even though we've grown up, we can still shake it up. We're right where we want to be with the right balance of Yin and Yang, intuitive branding and disciplined execution.
Before I joined Starwood, I often traveled more than 100 days per year staying in my share of nice hotels. But as a brand guy, I would describe so many of those hotels as generic or even soulless. The only way you could tell one brand from another was to walk outside and look at the sign on the building. A four- or five-star hotel was a four- or five-star hotel. At Starwood, we believe branding should be much more than that. Here's an example: last week, I was in San Diego for the ALIS Conference. I left the US GRANT, our Luxury Collection hotel, walked through the Westin on my way to reception at the W. These are all wonderful hotels, but what jumps out is how each is distinct from the other. Each hotel represents its brand, whether it's the 100 years of heritage at the beautifully restored US GRANT, the party vibe at the W's rooftop beach bar with a soothing Zen-like lobby at The Westin Gaslamp, you can't escape that each of these hotels makes you feel different. That, in a nutshell, is what we mean by lifestyle branding.
We aren't segmenting by price or stars, and we foresee that the appeal of lifestyle brands will only increase in a world where travelers expect ever more from brands.
During our Investor Day, we discussed how the world is changing rapidly in a ways that favor a global brand-led company like Starwood. Globalization, and all that comes with it, including billions of new travelers and generations connected via social networks, translates into a truly global consumer base with unprecedented appetite for global brands.
I see this as the next stage in the long evolution of brands. When many of us baby boomers grew up in the 60s or 70s, brands were just a promise, a guarantee of safety, consistency and reliability. Ultimately, brands got so good at delivering consistency that consumers took it for granted and got bored. Brands today can't just be reliable or even just generically nice. They need to deliver personality, purpose and personalization. 
Consumers look to brands to add something to their lives and to define who they are. So we work hard to understand our brand loyalists and use these insights to define each brand; W for trendsetters, Sheraton for socials, Westin for balance-seekers, Le Méridien for creatives, Aloft for early adopters and so on. Distinct brands help us create emotional connections with our guests. Distinct brands also help us work with owners to align the right brand with the right project and to translate crisp brand positioning into more value for their assets.  Our business model boils down to owning the hearts and minds of our guests and creating value for our owners.
The well spring of Starwood's lifestyle brand strategy dates back to the launch of W in 1998. More recently, we've kept the flame of innovation burning brightly with the launch of Aloft and Element. Innovation is also bright in Sheraton. The Link@Sheraton, our lobby cybercafe for today's multi-tasking social traveler, is now a central feature of almost every Sheraton around the world. An essential part of lifestyle branding is translating brand personality into design. In fact, I believe that bringing our brands to life in 3D is one of Starwood's greatest innovations. 
Design is a sweet spot for us and something we take seriously. So despite the crisis and our focus on reducing costs, we made the investment to open the Starwood Design Center in Soho early last year. Our design team there and in our headquarters is comprised of leaders that have come to us from the world's most respected design-led brands including Armani, Nike and Starbucks.
But insights and personality, design and innovation are nothing without the human touch. Our brands depend on the efforts of our associates to delight our guests. So we start by selecting the right associates to represent our brands. We train them in the fundamentals of service delivered in the right brand voice, and we work hard to remind our associates that they're central to the success of the company, which, in fact, they are.
The sum total of all that we do creates branded experiences; cues, both overt and subtle, reinforce what each brand is about. The goal is to appeal to our guests' lifestyle, emotions and aspirations, and to compel them to come back again and again.
I can't talk about brand building, innovation or design without talking more about W. W came on the scene, or better said, created a scene in New York back in 1998. For the first time, a hotel combined the style of an independent boutique hotel with the substance of a branded business hotel. The first W was an immediate hit. With lines around the block, our biggest problem was replacing the floors for the wear and tear. The original idea of W was to transform tired, upscale properties in to cool Ws and charged upper upscale rates, but as we've grown around the world with W flagships in Hong Kong, Barcelona, Santiago and South Beach, the brand has been pulled up-market, with rates that put us squarely into Luxury territory, and the growth continues. We believe that W will get to 50 hotels in half the time that it took Four Seasons. This is what can happen when you combine a game-changing brand with a powerful global platform.
We haven't stopped there. The way W redefined Luxury spawned the belief that we could do the same to shake up this state's Select Service segment. The Aloft brand has done just that. Last month, TripAdvisor released survey results ranking two of our Aloft hotels in the top 10 trendiest hotels in the entire U.S. This list concluded some of the most buzzed-about new hotels. 
So it's one thing for a Manhattan hotspot to make a list like this, but a select-service hotel like Aloft in suburban Nashville, or an airport hotel like the Aloft in Portland, Oregon? But this is exactly what we set out to do when we created Aloft, to bring style and design at an affordable price to unexpected places, or as we like to say, style at a steal. Aloft was created by and for next-generation travelers, people who grew up with IKEA and iPods, expecting style and design wherever they go.
And here is something else that's groundbreaking about Aloft. We launched it globally from day one in Canada, China, India, the Emirates and Belgium. Globalization means that there's simultaneous demand for new brands. Segmentation by geography is as outdated as segmentation by price. This helps explain why Aloft has the fastest brand launch in hotel history. In a few months, we'll celebrate our 50th opening, not bad for a brand that opened its doors during the worst recession in our lifetimes.
As you may also know, we recently launched another first-of-its-kind brand: Element, the world's first LEED-certified hotel chain. We dubbed it our ""eco-chic brand."" It combines sustainability and style and already enjoys a cult-like following. Guest satisfaction scores for Element properties routinely reach levels normally associated with Luxury hotels. And despite its small footprint, REVPAR index is ramping quickly. With Gen Y leading the charge in how we think about sustainability, we're looking to migrate the learnings from Element, which we consider our green innovation lab, across our entire portfolio of brands. The brand may be small now, but its impact on the industry over the coming decade should be quite meaningful. In fact, Element helped Starwood earn a coveted spot as one of Newsweek's greenest companies.
Let's move on to the brand that helped inspire Element, Westin. Westin is proof-positive that a district brand personality in a mainstream upper upscale space can create a category killer. Building on the success of the iconic Heavenly Bed, Westin is all about wellness and renewal. The cachet of the Westin brand and its suite of restorative products like the Heavenly Bath, the Heavenly Spa and a SuperFoods menu allow it to own wellness among hotel brands. 
And wellness is by no means a passing fad. It's a $2 trillion global industry, driven by affluent consumers around the globe. In fact, Westin is enjoying global growth with more than 90% of its pipeline outside of the U.S. In the past two years, we've opened eight Westins in China and India alone, and Westin opened strong right out of the gate with markets like Tian Jin, China and Hyderabad, India, outperforming the comp set in the first year. Back in the U.S., with a footprint half the size of other upper upscale brands, there's plenty of room to grow in North America once developers start building.
Another brand case study is Le Méridien, with its European heritage and geographic reach, it complemented nicely our existing brands and footprint. When we bought the brand five years ago, it wasn't making money. We eliminated 85% of the G&A. And by plugging it into our system, we grew revenues by 20% in the first year alone. The net result was first-year EBITDA of nearly $50 million, not bad for a $300 million investment.  
This acquisition showed how we can breathe life into a languishing brand. We took a disparate group of hotels, many of which were at best generically nice, and invented a brand for the creative class, a group not served by any global hotel brand. The creative class includes the growing ranks of architects, web designers and journalists and is estimated to number nearly in the tens of millions in the U.S. alone. Le Méridien brought art, music and culture and a European sensibility into the guest experience. We selectively added high-quality hotels to the portfolio and removed 30 properties that weren't up to the brand standards. Today, worldwide REVPAR index is at record highs and catching the interest of developers.
So now I'd like to turn to the Sheraton brand, our biggest brand and our biggest story. From my career in branded businesses, I can tell you that it takes discipline and determination to bring today's sense of personality to a brand that grew up in the era of reliability, but we held the course over the past four years to recreate Sheraton. This entailed a $6 billion capital plan combined with de-flagging over 50 properties worldwide. 
Behind the discipline of our Sheraton efforts, there was a vision for creating a compelling lifestyle brand out of this global hospitality icon. Sheraton has the highest global awareness of any hotel brand and was the first global brand in most markets around the world. In short, Sheraton is the world's gathering place. This positioning appeals to today's social travelers and is a lifestyle brand transcends generations and geographies. Sheraton appeals to what we call ""downstairs people."" They love to travel but don't want to sit alone in their rooms. That insight led us to redesign our Sheraton lobbies with the Link, an inviting space that gives new purpose to our lobbies in much the same way the living room does at W. Most importantly, I'm thrilled to share with you the success of our Sheraton relaunch. The brand has seen record-high guest satisfaction, record-high meeting planners' likelihood to return, record-high associate engagement for three years running. Sheraton today also boasts record-high four-star ratings and a higher percentage of those ratings than either Hilton or Marriott.
In 2010, this translated into a 210-basis-point gain in REVPAR index in North America. This is a monumental move for an established brand base of 200 hotels. Finally, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sheraton is also the largest part of our global pipeline.
We've also revitalized Four Points by Sheraton, which today has seen record growth. The halo effect of Sheraton is certainly helping Four Points around the world. Four Points' personality is based on the insight that many travelers are looking for honest, uncomplicated comfort in the form of a great bed, cold beer, free water and Wi-Fi. In today's environment in North America, Four Points by Sheraton is a great conversion play for owners looking to get more value out of their assets. Oh, and by the way, uncomplicated doesn't mean we can't have a sense of humor. Over the past few years, our Chief Beer Officer made appearances across our system.
And finally, let's turn to our St. Regis and Luxury Collection brands. Between the two, we have 100 Luxury properties around the world, almost 140 when you add in W's portfolio. That gives us substantially more luxury hotels than any other hotel company. Like W, our Luxury brands benefit from their connection to the Starwood platform. Take for instance our loyalty program, SPG. Because of our high-end brands,  we're able to offer our members more luxury and more destinations around the globe. This is a big draw for our loyal members who account for nearly one in two guests at our hotels today.
And as we all know, wealth creation around the world is fueling new demand for Luxury. In fact, 70% of our pipeline for St. Regis and Luxury Collection is in emerging markets across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Looking back, this is exactly the opportunity that led us to create the St. Regis brand out of one single-owned hotel, the St. Regis New York. This legendary hotel defines luxury with its signature butler service. And whereas W may thumb its nose at tradition, St. Regis respects it, but is not afraid to reinterpret it. 
In just the past two years, St. Regis has doubled its footprint, and there's plenty of runway for future growth, as St. Regis Hotels debut in locations such as Lhasa in Tibet, Sanya in Southern China, Bahia Beach in Puerto Rico and Doha in Qatar. Places that, not long ago, you might not have associated as luxury destinations.
And finally, a few words about Luxury Collection. These high-end hotels offer indigenous experiences to sophisticated travelers exploring the world for something new. Luxury Collection offers owners of independent iconic properties the chance to plug into a global reservation system, a sales force and, of course, SPG. The brand's conversion flexibility, not to mention its unique appeal, is reflected by the recent openings at the Liberty Hotel in Boston, a transformed urban jail; the Omaha Resort in the Emirates, a luxury tented camp in the desert; and The Astor Hotel in Tianjin, the oldest luxury hotel in China.
So my goal over of the past few minutes has been to share with you some insight into our strategy behind our brands. To sum it up, Starwood's approach offers our guests and our owners a portfolio of brands, each with a personality built on consumer insight and brought to life by design, innovation and energized associates. A brand that is reliable and all things to all people is yesterday's news. A portfolio of distinct brands for distinct travel occasions is a great foundation for tomorrow's growth. Through this commitment to differentiated lifestyle brands, we are looking to lead in delivering great experiences in an earning-premium rates. 
So before I wrap up, let me move on to my third topic for today, a revised outlook for 2011. Business travel remains strong. Our Monday to Thursday volumes are driving occupancies in the 90% range in most major metro markets. Our customers are telling us that they'll continue to travel in 2011 in search of precious growth for their own businesses. 
Some months ago, I described this as a travel-intensive recovery. I still believe that. Group business has also carried over the momentum we built in 2010. As a reminder, 2010 Group business at the beginning of last year was pacing down 20%, but improved dramatically through 2010. Group pays for 2011 also improved sequentially through 2010. So as a result, we're beginning 2011 with pace of double digits significantly ahead of last year's starting point. 
As expected for some time, booking windows are now slowly starting to lengthen. Nonetheless, strong bookings and improving sales will translate into revenues that are quickly rebounding towards 2007 levels. Who would have taken that bet a year ago? And get this, December crushed the all-time record for monthly group production. The real story in 2011 will be about rising rates. Corporate rate negotiations are being finalized, and they're still on track to increase in high-single digits. 
The mix of room categories and clients should also support our ADR growth. Business travelers power 75% of our revenues, but leisure travel is also an important part of our business, especially at resorts and tourist destinations. We've seen the leisure demand increase as consumer confidence has improved and, we take heart from the fact that affluent travelers with finances today are quite robust compared to a couple of years ago. As with business travel, this affords us the opportunity to improve mix by, for example, phasing out some cut-rate Internet channels such as opaque [ph].
So before I hand off to Vasant, I'd like to share a few more thoughts on 2011. Overall, I'm encouraged by our REVPAR trajectory in what appears to be the start of a multiyear recovery. For all the reasons we've been talking about, we remain bullish about our business over the long term. At the same time, we see a global economy that can be volatile and unpredictable. If current trends continue, we could expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011. With rate increases for group and corporate accounts and a better mix of business, REVPAR in 2011 will be increasingly driven by rate. This is in contrast to 2010, where REVPAR growth was driven by rising occupancy. Factoring all this in, we would deliver a baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion. 
With more on that, let me turn over the call to Vasant."
341584,117936130,99034,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. As you have seen, business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the U.S. and internationall",1923,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. As you have seen, business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the U.S. and internationally. Healthy fee growth, a strong finish at SVO and good cost control resulted in EBITDA and EPS well ahead of our expectations. This sets the stage well for what we think will be the second year of a normal, cyclical recovery in 2011. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on business conditions around the world, our 2011 outlook, our balance sheet and Bal Harbour. 
Despite tougher comparisons from 2009, North America was up double digits in the fourth quarter. We saw rate picking up and group business coming back strong. In the first half, the East, New York, Boston and other cities led the recovery. But as the year progressed, business picked up in the West, San Francisco, Seattle and across the country. At this time last year, we had indicated that late-breaking corporate transient business would make or break 2010. And as you know, corporate transient business came back strong, while make-or-break 2011 is red and the trends we saw in Q4 are promising. In 2010, occupancy accounted for almost all the REVPAR growth in North America. We expect rate to drive 50% or more of REVPAR growth in 2011.
With 75% of corporate rate negotiations complete, we expect to finish with rates up in the high single digits. We will also continue to aggressively manage mix to improve rate realization through the year. Group business is also picking up, as we would expect, at this stage in the cycle. Group base is up in the double digits. Q4 new production was up over 50% for all future years and up almost 50% for 2011. The lead pipeline remains strong, with lead volume up almost 30% and size of leads up 20%. With some volatility due to the weather, January momentum is good, with REVPAR tracking in the double digits across the U.S. Low supply growth and the U.S. economy showing increasing signs of recovery point to 2011 shaping up as a second year of a normal cyclical recovery.
Outside the U.S., Asia continues to power ahead. Q4 REVPAR growth was up in the high teens across Asia, led by China and China-related economies. We expect sums will be expected some slowdown after the World Expo in Shanghai, but did not see any as China grew 24%. China-related economies like Australia are also booming. Our hotels in Australia are hitting all-time highs in profitability, even as the Aussie dollar is at parity with the U.S. dollar. Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, also a double-digit growth. Thailand is recovering from the political turmoil, and Japan remains the only soft spot. 
Fee growth in Asia in 2010 approached 40%, driven by 26% REVPAR growth and the rapid expansion of our hotel base in the region. Starwood-branded rooms operating in Asia are up over 80% since 2005. And as you know, we have a strong pipeline of future openings.
Moving to Europe, trends are not dissimilar to the U.S. in Northern and Central Europe. Local currency REVPARs were up double digits with some volatility due to the unusual snow in December. Group base is also picking up and booking windows are returning to normal. Despite the concerns about Spain, our business was fine in Q4 with outstanding performance all year by our new iconic W Barcelona, which we lease. The W is well on its way to becoming the leading hotel in Barcelona.
We are excited about the next major W opening in Europe, the W Leicester Square in London this February, which is also a leased hotel. Pre-opening costs associated with this opening will depress reported on-lease hotel earnings in Q1. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter in Europe, and the trend for the year will likely become more evident, as we get into the second quarter. Like the U.S. with low supply growth and rate improvement, we expect 2011 to shape up as the second year of a normal cyclical recovery. As we have for the past few years, we have hedged about 50% of our euro exposure.
The Middle East and Africa is the only region that has not yet recovered fully. REVPAR was down slightly in Q4. Africa grew but the Middle East was down, mostly due to the Gulf where we have a large presence. But we did see a recovery in the Gulf in November, December, and this appears to be continuing into January. Occupancies in the Gulf are high, but rates have lagged so far. 
The political turmoil in North Africa, especially Egypt, is of course hurting our business. We have 16 hotels across North Africa and approximately $10 million to $12 million in fees in 2010. We expect that our fees will be hit in North Africa, but we may pick up some business if it shifts to the Gulf, for example. It is too early to tell how we will be impacted, but this is clearly a risk that needs to be closely monitored.
In Latin America, the South continues to boom. Brazil was up 18%; Argentina, up 15%; and Chile, up 25% as it recovers from last year's earthquake. In Mexico, Mexico City was strong. The results continue to lag due to crime concerns but is starting to see some improvement. The issue persisting in Latin America is the local inflation devaluation gap, which is hurting margins at our hotels. We have large owned hotels in the region, and this issue will depress our global owned hotel margins in 2011, as it has in 2010. Local costs are going up: 25%, for example, in Argentina, due to high local inflation. But the currency into the weakening relative dollar has been roughly flat over the last three months.
Our hotel rates, which are typically in dollars, are not going up as fast as our costs. As a result of this disconnect, and despite significant efforts by our local teams to hold costs in line, our margins are under pressure. We expect this issue to persist as long as these currencies are not devalued relative to the dollar commensurate with the local inflation trend. 
Our Vacation Ownership business is stable. Tours, closed rates and pricing have tracked in line with expectations. Delinquency default rates continue to improve. We remain focused on cash generation in this business, with selective inventory adds. We expect to generate over $150 million in cash flow in 2011 on top of the $500 million we generated in '09 and '10.
At Bal Harbour, 2011 is a key year. The project is nearing completion. We're targeting a temporary certificate of occupancy in Q4 2011 and expect to start closing late in the fourth quarter. Capital required is $150 million in 2011. We will have expenses through the first three quarters for Bal Harbour, as we have had in prior years. Assuming we start closings in Q4, there may well be some revenue and income recognition in Q4, which is not included in our outlook. We will provide updates as the year progresses. There will also be some cash flow from closings that offset some of our capital spend on Bal Harbour this year.
We have contracts on more than half the condo inventory and hope to be 65% to 70% sold by the time we start closings. 2012 will be the big year for revenue and income recognition, and cash flow from Bal Harbour based on current plans. 
All this brings us to our overall outlook for 2011. The world remains an uncertain place with the risk of geopolitical and marcoeconomic shocks. We remain of the view that the scenario-based approach is the best way to plan for the future, we have prepared for worst-case outcomes, but based on what we see today, believe that a normal recovery scenario is playing out around the world. Our outlook reflects this normal recovery with global REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% at company-operated hotels in local currency and 100 basis points higher as reported in dollars. 150 to 200 basis points of margin improvement at owned hotels; 10% to 12% fee growth, a small increase at SVO, giving us a 2011 EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion and an EPS range of $1.55 to $1.65.
One point of REVPAR impacts EBITDA by approximately $15 million. One point of shift in Forex rates globally relative to the dollar impacts EBITDA by $4 million to $5 million. We expect to open 70 to 80 hotels globally in 2011, with more than half outside the U.S. Why our own margin improvements not higher? Three points to highlight here: margin pressure at our owned Latin American hotels due to the inflation devaluation, disconnect; second, at this stage of the cycle, revenue, which is what drives margins, lag REVPAR by almost 400 basis points in Q4, for example; and preopening costs associated with the W in London, which will reduce Q1-owned profits. We will remain very focused on cost, as we have been, to drive our own margins back to peak levels.
We are setting up capital spending up to two years, when we sharply reduced our capital to conserve cash. As you may expect, there is some catching up to do over the next couple of years. Several significant renovations will be undertaken in 2011, including the Grand in Florence, which we are converting into a St. Regis, the Alfonso XIII in Seville, the Westin Gaslamp, the Sheraton Kauai and other smaller projects. 
Over an extended time frame, our maintenance capital spend at owned hotels has averaged 7% to 8% of gross operating revenue, ranging from 5% when the cycle turns down to highs of 10% when the cycle turns up. We expect to be at the high end of the range for the next couple of years.
We're also stepping up spending on our major technology platforms to enhance functionality, to build a new platform in sales and to refresh hardware. In addition, as we normally do, we expect to deploy capital to build our pipeline and assist owners with key money, loans or equity when the returns warrant it. Despite the increase in capital spending, we expect to be modestly positive on cash flow before any asset sales. All the time, as we continue to sell hotels, the capital needs of the business will decline.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We have significant cash inflows in the fourth quarter, $245 million from the tax refund, $75 million from a legal settlement, cash from the sale of a joint venture hotel and, of course, strong operating performance. As a result, our net debt, excluding securitized receivables, was down to $2 billion. At the end of the year we had cash in excess of working capital needs of approximately $650 million. 
Our liquidity and leverage positions continue to get stronger. Our ratios are well below covenant levels, and we are moving rapidly towards achieving an investment-grade rating, hopefully before the end of 2011. With regard to asset sales, we continue to have a few assets on the market. As always, we will close deals where we get the right price, the right management-to-franchise contract and the right buyer, and we will announce deals if and when they close. As is our practice, our outlook does not assume any asset sales.
With that, let me turn this back to Jay."

So we continue to look for ways to pull up rates. I think that the REVPAR performance in Asia Pacific certainly points to our ability to do that. And likewise, as the markets in Africa and the Middle East rebound, which we expect that they will this year, particularly with rising commodity prices, that we should be able to push rate there as well. So I think by and large, rates should do well in emerging markets, and the specific phenomenon in Latin America, I think, was pretty well-outlined by Vasant already."

Briefly though, on the real estate market, as we see it, clearly, the market fell off in a dramatic way in 2008 and 2009.

They're from well-capitalized REITs who are looking for operating hotels, mostly in gateway cities that are well-financed and have no complication. The other buyers, such as they exist, and we would call these on a rifle-shot basis, our high net-worth buyers from different markets around the world. What you're not yet seeing is the depth in terms of the buyer base, meaning private equity funds, other investors and more high net-worth pockets of wealth in different places.

In terms of branding, there's a considerable amount of scale that goes to having a lodging brand. In other words, even as we add more hotels, while we need to add some local resources to support those brands specifically in markets, a lot of those costs are either fixed or they're part of the break-even fund pools that we have to invest in, in building brands on behalf of owners. And so, I don't think that the branding focus that we have is as much at odds with our P&L as it might seem. And what I wanted to emphasize, in my words, that we have been able to combine the focus on creativity and innovation with the discipline on the same side. And what you see in some creative and brand-driven organizations is a lack of balance in that way. And I think that right now, given where we are in terms of our corporate culture and the alignment of our senior teams around the world, we're in a very good place, I think, to take advantage of that scale. When it comes to CapEx, as you know, we currently, today, only own about 5% of our total base. And so the work that we've done has been largely focused on making sure that our owners are in a position that they're investing behind our brands in meaningful ways. And one of the things that we've talked about for some time is the fact that over 60% of our hotels today continue to be hotels that were either opened or significantly renovated in the last three years. So we have a very strong base of hotels. We have the highest percentage of hotels for the brand Sheraton that are on-brand and consistent with our standards than we've ever had. And I think that's born out by some of the other results and some of the other all-time highs that I was talking about during my discussion of branding"

In fact, as you look at 2010, there weren't huge rate increases. Most of the increase on the rate side of REVPAR growth in 2010, and Jay could split this out maybe for you later, would have been driven by more by mix than it would have been by absolute rate increase.

I'm not sure if you can get back in, Chris.  I'm going to assume your concerns here for a sec. First of all, I think it's interesting and important to remember that our incentive fees in countries like China don't have a preferred return basis, as Vasant was referring to earlier. So we would get to incentive fees early in the process. As you look at second-tier markets, it's also hard to make generalizations. There are some markets where, because we're the first five-star brand with a global connection in that market, those hotels do quite well and achieve great rates. There are other markets that are continuing to build where that will come in over time. But we continue to be very impressed with the resiliency of the Chinese market. Vasant mentioned to you the ability for demand to absorb occupancy post-Shanghai World Expo. The same thing was true after the Olympics in 2008. And so, the pace of development in China continues to be very strong. We continue to see opportunities to sign new projects. And as you could see, the REVPAR numbers for 2010 is certainly borne that out."

What I can tell you is, as we've mentioned in the call or in the script earlier, timeshare is starting to build. We believe that a timeshare purchase is largely a big-ticket discretionary item and, therefore, very much a function of an individual's confidence about their own situation. As the world improves, that certainly gets better. Delinquencies are going down, which is a trend we've seen in common with the improving balance sheets, at least of people with higher net worth across the U.S. So this is a business that is in a rebound. I wouldn't say it's a rapid rebound, but it's certainly one that's held its pace, which is good for us, because that continues to give us opportunities to monetize and reduce our exposure to vacation ownership and then take advantage of the fact that we have a strong team and strong brands that will enable us to be successful in doing that."

I'm happy to report that 2010 turned out to be a much better year than anyone predicted 12 months ago. And fortunately, the momentum has continued into 2011. Our results suggest that the lodging recovery has held steady in the face of an uncertain and volatile world. 
REVPAR growth sustained its 10% cliff, even as comparisons became more challenging throughout the year. We enjoyed a tailwind as Luxury brands and gateway cities powered ahead. Based on these results, we remain cautiously confident about the near term. Nevertheless, the rapidly unfolding events in Egypt remind us that the world is an uncertain place. Our thoughts today are with the people of Egypt, including our guests and associates.
As we look ahead, we remain bullish about our long-term prospects. Many refer to 2011 as the beginning of a two-speed recovery. According to that line of thinking, the developed world will see moderate economic growth. In North America and Europe, the hotel industry may nonetheless be on the verge of a multiyear surge in rates, thanks to the basic laws of supply and demand. This is worth some explanation. 
Unlike residential or office real estate, hotel supply is unusually tight at this early stage in the cycle. And with construction financing almost nonexistent, virtually no new hotels are being built. Meanwhile, demand is already strong and likely to get stronger. Corporate profitability is high, and businesses are out traveling in search of growth. Leisure demand is also building, as wealthier households are in good financial shape. So based on tight supply and growing demand, we believe REVPAR has a good chance of rising from well below its historic trend line, where it is today, to well above the trend line in the coming years. In fact, the next three to four years could see the strongest real growth in rates in North America that we've seen in decades.
The second part of the two-speed recovery is playing out in the emerging markets. We've talked at length about his huge secular growth trend in earlier calls. And today, we remain as bullish as ever in these markets as an extraordinary growth opportunity for Starwood. Rising wealth and growing demand for infrastructure, travel, and of course, hotels, has a long way to go up.
For the next few minutes, I'd like to cover three topics: First, a quick review of the fourth quarter; second, an in-depth look at our approach to global brands; and third, an update on our 2011 outlook.
Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Worldwide REVPAR was up over 10%, excluding foreign exchange, well ahead of our Q3 guidance. Growth was balanced around most of the world. Outside North America, REVPAR growth was 11% compared to 10% in North America. Likewise, owned hotels around the world grew at 11%. Margins increased 170 basis points after adjusting for nonrecurring items in 2009. 
We continue to work hard to drive our hotels past the levels of peak profitability that they had reached before the downturn. This is what we're calling our path-to-peak initiatives, and they're focused on taking market share while holding our costs down. Today, margins are still low. But as REVPAR builds, they'll continue moving in the right direction.
Our Vacation Ownership business also beat expectations. Rising consumer confidence is reflected in rising tour flows and close rates. Defaults in delinquencies are also improving. Remember, this business generated almost $0.5 billion in cash over the past two years. We expect it to throw out more cash in the coming years as well. Also, by this time next year, Bal Harbour will begin closing sales and returning cash.
So to conclude our discussion of the fourth quarter, we beat the high end of our EBITDA guidance by $34 million and EPS by $0.14. This is a great way to finish the year and put a foundation under what looks to be a prolonged lodging recovery.
So let's turn now to my second topic. I'd like to spend most of this call talking about our philosophy and approach to creating global lifestyle brands. Over the past several calls, we've talked at length about our global advantage. The fact that we parlayed our decades-long legacy in cities around the world into being the most global hotel company, with meaningful leads in China, India, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. With 70% of the world's economic growth expected to come from emerging markets, I have a strong conviction that this is an important advantage for Starwood.
Equally important is our focus on building brands that will capture the loyalty and increasingly brand-savvy global travelers. Brands and innovation are what makes Starwood special in the eyes of associates, our guests and our owners. Throughout its history, Starwood earned its stripes as a lodging industry renegade with game-changing innovations like W to Heavenly Bed and Starwood Preferred Guest. Over the past several years, we've worked hard to forge a more aligned and disciplined culture. But even though we've grown up, we can still shake it up. We're right where we want to be with the right balance of Yin and Yang, intuitive branding and disciplined execution.
Before I joined Starwood, I often traveled more than 100 days per year staying in my share of nice hotels. But as a brand guy, I would describe so many of those hotels as generic or even soulless. The only way you could tell one brand from another was to walk outside and look at the sign on the building. A four- or five-star hotel was a four- or five-star hotel. At Starwood, we believe branding should be much more than that. Here's an example: last week, I was in San Diego for the ALIS Conference. I left the US GRANT, our Luxury Collection hotel, walked through the Westin on my way to reception at the W. These are all wonderful hotels, but what jumps out is how each is distinct from the other. Each hotel represents its brand, whether it's the 100 years of heritage at the beautifully restored US GRANT, the party vibe at the W's rooftop beach bar with a soothing Zen-like lobby at The Westin Gaslamp, you can't escape that each of these hotels makes you feel different. That, in a nutshell, is what we mean by lifestyle branding.
We aren't segmenting by price or stars, and we foresee that the appeal of lifestyle brands will only increase in a world where travelers expect ever more from brands.
During our Investor Day, we discussed how the world is changing rapidly in a ways that favor a global brand-led company like Starwood. Globalization, and all that comes with it, including billions of new travelers and generations connected via social networks, translates into a truly global consumer base with unprecedented appetite for global brands.
I see this as the next stage in the long evolution of brands. When many of us baby boomers grew up in the 60s or 70s, brands were just a promise, a guarantee of safety, consistency and reliability. Ultimately, brands got so good at delivering consistency that consumers took it for granted and got bored. Brands today can't just be reliable or even just generically nice. They need to deliver personality, purpose and personalization. 
Consumers look to brands to add something to their lives and to define who they are. So we work hard to understand our brand loyalists and use these insights to define each brand; W for trendsetters, Sheraton for socials, Westin for balance-seekers, Le Méridien for creatives, Aloft for early adopters and so on. Distinct brands help us create emotional connections with our guests. Distinct brands also help us work with owners to align the right brand with the right project and to translate crisp brand positioning into more value for their assets.  Our business model boils down to owning the hearts and minds of our guests and creating value for our owners.
The well spring of Starwood's lifestyle brand strategy dates back to the launch of W in 1998. More recently, we've kept the flame of innovation burning brightly with the launch of Aloft and Element. Innovation is also bright in Sheraton. The Link@Sheraton, our lobby cybercafe for today's multi-tasking social traveler, is now a central feature of almost every Sheraton around the world. An essential part of lifestyle branding is translating brand personality into design. In fact, I believe that bringing our brands to life in 3D is one of Starwood's greatest innovations. 
Design is a sweet spot for us and something we take seriously. So despite the crisis and our focus on reducing costs, we made the investment to open the Starwood Design Center in Soho early last year. Our design team there and in our headquarters is comprised of leaders that have come to us from the world's most respected design-led brands including Armani, Nike and Starbucks.
But insights and personality, design and innovation are nothing without the human touch. Our brands depend on the efforts of our associates to delight our guests. So we start by selecting the right associates to represent our brands. We train them in the fundamentals of service delivered in the right brand voice, and we work hard to remind our associates that they're central to the success of the company, which, in fact, they are.
The sum total of all that we do creates branded experiences; cues, both overt and subtle, reinforce what each brand is about. The goal is to appeal to our guests' lifestyle, emotions and aspirations, and to compel them to come back again and again.
I can't talk about brand building, innovation or design without talking more about W. W came on the scene, or better said, created a scene in New York back in 1998. For the first time, a hotel combined the style of an independent boutique hotel with the substance of a branded business hotel. The first W was an immediate hit. With lines around the block, our biggest problem was replacing the floors for the wear and tear. The original idea of W was to transform tired, upscale properties in to cool Ws and charged upper upscale rates, but as we've grown around the world with W flagships in Hong Kong, Barcelona, Santiago and South Beach, the brand has been pulled up-market, with rates that put us squarely into Luxury territory, and the growth continues. We believe that W will get to 50 hotels in half the time that it took Four Seasons. This is what can happen when you combine a game-changing brand with a powerful global platform.
We haven't stopped there. The way W redefined Luxury spawned the belief that we could do the same to shake up this state's Select Service segment. The Aloft brand has done just that. Last month, TripAdvisor released survey results ranking two of our Aloft hotels in the top 10 trendiest hotels in the entire U.S. This list concluded some of the most buzzed-about new hotels. 
So it's one thing for a Manhattan hotspot to make a list like this, but a select-service hotel like Aloft in suburban Nashville, or an airport hotel like the Aloft in Portland, Oregon? But this is exactly what we set out to do when we created Aloft, to bring style and design at an affordable price to unexpected places, or as we like to say, style at a steal. Aloft was created by and for next-generation travelers, people who grew up with IKEA and iPods, expecting style and design wherever they go.
And here is something else that's groundbreaking about Aloft. We launched it globally from day one in Canada, China, India, the Emirates and Belgium. Globalization means that there's simultaneous demand for new brands. Segmentation by geography is as outdated as segmentation by price. This helps explain why Aloft has the fastest brand launch in hotel history. In a few months, we'll celebrate our 50th opening, not bad for a brand that opened its doors during the worst recession in our lifetimes.
As you may also know, we recently launched another first-of-its-kind brand: Element, the world's first LEED-certified hotel chain. We dubbed it our ""eco-chic brand."" It combines sustainability and style and already enjoys a cult-like following. Guest satisfaction scores for Element properties routinely reach levels normally associated with Luxury hotels. And despite its small footprint, REVPAR index is ramping quickly. With Gen Y leading the charge in how we think about sustainability, we're looking to migrate the learnings from Element, which we consider our green innovation lab, across our entire portfolio of brands. The brand may be small now, but its impact on the industry over the coming decade should be quite meaningful. In fact, Element helped Starwood earn a coveted spot as one of Newsweek's greenest companies.
Let's move on to the brand that helped inspire Element, Westin. Westin is proof-positive that a district brand personality in a mainstream upper upscale space can create a category killer. Building on the success of the iconic Heavenly Bed, Westin is all about wellness and renewal. The cachet of the Westin brand and its suite of restorative products like the Heavenly Bath, the Heavenly Spa and a SuperFoods menu allow it to own wellness among hotel brands. 
And wellness is by no means a passing fad. It's a $2 trillion global industry, driven by affluent consumers around the globe. In fact, Westin is enjoying global growth with more than 90% of its pipeline outside of the U.S. In the past two years, we've opened eight Westins in China and India alone, and Westin opened strong right out of the gate with markets like Tian Jin, China and Hyderabad, India, outperforming the comp set in the first year. Back in the U.S., with a footprint half the size of other upper upscale brands, there's plenty of room to grow in North America once developers start building.
Another brand case study is Le Méridien, with its European heritage and geographic reach, it complemented nicely our existing brands and footprint. When we bought the brand five years ago, it wasn't making money. We eliminated 85% of the G&A. And by plugging it into our system, we grew revenues by 20% in the first year alone. The net result was first-year EBITDA of nearly $50 million, not bad for a $300 million investment.  
This acquisition showed how we can breathe life into a languishing brand. We took a disparate group of hotels, many of which were at best generically nice, and invented a brand for the creative class, a group not served by any global hotel brand. The creative class includes the growing ranks of architects, web designers and journalists and is estimated to number nearly in the tens of millions in the U.S. alone. Le Méridien brought art, music and culture and a European sensibility into the guest experience. We selectively added high-quality hotels to the portfolio and removed 30 properties that weren't up to the brand standards. Today, worldwide REVPAR index is at record highs and catching the interest of developers.
So now I'd like to turn to the Sheraton brand, our biggest brand and our biggest story. From my career in branded businesses, I can tell you that it takes discipline and determination to bring today's sense of personality to a brand that grew up in the era of reliability, but we held the course over the past four years to recreate Sheraton. This entailed a $6 billion capital plan combined with de-flagging over 50 properties worldwide. 
Behind the discipline of our Sheraton efforts, there was a vision for creating a compelling lifestyle brand out of this global hospitality icon. Sheraton has the highest global awareness of any hotel brand and was the first global brand in most markets around the world. In short, Sheraton is the world's gathering place. This positioning appeals to today's social travelers and is a lifestyle brand transcends generations and geographies. Sheraton appeals to what we call ""downstairs people."" They love to travel but don't want to sit alone in their rooms. That insight led us to redesign our Sheraton lobbies with the Link, an inviting space that gives new purpose to our lobbies in much the same way the living room does at W. Most importantly, I'm thrilled to share with you the success of our Sheraton relaunch. The brand has seen record-high guest satisfaction, record-high meeting planners' likelihood to return, record-high associate engagement for three years running. Sheraton today also boasts record-high four-star ratings and a higher percentage of those ratings than either Hilton or Marriott.
In 2010, this translated into a 210-basis-point gain in REVPAR index in North America. This is a monumental move for an established brand base of 200 hotels. Finally, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sheraton is also the largest part of our global pipeline.
We've also revitalized Four Points by Sheraton, which today has seen record growth. The halo effect of Sheraton is certainly helping Four Points around the world. Four Points' personality is based on the insight that many travelers are looking for honest, uncomplicated comfort in the form of a great bed, cold beer, free water and Wi-Fi. In today's environment in North America, Four Points by Sheraton is a great conversion play for owners looking to get more value out of their assets. Oh, and by the way, uncomplicated doesn't mean we can't have a sense of humor. Over the past few years, our Chief Beer Officer made appearances across our system.
And finally, let's turn to our St. Regis and Luxury Collection brands. Between the two, we have 100 Luxury properties around the world, almost 140 when you add in W's portfolio. That gives us substantially more luxury hotels than any other hotel company. Like W, our Luxury brands benefit from their connection to the Starwood platform. Take for instance our loyalty program, SPG. Because of our high-end brands,  we're able to offer our members more luxury and more destinations around the globe. This is a big draw for our loyal members who account for nearly one in two guests at our hotels today.
And as we all know, wealth creation around the world is fueling new demand for Luxury. In fact, 70% of our pipeline for St. Regis and Luxury Collection is in emerging markets across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Looking back, this is exactly the opportunity that led us to create the St. Regis brand out of one single-owned hotel, the St. Regis New York. This legendary hotel defines luxury with its signature butler service. And whereas W may thumb its nose at tradition, St. Regis respects it, but is not afraid to reinterpret it. 
In just the past two years, St. Regis has doubled its footprint, and there's plenty of runway for future growth, as St. Regis Hotels debut in locations such as Lhasa in Tibet, Sanya in Southern China, Bahia Beach in Puerto Rico and Doha in Qatar. Places that, not long ago, you might not have associated as luxury destinations.
And finally, a few words about Luxury Collection. These high-end hotels offer indigenous experiences to sophisticated travelers exploring the world for something new. Luxury Collection offers owners of independent iconic properties the chance to plug into a global reservation system, a sales force and, of course, SPG. The brand's conversion flexibility, not to mention its unique appeal, is reflected by the recent openings at the Liberty Hotel in Boston, a transformed urban jail; the Omaha Resort in the Emirates, a luxury tented camp in the desert; and The Astor Hotel in Tianjin, the oldest luxury hotel in China.
So my goal over of the past few minutes has been to share with you some insight into our strategy behind our brands. To sum it up, Starwood's approach offers our guests and our owners a portfolio of brands, each with a personality built on consumer insight and brought to life by design, innovation and energized associates. A brand that is reliable and all things to all people is yesterday's news. A portfolio of distinct brands for distinct travel occasions is a great foundation for tomorrow's growth. Through this commitment to differentiated lifestyle brands, we are looking to lead in delivering great experiences in an earning-premium rates. 
So before I wrap up, let me move on to my third topic for today, a revised outlook for 2011. Business travel remains strong. Our Monday to Thursday volumes are driving occupancies in the 90% range in most major metro markets. Our customers are telling us that they'll continue to travel in 2011 in search of precious growth for their own businesses. 
Some months ago, I described this as a travel-intensive recovery. I still believe that. Group business has also carried over the momentum we built in 2010. As a reminder, 2010 Group business at the beginning of last year was pacing down 20%, but improved dramatically through 2010. Group pays for 2011 also improved sequentially through 2010. So as a result, we're beginning 2011 with pace of double digits significantly ahead of last year's starting point. 
As expected for some time, booking windows are now slowly starting to lengthen. Nonetheless, strong bookings and improving sales will translate into revenues that are quickly rebounding towards 2007 levels. Who would have taken that bet a year ago? And get this, December crushed the all-time record for monthly group production. The real story in 2011 will be about rising rates. Corporate rate negotiations are being finalized, and they're still on track to increase in high-single digits. 
The mix of room categories and clients should also support our ADR growth. Business travelers power 75% of our revenues, but leisure travel is also an important part of our business, especially at resorts and tourist destinations. We've seen the leisure demand increase as consumer confidence has improved and, we take heart from the fact that affluent travelers with finances today are quite robust compared to a couple of years ago. As with business travel, this affords us the opportunity to improve mix by, for example, phasing out some cut-rate Internet channels such as opaque [ph].
So before I hand off to Vasant, I'd like to share a few more thoughts on 2011. Overall, I'm encouraged by our REVPAR trajectory in what appears to be the start of a multiyear recovery. For all the reasons we've been talking about, we remain bullish about our business over the long term. At the same time, we see a global economy that can be volatile and unpredictable. If current trends continue, we could expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011. With rate increases for group and corporate accounts and a better mix of business, REVPAR in 2011 will be increasingly driven by rate. This is in contrast to 2010, where REVPAR growth was driven by rising occupancy. Factoring all this in, we would deliver a baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion. 
With more on that, let me turn over the call to Vasant."
341584,117936130,99037,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. As you have seen, business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the U.S. and internationall",1923,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. As you have seen, business momentum remains strong globally through the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the U.S. and internationally. Healthy fee growth, a strong finish at SVO and good cost control resulted in EBITDA and EPS well ahead of our expectations. This sets the stage well for what we think will be the second year of a normal, cyclical recovery in 2011. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on business conditions around the world, our 2011 outlook, our balance sheet and Bal Harbour. 
Despite tougher comparisons from 2009, North America was up double digits in the fourth quarter. We saw rate picking up and group business coming back strong. In the first half, the East, New York, Boston and other cities led the recovery. But as the year progressed, business picked up in the West, San Francisco, Seattle and across the country. At this time last year, we had indicated that late-breaking corporate transient business would make or break 2010. And as you know, corporate transient business came back strong, while make-or-break 2011 is red and the trends we saw in Q4 are promising. In 2010, occupancy accounted for almost all the REVPAR growth in North America. We expect rate to drive 50% or more of REVPAR growth in 2011.
With 75% of corporate rate negotiations complete, we expect to finish with rates up in the high single digits. We will also continue to aggressively manage mix to improve rate realization through the year. Group business is also picking up, as we would expect, at this stage in the cycle. Group base is up in the double digits. Q4 new production was up over 50% for all future years and up almost 50% for 2011. The lead pipeline remains strong, with lead volume up almost 30% and size of leads up 20%. With some volatility due to the weather, January momentum is good, with REVPAR tracking in the double digits across the U.S. Low supply growth and the U.S. economy showing increasing signs of recovery point to 2011 shaping up as a second year of a normal cyclical recovery.
Outside the U.S., Asia continues to power ahead. Q4 REVPAR growth was up in the high teens across Asia, led by China and China-related economies. We expect sums will be expected some slowdown after the World Expo in Shanghai, but did not see any as China grew 24%. China-related economies like Australia are also booming. Our hotels in Australia are hitting all-time highs in profitability, even as the Aussie dollar is at parity with the U.S. dollar. Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, also a double-digit growth. Thailand is recovering from the political turmoil, and Japan remains the only soft spot. 
Fee growth in Asia in 2010 approached 40%, driven by 26% REVPAR growth and the rapid expansion of our hotel base in the region. Starwood-branded rooms operating in Asia are up over 80% since 2005. And as you know, we have a strong pipeline of future openings.
Moving to Europe, trends are not dissimilar to the U.S. in Northern and Central Europe. Local currency REVPARs were up double digits with some volatility due to the unusual snow in December. Group base is also picking up and booking windows are returning to normal. Despite the concerns about Spain, our business was fine in Q4 with outstanding performance all year by our new iconic W Barcelona, which we lease. The W is well on its way to becoming the leading hotel in Barcelona.
We are excited about the next major W opening in Europe, the W Leicester Square in London this February, which is also a leased hotel. Pre-opening costs associated with this opening will depress reported on-lease hotel earnings in Q1. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter in Europe, and the trend for the year will likely become more evident, as we get into the second quarter. Like the U.S. with low supply growth and rate improvement, we expect 2011 to shape up as the second year of a normal cyclical recovery. As we have for the past few years, we have hedged about 50% of our euro exposure.
The Middle East and Africa is the only region that has not yet recovered fully. REVPAR was down slightly in Q4. Africa grew but the Middle East was down, mostly due to the Gulf where we have a large presence. But we did see a recovery in the Gulf in November, December, and this appears to be continuing into January. Occupancies in the Gulf are high, but rates have lagged so far. 
The political turmoil in North Africa, especially Egypt, is of course hurting our business. We have 16 hotels across North Africa and approximately $10 million to $12 million in fees in 2010. We expect that our fees will be hit in North Africa, but we may pick up some business if it shifts to the Gulf, for example. It is too early to tell how we will be impacted, but this is clearly a risk that needs to be closely monitored.
In Latin America, the South continues to boom. Brazil was up 18%; Argentina, up 15%; and Chile, up 25% as it recovers from last year's earthquake. In Mexico, Mexico City was strong. The results continue to lag due to crime concerns but is starting to see some improvement. The issue persisting in Latin America is the local inflation devaluation gap, which is hurting margins at our hotels. We have large owned hotels in the region, and this issue will depress our global owned hotel margins in 2011, as it has in 2010. Local costs are going up: 25%, for example, in Argentina, due to high local inflation. But the currency into the weakening relative dollar has been roughly flat over the last three months.
Our hotel rates, which are typically in dollars, are not going up as fast as our costs. As a result of this disconnect, and despite significant efforts by our local teams to hold costs in line, our margins are under pressure. We expect this issue to persist as long as these currencies are not devalued relative to the dollar commensurate with the local inflation trend. 
Our Vacation Ownership business is stable. Tours, closed rates and pricing have tracked in line with expectations. Delinquency default rates continue to improve. We remain focused on cash generation in this business, with selective inventory adds. We expect to generate over $150 million in cash flow in 2011 on top of the $500 million we generated in '09 and '10.
At Bal Harbour, 2011 is a key year. The project is nearing completion. We're targeting a temporary certificate of occupancy in Q4 2011 and expect to start closing late in the fourth quarter. Capital required is $150 million in 2011. We will have expenses through the first three quarters for Bal Harbour, as we have had in prior years. Assuming we start closings in Q4, there may well be some revenue and income recognition in Q4, which is not included in our outlook. We will provide updates as the year progresses. There will also be some cash flow from closings that offset some of our capital spend on Bal Harbour this year.
We have contracts on more than half the condo inventory and hope to be 65% to 70% sold by the time we start closings. 2012 will be the big year for revenue and income recognition, and cash flow from Bal Harbour based on current plans. 
All this brings us to our overall outlook for 2011. The world remains an uncertain place with the risk of geopolitical and marcoeconomic shocks. We remain of the view that the scenario-based approach is the best way to plan for the future, we have prepared for worst-case outcomes, but based on what we see today, believe that a normal recovery scenario is playing out around the world. Our outlook reflects this normal recovery with global REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% at company-operated hotels in local currency and 100 basis points higher as reported in dollars. 150 to 200 basis points of margin improvement at owned hotels; 10% to 12% fee growth, a small increase at SVO, giving us a 2011 EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion and an EPS range of $1.55 to $1.65.
One point of REVPAR impacts EBITDA by approximately $15 million. One point of shift in Forex rates globally relative to the dollar impacts EBITDA by $4 million to $5 million. We expect to open 70 to 80 hotels globally in 2011, with more than half outside the U.S. Why our own margin improvements not higher? Three points to highlight here: margin pressure at our owned Latin American hotels due to the inflation devaluation, disconnect; second, at this stage of the cycle, revenue, which is what drives margins, lag REVPAR by almost 400 basis points in Q4, for example; and preopening costs associated with the W in London, which will reduce Q1-owned profits. We will remain very focused on cost, as we have been, to drive our own margins back to peak levels.
We are setting up capital spending up to two years, when we sharply reduced our capital to conserve cash. As you may expect, there is some catching up to do over the next couple of years. Several significant renovations will be undertaken in 2011, including the Grand in Florence, which we are converting into a St. Regis, the Alfonso XIII in Seville, the Westin Gaslamp, the Sheraton Kauai and other smaller projects. 
Over an extended time frame, our maintenance capital spend at owned hotels has averaged 7% to 8% of gross operating revenue, ranging from 5% when the cycle turns down to highs of 10% when the cycle turns up. We expect to be at the high end of the range for the next couple of years.
We're also stepping up spending on our major technology platforms to enhance functionality, to build a new platform in sales and to refresh hardware. In addition, as we normally do, we expect to deploy capital to build our pipeline and assist owners with key money, loans or equity when the returns warrant it. Despite the increase in capital spending, we expect to be modestly positive on cash flow before any asset sales. All the time, as we continue to sell hotels, the capital needs of the business will decline.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We have significant cash inflows in the fourth quarter, $245 million from the tax refund, $75 million from a legal settlement, cash from the sale of a joint venture hotel and, of course, strong operating performance. As a result, our net debt, excluding securitized receivables, was down to $2 billion. At the end of the year we had cash in excess of working capital needs of approximately $650 million. 
Our liquidity and leverage positions continue to get stronger. Our ratios are well below covenant levels, and we are moving rapidly towards achieving an investment-grade rating, hopefully before the end of 2011. With regard to asset sales, we continue to have a few assets on the market. As always, we will close deals where we get the right price, the right management-to-franchise contract and the right buyer, and we will announce deals if and when they close. As is our practice, our outlook does not assume any asset sales.
With that, let me turn this back to Jay."

But as the new business is coming in, the mix is changing more to rate. So clearly, that's moving in the right direction, and we are getting the ability to move rates up in the Group business. As it relates to pricing with inflation, we definitely have some challenges in Latin America, because there's been a history there of setting rates in dollars. And that definitely is not making it easy to move rates up, given the local competitive situation and the fairly significant difference between inflation and devaluation.

So we continue to look for ways to pull up rates. I think that the REVPAR performance in Asia Pacific certainly points to our ability to do that. And likewise, as the markets in Africa and the Middle East rebound, which we expect that they will this year, particularly with rising commodity prices, that we should be able to push rate there as well. So I think by and large, rates should do well in emerging markets, and the specific phenomenon in Latin America, I think, was pretty well-outlined by Vasant already."

In terms of branding, there's a considerable amount of scale that goes to having a lodging brand. In other words, even as we add more hotels, while we need to add some local resources to support those brands specifically in markets, a lot of those costs are either fixed or they're part of the break-even fund pools that we have to invest in, in building brands on behalf of owners. And so, I don't think that the branding focus that we have is as much at odds with our P&L as it might seem. And what I wanted to emphasize, in my words, that we have been able to combine the focus on creativity and innovation with the discipline on the same side. And what you see in some creative and brand-driven organizations is a lack of balance in that way. And I think that right now, given where we are in terms of our corporate culture and the alignment of our senior teams around the world, we're in a very good place, I think, to take advantage of that scale. When it comes to CapEx, as you know, we currently, today, only own about 5% of our total base. And so the work that we've done has been largely focused on making sure that our owners are in a position that they're investing behind our brands in meaningful ways. And one of the things that we've talked about for some time is the fact that over 60% of our hotels today continue to be hotels that were either opened or significantly renovated in the last three years. So we have a very strong base of hotels. We have the highest percentage of hotels for the brand Sheraton that are on-brand and consistent with our standards than we've ever had. And I think that's born out by some of the other results and some of the other all-time highs that I was talking about during my discussion of branding"

But the point is, as you look at things like whether you have airline crews in W hotels, what kind of business we take in general from different channels, that overall mix, I think, does add up to being a meaningful amount. In fact, as you look at 2010, there weren't huge rate increases. Most of the increase on the rate side of REVPAR growth in 2010, and Jay could split this out maybe for you later, would have been driven by more by mix than it would have been by absolute rate increase. So again, that comment was more driven to point to an example of how mix can change rate rather than itself being the key driver of that."

So we would get to incentive fees early in the process. As you look at second-tier markets, it's also hard to make generalizations. There are some markets where, because we're the first five-star brand with a global connection in that market, those hotels do quite well and achieve great rates. There are other markets that are continuing to build where that will come in over time. But we continue to be very impressed with the resiliency of the Chinese market. Vasant mentioned to you the ability for demand to absorb occupancy post-Shanghai World Expo. The same thing was true after the Olympics in 2008. And so, the pace of development in China continues to be very strong. We continue to see opportunities to sign new projects. And as you could see, the REVPAR numbers for 2010 is certainly borne that out."

What I can tell you is, as we've mentioned in the call or in the script earlier, timeshare is starting to build. We believe that a timeshare purchase is largely a big-ticket discretionary item and, therefore, very much a function of an individual's confidence about their own situation. As the world improves, that certainly gets better. Delinquencies are going down, which is a trend we've seen in common with the improving balance sheets, at least of people with higher net worth across the U.S. So this is a business that is in a rebound. I wouldn't say it's a rapid rebound, but it's certainly one that's held its pace, which is good for us, because that continues to give us opportunities to monetize and reduce our exposure to vacation ownership and then take advantage of the fact that we have a strong team and strong brands that will enable us to be successful in doing that."

Thanks all for joining us on our call today. Let me begin with the observation that once again, so much has happened since our last call. Like many of you, we've been gripped by the catastrophe in Japan and the political",3126,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning. Thanks all for joining us on our call today. Let me begin with the observation that once again, so much has happened since our last call. Like many of you, we've been gripped by the catastrophe in Japan and the political turmoil in the Arab world, not to mention the drug violence in Mexico, Portugal's fiscal woes, the near shutdown of the U.S. government and the rising cost of commodities. 
Despite all of this, our view of the global economy and the lodging recovery remain unchanged. We maintain that the recovery continues on in an uncertain and volatile world. For several quarters now, we have been and remain cautiously confident about a bumpy recovery in the near term and bullish about Starwood's prospects in the long term. 
With operations in 100 countries, our associates are never far from world events. Their eyewitness accounts and their great courage to do whatever it takes to protect the safety and comfort of our guests make for some of the most remarkable and inspiring stories I've heard in my career. Our closer view around the world, along with our dialogue with global accounts, also tell us that right now, world events have not derailed the forces driving this recovery. The rise of emerging markets, the financial health of global companies and the demand for travel in an ever more digitally connected world. 
So at a macro level, we're seeing activity consistent with global GDP growth at 4%, with occupancies at our own properties that are now greater than 2007 levels. So despite all of the turbulence, this is a great time to be a global branded company in the hotel business. With this world view in mind, we've kept our resolve to sustain this performance, overcome obstacles and position Starwood to thrive. Our resolve extends beyond our conservative approach to our balance sheet and our relentless focus on costs. We continue to be on offense, with numerous efforts to grow faster than the marketplace. 
Our results in the first quarter are a direct result of this result. In that context, I'd like to cover 3 topics for today: first, a quick recap of the first quarter; second, a snapshot of recent events and what they mean for the rest of 2011; and third, a look at how we create value for owners and how this, in turn, creates value for shareholders. 
So let's start with first quarter results. Our worldwide REVPAR grew by over 9%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Notably, for the first time in a recovery, rate contributed as much as occupancy to REVPAR growth. As many of you know well, this follows the pattern of a typical lodging recovery. As hotels fill, rates rise. 
Outside of North America, Japan and Mexico -- excuse me, outside of North Africa, Japan and Mexico, REVPAR around the world grew by more than 10%. North American Owned Hotel margins increased by 150 basis points, and worldwide margins would've increased by over 200 basis points were it not for the inflationary pressures in Latin America, which Vasant will describe later. 
Overall, our first quarter was a great start to the year, and it underscores our ability to grow faster than the market. No matter how you measure it, our brands are in terrific shape. For example, Smith Travel Research estimates that our REVPAR index in North America is up over 300 basis points, with each of our 9 brands showing REVPAR index improvement. This marks the fifth quarter in a row that across our system, both REVPAR growth and REVPAR index had outpaced the market. 
Our largest brand, Sheraton, sustained its best ever performance in guest satisfaction, meeting planner satisfaction, REVPAR index, pipeline and not to mention, the 4- and 5-star ratings. Sheraton REVPAR was up over 9% in Q1 in North America, significantly faster than 4% for Marriott. All of this is to drive home the point that the significant investment we and our owners have made in Sheraton continues to pay off. The momentum we enjoy by Sheraton and our entire portfolio of brands, despite a turbulent world and softness in a few U.S. metro markets, shows that we're holding to our baseline 2011 for both REVPAR and EBITDA.
In addition, our Vacation Ownership business also performed well in the quarter. Both tour flows and close rates increased by 4%, while pricing was off slightly as a result of product mix. As another sign of the recovery, we're encouraged to report that annualized defaults and delinquencies have now dropped to levels last seen in late 2007. Our Vacation Ownership business continues to be a strong source of cash, and with smaller investments, we can sustain our sales and cash generation at current levels through 2013.
In summary, we beat the high end of our EBITDA expectations by $3 million and EPS by $0.04 despite the events in Japan and North Africa, which brings me to my second topic of today: a quick look at our business trends. The key takeaway is that we see nothing right now that suggests we should change our outlook. 
Let's start with our group business. After record-breaking group production last December, sales leveled off somewhat in the first 2 months of 2011, but in March, business accelerated, and we ended the quarter with 6% more business booked than in the prior year. As proof of growing business confidence, our corporate group business jumped 35% in the quarter. This provided a nice tailwind for rates. And as a result, our group pays for the total amount of group business we have in the books for 2011 is on track to be up double digits. We're also on track for our group pays in 2012 to be ahead of 2011. In fact, we now have more business on the books for 2012 than we did in early 2006 or 2007. 
And group business is evolving in a way that favors our global footprint and high end positioning. Here are a couple of examples of what I mean. Sales for North American group business booked from outside North America increased 20% in the quarter. And North American business booked by global accounts grew by 60%. These trends are only likely to continue.
Overall, our top accounts are growing rapidly global firms and professional services, financial services and technology. And as these industries continue to grow, we stand to benefit disproportionately. Already, we know that we get much more than our fair share of business from firms like MacKenzie, Deloitte and PwC. In fact, today, 1 in 4 Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum members is a consultant. 
Our data suggests that SPG members overall have higher incomes than any other hotel loyalty program. Moreover, our brands also resonate with Gen Y and tech-savvy travelers that work in high-growth idea industries. This explains our jump of about 50% in a business with the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in just the past 3 years. 
Turning now to our corporate negotiated rates. We're happy to report that we achieved the high-single-digit increases that we were seeking. Coupled with rising occupancies, transient revenue increased 15% in Q1. And from what we can see today, this trend is continuing in Q2, with room nights booked one month out on track to increase double digits and with ADRs of over 6%. We're now 2 years into our efforts to improve our revenue management systems, which are enabling us to push up rates and switch out lower price business while increasing occupancy and market share.  And midweek occupancy is now approaching 2007 levels in gateway cities such as New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong as business travel, particularly at the high end, remains robust. 
We often get asked whether we're concerned about rising oil prices. And no doubt, price-sensitive leisure travelers and some lower rated business will be affected. But high end travel is less elastic, and it's worth noting that lodging demand and oil prices show little correlation over time. Upon reflection, this actually makes sense. Consider these 2 scenarios: Scenario 1: Oil prices rise with higher demand for oil. This usually means more economic activity and more travel. Scenario 2: Oil prices rise as a result of tight supply. The net effect is less travel. 
Today, we're seeing a mix of both scenarios. Some of the rise in oil prices is a function of uncertain supply tied to political unrest. At the same time, economic growth is driving demand for all commodities including oil. 
A more straightforward barometer for us is simply to ask our customers. And they tell us that they plan to travel more and spend more in 2011 than in 2010.  And along the same line, the Global Business Travel Association raised their projected growth in business travel spending from 5% to 7% in 2011. 
Another question we get asked a lot lately is whether we're concerned about the recent softness in New York, a marker we often cite as a leading indicator. And here's why we're not as worried about this as you might think. It comes down to 3 things: weather, group demand and supply. I won't dwell on the New York winter but we'll touch briefly on group demand. Group business came back in New York early in this recovery as planners were reluctant to book events at high-end resorts. As the appetite for resort returns, some group business has cycled away from New York. Today, the biggest downdraft on New York is a 7% increase in supply over the past year. 
New York, by the way, stands alone in the developed world in this respect, and absorbing the new supply will take some time. Already for Q2, we're starting to see occupancies build.  And for our part, we've accounted for one of every 4 new rooms in New York. This includes 6 new build hotels. 2 Alofts in Harlem and Brooklyn, the Element Times Square, 2 Sheratons in Brooklyn and Tribeca and the W Downtown.  And after that, 2 recent conversions, the Homesley to a Weston and the Chatwell to Luxury Collection. So for all of our growth around the globe, it's New York that becomes the first market where all 9 brands will be present. So to conclude this topic, I hope this discussion gives you clarity about why we remained encouraged by the pace of our business. 
I'd like to turn now to my third and final topic for today, a glimpse at some of the ways we create value for our owners. For those of you who've watched Starwood over the years, you know that we're transforming from being a hotel investment company to a global operator of lifestyle hospitality brands. Today, 95% of the hotel as a carrier brand are owned by others. This means that we're more committed to the fee business and better aligned with our owners than ever before. If we create great returns for our owners, they're more likely to invest in our brands and sign up for additional hotels. So for the next few minutes, I'd like to share with you some examples of what we shared with our North American owners at our recent meeting about how we're working to create value. These fall into 3 areas: first, our portfolio of brands; second, our operational capabilities; and third, our ability to bring high-end guests. 
So let me start by discussing some of our brands. What sets us apart is our portfolio of compelling brands, whose purpose is simply to create emotional connections and return business with travelers. Each brand is distinctive so there's no brand border. This means we can add hotels of different brands in the same market, and they complement rather than compete with each other. All this enables us to drive even more growth. We're already the largest luxury hotel company in the world. Luxury Collection alone is about the same size as Four Seasons. St. Regis has doubled its footprint in the past 2 years, and we'll open 10 new Luxury properties around the world this year. And no other hotel company has a brand like W.  
And similar to W, Weston is becoming a global brand and continues to be a category killer in the U.S. And we're already seeing that Aloft and Element can do to the specialty select business, where W has done the luxury, generate outsized returns by using a distinct point of view and positioning to bring attitude and design flair to an undifferentiated market. 
Aloft is not even 3 years old today but is driving REVPAR results nearly equal to its largest competitor. And I've already talked about Sheraton's momentum today, which is helping drive Four Points to new heights. Our owners are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio as REVPAR index has now risen for 5 straight quarters.
Operational excellence is another way we can create value for owners. We have experienced teams in the field with proven abilities to driving top and bottom line in our properties. We're also investing heavily in the systems that will make their hotels more profitable. As we reduce our portfolio of owned hotels, we're increasingly redirecting our capital and attention to revenue management, sales capabilities and cost controls. By working closely with our owners on these investments, we ensure the best possible returns for them. 
Take revenue management, where we've already invested more than $40 million without increasing fees to our owners. We have implemented the new systems and training, resulting in a sustained 3.5% increase in REVPAR, and we believe we can double that improvement over time. Similarly, in markets where we've reoriented our sales resources, our hotels are now leading their competitive sets, and this is before the sales systems improvements come on stream. 
We also continue to invest in our cost containment tools, which have contributed to industry-leading margin improvements over the past year. Importantly, these cost cuts have not pulled us away from record high guest satisfaction even as occupancies and rate have risen. 
These efforts are all part of our path-to-peak initiatives, and we're getting all of our tails and systems up to and beyond their precrisis peak profits. This is a multiyear focus for Starwood, and we'll aggressively pull all levers to get there.  And remember, as rate increasingly drives REVPAR growth, we believe the best margin improvement is yet to come as we keep our cost per occupied room in check. 
The third way we create value for others is by putting affluent heads in Heavenly Beds. We make this possible through our central delivery systems and our best-in-class loyalty program, SPG. We have 11 websites, 1 for each of our 9 brands plus www.starwoodhotels.com and www.spg.com. In total, they drive roughly 20% of our bookings today. Some people are surprised to learn that our own websites drive over 3x as much occupancy for us as all other third-party sites combined. Smart travelers know that they can only get best rate guarantees, all of our inventory and SPG points by booking with us, which mean our websites, our call centers, our global distribution centers, 50% of our bookings come through central delivery. 
And speaking of SPG, we see this as the glue that binds all of our brands. We led the industry with no blackout dates and providing redemption across our 3 luxury brands.  And as our footprint of hotels has grown, SPG has grown even faster. In 2005, SPG members accounted for 34% of our stakes. Now SPG is at 47% or almost one in every 2 guests at our hotels. And SPG guests spend more than the average guest. 
SPG is also fueling our newest brands, driving 60% of occupancy for Aloft and Element. And with our global footprint, we now have more active members outside the U.S. than inside. So SPG drives occupancies around the world, and it will only increasingly drive business to each of our owners as more travelers travel across regions. 
In summary, these are some of the ways we create value for owners. Virtually everything we work on is with an eye towards creating value for them through great experiences and brand connections with guests.  And owners are noticing. We signed 10 conversions in the U.S. in Q1, and our owner engagement have never been better, with 96% extremely satisfied with what we presented at our conference and 90% proud of being affiliated with Starwood. 
So to wrap up my prepared remarks, let me leave you with 4 thoughts. First, Starwood is structurally different from other lodging companies. We're focused on the 4- and 5-star category and have the largest and fastest growing presence in international markets. For example, we opened roughly the same number of rooms in 2009 as 2010, but the percentage of non-U.S. rooms increased from 43% to almost 70%, and that will be even higher in 2011. We're also extending our lead. In the past couple of years, for example, we opened more rooms in India than our 3 biggest competitors combined. We already derive 60% of our fees outside of the U.S. 
Second, we can sustain growth faster than the market. Structurally, we benefit from our positioning, customer base and global growth. At the same time, we're investing in capabilities that show promise of multiyear improvements. 
Third, our focus on creating value for owners has helped us create a high-quality pipeline. Over 80% of our 85,000 rooms will be 4- and 5-star properties outside of the U.S. These are high-value contracts, thanks to high ADRs and incentive fees. So our growth should be faster on a relative basis and result in strong absolute fee growth. And this is before the implied fees, we also expect to capture from selling our own hotels and maintain the management contracts on it. 
As you saw in the quarter, we sold The Westin Gaslamp in April, and we're closely watching the bid ask spread on other assets as we go to market.  
And finally, let me remind you that we remain cautiously confident about the lodging recovery. The business environment today looks turbulent but robust, with strong group and transient pace and rates becoming a larger contributor to our REVPAR growth. As such, we expect worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011, in line with our trajectory of our baseline. So despite the headwinds in North Africa, Japan and Latin America, softness in big metro markets like New York and D.C., not to mention an asset sale, we're maintaining our prior baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion and increasing our EPS in range from $1.60 to $1.70. Now let me turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,129091802,119160,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We were able to exceed our expectations in the first quarter despite the significant unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and the deteriorating crime situation in Mexico. In our business, as you all kno",2008,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We were able to exceed our expectations in the first quarter despite the significant unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and the deteriorating crime situation in Mexico. In our business, as you all know, we're impacted by wars, terrorism, political instability, national disasters, pandemics, financial crises and recessions. We expect 1 or 2 will be enter each year somewhere and have learned to roll with the punches, so to speak. 
However, the events of the first quarter, the tragic earthquake, tsunami in Japan and the turmoil all across North Africa, are more significant than the earthquake in Chile, the H1N1 scare in Latin America, the rice in Thailand and the various terrorist incidents that we've had in the last few years. Nevertheless, a strong cyclical recovery around the globe allowed us to offset a $5 million-plus negative impact from Japan and North Africa throughout performance elsewhere in our business. As is indicated, this global cyclical rebound continues, and it is our intent to offset negatives as best we can with positives elsewhere. As such, we're keeping our profit outlook for the year unchanged. In the next few minutes, I'll quickly review our business conditions around the world and provide some color on our outlook for 2011.
Japan had a significant impact on our business. We have 15 hotels operating in Japan. We expect it to earn $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA this year, with about half of this coming from the 802 room Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay outside Tokyo Disneyland, of which we own 25%. 
We also just opened a new lease, St. Regis in Osaka, in October 2010, which is expected to break-even in 2011. All the other hotels are managed or franchised. As may be expected, travel into Japan is down significantly, resulting in large occupancy and rate shortfalls at hotels. With a nation in mourning events and spending on events like weddings, is down very sharply, and unlikely to cover soon, hurting food and beverage, which is over 50% of Japanese hotel revenues. 
The Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay is particularly hard hit, as Tokyo Disneyland was shut and while it is now open, we do not expect a recovery to normal levels anytime soon. The St. Regis in Osaka will likely lose $7 million to $8 million this year instead of breaking even. As such, we expect to make $5 million to $10 million in Japan, a $20 million to $25 million EBITDA shortfall for the year. Given the financial condition of the Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay, we have written off our equity investment. All-in-all, Japan will be a headwind this year.
We are offsetting some of this shortfall from strength elsewhere in Asia. Despite Japan, local currency REVPAR across Asia grew by 11%, led by China and China-related economies: Hong Kong, Taiwan in Australia. REVPAR in China was up 22%, with rates up 11% and occupancy up 5 points. We expect to have almost 100 hotels opened in China by the end of 2011, making China easily our second largest country after the U.S. 
Booking pace remains strong in China though comparisons will be affected by the lapping of the World Expo in Shanghai in Q2 and Q3 last year. 
India's growing well, too. We've had a very successful launch of the Westin brand in India, with 5 Wests open in the major cities over the past 18 months. The Westin Mumbai was recently voted the best new luxury hotel in India. We have 32 operating hotels with but 4 more to open this year, including a spectacular new Sheraton in Bangalore. Our goal is to get to 100 opened and pipeline hotels in India by 2015. 
As a reminder, our operating hotels in Asia are in the 4- and 5-star and above category, and as such, each hotel earns significantly more in fees than smaller, lower price point brands. In summary, Asia x Japan continues to be a major engine of our growth. 
Moving on to the Middle East and Africa. The political turmoil in North Africa continues, with no clear end in sight. Our one hotel in Libya is shut and travel into most North African countries is down sharply. We have 24 hotels across the affected countries, which includes all of North Africa, plus Bahrain, Syria and Jordan. We expect it to earn at least $15 million in fees this year. We now estimate our fees will be cut in half, with no incentive fees earned and base fees down sharply. This assumes that the instability will not spread to Saudi and the Gulf, where we have the bulk of our business. 
In the first quarter, business conditions were stable in Saudi and the Gulf. We are seeing strong growth in Sub-Saharan Africa and expect it will continue with line with the community boom. As in Asia, our EMEA division is working on offsetting shortfalls from the Middle East in other parts of the region. In particular, our iconic W Barcelona, which opened in late 2009, has been a runaway success and continues to significantly exceed our expectations despite the Malaysian spend.  And our new lease, W Lexa Square, which opened in February, is off to a very strong start. 
Also helping our robust business conditions in Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. The first quarter is a small quarter in Continental Europe, but booking pace suggests strength as we enter Q2. In Latin America, Mexico is our largest business, with 25 operating hotels, 3 owned resorts and Cancun, cowboy and by Alta. And then owned hotel each in Mexico City and Monterrey. 
The drug war is in the negative press in the U.S. have decimated leisure travel into our Mexican resorts. In the peak season, occupancies are in the 50s and rate was down the sharply as we had to replace U.S. guest with lower rate domestic business. While conditions are tough currently, we're long term bullish in Mexico, and our business continues to grow with a new St. Regis, a new Weston and a second W in Mexico City and a great new St. Regis Resort in Punta Mita, with more hotels in the pipeline. 
Also in Latin America, the gap between high local inflation while currencies appreciate related to the dollar is severely hurting our own hotel margins, particularly in Argentina. This inflation devaluation gap causes our own margins to decline as much as 400 basis the in Q1. We're working on improving our dollar rate generalization with our global accounts and by remixing the business.
In North America, a robust cyclical recovery in lodging is clearly on the way. REVPAR grew over 11% despite Starwood being over at New Yorkers, which only grew 8%. Frits review some of what we're seeing as it relates to transient and group base. As we said earlier this year, rate is a crucial make or break factor, and so far, we're on the right track. North American rate was up 5% in Q1. Our corporate negotiations have ended well. Group rate is picking up, and transient rate continues to improve as occupancies rise and we remix business. We're outperforming the competition as we gained 300 basis a share across all of our brands with outstanding performance by brand Sheraton. 
The situation in New York will improve as the year progresses and the market absorbs new supply. In Q2, we expect occupancies in the 90s at our New York hotels and REVPAR growth in the mid-teens. Based on current trends, we expect second quarter REVPAR growth to be in the same range as first quarter growth in North America despite tougher comparisons. 
Overall, our Owned Hotel portfolio performed well in Q1, with REVPAR up 12% and margins up over 200 basis points, x Latin America. Rate was up 4%. Cost control continues to be good, driving strong flow-throughs. Year-over-year comparisons are affected by opening costs of the new leased W in London, the St. Regis in Osaka, on renovation and one hotels sold last year. Our fees were up slightly at 15.7% despite the Japan, North Africa impact which reduced worldwide REVPAR by over 100 basis points and hurt global GOP margins by 50 be basis points. 
In Q1, worldwide REVPAR was 10% below the Q1 2008 peak, 9% lower on rate and 100 basis points lower on occupancy. 
Finally our Vacation Ownership business continues to be stable. Sales to existing owners have picked up and 2 of those are getting better. Default rates also continue to decline. As a result, HBO exceeded our expectations in Q1. 
Moving on to our outlook for the quarter and the year. In Q2, we expect REVPAR growth at Company Operated Hotels to be up 7% to 9% in local currencies globally, approximately 9% to 11% as reported in dollars. Seasonally up 10% to 12% thrust by 200 basis points due to Japan and North African issues. On hotel REVPAR globally, it's estimated to grow 8% to 10% in local currencies, 12% to 14% in dollars. All margins should be up 150 to 200 basis points, with North America at the high end of the range and international margins pressured once again by Latin America. 
Japan, North Africa and the sale of The Westin Gaslamp will reduce Q2 EBITDA by approximately $10 million. As such, we're projecting a Q2 EBITDA range of $245 million to $255 million and an EPS range of $0.42 to $0.46 based on a 24% tax rate. 
For the full year, we are maintaining our EBITDA outlook range of $975 million to $1 billion. The global company operated REVPAR forecast remains unchanged at 7% to 9% in local currencies, 8% to 10% in dollars. Fee growth is also unchanged at 10% to 12%, of course, 200 basis points by Japan and North Africa. Old REVPAR expectation are up 100 basis points to 8% to 10% in local currencies, 10% to 12% in dollars. Same-Store Owned EBITDA will be higher, offset by the loss as the St. Regis Osaka and the sale of The Westin Gaslamp. SBO will be $5 million better. Our SG&A will be up 4% to 5% due to a weaker dollar. Approximately 1/3 of our SG&A is denominated in Euros and Asian currencies. We are raising the EPS range by $0.05 due to lower depreciation and amortization and interest expenses. 
With regard to Bal Harbour, we remain on track to obtain a TCO and stop closings late in the fourth quarter. Sales have continued at good square foot rates and high deposits, and we've been in contact with people with signed contracts to alert them to the upcoming closing schedule. As we have indicated, there will be income recognize from clothings that are completed in 2011, which is not included in our outlook. We will provide our best estimates as we get closer to actually initiating the closing process. Any cash from closings this year is also not included in our estimate of cash flow for our Vacation Ownership and Residential business. 
Our balance sheet continues to get stronger. We finished the quarter with net debt before securitized receivables of $2.1 billion. We had cash on hand of around $750 million, with almost $600 million in excess of working capital needs. As you know Q1 is typically a cash used quarter for us. Off the end of the quarter, we received $110 million from the sale of The Westin Gaslamp. We're working on other asset sales and we'll announce them if and when they close. Our ratios continue to be well below covenant levels, and we have no bond maturities until May 2012. 
In summary, as Frits said, we remain cautiously confident. The world remains an uncertain place and could yet show some surprises at us. With a strong balance sheet, good cost control, the best global footprint in our industry and a great bland portfolio, we think we are very well positioned to weather the storms that may come our way. With that, I'll this back over to Jay."

So we feel very good about the overall trend rate for us. And I think in part, that's driven by what we've done to reinvigorate our sales and to put energy behind SPG. As we look outside of the U.S., as you know, the ability to measure REVPAR index, which isn't exactly the same thing as market share, by the way, but our ability to measure that as in the same granular way as in North America is a bit more difficult. What we tend to look at is the strength of our individual properties, end markets and their growth.  And we continue to see great momentum that continues to build. So while we do have some numbers, by the way, that corroborate that on a REVPAR index basis, we're also seeing in properties where we don't have those numbers, but we're seeing strong REVPAR growth that we think is at least on par and generally ahead of the marketplace. Vasant, or Jay, I don't know if you want to add any color on that."

We're seeing significant growth in demand for properties but not be yet at the level that's consistent with a larger group of properties going to market, and so our philosophy certainly feel today is to look at what we've been describing as rightful shot, sales opportunities, by which we mean specifically, individual hotels going to a set of owners, particularly well capitalized REITs that have an interest in certain types of hotels like the strong brands in gateway cities. I think that over time, obviously, we will expect that there will be a broader base of buyers and more general capital coming in that would make an acceleration of our sales process better. I would be speculating to tell you when exactly I think that is going to take place. What I like is the fact that interest and demand and hotel transactions continues to build. It still needs to go a fairways for it to be deep enough to consider sending a we're meaningful part of our portfolio.  And as I say, I hesitate to put a timeframe on it because I think it's just too hard to know whether that will be even more of us in 6 months or in 18 months. But as we get into let's call it, the middle stages of this cycle, we should be in a place where we can do something more significant.

What we're seeing is a strong underlying global economic and lodging recovery, punctuated by a few areas that are dramatically weaker for reasons that are entirely explainable for outside or, if you will, exogenous factors. So specifically, if you look at Asia, Japan is off for the reasons we all understand and appreciate. On the other hand, the other 5 areas throughout what we call Asia-Pacific are up and doing strongly, led by China but also Southeast Asia and the rest of ASEAN. As Vasant mentioned, India is strong, Australia driven by commodity sales, is extremely strong. Latin America, likewise, some areas where the commodity sales are driving the strength of the economy like Chile, very good but in Argentina, where you have an inflation and dollar revenue-based issue, things go the other way. And so, I think the thing to keep in mind here is outside of those places we cited like North Africa, Syria, Jordan, Bahrain, Japan and Argentina, things continue actually a bit stronger than the midpoint of our guidance or our baseline at the beginning of the year would've had us. But as we put together our baseline, we anticipated, because as Vasant pointed out, there's always something going on somewhere when you have operations in 100 countries.  And so this is a balancing of those and the fact that the underlying recovery is still pretty strong. Vasant, do you want to add anything to that?"

We define Same-Store, I think, similar to our competitors in the industry, where if we have hotels that are impacted by renovations, meaning more than 25% of the potential occupied rooms in a quarter are impacted, then we would pull it out of the Same-Store set, and that hotel would not go back into the set until a full year has passed, i.e. 5 quarters.

But the addition of a brand with the cachet and the following now that W has around the world points to the strength of that result. And by the way, now with the strong W in London, we believe we're going to see that much more outbound demand for W from the U.K. in some of the markets where people go.

But I think what's exciting about that brand is as you know, it typically takes a hotel about 3 years to get up to steady-state. If you've been following Aloft, you'll note that the first one opened less than 3 years ago.  We'll come on that in a couple of months here.  And yet the brand overall is ramping up to a point where it's very close to REVPAR numbers with its key competitors. And so we think again the reason for that quite simply is Aloft is to the specialty select business in many respects where W has been on the luxury side. And what I think so interesting about our experience with W over the years is here's a brand that began as a conversion brand for 3- to 4-star properties in a new type of environment and it literally got pulled into the luxury space. Now I'm not going to suggest that we're hoping for Aloft to be pulled into the Upper Upscale segment of the business, but we do think that because of its cachet, because of its attitude, because of its design positioning and, by the way, because of all these things together, not just one of those things, this brand has vitality that I think is going to sustain our franchise growth over time, by the way, not just in North America but as we open around the world."

Group business now we're seeing rate increases, and we're going to continue to be aggressive in pushing forward rate increases as we get some of the higher rated corporate group back into the mix. Frits has talked a lot about corporate rates, and corporate rates were down close to 20% from peak levels. We're clawing some of that back this year with the increases that we negotiated, and we would expect that over the coming years as well. When you look at the lower-rated channels, OTA, our business with OTA has probably peaked at 5% to 6% of room nights, whereas when you went back to 2007, that number was closer to 2% to 3%. So there's several percentage points that we can gain by moving to our own higher-margin distribution channels instead of using the OTAs. And our business with government is relatively small, call it just under 3%, and at the prior peak, that was probably 1% to 2%. So there's some room to grow there from a mix standpoint. So with that, that wraps up our first quarter earnings call.

Thanks all for joining us on our call today. Let me begin with the observation that once again, so much has happened since our last call.

Let me begin with the observation that once again, so much has happened since our last call. Like many of you, we've been gripped by the catastrophe in Japan and the political turmoil in the Arab world, not to mention the drug violence in Mexico, Portugal's fiscal woes, the near shutdown of the U.S. government and the rising cost of commodities. 
Despite all of this, our view of the global economy and the lodging recovery remain unchanged. We maintain that the recovery continues on in an uncertain and volatile world. For several quarters now, we have been and remain cautiously confident about a bumpy recovery in the near term and bullish about Starwood's prospects in the long term. 
With operations in 100 countries, our associates are never far from world events. Their eyewitness accounts and their great courage to do whatever it takes to protect the safety and comfort of our guests make for some of the most remarkable and inspiring stories I've heard in my career. Our closer view around the world, along with our dialogue with global accounts, also tell us that right now, world events have not derailed the forces driving this recovery. The rise of emerging markets, the financial health of global companies and the demand for travel in an ever more digitally connected world. 
So at a macro level, we're seeing activity consistent with global GDP growth at 4%, with occupancies at our own properties that are now greater than 2007 levels. So despite all of the turbulence, this is a great time to be a global branded company in the hotel business. With this world view in mind, we've kept our resolve to sustain this performance, overcome obstacles and position Starwood to thrive. Our resolve extends beyond our conservative approach to our balance sheet and our relentless focus on costs. We continue to be on offense, with numerous efforts to grow faster than the marketplace. 
Our results in the first quarter are a direct result of this result. [ph] In that context, I'd like to cover 3 topics for today: first, a quick recap of the first quarter; second, a snapshot of recent events and what they mean for the rest of 2011; and third, a look at how we create value for owners and how this, in turn, creates value for shareholders. 
So let's start with first quarter results. Our worldwide REVPAR grew by over 9%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Notably, for the first time in a recovery, rate contributed as much as occupancy to REVPAR growth. As many of you know well, this follows the pattern of a typical lodging recovery. As hotels fill, rates rise. 
Outside of North America, Japan and Mexico -- excuse me, outside of North Africa, Japan and Mexico, REVPAR around the world grew by more than 10%. North American Owned Hotel margins increased by 150 basis points, and worldwide margins would've increased by over 200 basis points or if not for the inflationary pressures in Latin America, which Vasant will describe later. 
Overall, our first quarter was a great start to the year, and it underscores our ability to grow faster than the market. No matter how you measure it, our brands are in terrific shape. For example, Smith Travel Research estimates that our REVPAR index in North America is up over 300 basis points, with each of our 9 brands showing REVPAR index improvement. This marks the fifth quarter in a row that across our system, both REVPAR growth and REVPAR index had outpaced the market. 
Our largest brand, Sheraton, sustained its best ever performance in guest satisfaction, meeting planner satisfaction, REVPAR index, pipeline and not to mention, the 4- and 5-star ratings. Sheraton REVPAR was up over 9% in Q1 in North America, significantly faster than 4% for Marriott. All of this is to drive home the point that the significant investment we and our owners have made in Sheraton continues to pay off. The momentum we enjoy by Sheraton and our entire portfolio of brands, despite a turbulent world and softness in a few U.S. metro markets, shows that we're holding to our baseline 2011 for both REVPAR and EBITDA.
In addition, our Vacation Ownership business also performed well in the quarter. Both tour flows and close rates increased by 4%, while pricing was off slightly as a result to product mix. As another sign of the recovery, we're encouraged to report that annualized defaults and delinquencies have now dropped to levels last seen in late 2007. Our Vacation Ownership business continues to be a strong source of cash, and with small re-investments, we can sustain our sales and cash generation at current levels through 2013.
In summary, we beat the high end of our EBITDA expectations by $3 million and EPS by $0.04 despite the events in Japan and North Africa -- which brings me to my second topic of today: a quick look at our business trends. The key takeaways that we see nothing right now that suggests we should change our outlook. 
Let's start with our group business. After a record-breaking group production last December, sales leveled off somewhat in the first 2 months of 2011, but in March, business accelerated, and we ended the quarter with 6% more business booked than in the prior year. As proof of growing business confidence, our corporate group business jumped 35% in the quarter. This provided a nice tailwind for rates. And as a result, our group pays or the total amount of group business we have in the books for 2011 is on track to be up double digits. We're also on track for our group pays in 2012 to be ahead of 2011. In fact, we now have more business on the books for 2012 than we did in early 2006 or 2007. 
And group business is evolving in a way that favors our global footprint and a high end positioning. Here are a couple of examples of what I mean. Sales for North American group business, booked from outside North America increased 20% in the quarter. And North American business booked by global accounts grew by 60%. These trends are only likely to continue.
Overall, our top accounts are rapidly growing global firms and professional services, financial services and technology. And as these industries continue to grow, we stand to benefit disproportionately. Already, we know that we get much more than our fair share of business from firms like McKenzie, Deloitte and PwC. In fact, today, 1 in 4 Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum members is a consultant. 
Our data suggest that SPG members overall have higher incomes than any other hotel loyalty program. Moreover, our brands also resonate with Gen Y and tech-savvy travelers that work in high-growth idea industries. This explains our jump of about 50% on our business with the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in just the past 3 years. 
Turning now to our corporate negotiated rates. We're happy to report that we achieved the high-single-digit increases that we were seeking. Coupled with rising occupancies, transient revenue increased 15% in Q1. And from what we can see today, this trend is continuing in Q2, with room nights booked one month out on track to increase double-digits and with ADRs of over 6%. We're now 2 years into our efforts to improve our revenue management systems, which are enabling us to push up rates and switch out lower price business while increasing occupancy and market share. And midweek occupancy is now approaching 2007 levels in gateway cities such as New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong, as business travel, particularly at the high end, remains robust. 
We often get asked whether we're concerned about rising oil prices. And no doubt, price-sensitive leisure travelers and some lower-rated business will be affected. But high-end travel is less elastic, and it's worth noting that lodging demand and oil prices show little correlation over time. Upon reflection, this actually makes sense. Consider these 2 scenarios: Scenario 1, oil prices rise with higher demand for oil. This usually means more economic activity and more travel. Scenario 2, oil prices rise as a result of tight supply. The net effect is less travel. Today, we're seeing a mix of both scenarios. Some of the rise in oil prices is a function of uncertain supply tied to political unrest. At the same time, economic growth is driving demand for all commodities including oil. 
A more straightforward barometer for us is simply to ask our customers. And they tell us that they plan to travel more and spend more in 2011 than in 2010. And along the same line, the Global Business Travel Association raised their projected growth in business travel spending from 5% to 7% in 2011. 
Another question we get asked a lot lately is whether we're concerned about the recent softness in New York, a marker we often cite as a leading indicator. And here's why we're not as worried about this as you might think. It comes down to 3 things: weather, group demand and supply. I won't dwell on the New York winter but we'll touch briefly on group demand. 
Group business came back in New York early in this recovery as planners were reluctant to book events at high-end resorts. As the appetite for resorts returns, some group business has cycled away from New York. Today, the biggest downdraft on New York is a 7% increase in supply over the past year. 
New York, by the way, stands alone in the developed world in this respect, and absorbing the new supply will take some time. Already for Q2, we're starting to see occupancies build. And for our part, we've accounted for 1 of every 4 new rooms in New York. This includes 6 new-build hotels. 2 Alofts in Harlem and Brooklyn, the Element Times Square, 2 Sheratons in Brooklyn and Tribeca and the W Downtown. And after that, 2 recent conversions, The Huntsville [ph] to The Westin and The Chatwal to Luxury Collection. So for all of our growth around the globe, it's New York that becomes the first market where all 9 brands will be present. So to conclude this topic, I hope this discussion gives you clarity about why we remained encouraged by the pace of our business. 
I'd like to turn now to my third and final topic for the day, a glimpse at some of the ways we create value for our owners. For those of you who've watched Starwood over the years, you know that we're transforming from being a hotel investment company to a global operator of lifestyle hospitality brands. Today, 95% of the hotel's carrier brands are owned by others. This means that we're more committed to the fee business and better aligned with our owners than ever before. If we create great returns for our owners, they're more likely to invest in our brands and sign up for additional hotels. So for the next few minutes, I'd like to share with you some examples of what we shared with our North American owners at our recent meeting about how we're working to create value. These fall into 3 areas: first, our portfolio of brands; second, our operational capabilities; and third, our ability to bring high-end guests.
So let me start by discussing some of our brands. What sets us apart is our portfolio of compelling brands, whose purpose is simply to create emotional connections and return business with travelers. Each brand is distinctive so there's no brand blur. This means we can add hotels of different brands in the same market, and they complement rather than compete with each other. All this enables us to drive even more growth. We're already the largest luxury hotel company in the world. Luxury Collection alone is about the same size as Four Seasons. St. Regis has doubled its footprint in the past 2 years, and we'll open 10 new Luxury properties around the world this year. And no other hotel company has a brand like W.  
And similar to W, Westin is becoming a global brand and continues to be a category killer in the U.S. And we're already seeing that Aloft and Element can do to [ph] the specialty select business, where W has done the luxury, generate outsized returns by using a distinct point of view and positioning to bring attitude and design flair to an undifferentiated market. 
Aloft is not even 3 years old today but is driving REVPAR results nearly equal to its largest competitor. And I've already talked about Sheraton's momentum today, which is helping drive Four Points to new heights. Our owners are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio as REVPAR index has now risen for 5 straight quarters.
Operational excellence is another way we can create value for owners. We have experienced teams in the field with proven abilities to driving top and bottom line in our properties. We're also investing heavily in the systems that will make their hotels more profitable. As we reduce our portfolio of owned hotels, we're increasingly redirecting our capital and attention to revenue management, sales capabilities and cost controls. By working closely with our owners on these investments, we ensure the best possible returns for them. 
Take revenue management, where we've already invested more than $40 million without increasing fees to our owners, where implemented the new systems and training, and resulting in a sustained 3.5% increase in REVPAR, and we believe we can double that improvement over time. Similarly, in markets where we've reoriented our sales resources, our hotels are now leading their competitive sets, and this is before the sales systems improvements come on stream. 
We also continue to invest in our cost containment tools, which have contributed to industry-leading margin improvements over the past year. Importantly, these cost cuts have not pulled us away from the record high guest satisfaction, even as occupancies and rate have risen. 
These efforts are all part of our path-to-peak initiative, and the getting all of our hotels in our system up-to-and-beyond their pre-crisis peak profits. This is a multiyear focus for Starwood, and we'll aggressively pull all the levers to get there. And remember, as rate increasingly drives the REVPAR growth, we believe the best margin improvement is yet to come as we keep our cost-per-occupied-room in check. 
The third way we create value for owners is by putting affluent heads in Heavenly Beds. We make this possible through our central delivery systems and our best-in-class loyalty program, SPG. We have 11 websites, 1 for each of our 9 brands plus starwoodhotels.com and spg.com. In total, they drive roughly 20% of our bookings today. Some people are surprised to learn that our own websites drive over 3x as much occupancy for us as all other third-party sites combined. Smart travelers know that they can only get best rate guarantee, all of our inventory and SPG points by booking with us, which mean our websites, our call centers, our global distribution centers, 50% of our bookings come through central delivery[ph]. 
And speaking of SPG, we see this as the glue that binds all of our brands. We led the industry with no blackout dates and providing redemption across our 3 luxury brands. And as our footprint of hotels has grown, SPG has grown even faster. In 2005, SPG members accounted for 34% of our stakes. Now SPG is at 47% or almost 1 in every 2 guests at our hotels. And SPG guests spend more than the average guest. 
SPG is also fueling our newest brands, driving 60% of occupancy for Aloft and Element. And with our global footprint, we now have more active members outside the U.S. than inside. So SPG drives occupancies around the world, and it will only increasingly drive business to each of our owners as more travelers travel across regions. 
In summary, these are some of the ways we create value for owners. Virtually everything we work on is with an eye towards creating value for them, through great experiences and brand connections with guests. And owners are noticing. We signed 10 conversions in the U.S. in Q1, and our owner engagement has never been better, with 96% extremely put satisfied with what we presented at our conference and 90% proud of being affiliated with Starwood. 
So to wrap up my prepared remarks, let me leave you with 4 thoughts. First, Starwood is structurally different from other lodging companies. We're focused on the 4- and 5-star categories and have the largest and fastest growing presence in international markets. For example, we opened roughly the same number of rooms in 2009 as 2010, but the percentage of non-U.S. rooms increased from 43% to almost 70%, and that will be even higher in 2011. We're also extending our lead. In the past couple of years, for example, we opened more rooms in India than our 3 biggest competitors combined. We already derived 60% of our fees outside of the U.S. 
Second, we can sustain growth faster than the market. Structurally, we benefit from our positioning, customer base and global growth. At the same time, we're investing in capabilities that show promise of multiyear improvements. 
Third, our focus on creating value for owners has helped us create a high-quality pipeline. Over 80% of our 85,000 rooms will be 4- and 5-star properties outside of the U.S. These are high-value contracts, thanks to high ADRs and incentive fees. So our growth should be faster on a relative basis and result in strong absolute fee growth. And this is before the implied fees, we also expect to capture from selling our own hotels and maintain the management contracts on it. 
As you saw in the quarter, we sold The Westin Gaslamp in April, and we're closely watching the bid asks spread on other assets as we go to market.  
And finally, let me remind you that we remain cautiously confident about the lodging recovery. The business environment today looks turbulent but robust, with strong group and transient pace and rates becoming a larger contributor to our REVPAR growth. As such, we expect worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011, in line with our trajectory of our baseline scenario. So despite the headwinds in North Africa, Japan and Latin America, softness in big metro markets like New York and D.C., not to mention an asset sale, we're maintaining our prior baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion and increasing our EPS in range from $1.60 to $1.70. Now let me turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,129091802,119362,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We were able to exceed our expectations in the first quarter despite the significant unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and the deteriorating crime situation in Mexico. In our business, as you all kno",1996,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We were able to exceed our expectations in the first quarter despite the significant unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and the deteriorating crime situation in Mexico. In our business, as you all know, we're impacted by wars, terrorism, political instability, national disasters, pandemics, financial crises and government [ph] recessions. We expect volatile will enter each year [ph] somewhere and have learned to roll with the punches, so to speak. 
However, the events of the first quarter, the tragic earthquake, tsunami in Japan and the turmoil all across North Africa, are more significant than the earthquake in Chile, the H1N1 scare in Latin America, the rice in Thailand and the various terrorist incidents that we've had in the last few years. Nevertheless, a strong cyclical recovery around the globe allowed us to offset a $5 million-plus negative impact from Japan and North Africa throughout performance elsewhere in our business. As Frits indicated, this global cyclical rebound continues, and it is our intent to offset negatives as best we can with positive elsewhere. As such, we're keeping our profit outlook for the year unchanged. In the next few minutes, I'll quickly review business conditions around the world and provide some color on our outlook for 2011.
Japan had a significant impact on our business. We have 15 hotels operating in Japan. We expect it to earn $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA this year, with about half of this coming from the 802-room Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay outside Tokyo Disneyland, of which we own 25%. 
We also just opened a new lease, St. Regis in Osaka, in October 2010, which is expected to break-even in 2011. All the other hotels are managed or franchised. As may be expected, travel into Japan is down significantly, resulting a larger occupancy and rate shortfalls at all hotels. With a nation in mourning, events and spending on events like wedding, is down very sharply, and unlikely to recover soon, hurting food and beverage, which is over 50% of Japanese hotel revenues. 
The Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay is particularly a hard hit, as Tokyo Disneyland was shut and while it is now open, we do not expect a recovery to normal levels anytime soon. The St. Regis in Osaka will likely lose $7 million to $8 million this year instead of breaking even. As such, we expect to make $5 million to $10 million in Japan, a $20 million to $25 million EBITDA shortfall for the year. Given the financial condition of the Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay, we have written off our equity investment. All-in-all, Japan will be a headwind this year.
We are offsetting some of this shortfall from strength elsewhere in Asia. Despite Japan, local currency REVPAR across Asia grew by 11%, led by China and China-related economies: Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. REVPAR in China was up 22%, with rates up 11% and occupancy up 5 points. We expect to have almost 100 hotels opened in China by the end of 2011, making China easily our second largest country after the U.S. 
Booking pace remains strong in China though comparisons will be affected by the lapping of the World Expo in Shanghai in Q2 and Q3 last year. 
India's growing well, too. We've had a very successful launch of the Westin brand in India, with 5 Westins open in the major cities over the past 18 months. The Westin Mumbai was recently voted the best new luxury hotel in India. We have 32 operating hotels with 4 more to open this year, including a spectacular new Sheraton in Bangalore. Our goal is to get to 100 opened and pipelined hotels in India by 2015. 
As a reminder, our operating hotels in Asia are in the 4- and 5-star and above category, and as such, each hotel earned significantly more in fees than smaller, lower price point brands. In summary, Asia ex-Japan continues to be a major engine of our growth. 
Moving on to the Middle East and Africa. The political turmoil in North Africa continues, with no clear end in sight. Our one hotel in Libya is shut and travel into most North African countries is down sharply. We have 24 hotels across the affected countries, which includes all of North Africa, plus Bahrain, Syria and Jordan. We expect it to earn at least $15 million in fees this year. We now estimate our fees will be cut in half, with no incentive fees earned and base fees down sharply. This assumes that the instability will not spread to Saudi and the Gulf, where we have the bulk of our business. 
In the first quarter, business conditions were stable in Saudi and the Gulf. We are seeing strong growth in Sub-Saharan Africa and expect it will continue in line with the commodity boom. As in Asia, our EMEA division is working on offsetting shortfalls from the Middle East in other parts of the region. In particular, our iconic W Barcelona, which opened in late 2009, has been a runaway success and continues to significantly exceed expectations despite the malaise in spend. And our new lease, W Leicester Square, which opened in February, is off to a very strong start. 
Also helping our robust business conditions in Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. The first quarter is a small quarter in Continental Europe, but booking pace suggests strength as we enter Q2. In Latin America, Mexico is our largest business, with 25 operating hotels, 3 owned resorts in Cancun, Cabo and Puerto Vallarta. And an owned hotel each in Mexico City and Monterrey. 
The drug wars and the negative press in the U.S. have decimated leisure travel into our Mexican resorts. In the peak season, occupancies are in the 50s and rate was down sharply as we had to replace U.S. guest with lower rate domestic business. While conditions are tough currently, we're long term bullish in Mexico, and our business continues to grow with a new St. Regis, a new Westin and a second W in Mexico City and a great new St. Regis Resort in Punta Mita, with more hotels in the pipeline. 
Also in Latin America, the gap between high local inflation while currencies appreciate relative to the dollar is severely hurting our own hotel margins, particularly in Argentina. This inflation devaluation gap cause our own margins to decline as much as 400 basis points in Q1. We're working on improving our dollar rate realization with our global accounts and by remixing the business.
In North America, a robust cyclical recovery in lodging is clearly underway. REVPAR grew over 11% despite Starwood being over at New Yorkers, which only grew 8%. Frits reviewed some of what we've seen as it relates to transient and group base. As we've said earlier this year, rate is a crucial make-or-break factor, and so far, we're on the right track. North American rate was up 5% in Q1. Our corporate renegotiations have ended well. Group rate is picking up, and transient rate continues to improve as occupancies rise in the remix business. We're outperforming the competition as we gained 300 basis points per share across all of our brands with outstanding performance by brand Sheraton. 
The situation in New York will improve as the year progresses and the market absorbs new supply. In Q2, we expect occupancies in the 90s at our New York hotels and REVPAR growth in the mid-teens. Based on current trends, we expect second quarter REVPAR growth to be in the same range as first quarter growth in North America despite tougher comparisons. 
Overall, our Owned Hotel portfolio performed well in Q1, with REVPAR up 12% and margins up over 200 basis points, ex-Latin America. Rate was up 4%. Cost control continues to be good, driving strong flow-throughs. Year-over-year comparisons are affected by opening costs of the new leased W London, the St. Regis in Osaka, one renovation and one hotel sold last year. Our fees are up strongly at 15.7% despite the Japan-North Africa impact, which reduced worldwide REVPAR by over 100 basis points and hurt global GOP margins by 50 basis points. 
In Q1, worldwide REVPAR was 10% below the Q1 2008 peak, 9% lower on rate and 100 basis points lower on occupancy. 
Finally our vacation ownership business continues to be stable. Sales to existing owners have picked up and tour flows are getting better. Default rates also continue to decline. As a result, SVO exceeded our expectations in Q1. 
Moving on to our outlook for the quarter in the year. In Q2, we expect REVPAR growth at Company Operated Hotels to be up 7% to 9% in local currencies globally, approximately 9% to 11% as reported in dollars. Fees will be up 10% to 12%, hurt by 200 basis points due to Japan and North African issues. Owned Hotel REVPAR globally is estimated to grow 8% to 10% in local currencies, 12% to 14% in dollars. Owned margins should be up 150 to 200 basis points, with North America at the high end of the range and international margins pressured once again by Latin America. 
Japan, North Africa and the sale of The Westin Gaslamp will reduce Q2 EBITDA by approximately $10 million. As such, we're projecting a Q2 EBITDA range of $245 million to $255 million and an EPS range of $0.42 to $0.46 based on a 24% tax rate. 
For the full year, we are maintaining our EBITDA outlook range of $975 million to $1 billion. The global company operated REVPAR forecast remains unchanged at 7% to 9% in local currencies, 8% to 10% in dollars. Fee growth is also unchanged at 10% to 12%, hurt 200 basis points by Japan and North Africa. Owned REVPAR expectation are up 100 basis points to 8% to 10% in local currencies, 10% to 12% in dollars. Same-Store Owned EBITDA will be higher, offset by the loss of the St. Regis Osaka and the sale of The Westin Gaslamp. SVO will be $5 million better. Our SG&A will be up 4% to 5% due to a weaker dollar. Approximately 1/3 of our SG&A is denominated in Euros and Asian currencies. We are raising the EPS range by $0.05 due to lower depreciation and amortization and interest expenses. 
With regard to Bal Harbour, we remain on track to obtain a TCO and start closings late in the fourth quarter. Sales have continued at good square foot rates and high deposits, and we've been in contact with people with signed contracts to alert them to the upcoming closing schedule. As we have indicated, there will be income recognized from closings that are completed in 2011, which is not included in our outlook. We will provide our best estimates as we get closer to actually initiating the closing process. Any cash from closings this year is also not included in our estimate of cash flow from our vacation ownership and residential business.  
Our balance sheet continues to get stronger. We finished the quarter with net debt before securitized receivables of $2.1 billion. We had cash on hand of around $750 million, with almost $600 million in excess of working capital needs. As you know, Q1 is typically a cash-used quarter for us. Off the end of the quarter, we received $110 million from the sale of the Westin Gaslamp. We're working on other asset sales and we'll announce them if and when they close. Our ratios continue to be well below covenant levels, and we have no bond maturities until May 2012. 
In summary, as Frits said, we remain cautiously confident. The world remains an uncertain place and could yet throw some surprises at us. With a strong balance sheet, good cost control, the best global footprint in our industry and a great brand portfolio, we think we are very well positioned to weather the storms that may come our way. With that, I'll this back over to Jay."

In terms of REVPAR index growth in North America, the great thing that we're looking at right now is that all 9 of our brands have gained. Clearly, with Sheraton being the largest brand, it contributes most to that growth. But we're seeing strong momentum with Westin and with W, for example also. So we feel very good about the overall trend rate for us. And I think in part, that's driven by what we've done to reinvigorate our sales and to put energy behind SPG. As we look outside of the U.S., as you know, the ability to measure REVPAR index, which isn't exactly the same thing as market share, by the way, but our ability to measure that as in the same granular way as in North America is a bit more difficult. What we tend to look at is the strength of our individual properties, end markets and their growth.  And we continue to see great momentum there that continues to build. So while we do have some numbers, by the way, that corroborate that on a REVPAR index basis, we're also seeing it in properties where we don't have those numbers. But we're seeing strong REVPAR growth that we think is at least on par and generally ahead of the marketplace. Vasant, or Jay, I don't know if you want to add some color to that."

Why don't I start with the second part of your question, then I'll hand back to Jay or Vasant to address the first part? We're seeing significant growth in demand for properties but not yet at the level that's consistent with a larger group of properties going to market. And so our philosophy certainly still today is to look at what we've been describing as rightful-shot sales opportunities, by which we mean specifically, individual hotels going to a set of owners, particularly well capitalized REITs that have an interest in certain types of hotels like the strong brands in gateway cities. I think that over time, obviously, we will expect that there will be a broader base of buyers and more general capital coming in that would make an acceleration of our sales process better. I would be speculating to tell you when exactly I think that is going to take place. What I like is the fact that interest and demand and hotel transactions continues to build. It still needs to go a fairways for it to be deep enough to consider selling a more meaningful part of our portfolio.  And as I say, I hesitate to put a time frame on it because I think it's just too hard to know whether that will be even more of us in 6 months or in 18 months. But as we get into, let's call it, the middle stages of this cycle, we should be in a place where we can do something more significant.

What we're seeing is a strong underlying global economic and lodging recovery, punctuated by a few areas that are dramatically weaker for reasons that are entirely explainable for outside or, if you will, exogenous factors. So specifically, if you look at Asia, Japan is off for the reasons we all understand and appreciate. On the other hand, the other 5 areas throughout what we call Asia-Pacific are up and doing strongly, led by China but also Southeast Asia and the rest of ASEAN. As Vasant mentioned, India is strong. Australia driven by commodity sales, is extremely strong. Latin America, likewise, some areas where the commodity sales are driving the strength of the economy like Chile, very good. But in Argentina, where you have an inflation and dollar revenue-based issue, things go the other way. And so, I think the thing to keep in mind here is outside of those places we cited, like North Africa, Syria, Jordan, Bahrain, Japan and Argentina, things continue actually a bit stronger than the midpoint of our guidance or our baseline at the beginning of the year would've had us. But as we put together our baseline, we anticipated, because as Vasant pointed out, there's always something going on somewhere when you have operations in 100 countries.  And so this is a balancing of those and the fact that the underlying recovery is still pretty strong. Vasant, do you want to add anything to that?"

So if you look at our North America systemwide Sheraton number, 10.1%, excluding the impact from the Canadian dollar, it's 9.3%. These numbers are Same-Store numbers. We define Same-Store, I think, similar to our competitors in the industry, where if we have hotels that are impacted by renovations, meaning more than 25% of the potential occupied rooms in a quarter are impacted, then we would pull that out of the Same-Store set, and that hotel would not go back into the set until a full year has passed, i.e. 5 quarters. So the Same-Store results for Sheraton excluding any kind of FX were 9.3%, which is very strong, I think. And that's why you've seen those REVPAR index gains that we spoke about."

But the addition of a brand with the cachet and the following now that W has around the world points to the strength of that result. And by the way, now with the strong W in London, we believe we're going to see that much more outbound demand for W from the U.K. in some of the markets where people go.

And yet the brand overall is ramping up to a point where it's very close to REVPAR numbers with its key competitors. And so we think again the reason for that quite simply is Aloft is to the specialty select business in many respects where W has been on the luxury side. And what I think so interesting about our experience with W over the years is here's a brand that began as a conversion brand for 3- to 4-star properties and a new type of environment and it literally got pulled into the luxury space. Now I'm not going to suggest that we're hoping for Aloft to get pulled into the upper upscale segment of the business, but we do think that because of its cachet, because of its attitude, because of its design positioning and, by the way, because of all these things together, not just one of those things, this brand has vitality that I think is going to sustain our franchise growth over time.

Group business, now we're seeing rate increases, and we're going to continue to be aggressive in pushing forward rate increases as we get some of the higher-rated corporate group back into the mix. Frits has talked a lot about corporate rates, and corporate rates were down close to 20% from peak levels. We're clawing some of that back this year with the increases that we negotiated, and we would expect that over the coming years as well. When you look at the lower-rated channels, OTA, our business with OTA has probably peaked at 5% to 6% of room nights. Whereas when you went back to 2007, that number was closer to 2% to 3%. So there's several percentage points that we can gain by moving to our own higher-margin distribution channels instead of using the OTAs. And our business with government is relatively small. Call it just under 3%, and at the prior peak, that was probably 1% to 2%. So there is some room to grow there from a mix standpoint. So with that, that wraps up our first quarter earnings call.

Thanks, all, for joining us on our call today. Let me begin with the observation that once again, so much has happened since our last call.

Let me begin with the observation that once again, so much has happened since our last call. Like many of you, we've been gripped by the catastrophe in Japan and the political turmoil in the Arab world, not to mention the drug violence in Mexico, Portugal's fiscal woes, the near shutdown of the U.S. government and the rising cost of commodities. 
Despite all of this, our view of the global economy and the lodging recovery remain unchanged. We maintain that the recovery continues on in an uncertain and volatile world. For several quarters now, we have been and remain cautiously confident about a bumpy recovery in the near term and bullish about Starwood's prospects in the long term. 
With operations in 100 countries, our associates are never far from world events. Their eyewitness accounts and their great courage to do whatever it takes to protect the safety and comfort of our guests make for some of the most remarkable and inspiring stories I've heard in my career. Our closer view around the world, along with our dialogue with global accounts, also tell us that right now, world events have not derailed the forces driving this recovery. The rise of emerging markets, the financial health of global companies and the demand for travel in an ever more digitally connected world. 
So at a macro level, we're seeing activity consistent with global GDP growth at 4%, with occupancies at our own properties that are now greater than 2007 levels. So despite all of the turbulence, this is a great time to be a global branded company in the hotel business. With this world view in mind, we've kept our resolve to sustain this performance, overcome obstacles and position Starwood to thrive. Our resolve extends beyond our conservative approach to our balance sheet and our relentless focus on costs. We continue to be on offense, with numerous efforts to grow faster than the marketplace. 
Our results in the first quarter are a direct result of this result. In that context, I'd like to cover 3 topics for today: First, a quick recap of the first quarter; second, a snapshot of recent events and what they mean for the rest of 2011; and third, a look at how we create value for owners and how this, in turn, creates value for shareholders. 
So let's start with first quarter results. Our worldwide REVPAR grew by over 9%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Notably, for the first time in a recovery, rate contributed as much as occupancy to REVPAR growth. As many of you know well, this follows the pattern of a typical lodging recovery. As hotels fill, rates rise. 
Outside of North America, Japan and Mexico -- excuse me, outside of North Africa, Japan and Mexico, REVPAR around the world grew by more than 10%. North American Owned Hotel margins increased by 150 basis points, and worldwide margins would've increased by over 200 basis points were if not for the inflationary pressures in Latin America, which Vasant will describe later. 
Overall, our first quarter was a great start to the year, and it underscores our ability to grow faster than the market. No matter how you measure it, our brands are in terrific shape. For example, Smith Travel Research estimates that our REVPAR index in North America is up over 300 basis points, with each of our 9 brands showing REVPAR index improvement. This marks the fifth quarter in a row that across our system, both REVPAR growth and REVPAR index had outpaced the market. 
Our largest brand, Sheraton, sustained its best ever performance in guest satisfaction, meeting planner satisfaction, REVPAR index, pipeline and, not to mention, the 4- and 5-star ratings. Sheraton REVPAR was up over 9% in Q1 in North America, significantly faster than 4% for Marriott. All of this was to drive home the point that the significant investment we and our owners have made in Sheraton continues to pay off. The momentum we enjoy by Sheraton and our entire portfolio of brands, despite a turbulent world and softness in a few U.S. metro markets, shows that we're holding to our baseline 2011 for both REVPAR and EBITDA.
In addition, our Vacation Ownership business also performed well in the quarter. Both tour flows and close rates increased by 4%, while pricing was off slightly as a result to product mix. As another sign of the recovery, we're encouraged to report that annualized defaults and delinquencies have now dropped to levels last seen in late 2007. Our Vacation Ownership business continues to be a strong source of cash, and with small re-investments, we can sustain our sales and cash generation at current levels through 2013.
In summary, we beat the high end of our EBITDA expectations by $3 million and EPS by $0.04 despite the events in Japan and North Africa -- which brings me to my second topic of today: a quick look at our business trends. The key takeaway is that we see nothing right now that suggests we should change our outlook. 
Let's start with our group business. After a record-breaking group production last December, sales leveled off somewhat in the first 2 months of 2011, but in March, business accelerated, and we ended the quarter with 6% more business booked than in the prior year. As proof of growing business confidence, our corporate group business jumped 35% in the quarter. This provided a nice tailwind for rates. And as a result, our group pays or the total amount of group business we have in the books for 2011 is on track to be up double digits. We're also on track for our group pays in 2012 to be ahead of 2011. In fact, we now have more business on the books for 2012 than we did in early 2006 or 2007. 
And group business is evolving in a way that favors our global footprint and a high end positioning. Here are a couple of examples of what I mean. Sales for North American group business, booked from outside North America increased 20% in the quarter. And North American business booked by global accounts grew by 60%. These trends are only likely to continue.
Overall, our top accounts are rapidly growing global firms and professional services, financial services and technology. And as these industries continue to grow, we stand to benefit disproportionately. Already, we know that we get much more than our fair share of business from firms like McKenzie, Deloitte and PwC. In fact, today, 1 in 4 Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum members is a consultant. 
Our data suggest that SPG members overall have higher incomes than any other hotel loyalty program. Moreover, our brands also resonate with Gen Y and tech-savvy travelers that work in high-growth idea industries. This explains our jump of about 50% on our business with the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in just the past 3 years. 
Turning now to our corporate negotiated rates. We're happy to report that we achieved the high-single-digit increases that we were seeking. Coupled with rising occupancies, transient revenue increased 15% in Q1. And from what we can see today, this trend is continuing in Q2, with room nights booked one month out on track to increase double-digits and with ADRs of over 6%. We're now 2 years into our efforts to improve our revenue management systems, which are enabling us to push up rates and switch out lower price business while increasing occupancy and market share. And midweek occupancy is now approaching 2007 levels in gateway cities such as New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong, as business travel, particularly at the high end, remains robust. 
We often get asked whether we're concerned about rising oil prices. And no doubt, price-sensitive leisure travelers and some lower-rated business will be affected. But high-end travel is less elastic, and it's worth noting that lodging demand and oil prices show little correlation over time. Upon reflection, this actually makes sense. Consider these 2 scenarios: Scenario 1, oil prices rise with higher demand for oil. This usually means more economic activity and more travel. Scenario 2, oil prices rise as a result of tight supply. The net effect is less travel. Today, we're seeing a mix of both scenarios. Some of the rise in oil prices is a function of uncertain supply tied to political unrest. At the same time, economic growth is driving demand for all commodities including oil. 
A more straightforward barometer for us is simply to ask our customers. And they tell us that they plan to travel more and spend more in 2011 than in 2010. And along the same line, the Global Business Travel Association raised their projected growth in business travel spending from 5% to 7% in 2011. 
Another question we get asked a lot lately is whether we're concerned about the recent softness in New York, a marker we often cite as a leading indicator. And here's why we're not as worried about this as you might think. It comes down to 3 things: weather, group demand and supply. I won't dwell on the New York winter but we'll touch briefly on group demand. 
Group business came back in New York early in this recovery as planners were reluctant to book events at high-end resorts. As the appetite for resorts returns, some group business has cycled away from New York. Today, the biggest downdraft on New York is a 7% increase in supply over the past year. 
New York, by the way, stands alone in the developed world in this respect, and absorbing the new supply will take some time. Already for Q2, we're starting to see occupancies build. And for our part, we've accounted for 1 of every 4 new rooms in New York. This includes 6 new-build hotels: 2 Alofts in Harlem and Brooklyn; the Element Times Square; 2 Sheratons in Brooklyn; and Tribeca and the W Downtown. And after that, 2 recent conversions: The Helmsley to The Westin; and The Chatwal to Luxury Collection. So for all of our growth around the globe, it's New York that becomes the first market where all 9 brands will be present. 
So to conclude this topic, I hope this discussion gives you clarity about why we remain encouraged by the pace of our business. 
I'd like to turn now to my third and final topic for the day: a glimpse at some of the ways we create value for our owners. For those of you who've watched Starwood over the years, you know that we're transforming from being a hotel investment company to a global operator of lifestyle hospitality brands. Today, 95% of the hotel's carrier brands are owned by others. This means that we're more committed to the fee business and better aligned with our owners than ever before. If we create great returns for our owners, they're more likely to invest in our brands and sign up for additional hotels. So for the next few minutes, I'd like to share with you some examples of what we shared with our North American owners at our recent meeting about how we're working to create value. These fall into 3 areas: First, our portfolio of brands; second, our operational capabilities; and third, our ability to bring high-end guests.
So let me start by discussing some of our brands. What sets us apart is our portfolio of compelling brands, whose purpose is simply to create emotional connections and return business with travelers. Each brand is distinctive so there's no brand blur. This means we can add hotels of different brands in the same market, and they complement rather than compete with each other. All this enables us to drive even more growth. We're already the largest luxury hotel company in the world. Luxury Collection alone is about the same size as Four Seasons. St. Regis has doubled its footprint in the past 2 years, and we'll open 10 new Luxury properties around the world this year. And no other hotel company has a brand like W.  
And similar to W, Westin is becoming a global brand and continues to be a category killer in the U.S. And we're already seeing that Aloft and Element can do to the specialty select business what W has done to Luxury: generate outsized returns by using a distinct point of view and positioning to bring attitude and design flair to an undifferentiated market. 
Aloft is not even 3 years old today but is driving REVPAR results nearly equal to its largest competitor. And I've already talked about Sheraton's momentum today, which is helping drive Four Points to new heights. Our owners are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio as REVPAR index has now risen for 5 straight quarters.
Operational excellence is another way we can create value for owners. We have experienced teams in the field with proven abilities to driving top and bottom line in our properties. We're also investing heavily in the systems that will make their hotels more profitable. As we reduce our portfolio of owned hotels, we're increasingly redirecting our capital and attention to revenue management, sales capabilities and cost controls. By working closely with our owners on these investments, we ensure the best possible returns for them. 
Take revenue management, where we've already invested more than $40 million without increasing fees to our owners, where implemented the new systems and training, and resulting in a sustained 3.5% increase in REVPAR, and we believe we can double that improvement over time. Similarly, in markets where we've reoriented our sales resources, our hotels are now leading their competitive sets, and this is before the sales systems improvements come on stream. 
We also continue to invest in our cost containment tools, which have contributed to industry-leading margin improvements over the past year. Importantly, these cost cuts have not pulled us away from the record high guest satisfaction, even as occupancies and rate have risen. 
These efforts are all part of our path-to-peak initiative, and to getting all of our hotels in our system up-to-and-beyond their pre-crisis peak profits. This is a multiyear focus for Starwood, and we'll aggressively pull all the levers to get there. And remember, as rate increasingly drives the REVPAR growth, we believe the best margin improvement is yet to come as we keep our cost-per-occupied-room in check. 
The third way we create value for owners is by putting affluent heads in Heavenly Beds. We make this possible through our central delivery systems and our best-in-class loyalty program, SPG. We have 11 websites, 1 for each of our 9 brands plus www.starwoodhotels.com and www.spg.com. In total, they drive roughly 20% of our bookings today. Some people are surprised to learn that our own websites drive over 3x as much occupancy for us as all other third-party sites combined. Smart travelers know that they can only get best rate guarantee, all of our inventory and SPG points by booking with us, which mean our websites, our call centers, our global distribution centers, 50% of our bookings come through central delivery.
And speaking of SPG, we see this as the glue that binds all of our brands. We led the industry with no blackout dates and providing redemption across our 3 luxury brands. And as our footprint of hotels has grown, SPG has grown even faster. In 2005, SPG members accounted for 34% of our stays. Now SPG is at 47%, or almost 1 in every 2 guests at our hotels. And SPG guests spend more than the average guest. 
SPG is also fueling our newest brands, driving 60% of occupancy for Aloft and Element. And with our global footprint, we now have more active members outside the U.S. than inside. So SPG drives occupancies around the world, and it will only increasingly drive business to each of our owners as more travelers travel across regions. 
In summary, these are some of the ways we create value for owners. Virtually everything we work on is with an eye towards creating value for them, through great experiences and brand connections with guests. And owners are noticing. We signed 10 conversions in the U.S. in Q1, and our owner engagement has never been better, with 96% extremely satisfied with what we presented at our conference and 90% proud of being affiliated with Starwood. 
So to wrap up my prepared remarks, let me leave you with 4 thoughts. First, Starwood is structurally different from other lodging companies. We're focused on the 4- and 5-star categories and have the largest and fastest growing presence in international markets. For example, we opened roughly the same number of rooms in 2009 as 2010, but the percentage of non-U.S. rooms increased from 43% to almost 70%, and that will be even higher in 2011. We're also extending our lead. In the past couple of years, for example, we opened more rooms in India than our 3 biggest competitors combined. We already derived 60% of our fees outside of the U.S. 
Second, we can sustain growth faster than the market. Structurally, we benefit from our positioning, customer base and global growth. At the same time, we're investing in capabilities that show promise of multiyear improvements. 
Third, our focus on creating value for owners has helped us create a high-quality pipeline. Over 80% of our 85,000 rooms will be 4- and 5-star properties outside of the U.S. These are high-value contracts, thanks to high ADRs and incentive fees. So our growth should be faster on a relative basis and result in strong absolute fee growth. And this is before the implied fees, we also expect to capture from selling our own hotels and maintain the management contracts on it. 
As you saw in the quarter, we sold The Westin Gaslamp in April, and we're closely watching the bid-ask spread on other assets as we go to market.  
And finally, let me remind you that we remain cautiously confident about the lodging recovery. The business environment today looks turbulent but robust, with strong group and transient pace and rates becoming a larger contributor to our REVPAR growth. As such, we expect worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011, in line with our trajectory of our baseline scenario. So despite the headwinds in North Africa, Japan and Latin America, softness in big metro markets like New York and D.C., not to mention an asset sale, we're maintaining our prior baseline 2011 EBITDA in the range of $975 million to $1 billion and increasing our EPS in the range from $1.60 to $1.70. 
Now let me turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,129091802,119526,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We were able to exceed our expectations in the first quarter despite the significant unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and the deteriorating crime situation in Mexico. In our business, as you all kno",1992,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We were able to exceed our expectations in the first quarter despite the significant unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and the deteriorating crime situation in Mexico. In our business, as you all know, we're impacted by wars, terrorism, political instability, national disasters, pandemics, financial crises and [indiscernible] recessions. We expect 1 or 2 will enter each year somewhere and have learned to roll with the punches, so to speak. 
However, the events of the first quarter, the tragic earthquake/tsunami in Japan and the turmoil all across North Africa, are more significant than the earthquake in Chile, the H1N1 scare in Latin America, the riots in Thailand and the various terrorist incidents that we've had in the last few years. Nevertheless, a strong cyclical recovery around the globe allowed us to offset a $5 million-plus negative impact from Japan and North Africa throughout performance elsewhere in our business. 
As Frits indicated, this global cyclical rebound continues, and it is our intent to offset negatives as best we can with positives elsewhere. As such, we're keeping our profit outlook for the year unchanged. In the next few minutes, I'll quickly review business conditions around the world and provide some color on our outlook for 2011.
Japan had a significant impact on our business. We have 15 hotels operating in Japan. We expected to earn $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA this year, with about half of this coming from the 802-room Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay outside Tokyo Disneyland, of which we own 25%. 
We also just opened a new lease St. Regis in Osaka, in October 2010, which is expected to break-even in 2011. All the other hotels are managed or franchised. As may be expected, travel into Japan is down significantly, resulting in large occupancy and rate shortfalls at all hotels. With a nation in mourning, events and spending on events like weddings is down very sharply, and unlikely to recover soon, hurting food and beverage, which is over 50% of Japanese hotel revenues. 
The Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay is particularly hard hit, as Tokyo Disneyland was shut and while it is now open, we do not expect a recovery to normal levels anytime soon. The St. Regis in Osaka will likely lose $7 million to $8 million this year instead of breaking even. As such, we expect to make $5 million to $10 million in Japan, a $20 million to $25 million EBITDA shortfall for the year. Given the financial condition of the Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay, we have written off our equity investment. All-in-all, Japan will be a headwind this year.
We are offsetting some of this shortfall from strength elsewhere in Asia. Despite Japan, local currency REVPAR across Asia grew by 11%, led by China and China-related economies: Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. REVPAR in China was up 22%, with rates up 11% and occupancy up 5 points. We expect to have almost 100 hotels opened in China by the end of 2011, making China easily our second largest country after the U.S. 
Booking pace remains strong in China though comparisons will be affected by the lapping of the World Expo in Shanghai in Q2 and Q3 last year. 
India's growing well, too. We've had a very successful launch of the Westin brand in India, with 5 Westins open in the major cities over the past 18 months. The Westin Mumbai was recently voted the best new luxury hotel in India. We have 32 operating hotels with 4 more to open this year, including a spectacular new Sheraton in Bangalore. Our goal is to get to 100 opened and pipelined hotels in India by 2015. 
As a reminder, our operating hotels in Asia are in the 4- and 5-star and above category, and as such, each hotel earned significantly more in fees than smaller, lower price point brands. In summary, Asia ex-Japan continues to be a major engine of our growth. 
Moving on to the Middle East and Africa. The political turmoil in North Africa continues, with no clear end in sight. Our one hotel in Libya is shut and travel into most North African countries is down sharply. We have 24 hotels across the affected countries, which includes all of North Africa, plus Bahrain, Syria and Jordan. We expected to earn at least $15 million in fees this year. We now estimate our fees will be cut in half, with no incentive fees earned and base fees down sharply. This assumes that the instability will not spread to Saudi and the Gulf, where we have the bulk of our business. 
In the first quarter, business conditions were stable in Saudi and the Gulf. We are seeing strong growth in Sub-Saharan Africa and expect it will continue in line with the commodity boom. As in Asia, our EMEA division is working on offsetting shortfalls from the Middle East in other parts of the region. In particular, our iconic W Barcelona, which opened in late 2009, has been a runaway success and continues to significantly exceed expectations despite the malaise in spend. And our new lease, W Leicester Square, which opened in February, is off to a very strong start. 
Also helping our robust business conditions in Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. The first quarter is a small quarter in Continental Europe, but booking pace suggests strength as we enter Q2. In Latin America, Mexico is our largest business, with 25 operating hotels, 3 owned resorts in Cancun, Cabo and Puerto Vallarta. And an owned hotel each in Mexico City and Monterrey. 
The drug wars and the negative press in the U.S. have decimated leisure travel into our Mexican resorts. In the peak season, occupancies were in the 50s and rate was down sharply as we had to replace U.S. guest with lower rate domestic business. While conditions are tough currently, we're long term bullish in Mexico, and our business continues to grow with a new St. Regis, a new Westin and a second W in Mexico City and a great new St. Regis Resort in Punta Mita, with more hotels in the pipeline. 
Also in Latin America, the gap between high local inflation while currencies appreciate relative to the dollar is severely hurting our own hotel margins, particularly in Argentina. This inflation devaluation gap cause our own margins to decline as much as 400 basis points in Q1. We're working on improving our dollar rate realization with our global accounts and by remixing the business.
In North America, a robust cyclical recovery in lodging is clearly underway. REVPAR grew over 11% despite Starwood being over at New Yorkers, which only grew 8%. Frits reviewed some of what we've seen as it relates to transient and group base. As we've said earlier this year, rate is a crucial make-or-break factor, and so far, we're on the right track. North American rate was up 5% in Q1. Our corporate renegotiations have ended well. Group rate is picking up, and transient rate continues to improve as occupancies rise in the remix business. We're outperforming the competition as we gained 300 basis points per share across all of our brands with outstanding performance by brand Sheraton. 
The situation in New York will improve as the year progresses and the market absorbs new supply. In Q2, we expect occupancies in the 90s at our New York hotels and REVPAR growth in the mid-teens. Based on current trends, we expect second quarter REVPAR growth to be in the same range as first quarter growth in North America despite tougher comparisons. 
Overall, our Owned Hotel portfolio performed well in Q1, with REVPAR up 12% and margins up over 200 basis points, ex-Latin America. Rate was up 4%. Cost control continues to be good, driving strong flow-throughs. Year-over-year comparisons are affected by opening costs of the new leased W London, the St. Regis in Osaka, one renovation and one hotel sold last year. Our fees are up strongly at 15.7% despite the Japan-North Africa impact, which reduced worldwide REVPAR by over 100 basis points and hurt global GOP margins by 50 basis points. 
In Q1, worldwide REVPAR was 10% below the Q1 2008 peak, 9% lower on rate and 100 basis points lower on occupancy. 
Finally our vacation ownership business continues to be stable. Sales to existing owners have picked up and tour flows are getting better. Default rates also continue to decline. As a result, SVO exceeded our expectations in Q1. 
Moving on to our outlook for the quarter and the year. In Q2, we expect REVPAR growth at Company Operated Hotels to be up 7% to 9% in local currencies globally, approximately 9% to 11% as reported in dollars. Fees will be up 10% to 12%, hurt by 200 basis points due to Japan and North African issues. Owned Hotel REVPAR globally is estimated to grow 8% to 10% in local currencies, 12% to 14% in dollars. Owned margins should be up 150 to 200 basis points, with North America at the high end of the range and international margins pressured once again by Latin America. 
Japan, North Africa and the sale of The Westin Gaslamp will reduce Q2 EBITDA by approximately $10 million. As such, we're projecting a Q2 EBITDA range of $245 million to $255 million and an EPS range of $0.42 to $0.46 based on a 24% tax rate. 
For the full year, we are maintaining our EBITDA outlook range of $975 million to $1 billion. The global company operated REVPAR forecast remains unchanged at 7% to 9% in local currencies, 8% to 10% in dollars. Fee growth is also unchanged at 10% to 12%, hurt 200 basis points by Japan and North Africa. Owned REVPAR expectation are up 100 basis points to 8% to 10% in local currencies, 10% to 12% in dollars. Same-Store Owned EBITDA will be higher, offset by the loss of the St. Regis Osaka and the sale of The Westin Gaslamp. SVO will be $5 million better. Our SG&A will be up 4% to 5% due to a weaker dollar. Approximately 1/3 of our SG&A is denominated in Euros and Asian currencies. We are raising the EPS range by $0.05 due to lower depreciation and amortization and interest expenses. 
With regard to Bal Harbour, we remain on track to obtain a TCO and start closings late in the fourth quarter. Sales have continued at good square foot rates and high deposits, and we've been in contact with people with signed contracts to alert them to the upcoming closing schedule. As we have indicated, there will be income recognized from closings that are completed in 2011, which is not included in our outlook. We will provide our best estimates as we get closer to actually initiating the closing process. Any cash from closings this year is also not included in our estimate of cash flow from our vacation ownership and residential business.  
Our balance sheet continues to get stronger. We finished the quarter with net debt before securitized receivables of $2.1 billion. We had cash on hand of around $750 million, with almost $600 million in excess of working capital needs. As you know, Q1 is typically a cash-used quarter for us. Off the end of the quarter, we received $110 million from the sale of the Westin Gaslamp. We're working on other asset sales and we'll announce them if and when they close. Our ratios continue to be well below covenant levels, and we have no bond maturities until May 2012. 
In summary, as Frits said, we remain cautiously confident. The world remains an uncertain place and could yet throw some surprises at us. With a strong balance sheet, good cost control, the best global footprint in our industry and a great brand portfolio, we think we are very well positioned to weather the storms that may come our way. 
With that, I'll this back over to Jay."

In terms of REVPAR index growth in North America, the great thing that we're looking at right now is that all 9 of our brands have gained. Clearly, with Sheraton being the largest brand, it contributes most to that growth. But we're seeing strong momentum with Westin and with W, for example, also. So we feel very good about the overall trend rate for us. And I think in part, that's driven by what we've done to reinvigorate our sales and to put energy behind SPG. As we look outside of the U.S., as you know, the ability to measure REVPAR index, which isn't exactly the same thing as market share, by the way, but our ability to measure that as in the same granular way as in North America is a bit more difficult. What we tend to look at is the strength of our individual properties, end markets and their growth.  And we continue to see great momentum there that continues to build. So while we do have some numbers, by the way, that corroborate that on a REVPAR index basis, we're also seeing it in properties where we don't have those numbers. But we're seeing strong REVPAR growth that we think is at least on par and generally ahead of the marketplace. Vasant, or Jay, I don't know if you want to add some color to that."

Why don't I start with the second part of your question, then I'll hand back to Jay or Vasant to address the first part? We're seeing significant growth in demand for properties but not yet at the level that's consistent with a larger group of properties going to market. And so our philosophy certainly still today is to look at what we've been describing as rifle shot sales opportunities, by which we mean specifically, individual hotels going to a set of owners, particularly well capitalized REITs that have an interest in certain types of hotels like the strong brands in gateway cities. I think that over time, obviously, we will expect that there will be a broader base of buyers and more general capital coming in that would make an acceleration of our sales process better. I would be speculating to tell you when exactly I think that is going to take place. What I like is the fact that interest and demand and hotel transactions continues to build. It still needs to go a fair ways for it to be deep enough to consider selling a more meaningful part of our portfolio.  And as I say, I hesitate to put a time frame on it because I think it's just too hard to know whether that will be even more of us in 6 months or in 18 months. But as we get into, let's call it, the middle stages of this cycle, we should be in a place where we can do something more significant.

What we're seeing is a strong underlying global economic and lodging recovery, punctuated by a few areas that are dramatically weaker for reasons that are entirely explainable for outside or, if you will, exogenous factors. So specifically, if you look at Asia, Japan is off for the reasons we all understand and appreciate. On the other hand, the other 5 areas throughout what we call Asia-Pacific are up and doing strongly, led by China but also Southeast Asia and the rest of ASEAN. As Vasant mentioned, India is strong. Australia driven by commodity sales, is extremely strong. Latin America, likewise, some areas where the commodity sales are driving the strength of the economy like Chile, very good. But in Argentina, where you have an inflation and dollar revenue-based issue, things go the other way. And so, I think the thing to keep in mind here is outside of those places we cited, like North Africa, Syria, Jordan, Bahrain, Japan and Argentina, things continue actually a bit stronger than the midpoint of our guidance or our baseline at the beginning of the year would've had us. But as we put together our baseline, we anticipated, because as Vasant pointed out, there's always something going on somewhere when you have operations in 100 countries.  And so this is a balancing of those and the fact that the underlying recovery is still pretty strong. Vasant, do you want to add anything to that?"

We define Same-Store, I think, similar to our competitors in the industry, where if we have hotels that are impacted by renovations, meaning more than 25% of the potential occupied rooms in a quarter are impacted, then we would pull that out of the Same-Store set, and that hotel would not go back into the set until a full year has passed, i.e. 5 quarters.

Its REVPAR compared to its competitive set is ramping very nicely. So you're looking at a market there where there's been some incremental supply. But the addition of a brand with the cachet and the following now that W has around the world points to the strength of that result. And by the way, now with the strong W in London, we believe we're going to see that much more outbound demand for W from the U.K. in some of the markets where people go.

If you've been following Aloft, you'll know that the first one opened less than 3 years ago.  We'll come on that in a couple of months here.  And yet the brand overall is ramping up to a point where it's very close to REVPAR numbers with its key competitors. And so we think again the reason for that quite simply is, Aloft is to the specialty select business in many respects where W has been on the luxury side. And what was, I think, so interesting about our experience with W over the years, is here's a brand that began as a conversion brand for 3- to 4-star properties and a new type of environment and it literally got pulled into the luxury space. Now I'm not going to suggest that we're hoping for Aloft to get pulled into the upper upscale segment of the business, but we do think that because of its cachet, because of its attitude, because of its design positioning and, by the way, because of all these things together, not just one of those things, this brand has vitality that I think is going to sustain our franchise growth over time.

Group business, now we're seeing rate increases, and we're going to continue to be aggressive in pushing forward rate increases as we get some of the higher-rated corporate group back into the mix. Frits has talked a lot about corporate rates, and corporate rates were down close to 20% from peak levels. We're clawing some of that back this year with the increases that we negotiated, and we would expect that over the coming years as well. When you look at the lower-rated channels, OTA, our business with OTA has probably peaked at 5% to 6% of room nights. Whereas when you went back to 2007, that number was closer to 2% to 3%. So there's several percentage points that we can gain by moving to our own higher-margin distribution channels instead of using the OTAs. And our business with government is relatively small. Call it just under 3%, and at the prior peak, that was probably 1% to 2%. So there is some room to grow there from a mix standpoint.

Following the format of previous calls, I'll start with our take on the current business environment, the highlights of our Q2 results followed by our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll",3440,"Thank you, Jay, and thanks all for joining us on our call today. Following the format of previous calls, I'll start with our take on the current business environment, the highlights of our Q2 results followed by our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll close with some thoughts on the month we spent in China. 
Here's how we see the business environment. Like many of you, we find ourselves once again looking at an uncertain global economy. As euro rose, our net with stopgap accords, worries grow at a real estate bubble in China, social unrest woes in the Arab world and U.S. lawmakers play at fiscal brinksmanship. 
Reading headlines, it's easy to feel skittish about the near term.  And to be sure, there are many factors that could upend this recovery. At the same time though, from our vantage point, drivers of our business paint a more robust picture. At least for now, trouble spots are contained while underlying growth and demand for travel continues to build. 
Developers in many markets around the world are eager to invest in hotel projects. This reflects both their confidence and their access to capital. Our biggest customers: global corporations, professional firms, growth companies and high-income individuals are telling us that they have earnings power and little debt. And perhaps most importantly, our customers are busy and look to stay busy. This has led us to conclude that the recovery continues to play out as a tale of 2 cities. We've known for a while that emerging markets are growing fast while developed ones are languishing. But the split is increasingly clear even within developed markets. Times are good for successful companies and highly skilled individuals. For companies with looming debt maturities and for people out of work, the crisis lingers. 
On a global level, this tale of 2 cities that persists is not healthy for any of us. But for our business today, it explains why tepid U.S. economic growth and persistent high unemployment have not dampened our own business momentum. 
I'm making this point for 2 reasons: first, to address the observation that our stock fluctuates in the short term based on day-to-day sentiments about the state of the world, without considering whether our core customers are going to be affected; and second, our conviction that the value of our company is set to rise with an unprecedented and seemingly unstoppable growth in the ranks of a new class of affluent global business and leisure travelers. This major secular trend will continue to fuel demand for our brands well into the future. 
And it's this second point of economic growth that prompted us to move our leadership team to China for part of the summer. More about that in a few minutes. But our time there has left us as bullish as ever about our long-term growth prospects in China and other rising markets around the globe. 
As a company, we're confident that we have the right foundation for realizing this growth. We've talked before about our global brands and local smart teams. Less well known outside of our company is that we've created a corporate culture that has a global perspective, a collaborative style and alignment around our direction. 
I should also add that during the financial crisis, we weren't just cutting costs and reducing debt. We were also busy launching a slate of initiatives and at boosting our performance in these growth markets. Today, we're 2 years into realizing the benefits of those efforts. 
So in that context, let me walk you through our Q2 results and recent trends. We continue to see strong demand around the world. I'm happy to report that worldwide fees grew 14%, driven by REVPAR up 8%. As expected, rate and occupancy now contribute equally to REVPAR growth. This is typical for an early stage recovery. Occupancies have now reached the point where we expect rates to rise further. And as you'd expect, higher revenues mean higher margins. Worldwide Company-Operated Hotel margins expanded by 90 basis points. 
As we look around the world, the 2 main trouble spots are Japan and parts of the Arab world. Excluding these regions, worldwide REVPAR increased 10% and margins widened by 140 basis points. REVPAR outside of North America grew at 7% in constant dollars or 11% excluding Japan, North America and the Middle East. 
Latin America was our fastest growing region, with REVPAR up 17%, and our Mexican resorts are showing signs of growing confidence among travelers. Europe performed well despite the sovereign debt circus. Our REVPAR growth was 12%, thanks to strong corporate and leisure demand and no new supply to speak of. 
We're also encouraged by our results in Asia, even if overall REVPAR was up a modest 7%. That growth was on top of last year's 28% jump, driven in part by the World Expo in Shanghai. Outside of Japan and Shanghai, Asia Pacific's REVPAR grew 16%. 
North America delivered 9% REVPAR growth, and our focus on margins is paying off with an increase of 170 basis points in the second quarter. Year-to-date, North American margins have expanded 180 basis points and REVPAR has grown 10%. 
Finally, our worldwide portfolio of owned hotels delivered REVPAR growth of almost 13% and margins expanded 225 basis points. 
These results show that our brand-led approach is paying off. Each brand has a distinct positioning that appeals to a different traveler or travel location. Collectively, our brands benefit toward to grow SPG, to upgrade revenue management and to improve our sales effectiveness. The result is the eighth quarter in a row of REVPAR index growth, up 250 basis points in North America and 170 basis points worldwide. 
We've been talking for a while about the momentum of Sheraton, which once again posted record high guest satisfaction scores and drove REVPAR increases. Year-to-date, REVPAR index for Sheraton North America is up another 210 basis points. 
Our outlook for the rest of the year foresees more brand-led success. Group pace for 2011 is up, even as booking windows are lengthening and rate trends are very encouraging. Rates on newly-booked business for 2012 are up 9% and for beyond 2012, up 12%. Business transient trends continue to point to a travel-intensive recovery. Banks and corporations are high in profits and low in debt. Professional service businesses have record backlogs, tech companies are booming and global businesses are benefiting from the robust growth in emerging markets. So it's no surprise that business transient revenue is up 9%, with rate up 6%. 
Transient revenue booking pace through September, by the way, is up double digits. So with supply already tight in the U.S. and Europe, we foresee strong rate increases, not just for the rest of this year, but also for corporate rate negotiations for next year. 
And finally, our leisure business is doing quite well as high-end guests better in the economy as a whole. The strength of our business will mean less inventory sold through costly channels such as OTAs. Our leisure business for the remainder of the year will build on the second quarter's 7% price increases and 12% revenue growth. 
Before I wrap up on my remarks for the quarter, let me call your attention to our Vacation Ownership business. flows steadily improved up 4%, and for the first time in nearly 4 years, realized price increased. Our Vacation Ownership team continues to do a stellar job driving sales and generating cash from the business. We expect more of the same for the coming years. 
In summary, for Q2, we beat the high end of EBITDA expectations by $7 million and EPS by $0.04, and that despite continued pressures in Japan and Northern Africa. Our outlook for the rest of 2011 is robust with solid group and transient pace and with good prospects for rate and margin.  In line with our baseline scenario, we expect REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2012. We're sticking to our 2011 EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion. And I should add that, that's in spite of asset sales, which will reduce full year EBITDA by about $20 million. We're also raising our EPS range to $1.67 to $1.77. Vasant, of course, will provide more details on our outlook and asset sales in a few minutes. 
But before I hand over to Vasant, I'd like to share some thoughts on the month our leadership team spent in China. Since returning, I've been asked many times what surprised me most, and the answer is easy. I had no idea there would be so much media attention. In retrospect, I guess it makes sense. For many global businesses and journalists, the Chinese market is a huge phenomenon. Our move and the success of our business there makes for a compelling story. 
It also seemed that many Chinese were keen to see how our move highlighted the importance of their market. Being in China, we were all struck once again by the rate and scale of change. A few stand out among our site business, our largest hotel, the 4,000-room Sheraton in Macau, our highest hotel, the St. Regis in Lhasa at nearly 4,000 meters and our tallest hotel, the St. Regis in Shenzhen. 
The Shenzhen for me was especially an eye-opener. It reminded me of when I first came to Hong Kong in 1986. Back then, the cityscape stood in stark contrast to the tiny fishing village with Shenzhen. From our 100-story purchase at the St. Regis, it was hard now not to think that the tables had turned, with in China in 2011 looking decidedly more modern. 
But I should emphasize our goal in coming to China was not for publicity nor was it to arrive at some blazing new insight. My colleagues and I have been going to China many times. We were there to deepen our dialogue with our leadership team and to add to our sort of shared experiences. This dialogue makes for better decisions and better global support to our local team as the business grows, which reminds me, when I was asked about my motivation for going to China, it reminded me with the Gangster with a Southern said when he was asked why he robbed banks and he replied, ""Because that's where the money is."" For our case, that's where the growth is, and the growth continues to be spectacular. 
More to the point, this decade represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, not just to grow but to shape the market. We have 75 hotels in operation in China and nearly 100 more under construction. It's rare that any country has more hotels in the pipeline than in its existing footprint, but it's unprecedented for this to be happening in our second largest country. 
Many people don't realize that already today, the number of domestic and international trips taken in China is roughly equal to those in the U.S. But in China, travel's growing at 15% to 20% a year, and there's only a fraction of the high-end hotels needed to serve this growth. Even after we open the next 100 hotels in China, our total number of hotels will be about 1/3 the size of our U.S. footprint. 
And by the way, Sheraton continues to lead our footprint in our growth in China, accounting for over 1/2 of our pipeline. China's -- excuse, Sheraton's footprint will more than double over the next 3 years. Westin at Four Points by Sheraton will make up another quarter of our growth. Four Points enjoys its association with Sheraton, and Westin's trajectory builds on its successful launch of major cities several years ago. 
For many luxury brands, from handbags to champagne, China's already the world's largest market. With 9 St. Regis hotels in the pipeline, in a few years, China could well be the largest market for that brand as well. Luxury consumption is evolving quickly China. Like other developing markets, consumers first tend to luxury brands as a sign of status. But people are increasingly seeing luxury defined what they themselves choose to enjoy during their free time.  And some travelers would choose to collect the indigenous experiences we offer through Luxury Collection. Others will seek informal contemporary feel of W. 
Our first Luxury Collection Hotel opened last year in Tianjin, and the first W would open in Guangzhou early next year. The distinct personalities of these brands, meaning that all 3 can thrive side-by-side, each appealing to a different type of high-end traveler. 
Another aspect of the growth in China is that it's spreading beyond the major markets to the so-called second and third tier cities. In fact, over 80% of our hotels are being built in the roughly 170 such cities, each with populations of more than 1 million. We're often asked whether this rapid growth will lead to temporary overcapacity.  And no doubt, there'll be some wrenching adjustments as supply and demand move in and out of balance. That said, our occupancies are above last year, and we've been careful in selecting the right partners and the right locations.  
And as another 300 million people move from the countryside into cities over the next 10 to 15 years, today's overcapacity will be tomorrow's needed supply. Take Beijing, for example. Post-Olympics in '08, there was plenty of talk about excess supply. Fast-forward to today year-to-date, REVPAR in Beijing is up 21% and new hotels are once again coming onstream. 
We'll take Shanghai. Where else in the world would you see flat REVPAR the year following a World Expo? So this growth is why even in the dark days of 2009, we were building out our leadership teams in growth markets like China. As a result, today, we have the foundation to triple the number of associates over the next 5 years in China to the 90,000 we'll be needing. 
But now, let me return to my earlier point about why having a dialogue and working in support of our local leadership teams is so vital to our growth. To do that, I'll walk you through a number of examples of what we mean by this. Nearly 4 years ago, during my first Starwood visit to China, we discussed our SPG strategy, which up until then, had been tailored -- had not been tailored to local Chinese travelers. We decided then to translate more collateral signage, train associates in a rolling guest in Chinese and maybe most importantly, adapt the program benefits including tie-ins to food and beverage. Today, the program drives over 50% of our occupancy on the heels of a 71% jump in enrollment in 2010. China's our biggest SPG market outside of North America. 
On a subsequent visit, we developed another foundation for our growth. With about 60% of our guests in China being local nationals, we all decided it was time to open a call center in-country. In the midst of the 2009 crisis, we opened what is now the largest call center for any global hotel company.  And we're also learning that, that call center is a great launch pad for promotions and for developing talent for our operations.  
And then there's our website. Consider this: What if Starwood were a Chinese company and in the U.S., you were booking a vacation through our website? The web pages would begin in English but the moment you would click to make a reservation, suddenly all you saw was Chinese. Sounds crazy but that's basically what global lodging companies have been doing to Chinese consumers, starting in Chinese and then switching to English.  Today's -- today, ours is the only website of its kind where Chinese guests can book start to finish in Chinese. 
Most importantly or most recently, we also turned our focus to the outbound Chinese traveler. This outbound opportunity is the third stage in what we've been calling the outpost of outbound transformation of our business. Our first hotels in China were outposts for Western travelers. Today, our business is mostly Chinese.  And now we're seeing the rise in the Chinese outbound travelers. The same is true, by the way, for knowledge transfer. We used to bring know-how into China but more and more, we're taking best practices from China and sharing them with other markets. 
So getting back to the outbound travelers but remind you that hear again, China's already about the same size of the U.S., roughly 50 million trips. But this number has grown fivefold since 2010, and Beijing is now the world's second busiest airport. 
Looking ahead, estimates are that each year, there will be 25 million Chinese traveling for the first time outside of their home country. And so that's why in close consultation with our team in China, we've launched our Chinese personalized travel program in 19 gateway cities, including New York, Mexico City and Paris. The goal is simple, bring the comforts of our home to our Chinese traveler when they stay abroad with us. The program includes language specialists, local welcome packets in Chinese, in-room amenities, not to mention special menus.  And we're expanding the program to other hotels around the world. 
These are a few important examples of what we mean by better dialogue and working together to support growth. Over the past 25 years, we built what we believe to be the best local smart team in the industry. Supporting local teams is what gives Starwood the edge not just in China but in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and other markets around Asia. 
Here's one way to think about how this edge translates into results. According to Smith Travel in China during 2010, Starwood opened 15 upper upscale and luxury hotels, over twice as many as Marriott and 5x as many as Hilton. In fact, globally, we opened 47 upper upscale and luxury hotels in 2010 versus 39 for Marriott, 22 for Hilton and 11 for Hyatt. So when we talk about our pipeline, we intend to realize it. And we've all read headlines in our industry about mega development deals in emerging markets that have fizzled. 
Less apparent than the headlines though is the quality of our growth. Our pipeline is strong -- so strong today that we don't feel the need to impress investors, present or future, with projected deals that won't stand the test of time. For example, we won't sign a deal if the economics compromise the integrity of our existing contracts, and we won't buy deals with exorbitant key money.  We'll walk away from the deal that's not right for our brands or if the partner is not right for the long term. 
Moreover, we have a branded strategy so we won't sell our distribution without a brand. We believe that generic distribution is not fair to owners who invest with us to build their brands. Understandably, owners wouldn't want us to open a low-cost generic hotel that undermines one of our branded hotels next door. In short, we're staying close to our local teams, and it gives us the knowledge and discipline to be selective in our development. 
As I look back on it, the time we invested with our team in China will certainly pay off. We were thrilled to join their discussions in strategy, marketing, sales, new deals and developing talent. The familiarity gives us a way to reach across cultural differences and to talk in shorthand. I'm confident that as we brace for more growth, our joint decisions and judgment calls will benefit from our shared experiences. 
So I hope this gives you a better sense of why we went to China, and we return all the more convinced of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that emerging markets represent around the world. Never before have 3 billion people moved from poverty to prosperity in a single generation. And there are huge ripple effects. Raw material exporters are getting enriched, and in a few years, China will shift from being a net exporter of low-cost labor to a massive importer.  And when that happens, it will jumpstart other countries. 
Think about this. The U.S. took 75 years to industrialize. Japan took 40 and China took only 25. This acceleration will continue in markets like Bangladesh, Vietnam, not to mention parts of Africa. 
So to sum it up, the world really is changing like never before, and the way we see, it's changing in our favor with so many new travelers who want our brands. The only thing that keeps me up at night, the fear of not fully seizing this moment.  And so with that, let me turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,136707027,147725,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter with EBITDA up 16% and EPS up 43%. We exceeded the high end of our expectations by $7 million despite the sale of 3 large hotels which resulted in lost EBITDA of around $5 millio",1945,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter with EBITDA up 16% and EPS up 43%. We exceeded the high end of our expectations by $7 million despite the sale of 3 large hotels which resulted in lost EBITDA of around $5 million in the quarter. These results were once again driven by the power of our brand portfolio, which gained 250 basis points of REVPAR index in North America, our revenue and cost management programs, which delivered industry-leading margin improvements of 170 basis points that come from operated hotels in North America and continued tight control of SG&A, which declined by 4.3% in the quarter. 
Asset sales and operating cash flow increased our cash balance to over $1 billion and reduced our net debt by almost $400 million. We have maintained the outlook range we first provided late last year despite a $25 million to $30 million EBITDA hit from the unexpected events in North Africa and Japan and an additional $20 million in lost EBITDA from asset sales completed in Q2 which were not included in our outlook. In other words, our core continuing business is performing better than we projected at the start of the year. I'll provide some more color on business trends around the world and on our outlook for the year. 
North American owned REVPAR was up double digits, with occupancy exceeding levels reached at 2008 peaks. Tight cost controls converted this revenue growth into strong EBITDA growth with owned EBITDA margins up over 250 basis points. System-wide REVPAR was also up strongly, with Sheraton up 7% and Westin up 10%, handily outperforming the competitors once again. 
Our Luxury brands continued their industry-leading performance with W up almost 14% and St. Regis up almost 16%. At this point, there is no discernible impact on our business from the much discussed soft patch in the U.S. economy or the debt limit shenanigans in Washington. 
Transient revenue pace both corporate and leisure is up double digits in Q3. Leads are up, group pace is gaining steam and booking windows are lengthening. So far in July, the momentum of the second quarter has been sustained. As we've said before, rate is the make or break variable this year. Rate trends are improving as occupancies enter the 70s. Like you, we remain on high alert for any signs of a change in trend. Since we do not see any evidence of that, our outlook assumes the normal cyclical recovery we have been experiencing in lodging will continue. 
The euro crisis has not impacted our business so far in Europe, which is one of our strongest regions in the quarter. In local currencies, system REVPAR in Europe was up 12%. Rate was up 5.1% and occupancy is up 4.5 points. Our owned hotels did even better, up 18%, with rate up 10% and occupancies hitting 87% in June. Once again, good cost control delivered EBITDA margin increases of 350 basis points. Italy and Spain REVPAR were up 20%, France was even stronger, U.K. and Australia grew double digits. German results were in line with what we expected given their biannual convention calendar. 
As in the U.S., no change in momentum is evident as we entered the third quarter. Africa and Middle East REVPAR was down 7% impacted by the political turmoil across the region. By and large, there is no improvement in sight. Syria was down 80%, Bahrain, down 65%; Egypt, minus 50%; and Jordan, down 26%. The Gulf continues to work through oversupply issues while Saudi Arabia remains on track. The full year impact of North Africa we had provided you in April remains unchanged. The situation is playing out as we had forecast, neither materially better nor worse. The more significant impact to softness in Middle East and Africa is in our incentive fees. 
Asian REVPAR grew 7% in local currency despite lapping the World Expo in Shanghai last year and the issues in Japan this year. With over 60,000 rooms open at the end of Q2, Asia has now overtaken our Europe, Africa, Middle East division to become our second largest after North America with a growth trajectory that will double its size again over the next 5 years. And as you heard from Frits, our China business is on track to triple in 5 years. 
Strong REVPAR growth testifies to the fact that demand continues to grow faster than supply in Asia. India was up 9%, South Korea and Indonesia up 11%, Australia, up 10%; Thailand, lapping last year's troubles up 47% and China, x Shanghai up 12%. Japan was down 22%. The recovery from the earthquake is slow. The full year impact of the Japanese earthquake tsunami remains unchanged from what we provided you in April. 
Latin America was our fastest growing region in Q2, clocking in at 17%. We experienced some extraordinary growth in Peru, up 60%; Brazil, plus 45%; and Chile, up 32%. The cities in Mexico were strong while the results are starting to improve with group business beginning to come back. 
Finally, our Vacation Ownership business performed as expected. Flows while close rates are stable. Mix management is improving price realization. Default rates continue to improve and are now back to 2007 levels. We expect these trends to continue. We remain focused on cash flow generation with a securitization planned in the fourth quarter. SVO will generate over $150 million in cash this year and over $700 million in total in the last 3 years. 
Our SG&A declined in the quarter. This is partially due to lapping incentive compensation accruals from last year. We also had some legal expenses last year. These positives were offset by higher costs of non-U.S. overhead due to the weak dollar. For the year, we continue to expect a 4% to 5% increase. 
Moving on to our outlook. We assume the normal cyclical lodging recovery continues in the second half. As such, our outlook remains unchanged from what we provided at the start of the year. It is important to highlight 2 major negatives we have absorbed since then. In April, we estimated a $25 million to $30 million full year impact from the unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and left our outlook unchanged. Now we're absorbing an additional $20 million from the sale of 3 large hotels in Q2 while leaving our outlook unchanged again. 
As such, we're offsetting almost $50 million in EBITDA, thanks to better-than-expected performance in our core continuing business, particularly at our owned hotels worldwide from strength across Asia and helped by a weak dollar. That said, we are more comfortable with the middle of the EBITDA outlook range rather than the high end than many of your estimates currently are. All other metrics, REVPAR growth, owned margin improvement, SVO and SG&A remain unchanged. Free growth ticks up due to a weaker dollar. EPS is higher from lower depreciation and interest expenses, partly as a result of the accretive asset sales. 
A point on our owned EBITDA. It is lower in Q2 than you may have expected. Owned EBITDA as reported was up 8%. If you adjust for asset sales, EBITDA growth was 16%. The same-store sales actually grew 28%. Non-Same-Store results were negatively impacted by some large renovations like the Sheraton Kuwait, The Grand in Florence and the Hotel Alfonso in Serbia, also by the earthquake impact in the St. Regis in Osaka and the new W Leicester Square in London which is still ramping up. In total, asset sales in Osaka reduced 2011 owned EBITDA by approximately $25 million. These factors will make total owned EBITDA not quite as high as the projection based on Same-Store REVPAR growth and margin improvement might lead you to. 
On the fee front, North Africa in Japan hurt 2011 management fees by as much as $18 million or a reduction of almost 300 basis points in year-over-year fee growth. 2/3 of the impact is on incentive fees and more significantly in the fourth quarter than these fees were anticipated. As such, our Q4 fee growth rate will be lower than the trend we have seen in the first 3 quarters. Some of this impact is offset by favorable currency translation due to the weak dollar, a 200 basis point positive for the year. As you know, only about 40% of our fees are earned in the U.S. 
The remaining impact of Japan is on the unconsolidated joint venture line, roughly $7 million in 2011, since we've written off our investment in the Sheraton Grand Tokyo Bay. Through June, we opened 34 hotels and remain on track to open 70 to 80 hotels in 2011. Last year, we opened more luxury and upper upscale rooms globally than any other hotel company and hope to repeat that this year too. As Frits indicated, we are focused on signing high-quality contracts with great long-term owners. This ensures both a healthy fee stream and a very high probability that deals we sign actually open with an owned brand hotel. The signing pace is picking up, and the pipeline is growing again. 85% of our 90,000-room pipeline is outside North America, and 75% of the rooms are in the high-fee luxury and Upper Upscale segments. 
We sold the Westin Gaslamp and the W Chicago Center in Q2. In the case of the Gaslamp, the spent $23 million to complete a full renovation that we had started. We also sold our interest in the Boston Park Plaza, a consolidated joint venture hotel. This is a 941-room hotel that was unbranded and in need of significant capital. We've been working with our partner to explore options for years. The hotel was a legacy investment from Starwood's REIT days. We're happy to have finally exited this venture on mutually acceptable terms. In total, these asset sales generated $281 million in cash and $57 million in debt reduction. EBITDA lost in 2011 will be $20 million and $23 million on an annualized basis. 
After the asset sales, our net debt is $400 million lower and stands at $1.74 billion. Cash in excess of working capital needs is almost $1 billion. We intend to use cash on hand to pay down debt maturing in 2012 as we work towards a solid BBB investment grade rating. Our priorities for cash deployment remain reinvesting in our business to drive growth, reducing our debt to target levels, and of course, returning cash to shareholders as we did in the last cycle. 
At Bal Harbour, construction is proceeding on schedule. We're also on track to receive our TCO in Q4. Our plan is to start closings in November. Meanwhile, the sales pace is good this year, particularly from Latin American buyers. Square foot rates realized on new sales are at precrisis levels and deposits are much higher, more than 40%. We expect that there will be revenue profits and cash from Bal Harbour in the fourth quarter as we start closings, which are not currently in our outlook. We will provide you our best estimates when we talk again in October. 
In summary, a normal cyclical recovery in lodging continues around the globe followed by extraordinary demand growth in emerging markets and record low supply growth in developed markets. As always, there are many results there that could derail this recovery: The euro debt crisis damaging key European economies, the debt reduction debate in the U.S. loan growth, the hardlining in China from efforts to control inflation are, of course, the big ones to watch. So far so good, and we hope it stays that way. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

It's just things they add in like something for the leases and some thing for securitized receivables and so on. Having said that, yes, our ratios are getting to levels, once you comp the cash that would put us where we would like to be. There's also a question on how the cash is counted. Certainly, the rating agencies, this is the way they do today, don't really give you credit for cash in the balance sheet. Net-net, we're on the right track. We expect and this is not something we control but we expect that ratings will move probably towards the end of this year or into next year. And our priority is we have maturities next year, roughly $600 million in public debt, as well as there's some debt on assets which is a small amount, maybe another $50 million or so that can be prepaid. So there's about $615 million in prepayments and in repayments that we can make next year.

Most of the work that we're doing in North America, thanks to the lack of construction heater, is to look at conversions.  And the interesting thing about conversions is they don't generally sit on your pipeline for the years. You saw them and within a much shorter period of time, they become your own brand. And so the pipeline will never look the same as long as you're doing conversion work relative to de novo construction.  And so that gives you a good sense of where the breakout is, and then of course, we continue to look at ways to find better opportunities in North America, especially but also Europe where as demand builds and as there's no construction, we still maintain that there is going to be a day out in the future where rates will be so compelling and financing will finally be available that there will be quite a bit of development.

So the real issue is around vacation ownership. And we've been very clear for some time now about our strategy to be 80% fee-driven and 20% driven by owned real estate, which would include vacation ownership from our perspective. And we do think that as time passes, there will be sufficiently high IRR places for us to invest in the Vacation Ownership business. Although at the same time, we have no expectation that the size of that business will get to anywhere near where it was before the downturn.

And more specifically, as you look at the U.S., the U.S. economy is clearly losing an opportunity to generate economic growth and jobs by turning Chinese away or we're making it too difficult for Chinese, and by the way, travelers from other markets to come to the U.S. As a point of fact, something like 5x as many Chinese today go to Europe has come to the United States.  And if you think about the difference between 2 to 4 weeks to get a visa in your hometown versus 90 days or longer to get a visa having to travel to a different city if you're Chinese, you can imagine why someone would choose to go elsewhere. It also means that when people think about booking conventions or other meetings business, and they know that there will be Chinese people coming, that they don't consider the U.S. as quickly as they otherwise might. So have we been vocal about this? Absolutely. Do the gears of government turn far more slowly and in a much more frustrating ways than the gears of business? Absolutely and I think that's why we're on the business side in our own lives. That said, the good part about our business is we don't just have hotels in the United states.  And so while we would love to generate more jobs in the U.S. and more growth here from that, we are enjoying the growth in Chinese travelers around the world.  And around the announcement of our China personalized travel program, we mentioned some of the triple-figure increases we're seeing in gateway cities around the world and places you'd expect, places like Paris, places like Buenos Aires, places like London.  And so we know the demands there. We also believe that as you look at the distribution of income in China today and the threshold level for people to become high-end travelers, while that economy may grow at let's say 8%, the number of people, the percentage growth in the number of people who cross that threshold grows at a much higher rate. So this is already important business for us but we believe in the coming years, it will be an increasingly important business. And for those of you with longer memories going back to the ways of Japanese tourists, this is a far greater way. You have 10x as many people in China as in Japan. The whole country of Japan would have to have emptied out to equal what we think ultimately will happen once the Chinese become even more active traveling outbound. So short answer, we're very vocal. Second is we see the growth in other markets, and we hope that it comes to the U.S. as well."

In Latin America, certainly the margins are under some pressure also the pressure on the margins has eased a little bit. I think, Jay, the margins may have been down between 100 basis points and 200 basis points in Latin America in Q3. The comparability issues come from 2 factors: the biggest, of course, is asset sales. Second in line is we have 2 hotels in there that are new in the non-Same-Store set, one of the St. Regis Osaka, which suffers not just from being new but also being affected by the earth quake. The second is the W Leicester Square, which is doing very well but just opened in February. And then of course, there's the renovation impact. But I will say the biggest impacts are the newer hotels in there, as well as the asset sales, which does make sort of simple comparisons from what we have in our reported P&L, somewhat harder to do, which is why we try to give you a little bit of a breakdown in our comments today."

We have got deposits already for many of the sales done prior to this year in the 20% range, and then more recently, our deposits have been much higher than that, as I said earlier, more than 40%. We have been contacting people who signed contracts going back to '08, '09, '07, letting them know that we're getting ready for closings. Our indications are very good that the closing rates will be high. There's no way to know until you actually -- you get people to sign on the dotted line and give you the check. Our view is yes, there may be some falloff but close rates are going to be high. The good news is the square footage rates we're selling at right now are at precrisis levels, which means that there isn't sort of recent sales going on -- not recent sales going on that are below prices people paid when they signed up a couple of years ago.  And in terms of square footage, you can find out if you're in the market. It does vary depending upon the units.

When we look at comparisons with precrisis levels, what we look at our units that are truly comparable. And in a building like this where some buyers are buying multiple units, different floor sizes, different floor patterns, for us, there are some art as well as science to seeing what's comparable. So we don't think it's appropriate to throw out an overall number because it then becomes a weighted average of what you're selling. But as we've done the analysis like-for-like with precrisis sales, as Vasant says, we're at the same point. The biggest difference being previously, we were getting 20% deposits and today, we're getting north of 40% and so that tells us 2 things: First of all, people really want to buy, and second of all, the 40% deposit on  $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $5 million purchase is a serious transaction and something not done speculatively. So we feel very good about certainty the sales of light and given the strength in the market, I feel better and better about the sales from before."

So '06, '07, when the market was frothy, many things were selling and selling at extraordinary prices in great volume. The market was off 90% as we went into the crisis.  And so we've definitely seen a pickup in volume, but that pickup in volume still leaves us with a transaction pace that's still south of certainly 1/2 and more and more like 30% or 40% of where it was. But that said, it continues to build.  And so we are seeing more buyers, not just from well-capitalized REITs, who've been the most active buyers of light but we continue to see more interest from high net worth individuals and sovereign wealth funds. But I don't think that the transaction market today is anywhere near where it will be once this recovery is fully underway, and that's one of the reasons that we continue to take assets to market, but we don't feel that this is the right time to be considering a much more substantial asset sales. We think the buyer into the market has to be much deeper than where it is now. We'd see the right trends. Exactly when that will happen, I think, is not something I'm ready to speculate on.

Following the format of previous calls, I'll start with our take on the current business environment, the highlights of our Q2 results, followed by our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll",3451,"Thank you, Jay, and thanks all for joining us on our call today. Following the format of previous calls, I'll start with our take on the current business environment, the highlights of our Q2 results, followed by our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll close with some thoughts on the month we spent in China. 
Here's how we see the business environment. Like many of you, we find ourselves once again looking at an uncertain global economy. As euro rose, our net with stopgap accords, worries grow at a real estate bubble in China. Social unrest woes in the Arab world and U.S. lawmakers play at fiscal brinksmanship. 
Reading headlines, it's easy to feel skittish about the near term.  And to be sure, there are many factors that could upend this recovery. At the same time though, from our vantage point, drivers of our business paint a more robust picture. At least for now, trouble spots are contained while underlying growth and demand for travel continues to build. 
Developers in many markets around the world are eager to invest in hotel projects. This reflects both their confidence and their access to capital. Our biggest customers: global corporations, professional firms, growth companies and high-income individuals are telling us that they have earnings power and little debt. And perhaps most importantly, our customers are busy and look to stay busy. This has led us to conclude that the recovery continues to play out as a tale of 2 cities. We've known for a while that emerging markets are growing fast while developed ones are languishing. But the split is increasingly clear even within developed markets. Times are good for successful companies and highly skilled individuals. For companies with looming debt maturities and for people out of work, the crisis lingers. 
On a global level, this tale of 2 cities that persists is not healthy for any of us. But for our business today, it explains why tepid U.S. economic growth and persistent high unemployment have not dampened our own business momentum. 
I'm making this point for 2 reasons: first, to address the observation that our stock fluctuates in the short term, based on day-to-day sentiments about the state of the world, without considering whether our core customers are going to be affected; and second, our conviction that the value of our company is set to rise with an unprecedented and seemingly unstoppable growth in the ranks of a new class of affluent global business and leisure travelers. This major secular trend will continue to fuel demand for our brands well into the future. 
And it's this second point on economic growth that prompted us to move our leadership team to China for part of the summer. More about that in a few minutes. But our time there has left us as bullish as ever about our long-term growth prospects in China and other rising markets around the globe. 
As a company, we're confident that we have the right foundation for realizing this growth. We've talked before about our global brands and local smart teams. Less well known outside of our company is that we've created a corporate culture that has a global perspective, a collaborative style and alignment around our direction. 
I should also add that during the financial crisis, we weren't just cutting costs and reducing debt. We were also busy launching a slate of initiatives aimed at boosting our performance in these growth markets. Today, we're 2 years into realizing the benefits of those efforts. 
So in that context, let me walk you through our Q2 results and recent trends. We continue to see strong demand around the world. I'm happy to report that worldwide fees grew 14%, driven by REVPAR up 8%. As expected, rate and occupancy now contribute equally to REVPAR growth. This is typical for an early stage recovery. Occupancies have now reached the point where we expect rates to rise further. And as you'd expect, higher revenues mean higher margins. Worldwide Company-Operated Hotel margins expanded by 90 basis points. 
As we look around the world, the 2 main trouble spots are Japan and parts of the Arab world. Excluding these regions, worldwide REVPAR increased 10% and margins widened by 140 basis points. REVPAR outside of North America grew at 7% in constant dollars or 11% excluding Japan, North America and the Middle East. 
Latin America was our fastest growing region with REVPAR up 17%. And our Mexican resorts are showing signs of growing confidence among travelers. Europe performed well despite the sovereign debt circus. Our REVPAR growth was 12%, thanks to strong corporate and leisure demand and no new supply to speak of. 
We're also encouraged by our results in Asia, even if overall REVPAR was up a modest 7%. That growth was on top of last year's 28% jump, driven in part by the World Expo in Shanghai. Outside of Japan and Shanghai, Asia Pacific's REVPAR grew 16%. 
North America delivered 9% REVPAR growth, and our focus on margins is paying off with an increase of 170 basis points in the second quarter. Year-to-date, North American margins have expanded 180 basis points and REVPAR has grown 10%. 
Finally, our worldwide portfolio of owned hotels delivered REVPAR growth of almost 13%, and margins expanded 225 basis points. 
These results show that our brand-led approach is paying off. Each brand has a distinct positioning that appeals to a different traveler or travel location. Collectively, our brands benefit from our work to grow SPG, to upgrade revenue management and to improve our sales effectiveness. The result is the eighth quarter in a row of REVPAR index growth, up 250 basis points in North America and 170 basis points worldwide. 
We've been talking for a while about the momentum of Sheraton, which once again posted record high guest satisfaction scores and drove REVPAR increases. Year-to-date, REVPAR index for Sheraton North America is up another 210 basis points. 
Our outlook for the rest of the year foresees more brand-led success. Group pace for 2011 is up, even as booking windows are lengthening, and rate trends are very encouraging. Rates on newly-booked business for 2012 are up 9%, and for beyond 2012, up 12%. Business transient trends continue to point to a travel-intensive recovery. Banks and corporations are high in profits and low in debt. Professional service businesses have record backlogs, tech companies are booming and global businesses are benefiting from the robust growth in emerging markets. So it's no surprise that business transient revenue is up 9%, with rate up 6%. 
Transient revenue booking pace through September, by the way, is up double digits. So with supply already tight in the U.S. and Europe, we foresee strong rate increases, not just for the rest of this year, but also for corporate rate negotiations for next year. 
And finally, our leisure business is doing quite well as high-end guests spare better than the economy as a whole. The strength of our business will mean less inventory sold through costly channels such as OTAs. Our leisure business for the remainder of the year will build on the second quarter's 7% price increases and 12% revenue growth. 
Before I wrap up on my remarks for the quarter, let me call your attention to our Vacation Ownership business to where flows steadily improved up 4%, and for the first time in nearly 4 years, realized price increased. Our Vacation Ownership team continues to do a stellar job driving sales and generating cash from the business. We expect more of the same for the coming years. 
In summary, for Q2, we beat the high end of EBITDA expectations by $7 million and EPS by $0.04, and that despite continued pressures in Japan and Northern Africa. Our outlook for the rest of 2011 is robust with solid group and transient pace and with good prospects for rate and margin.  In line with our baseline scenario, we expect REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2012. We're sticking to our 2011 EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion. And I should add that, that's in spite of asset sales, which will reduce full year EBITDA by about $20 million. We're also raising our EPS range to $1.67 to $1.77. Vasant, of course, will provide more details on our outlook and asset sales in a few minutes. 
But before I hand over to Vasant, I'd like to share some thoughts on the month our leadership team spent in China. Since returning, I've been asked many times what surprised me most, and the answer is easy. I had no idea there would be so much media attention. In retrospect, I guess it makes sense. For many global businesses and journalists, the Chinese market is a huge phenomenon. Our move and the success of our business there makes for a compelling story. 
It also seemed that many Chinese were keen to see how our move highlighted the importance of their market. Being in China, we were all struck once again by the rate and scale of change. A few superlative stand out among our site business, our largest hotel, the 4,000-room Sheraton in Macau, our highest hotel, the St. Regis in Lhasa at nearly 4,000 meters and our tallest hotel, the St. Regis in Shenzhen. 
The Shenzhen for me was especially an eyeopener. It reminded me of when I first came to Hong Kong in 1986. Back then, the cityscape stood in stark contrast to the tiny fishing village with Shenzhen. From our 100-story perch at the St. Regis, it was hard now not to think that the tables had turned, with Mainland China in 2011 looking decidedly more modern. 
But I should emphasize our goal in coming to China was not for publicity nor was it to arrive at some blazing new insight. My colleagues and I have been going to China many times. We were there to deepen our dialogue with our leadership team and to add to our set of shared experiences. This dialogue makes for better decisions and better global support to our local team as the business grows, which reminds me, when I was asked about my motivation for going to China, it reminded me of what the gangster Willie Sutton said when he was asked why he robbed banks. And he replied, ""Because that's where the money is."" For our case, that's where the growth is, and the growth continues to be spectacular. 
More to the point, this decade represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, not just to grow, but to shape the market. We have 75 hotels in operation in China and nearly 100 more under construction. It's rare that any country has more hotels in the pipeline than in its existing footprint. But it's unprecedented for this to be happening in our second largest country. 
Many people don't realize that already today, the number of domestic and international trips taken in China is roughly equal to those in the U.S. But in China, travel's growing at 15% to 20% a year, and there's only a fraction of the high-end hotels needed to serve this growth. Even after we open the next 100 hotels in China, our total number of hotels will be about 1/3 the size of our U.S. footprint. 
And by the way, Sheraton continues to lead our footprint in our growth in China, accounting for over 1/2 of our pipeline. China's -- excuse me, Sheraton's footprint will more than double over the next 3 years. Westin and Four Points by Sheraton will make up another quarter of our growth. Four Points enjoys its association with Sheraton, and Westin's trajectory builds on its successful launch in major cities several years ago. 
For many luxury brands, from handbags to champagne, China's already the world's largest market. With 9 St. Regis hotels in the pipeline, in a few years, China could well be the largest market for that brand as well. Luxury consumption is evolving quickly in China. Like other developing markets, consumers first tend to luxury brands as a sign of status. But people are increasingly seeing luxury defined what they themselves choose to enjoy during their free time.  And some travelers would choose to collect the indigenous experiences we offer through Luxury Collection. Others will seek the informal contemporary feel of W. 
Our first Luxury Collection hotel opened last year in Tian Jin, and the first W will open in Guangzhou early next year. The distinct personalities of these brands mean that all 3 can thrive side-by-side, each appealing to a different type of high-end traveler. 
Another aspect of the growth in China is that it's spreading beyond the major markets to the so-called second- and third-tier cities. In fact, over 80% of our hotels are being built in the roughly 170 such cities, each with populations of more than 1 million. We're often asked whether this rapid growth will lead to temporary overcapacity.  And no doubt, there will be some wrenching adjustments as supply and demand move in and out of balance. That said, our occupancies are above last year, and we've been careful in selecting the right partners and the right locations.  
And as another 300 million people move from the countryside into cities over the next 10 to 15 years, today's overcapacity will be tomorrow's needed supply. Take Beijing, for example. Post-Olympics in '08, there was plenty of talk about excess supply. Fast-forward to today, year-to-date REVPAR in Beijing is up 21% and new hotels are once again coming onstream. 
We'll take Shanghai. Where else in the world would you see flat REVPAR the year following a World Expo? So this growth is why even in the dark days of 2009, we were building out our leadership teams in growth markets like China. As a result, today, we have the foundation to triple the number of associates over the next 5 years in China to the 90,000 we'll be needing. 
But now, let me return to my earlier point about why having a dialogue and working in support of our local leadership teams is so vital to our growth. To do that, I'll walk you through a number of examples of what we mean by this. Nearly 4 years ago, during my first Starwood visit to China, we discussed our SPG strategy, which up until then, had been tailored -- had not been tailored to local Chinese travelers. We decided then to translate more collateral signage, train associates in enrolling guests in Chinese and maybe most importantly, adapt the program benefits, including tie-ins to food and beverage. Today, the program drives over 50% of our occupancy on the heels of a 71% jump in enrollment in 2010. China's our biggest SPG market outside of North America. 
On a subsequent visit, we developed another foundation for our growth. With about 60% of our guests in China being local nationals, we all decided it was time to open a call center in-country. In the midst of the 2009 crisis, we opened what is now the largest call center for any global hotel company.  And we're also learning that, that call center is a great launch pad for promotions and for developing talent for our operations.  
And then there's our website. Consider this: What if Starwood were a Chinese company, and in the U.S., you were booking a vacation through our website? The web pages would begin in English, but the moment you would click to make a reservation, suddenly all you saw was Chinese. Sounds crazy, but that's basically what global lodging companies have been doing to Chinese consumers, starting in Chinese and then switching to English.  Today's -- today, ours is the only website of its kind where Chinese guests can book start to finish in Chinese. 
Most importantly or most recently, we also turned our focus to the outbound Chinese traveler. This outbound opportunity is the third stage in what we've been calling the outpost to outbound transformation of our business. Our first hotels in China were outposts for Western travelers. Today, our business is mostly Chinese.  And now we're seeing the rise in the Chinese outbound travelers. The same is true, by the way, for knowledge transfer. We used to bring know-how into China, but more and more, we're taking best practices from China and sharing them with other markets. 
So getting back to the outbound travelers, but remind you that here again, China's already about the same size as the U.S., roughly 50 million trips. But this number has grown fivefold since 2000, and Beijing is now the world's second busiest airport. 
Looking ahead, estimates are that each year, there will be 25 million Chinese traveling for the first time outside of their home country. And so that's why in close consultation with our team in China, we've launched our Chinese personalized travel program in 19 gateway cities, including New York, Mexico City and Paris. The goal is simple, bring the comforts of home to our Chinese travelers when they stay abroad with us. The program includes language specialists, local welcome packets in Chinese, in-room amenities, not to mention special menus.  And we're expanding the program to other hotels around the world. 
These are a few important examples of what we mean by better dialogue and working together to support growth. Over the past 25 years, we built what we believe to be the best local smart team in the industry. Supporting local teams is what gives Starwood the edge not just in China, but in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and other markets around Asia. 
Here's one way to think about how this edge translates into results. According to Smith Travel, in China during 2010, Starwood opened 15 upper upscale and luxury hotels, over twice as many as Marriott and 5x as many as Hilton. In fact, globally, we opened 47 upper upscale and luxury hotels in 2010 versus 39 for Marriott, 22 for Hilton and 11 for Hyatt. So when we talk about our pipeline, we intend to realize it. And we've all read headlines in our industry about mega development deals in emerging markets that have fizzled. 
Less apparent than the headlines though is the quality of our growth. Our pipeline is strong -- is so strong today that we don't feel the need to impress investors, present or future, with projected deals that won't stand the test of time. For example, we won't sign a deal if the economics compromise the integrity of our existing contracts, and we won't buy deals with exorbitant key money.  We'll walk away from the deal that's not right for our brands or if the partner is not right for the long term. 
Moreover, we have a branded strategy so we won't sell our distribution without a brand. We believe that generic distribution is not fair to owners who invest with us to build their brands. Understandably, owners wouldn't want us to open a low-cost generic hotel that undermines one of our branded hotels next door. In short, we're staying close to our local teams, and it gives us the knowledge and discipline to be selective in our development. 
As I look back on it, the time we invested with our team in China will certainly pay off. We were thrilled to join their discussions in strategy, marketing, sales, new deals and developing talent. The familiarity gives us a way to reach across cultural differences and to talk in shorthand. I'm confident that as we brace for more growth, our joint decisions and judgment calls will benefit from our shared experiences. 
So I hope this gives you a better sense of why we went to China, and we return all the more convinced of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that emerging markets represent around the world. Never before have 3 billion people moved from poverty to prosperity in a single generation. And there are huge ripple effects. Raw material exporters are getting enriched. And in a few years, China will shift from being a net exporter of low-cost labor to a massive importer.  And when that happens, it will jump start other countries. 
Think about this. The U.S. took 75 years to industrialize. Japan took 40 and China took only 25. This acceleration will continue in markets like Bangladesh, Vietnam, not to mention parts of Africa. 
So to sum it up, the world really is changing like never before, and the way we see it, it's changing in our favor with so many new travelers who want our brands. The only thing that keeps me up at night, the fear of not fully seizing this moment.  And so with that, let me turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,136707027,147913,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter with EBITDA up 16% and EPS up 43%. We exceeded the high end of our expectations by $7 million despite the sale of 3 large hotels, which resulted in lost EBITDA of around $5 milli",1954,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter with EBITDA up 16% and EPS up 43%. We exceeded the high end of our expectations by $7 million despite the sale of 3 large hotels, which resulted in lost EBITDA of around $5 million in the quarter. These results were once again driven by the power of our brand portfolio, which gained 250 basis points of REVPAR index in North America, our revenue and cost management programs, which delivered industry-leading margin improvements of 170 basis points that come from the operated hotels in North America and continued tight control of SG&A, which declined by 4.3% in the quarter. 
Asset sales and operating cash flow increased our cash balance to over $1 billion and reduced our net debt by almost $400 million. We have maintained the outlook range we first provided late last year despite a $25 million to $30 million EBITDA hit from the unexpected events in North Africa and Japan, and an additional $20 million in lost EBITDA from asset sales completed in Q2, which were not included in our outlook. In other words, our core continuing business is performing better than we projected at the start of the year. I'll provide some more color on business trends around the world and on our outlook for the year. 
North American owned REVPAR was up double digits, with occupancy exceeding levels reached at 2008 peaks. Tight cost controls converted this revenue growth into strong EBITDA growth, with owned EBITDA margins up over 250 basis points. System-wide REVPAR was also up strongly, with Sheraton up 7% and Westin up 10%, handily outperforming their competitors once again. 
Our Luxury brands continued their industry-leading performance with W up almost 14% and St. Regis up almost 16%. At this point, there is no discernible impact on our business from the much discussed soft patch in the U.S. economy or the debt limit shenanigans in Washington. 
Transient revenue pace, both corporate and leisure, is up double digits in Q3. Leads are up, group pace is gaining steam and booking windows are lengthening. So far in July, the momentum of the second quarter has been sustained. As we've said before, rate is the make or break variable this year. Rate trends are improving as occupancies enter the 70s. Like you, we remain on high alert for any signs of a change in trend. Since we do not see any evidence of that, our outlook assumes the normal cyclical recovery we have been experiencing in lodging will continue. 
The euro crisis has not impacted our business so far in Europe, which is one of our strongest regions in the quarter. In local currencies, system REVPAR in Europe was up 12%, rate was up 5.1% and occupancy is up 4.5 points. Our owned hotels did even better, up 18%, with rate up 10% and occupancies hitting 87% in June. Once again, good cost control delivered EBITDA margin increases of 350 basis points. Italy and Spain REVPAR were up 20%, France was even stronger, U.K. and Australia grew double digits. German results were in line with what we expected given their biannual convention calendar. 
As in the U.S., no change in momentum is evident as we enter the third quarter. Africa and Middle East REVPAR was down 7%, impacted by the political turmoil across the region. By and large, there is no improvement in sight. Syria was down 80%, Bahrain down 65%; Egypt, minus 50%; and Jordan down 26%. The Gulf continues to work through oversupply issues while Saudi Arabia remains on track. The full year impact of North Africa we had provided you in April remains unchanged. The situation is playing out as we had forecast, neither materially better nor worse. The more significant impact to softness in the Middle East and North Africa is in our incentive fees. 
Asian REVPAR grew 7% in local currency despite lapping the World Expo in Shanghai last year and the issues in Japan this year. With over 60,000 rooms open at the end of Q2, Asia has now overtaken our Europe, Africa, Middle East divisions to become our second largest after North America, with a growth trajectory that will double its size again over the next 5 years. And as you heard from Frits, our China business is on track to triple in 5 years. 
Strong REVPAR growth testifies to the fact that demand continues to grow faster than supply in Asia. India was up 9%, South Korea and Indonesia, up 11%, Australia, up 10%; Thailand, lapping last year's troubles, up 47% and China x Shanghai, up 12%. Japan was down 22%. The recovery from the earthquake is slow. The full year impact of the Japanese earthquake tsunami remains unchanged from what we provided you in April. 
Latin America was our fastest growing region in Q2, clocking in at 17%. We experienced some extraordinary growth in Peru, up 60%; Brazil, plus 45%; and Chile, up 32%. The cities in Mexico were strong while the results are starting to improve with group business beginning to come back. 
Finally, our Vacation Ownership business performed as expected. Cash flows are improved, while close rates are stable. Mix management is improving price realization. Default rates continue to improve and are now back to 2007 levels. We expect these trends to continue. We remain focused on cash flow generation with a securitization planned in the fourth quarter. SVO will generate over $150 million in cash this year and over $700 million in total in the last 3 years. 
Our SG&A declined in the quarter. This is partially due to lapping incentive compensation accruals from last year. We also had some legal expenses last year. These positives were offset by higher costs of non-U.S. overhead due to the weak dollar. For the year, we continue to expect a 4% to 5% increase. 
Moving on to our outlook. We assume the normal cyclical lodging recovery continues in the second half. As such, our outlook remains unchanged from what we provided at the start of the year. It is important to highlight 2 major negatives we have absorbed since then. In April, we estimated a $25 million to $30 million full year impact from the unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and left our outlook unchanged. Now we're absorbing an additional $20 million from the sale of 3 large hotels in Q2 while leaving our outlook unchanged again. 
As such, we're offsetting almost $50 million in EBITDA, thanks to better-than-expected performance in our core continuing business, particularly at our owned hotels worldwide, from strength across Asia and helped by a weak dollar. That said, we are more comfortable with the middle of the EBITDA outlook range rather than the high end where many of your estimates currently are. All other metrics, REVPAR growth, owned margin improvement, SVO and SG&A remain unchanged. Fee growth ticks up due to a weaker dollar. EPS is higher from lower depreciation and interest expenses, partly as a result of the accretive asset sales. 
A point on our owned EBITDA. It is lower in Q2 than you may have expected. Owned EBITDA as reported was up 8%. If you adjust for asset sales, EBITDA growth was 16%. The same-store sale actually grew 28%. Non-Same-Store results were negatively impacted by some large renovations like the Sheraton Kuwait, The Grand in Florence and the Hotel Alfonso in Seville, also by the earthquake impact at the St. Regis in Osaka and the new W Leicester Square in London, which is still ramping up. In total, asset sales in Osaka reduced 2011 owned EBITDA by approximately $25 million. These factors will make total owned EBITDA not quite as high as the projection based on Same-Store REVPAR growth and margin improvement might lead you too. 
On the fee front, North Africa and Japan hurt 2011 management fees by as much as $18 million or a reduction of almost 300 basis points in year-over-year fee growth. 2/3 of the impact is on incentive fees and more significantly in the fourth quarter than these fees were anticipated. As such, our Q4 fee growth rate will be lower than the trend we have seen in the first 3 quarters. Some of this impact is offset by favorable currency translation due to the weak dollar, a 200 basis point positive for the year. As you know, only about 40% of our fees are earned in the U.S. 
The remaining impact of Japan is on the unconsolidated joint venture line, roughly $7 million in 2011, since we've written off our investment in the Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay. Through June, we've opened 34 hotels and remain on track to open 70 to 80 hotels in 2011. Last year, we opened more luxury and upper upscale rooms globally than any other hotel company and hope to repeat that this year too. As Frits indicated, we are focused on signing high-quality contracts with great long-term owners. This ensures both a healthy fee stream and a very high probability that deals we sign actually open with an owned-brand hotel. The signing pace is picking up, and the pipeline is growing again. 85% of our 90,000-room pipeline is outside North America, and 75% of the rooms are in the high-fee Luxury and Upper Upscale segments. 
We sold the Westin Gaslamp and the W Chicago Center in Q2. In the case of the Gaslamp, then you all know we'll spend $23 million to complete a full renovation that we had started. We also sold our interest in the Boston Park Plaza, a consolidated joint venture hotel. This is a 941-room hotel that was unbranded and in need of significant capital. We've been working with our partner to explore options for years. The hotel was a legacy investment from Starwood's REIT days. We're happy to have finally exited this venture on mutually acceptable terms. In total, these asset sales generated $281 million in cash and $57 million in debt reduction. EBITDA lost in 2011 will be $20 million and $23 million on an annualized basis. 
After the asset sales, our net debt is $400 million lower and stands at $1.74 billion. Cash in excess of working capital needs is almost $1 billion. We intend to use cash on hand to pay down debt maturing in 2012 as we work towards a solid BBB investment grade rating. Our priorities for cash deployment remain reinvesting in our business to drive growth, reducing our debt to target levels, and of course, returning cash to shareholders as we did in the last cycle. 
At Bal Harbour, construction is proceeding on schedule. We're also on track to receive our TCO in Q4. Our plan is to start closings in November. Meanwhile, the sales pace is good this year, particularly from Latin American buyers. Square foot rates realized on new sales are at precrisis levels and deposits are much higher, more than 40%. We expect that there will be revenue profits and cash from Bal Harbour in the fourth quarter as we start closings, which are not currently in our outlook. We will provide you our best estimates when we talk again in October. 
In summary, a normal cyclical recovery in lodging continues around the globe followed by extraordinary demand growth in emerging markets and record low supply growth in developed markets. As always, there are many results there that could derail this recovery: The euro debt crisis damaging key European economies, the debt reduction debate in the U.S. loan growth, the hardlining in China from efforts to control inflation are, of course, the big ones to watch. So far so good, and we hope it stays that way. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

We expect -- and this is not something we control but we expect that ratings will move probably towards the end of this year or into next year. And our priority is we have maturities next year, roughly $600 million in public debt, as well as there's some debt on assets, which is a small amount, maybe another $50 million or so that can be prepaid.

And so as a consequence of that, keeping our powder a bit drier than we might have in the past is something that we are inclined to do. And what Vasant has also said is actually true and that is, we continue to look at opportunities to invest in our business, and whether that's some of the renovations that we have underway or other opportunities that may come up, we want to be ready.  And that's not to signal anything significant, but it's to mention the fact that, that's something that continues to be on our minds. That said, we're not ambivalent. And in terms of giving cash back to shareholders, and I think there are $4 billion or $5 billion that we've given back in the past would let you know that as a management team and philosophically, we don't have any problems with doing that. And as you pointed out in your question, it's more a function of timing than anything else."

I'll address the first part of your question around development pipeline, then hand off to Vasant to talk a bit more about the 2011 outlook and margins. As we look at our pipeline, I don't think it would surprise anybody to hear that the growth in where we're signing deals is more in Asia, not just China, but other markets in Asia, as well as in some of the resource economies in Latin America and elsewhere. Most of the work that we're doing in North America, thanks to the lack of construction heater, is to look at conversions.  And the interesting thing about conversions is they don't generally sit in your pipeline for 3 years. You sign them and within a much shorter period of time, they become your own brand. And so the pipeline will never look the same as long as you're doing conversion work relative to de novo construction.  And so that gives you a good sense of where the breakout is, and then of course, we continue to look at ways to find better opportunities in North America especially, but also Europe where as demand builds and as there's no construction, we still maintain that there is going to be a day out in the future where rates will be so compelling and financing will finally be available that there will be quite a bit of development.  And we want to be ready for that moment, and we'll continue to look at ways to do that. So with that, Vasant, you want to talk about 2011?"

So the best way to describe it is you saw that we had some healthy margin improvement in our North American hotels and actually even in our European hotels. So where we have the margin pressures for the reasons we mentioned in our Latin American hotels, the best way I would describe it is the range we've given you is 150 to 200. I would say our North American hotels will have margin improvements that are north of 200, but our international hotels will be below 150. Mostly because in Europe, we'll do well, but in Latin America, the margin pressure continues, although it's getting a little better. So let's say international below 150 and North America, about 200, with the whole portfolio in the 150 to 200 range."

First, from our perspective, Bal Harbour is a completely different animal from SVO. And our point of view on Bal Harbour, of course, is that it is a onetime episodic development of something that wouldn't be on strategy today. But given the improving macro environment and particularly given the increase in demand among the kinds of high net worth buyers from around the world that are looking at that property, we think we're going to exit that whole project far better than we could have imagined a couple of years ago. So the real issue is around Vacation Ownership. And we've been very clear for some time now about our strategy to be 80% fee-driven and 20% driven by owned real estate, which would include Vacation Ownership from our perspective. And we do think that as time passes, there will be sufficiently high IRR places for us to invest in the Vacation Ownership business. Although at the same time, we have no expectation that the size of that business will get to anywhere near where it was before the downturn.  And in terms of the team there, they continue to do a spectacular job. The morale in the leadership there is very strong. We're keeping the people that we want. The fact that we, Starwood, have stayed committed to that organization is a great selling point for us and the industry. So we believe we can be both right-sized, generating high returns and still maintain a high quality of smaller team than where it was before."

And more specifically, as you look at the U.S., the U.S. economy is clearly losing an opportunity to generate economic growth and jobs by turning Chinese away or we're making it too difficult for Chinese, and by the way, travelers from other markets to come to the U.S. As a point of fact, something like 5x as many Chinese today go to Europe has come to the United States.  And if you think about the difference between 2 to 4 weeks to get a visa in your hometown versus 90 days or longer to get a visa having to travel to a different city if you're Chinese, you can imagine why someone would choose to go elsewhere. It also means that when people think about booking conventions or other meetings business, and they know that there will be Chinese people coming, that they don't consider the U.S. as quickly as they otherwise might. So have we been vocal about this? Absolutely. Do the gears of government turn far more slowly and in a much more frustrating ways than the gears of business? Absolutely. And I think that's why we're on the business side in our own lives. That said, the good part about our business is we don't just have hotels in the United states.  And so while we would love to generate more jobs in the U.S. and more growth here from that, we are enjoying the growth in Chinese travelers around the world.  And around the announcement of our China personalized travel program, we mentioned some of the triple-figure increases we're seeing in gateway cities around the world and places you'd expect, places like Paris, places like Buenos Aires, places like London.  And so we know the demands there. We also believe that as you look at the distribution of income in China today and the threshold level for people to become high-end travelers, while that economy may grow at let's say 8%, the number of people, the percentage growth in the number of people who cross that threshold grows at a much higher rate. So this is already an important business for us, but we believe in the coming years, it will be an increasingly important business. And for those of you with longer memories, going back to the waves of Japanese tourists, this is a far greater wave. You have 10x as many people in China as in Japan. The whole country of Japan would have to have emptied out to equal what we think ultimately will happen once the Chinese become even more active traveling outbound. So short answer, we're very vocal. Second is, we see the growth in other markets, and we hope that it comes to the U.S. as well."

In Latin America, certainly the margins are under some pressure, although the pressure on the margins has eased a little bit. I think yes, the margins may have been down between 100 and 200 basis points in Latin America in Q3. The comparability issues come from 2 factors, the biggest, of course, is asset sales. Second in line is we have 2 hotels in there that are new in the non-Same-Store set, one is the St. Regis Osaka, which suffers not just from being new, but also being affected by the earthquake. The second is the W Leicester Square, which is doing very well but just opened in February. And then of course, there's the renovation impact. But I would say the biggest impacts are the new hotels in there, as well as the asset sales, which does make sort of simple comparisons from what we have in our reported P&L somewhat harder to do.

We have got deposits already for many of the sales done prior to this year in the 20% range. And then more recently, our deposits have been much higher than that, as I said earlier, more than 40%. We have been contacting people who signed contracts going back to '08, '09, '07, letting them know that we're getting ready for closings. Our indications are very good that the closing rates will be high. There's no way to know until you actually -- you get people to sign on the dotted line and give you the check. Our view is yes, there may be some falloff, but close rates are going to be high. The good news is the square footage rates we're selling at right now are at precrisis levels, which means that there isn't sort of recent sales going on -- no recent sales going on that are below prices people paid when they signed up a couple of years ago.  And in terms of square footage, you can find out if you're in the market. It does vary depending upon the units.

And in a building like this where some buyers are buying multiple units, different floor sizes, different floor patterns, for us, there are some art as well as science to seeing what's comparable. So we don't think it's appropriate to throw out an overall number because it then becomes a weighted average of what you're selling. But as we've done the analysis like-for-like with precrisis sales, as Vasant says, we're at the same point. The biggest difference being previously, we were getting 20% deposits and today, we're getting north of 40%. And so that tells us 2 things. First of all, people really want to buy, and second of all, a 40% deposit on a $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $5 million purchase is a serious transaction and something not done speculatively. So we feel very good about certainly, the sales of late. And given the strength in the market, I feel better and better about the sales from before."

So '06, '07, when the market was frothy, many things were selling and selling at extraordinary prices in great volume. The market was off 90% as we went into the crisis.

But that said, it continues to build.  And so we are seeing more buyers, not just from well-capitalized REITs who've been the most active buyers of late, but we continue to see more interest from high net worth individuals and sovereign wealth funds. But I don't think that the transaction market today is anywhere near where it will be once this recovery is fully underway. And that's one of the reasons that we continue to take assets to market, but we don't feel that this is the right time to be considering a much more substantial asset sales.

Following the format of previous calls, I'll start with our take on the current business environment, the highlights of our Q2 results, followed by our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll close with some thoughts on the month we spent in China. 
Here's how we see the business environment. Like many of you, we find ourselves once again looking at an uncertain global economy. As euro rose, our net with stopgap accords, worries grow at a real estate bubble in China. Social unrest woes in the Arab world and U.S. lawmakers play at fiscal brinksmanship. 
Reading headlines, it's easy to feel skittish about the near term.  And to be sure, there are many factors that could upend this recovery. At the same time though, from our vantage point, drivers of our business paint a more robust picture. At least for now, trouble spots are contained while underlying growth and demand for travel continues to build. 
Developers in many markets around the world are eager to invest in hotel projects. This reflects both their confidence and their access to capital. Our biggest customers: global corporations, professional firms, growth companies and high-income individuals are telling us that they have earnings power and little debt. And perhaps most importantly, our customers are busy and look to stay busy. This has led us to conclude that the recovery continues to play out as a tale of 2 cities. We've known for a while that emerging markets are growing fast while developed ones are languishing. But the split is increasingly clear even within developed markets. Times are good for successful companies and highly skilled individuals. For companies with looming debt maturities and for people out of work, the crisis lingers. 
On a global level, this tale of 2 cities that [ph persists is not healthy for any of us. But for our business today, it explains why tepid U.S. economic growth and persistent high unemployment have not dampened our own business momentum. 
I'm making this point for 2 reasons: first, to address the observation that our stock fluctuates in the short term, based on day-to-day sentiments about the state of the world, without considering whether our core customers are going to be affected; and second, our conviction that the value of our company is set to rise with an unprecedented and seemingly unstoppable growth in the ranks of a new class of affluent global business and leisure travelers. This major secular trend will continue to fuel demand for our brands well into the future. 
And it's this second point on economic growth that prompted us to move our leadership team to China for part of the summer. More about that in a few minutes. But our time there has left us as bullish as ever about our long-term growth prospects in China and other rising markets around the globe. 
As a company, we're confident that we have the right foundation for realizing this growth. We've talked before about our global brands and local smart teams. Less well known outside of our company is that we've created a corporate culture that has a global perspective, a collaborative style and alignment around our direction. 
I should also add that during the financial crisis, we weren't just cutting costs and reducing debt. We were also busy launching a slate of initiatives aimed at boosting our performance in these growth markets. Today, we're 2 years into realizing the benefits of those efforts. 
So in that context, let me walk you through our Q2 results and recent trends. We continue to see strong demand around the world. I'm happy to report that worldwide fees grew 14%, driven by REVPAR up 8%. As expected, rate and occupancy now contribute equally to REVPAR growth. This is typical for an early stage recovery. Occupancies have now reached the point where we expect rates to rise further. And as you'd expect, higher revenues mean higher margins. Worldwide Company-Operated Hotel margins expanded by 90 basis points. 
As we look around the world, the 2 main trouble spots are Japan and parts of the Arab world. Excluding these regions, worldwide REVPAR increased 10% and margins widened by 140 basis points. REVPAR outside of North America grew at 7% in constant dollars or 11% excluding Japan, North America and the Middle East. 
Latin America was our fastest growing region with REVPAR up 17%. And our Mexican resorts are showing signs of growing confidence among travelers. Europe performed well despite the sovereign debt circus. Our REVPAR growth was 12%, thanks to strong corporate and leisure demand and no new supply to speak of. 
We're also encouraged by our results in Asia, even if overall REVPAR was up a modest 7%. That growth was on top of last year's 28% jump, driven in part by the World Expo in Shanghai. Outside of Japan and Shanghai, Asia Pacific's REVPAR grew 16%. 
North America delivered 9% REVPAR growth, and our focus on margins is paying off with an increase of 170 basis points in the second quarter. Year-to-date, North American margins have expanded 180 basis points and REVPAR has grown 10%. 
Finally, our worldwide portfolio of owned hotels delivered REVPAR growth of almost 13%, and margins expanded 225 basis points. 
These results show that our brand-led approach is paying off. Each brand has a distinct positioning that appeals to a different traveler or travel location. Collectively, our brands benefit from our work to grow SPG, to upgrade revenue management and to improve our sales effectiveness. The result is the eighth quarter in a row of REVPAR index growth, up 250 basis points in North America and 170 basis points worldwide. 
We've been talking for a while about the momentum of Sheraton, which once again posted record high guest satisfaction scores and drove REVPAR increases. Year-to-date, REVPAR index for Sheraton North America is up another 210 basis points. 
Our outlook for the rest of the year foresees more brand-led success. Group pace for 2011 is up, even as booking windows are lengthening, and rate trends are very encouraging. Rates on newly-booked business for 2012 are up 9%, and for beyond 2012, up 12%. Business transient trends continue to point to a travel-intensive recovery. Banks and corporations are high in profits and low in debt. Professional service businesses have record backlogs, tech companies are booming and global businesses are benefiting from the robust growth in emerging markets. So it's no surprise that business transient revenue is up 9%, with rate up 6%. 
Transient revenue booking pace through September, by the way, is up double digits. So with supply already tight in the U.S. and Europe, we foresee strong rate increases, not just for the rest of this year, but also for corporate rate negotiations for next year. 
And finally, our leisure business is doing quite well as high-end guests fare better than the economy as a whole. The strength of our business will mean less inventory sold through costly channels such as OTAs. Our leisure business for the remainder of the year will build on the second quarter's 7% price increases and 12% revenue growth. 
Before I wrap up on my remarks for the quarter, let me call your attention to our Vacation Ownership business to where flows steadily improved up 4%, and for the first time in nearly 4 years, realized price increased. Our Vacation Ownership team continues to do a stellar job driving sales and generating cash from the business. We expect more of the same for the coming years. 
In summary, for Q2, we beat the high end of EBITDA expectations by $7 million and EPS by $0.04, and that despite continued pressures in Japan and Northern Africa. Our outlook for the rest of 2011 is robust with solid group and transient pace and with good prospects for rate and margin.  In line with our baseline scenario, we expect REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2012. We're sticking to our 2011 EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion. And I should add that, that's in spite of asset sales, which will reduce full year EBITDA by about $20 million. We're also raising our EPS range to $1.67 to $1.77. Vasant, of course, will provide more details on our outlook and asset sales in a few minutes. 
But before I hand over to Vasant, I'd like to share some thoughts on the month our leadership team spent in China. Since returning, I've been asked many times what surprised me most, and the answer is easy. I had no idea there would be so much media attention. In retrospect, I guess it makes sense. For many global businesses and journalists, the Chinese market is a huge phenomenon. Our move and the success of our business there makes for a compelling story. 
It also seemed that many Chinese were keen to see how our move highlighted the importance of their market. Being in China, we were all struck once again by the rate and scale of change. A few superlatives stand out among our site business, our largest hotel, the 4,000-room Sheraton in Macau, our highest hotel, the St. Regis in Lhasa at nearly 4,000 meters and our tallest hotel, the St. Regis in Shenzhen. 
The Shenzhen for me was especially an eyeopener. It reminded me of when I first came to Hong Kong in 1986. Back then, the cityscape stood in stark contrast to the tiny fishing village with Shenzhen. From our 100-story perch at the St. Regis, it was hard now not to think that the tables had turned, with Mainland China in 2011 looking decidedly more modern. 
But I should emphasize our goal in coming to China was not for publicity nor was it to arrive at some blazing new insight. My colleagues and I have been going to China many times. We were there to deepen our dialogue with our leadership team and to add to our set of shared experiences. This dialogue makes for better decisions and better global support to our local team as the business grows, which reminds me, when I was asked about my motivation for going to China, it reminded me of what the gangster Willie Sutton said when he was asked why he robbed banks. And he replied, ""Because that's where the money is."" For our case, that's where the growth is, and the growth continues to be spectacular. 
More to the point, this decade represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, not just to grow, but to shape the market. We have 75 hotels in operation in China and nearly 100 more under construction. It's rare that any country has more hotels in the pipeline than in its existing footprint. But it's unprecedented for this to be happening in our second largest country. 
Many people don't realize that already today, the number of domestic and international trips taken in China is roughly equal to those in the U.S. But in China, travel's growing at 15% to 20% a year, and there's only a fraction of the high-end hotels needed to serve this growth. Even after we open the next 100 hotels in China, our total number of hotels will be about 1/3 the size of our U.S. footprint. 
And by the way, Sheraton continues to lead our footprint in our growth in China, accounting for over 1/2 of our pipeline. China's -- excuse me, Sheraton's footprint will more than double over the next 3 years. Westin and Four Points by Sheraton will make up another quarter of our growth. Four Points enjoys its association with Sheraton, and Westin's trajectory builds on its successful launch in major cities several years ago. 
For many luxury brands, from handbags to champagne, China's already the world's largest market. With 9 St. Regis hotels in the pipeline, in a few years, China could well be the largest market for that brand as well. Luxury consumption is evolving quickly in China. Like other developing markets, consumers first tend to luxury brands as a sign of status. But people are increasingly seeing luxury defined what they themselves choose to enjoy during their free time.  And some travelers would choose to collect the indigenous experiences we offer through Luxury Collection. Others will seek the informal contemporary feel of W. 
Our first Luxury Collection hotel opened last year in Tian Jin, and the first W will open in Guangzhou early next year. The distinct personalities of these brands mean that all 3 can thrive side-by-side, each appealing to a different type of high-end traveler. 
Another aspect of the growth in China is that it's spreading beyond the major markets to the so-called second- and third-tier cities. In fact, over 80% of our hotels are being built in the roughly 170 such cities, each with populations of more than 1 million. We're often asked whether this rapid growth will lead to temporary overcapacity.  And no doubt, there will be some wrenching adjustments as supply and demand move in and out of balance. That said, our occupancies are above last year, and we've been careful in selecting the right partners and the right locations.  
And as another 300 million people move from the countryside into cities over the next 10 to 15 years, today's overcapacity will be tomorrow's needed supply. Take Beijing, for example. Post-Olympics in '08, there was plenty of talk about excess supply. Fast-forward to today, year-to-date REVPAR in Beijing is up 21% and new hotels are once again coming onstream. 
Or take Shanghai. Where else in the world would you see flat REVPAR the year following a World Expo? So this growth is why even in the dark days of 2009, we were building out our leadership teams in growth markets like China. As a result, today we have the foundation to triple the number of associates over the next 5 years in China to the 90,000 we'll be needing. 
But now, let me return to my earlier point about why having a dialogue and working in support of our local leadership teams is so vital to our growth. To do that, I'll walk you through a number of examples of what we mean by this. Nearly 4 years ago, during my first Starwood visit to China, we discussed our SPG strategy, which up until then, had been tailored -- had not been tailored to local Chinese travelers. We decided then to translate more collateral signage, train associates in enrolling guests in Chinese and maybe most importantly, adapt the program benefits, including tie-ins to food and beverage. Today, the program drives over 50% of our occupancy on the heels of a 71% jump in enrollment in 2010. China's our biggest SPG market outside of North America. 
On a subsequent visit, we developed another foundation for our growth. With about 60% of our guests in China being local nationals, we all decided it was time to open a call center in-country. In the midst of the 2009 crisis, we opened what is now the largest call center for any global hotel company.  And we're also learning that, that call center is a great launch pad for promotions and for developing talent for our operations.  
And then there's our website. Consider this: What if Starwood were a Chinese company, and in the U.S., you were booking a vacation through our website? The web pages would begin in English, but the moment you would click to make a reservation, suddenly all you saw was Chinese. Sounds crazy, but that's basically what global lodging companies have been doing to Chinese consumers, starting in Chinese and then switching to English.  Today's -- today, ours is the only website of its kind where Chinese guests can book start to finish in Chinese. 
Most importantly or most recently, we also turned our focus to the outbound Chinese traveler. This outbound opportunity is the third stage in what we've been calling the Outpost to Outbound transformation of our business. Our first hotels in China were outposts for Western travelers. Today, our business is mostly Chinese.  And now we're seeing the rise in the Chinese outbound travelers. The same is true, by the way, for knowledge transfer. We used to bring know-how into China, but more and more, we're taking best practices from China and sharing them with other markets. 
So getting back to the outbound travelers, but remind you that here again, China's already about the same size as the U.S., roughly 50 million trips. But this number has grown fivefold since 2000, and Beijing is now the world's second busiest airport. 
Looking ahead, estimates are that each year, there will be 25 million Chinese traveling for the first time outside of their home country. And so that's why in close consultation with our team in China, we've launched our Chinese personalized travel program in 19 gateway cities, including New York, Mexico City and Paris. The goal is simple, bring the comforts of home to our Chinese travelers when they stay abroad with us. The program includes language specialists, local welcome packets in Chinese, in-room amenities, not to mention special menus.  And we're expanding the program to other hotels around the world. 
These are a few important examples of what we mean by better dialogue and working together to support growth. Over the past 25 years, we built what we believe to be the best local smart team in the industry. Supporting local teams is what gives Starwood the edge not just in China, but in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and other markets around Asia. 
Here's one way to think about how this edge translates into results. According to Smith Travel, in China during 2010, Starwood opened 15 upper upscale and luxury hotels, over twice as many as Marriott and 5x as many as Hilton. In fact, globally, we opened 47 upper upscale and luxury hotels in 2010 versus 39 for Marriott, 22 for Hilton and 11 for Hyatt. So when we talk about our pipeline, we intend to realize it. And we've all read headlines in our industry about mega development deals in emerging markets that have fizzled. 
Less apparent than the headlines though is the quality of our growth. Our pipeline is strong -- is so strong today that we don't feel the need to impress investors, present or future, with projected deals that won't stand the test of time. For example, we won't sign a deal if the economics compromise the integrity of our existing contracts, and we won't buy deals with exorbitant key money.  We'll walk away from the deal if it's not right for our brands or if the partner is not right for the long term. 
Moreover, we have a branded strategy so we won't sell our distribution without a brand. We believe that generic distribution is not fair to owners who invest with us to build their brands. Understandably, owners wouldn't want us to open a low-cost generic hotel that undermines one of our branded hotels next door. In short, we're staying close to our local teams, and it gives us the knowledge and discipline to be selective in our development. 
As I look back on it, the time we invested with our team in China will certainly pay off. We were thrilled to join their discussions in strategy, marketing, sales, new deals and developing talent. The familiarity gives us a way to reach across cultural differences and to talk in shorthand. I'm confident that as we brace for more growth, our joint decisions and judgment calls will benefit from our shared experiences. 
So I hope this gives you a better sense of why we went to China, and we return all the more convinced of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that emerging markets represent around the world. Never before have 3 billion people moved from poverty to prosperity in a single generation. And there are huge ripple effects. Raw material exporters are getting enriched. And in a few years, China will shift from being a net exporter of low-cost labor to a massive importer.  And when that happens, it will jump start other countries. 
Think about this. The U.S. took 75 years to industrialize. Japan took 40 and China took only 25. This acceleration will continue in markets like Bangladesh, Vietnam, not to mention parts of Africa. 
So to sum it up, the world really is changing like never before, and the way we see it, it's changing in our favor with so many new travelers who want our brands. The only thing that keeps me up at night, is the fear of not fully seizing this moment.  And so with that, let me turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,136707027,148105,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter with EBITDA up 16% and EPS up 43%. We exceeded the high end of our expectations by $7 million despite the sale of 3 large hotels, which resulted in lost EBITDA of around $5 milli",1952,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter with EBITDA up 16% and EPS up 43%. We exceeded the high end of our expectations by $7 million despite the sale of 3 large hotels, which resulted in lost EBITDA of around $5 million in the quarter. These results were once again driven by the power of our brand portfolio, which gained 250 basis points of REVPAR index in North America, our revenue and cost management programs, which delivered industry-leading margin improvements of 170 basis points that come from the operated hotels in North America and continued tight control of SG&A, which declined by 4.3% in the quarter. 
Asset sales and operating cash flow increased our cash balance to over $1 billion and reduced our net debt by almost $400 million. We have maintained the outlook range we first provided late last year despite a $25 million to $30 million EBITDA hit from the unexpected events in North Africa and Japan, and an additional $20 million in lost EBITDA from asset sales completed in Q2, which were not included in our outlook. In other words, our core continuing business is performing better than we projected at the start of the year. I'll provide some more color on business trends around the world and on our outlook for the year. 
North American owned REVPAR was up double digits, with occupancy exceeding levels reached at 2008 peaks. Tight cost controls converted this revenue growth into strong EBITDA growth, with owned EBITDA margins up over 250 basis points. System-wide REVPAR was also up strongly, with Sheraton up 7% and Westin up 10%, handily outperforming the competitors once again. 
Our Luxury brands continued their industry-leading performance with W up almost 14% and St. Regis up almost 16%. At this point, there is no discernible impact on our business from the much discussed soft patch in the U.S. economy or the debt limit shenanigans in Washington. 
Transient revenue pace, both corporate and leisure, is up double digits in Q3. Leads are up, group pace is gaining steam and booking windows are lengthening. So far in July, the momentum of the second quarter has been sustained. As we've said before, rate is the make-or-break variable this year. Rate trends are improving as occupancies enter the 70s. Like you, we remain on high alert for any signs of a change in trend. Since we do not see any evidence of that, our outlook assumes the normal cyclical recovery we have been experiencing in lodging will continue. 
The euro crisis has not impacted our business so far in Europe, which is one of our strongest regions in the quarter. In local currencies, system REVPAR in Europe was up 12%, rate was up 5.1% and occupancy is up 4.5 points. Our owned hotels did even better, up 18%, with rate up 10% and occupancies hitting 87% in June. Once again, good cost control delivered EBITDA margin increases of 350 basis points. Italy and Spain REVPAR were up 20%, France was even stronger, U.K. and Australia grew double digits. German results were in line with what we expected given their biannual convention calendar. 
As in the U.S., no change in momentum is evident as we enter the third quarter. Africa and Middle East REVPAR was down 7%, impacted by the political turmoil across the region. By and large, there is no improvement in sight. Syria was down 80%, Bahrain down 65%; Egypt, minus 50%; and Jordan down 26%. The Gulf continues to work through oversupply issues while Saudi Arabia remains on track. The full year impact of North Africa we had provided you in April remains unchanged. The situation is playing out as we had forecast, neither materially better nor worse. The most significant impact to softness in the Middle East and North Africa is in our incentive fees. 
Asian REVPAR grew 7% in local currency despite lapping the World Expo in Shanghai last year and the issues in Japan this year. With over 60,000 rooms open at the end of Q2, Asia has now overtaken our Europe, Africa, Middle East divisions to become our second largest after North America, with a growth trajectory that will double its size again over the next 5 years. And as you heard from Frits, our China business is on track to triple in 5 years. 
Strong REVPAR growth testifies to the fact that demand continues to grow faster than supply in Asia. India was up 9%, South Korea and Indonesia, up 11%, Australia, up 10%; Thailand, lapping last year's troubles, up 47% and China x Shanghai, up 12%. Japan was down 22%. The recovery from the earthquake is slow. The full year impact of the Japanese earthquake tsunami remains unchanged from what we provided you in April. 
Latin America was our fastest growing region in Q2, clocking in at 17%. We experienced some extraordinary growth in Peru, up 60%; Brazil, plus 45%; and Chile, up 32%. The cities in Mexico were strong while the results are starting to improve with group business beginning to come back. 
Finally, our Vacation Ownership business performed as expected. Cash flows are improved, while close rates are stable. Mix management is improving price realization. Default rates continue to improve and are now back to 2007 levels. We expect these trends to continue. We remain focused on cash flow generation with a securitization planned in the fourth quarter. SVO will generate over $150 million in cash this year and over $700 million in total in the last 3 years. 
Our SG&A declined in the quarter. This is partially due to lapping incentive compensation accruals from last year. We also had some legal expenses last year. These positives were offset by higher costs of non-U.S. overhead due to the weak dollar. For the year, we continue to expect a 4% to 5% increase. 
Moving on to our outlook. We assume the normal cyclical lodging recovery continues in the second half. As such, our outlook remains unchanged from what we provided at the start of the year. It is important to highlight 2 major negatives we have absorbed since then. In April, we estimated a $25 million to $30 million full year impact from the unexpected events in Japan and North Africa and left our outlook unchanged. Now we're absorbing an additional $20 million from the sale of 3 large hotels in Q2 while leaving our outlook unchanged again. 
As such, we're offsetting almost $50 million in EBITDA, thanks to better-than-expected performance in our core continuing business, particularly at our owned hotels worldwide, from strength across Asia and helped by a weak dollar. That said, we are more comfortable with the middle of the EBITDA outlook range rather than the high end where many of your estimates currently are. All other metrics, REVPAR growth, owned margin improvement, SVO and SG&A remain unchanged. Fee growth ticks up due to a weaker dollar. EPS is higher from lower depreciation and interest expenses, partly as a result of the accretive asset sales. 
A point on our owned EBITDA. It is lower in Q2 than you may have expected. Owned EBITDA as reported was up 8%. If you adjust for asset sales, EBITDA growth was 16%. The same-store sale actually grew 28%. Non-Same-Store results were negatively impacted by some large renovations like the Sheraton Kauai, The Grand in Florence and the Hotel Alfonso in Seville, also by the earthquake impact at the St. Regis in Osaka and the new W Leicester Square in London, which is still ramping up. In total, asset sales in Osaka reduced 2011 owned EBITDA by approximately $25 million. These factors will make total owned EBITDA not quite as high as the projection based on Same-Store REVPAR growth and margin improvement might lead you to. 
On the fee front, North Africa and Japan hurt 2011 management fees by as much as $18 million or a reduction of almost 300 basis points in year-over-year fee growth. 2/3 of the impact is on incentive fees and more significantly in the fourth quarter than these fees were anticipated. As such, our Q4 fee growth rate will be lower than the trend we have seen in the first 3 quarters. Some of this impact is offset by favorable currency translation due to the weak dollar, a 200 basis point positive for the year. As you know, only about 40% of our fees are earned in the U.S. 
The remaining impact of Japan is on the unconsolidated joint venture line, roughly $7 million in 2011, since we've written off our investment in the Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay. Through June, we've opened 34 hotels and remain on track to open 70 to 80 hotels in 2011. Last year, we opened more luxury and upper upscale rooms globally than any other hotel company and hope to repeat that this year too. As Frits indicated, we are focused on signing high-quality contracts with great long-term owners. This ensures both a healthy fee stream and a very high probability that deals we sign actually open with an owned-brand hotel. The signing pace is picking up, and the pipeline is growing again. 85% of our 90,000-room pipeline is outside North America, and 75% of the rooms are in the high-fee Luxury and Upper Upscale segments. 
We sold the Westin Gaslamp and the W Chicago Center in Q2. In the case of the Gaslamp, then you all know we'll spend $23 million to complete a full renovation that we had started. We also sold our interest in the Boston Park Plaza, a consolidated joint venture hotel. This is a 941-room hotel that was unbranded and in need of significant capital. We've been working with our partner to explore options for years. The hotel was a legacy investment from Starwood's REIT days. We're happy to have finally exited this venture on mutually acceptable terms. In total, these asset sales generated $281 million in cash and $57 million in debt reduction. EBITDA lost in 2011 will be $20 million and $23 million on an annualized basis. 
After the asset sales, our net debt is $400 million lower and stands at $1.74 billion. Cash in excess of working capital needs is almost $1 billion. We intend to use cash on hand to pay down debt maturing in 2012 as we work towards a solid BBB investment grade rating. Our priorities for cash deployment remain reinvesting in our business to drive growth, reducing our debt to target levels, and of course, returning cash to shareholders as we did in the last cycle. 
At Bal Harbour, construction is proceeding on schedule. We're also on track to receive our TCO in Q4. Our plan is to start closings in November. Meanwhile, the sales pace is good this year, particularly from Latin American buyers. Square foot rates realized on new sales are at precrisis levels and deposits are much higher, more than 40%. We expect that there will be revenue profits and cash from Bal Harbour in the fourth quarter as we start closings, which are not currently in our outlook. We will provide you our best estimates when we talk again in October. 
In summary, a normal cyclical recovery in lodging continues around the globe followed by extraordinary demand growth in emerging markets and record low supply growth in developed markets. As always, there are many results there that could derail this recovery: The euro debt crisis damaging key European economies, the debt reduction debate in the U.S. loan growth, the hardlining in China from efforts to control inflation are, of course, the big ones to watch. So far so good, and we hope it stays that way. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

Certainly, the rating agencies, this is the way they do it today. I don't really give you for credit for cash in the balance sheet. Net-net, we're on the right track. We expect -- and this is not something we control but we expect that ratings will move probably towards the end of this year or into next year. And our priority is we have maturities next year, roughly $600 million in public debt, as well as there's some debt on assets, which is a small amount, maybe another $50 million or so that can be prepaid. So there's about $615 million in prepayments -- in repayments that we can make next year.

As we look at our pipeline, I don't think it would surprise anybody to hear that the growth in where we're signing deals is more in Asia, not just China, but other markets in Asia, as well as in some of the resource economies in Latin America and elsewhere. Most of the work that we're doing in North America, thanks to the lack of construction heater, is to look at conversions.  And the interesting thing about conversions is they don't generally sit in your pipeline for 3 years. You sign them and within a much shorter period of time, they become your own brand. And so the pipeline will never look the same as long as you're doing conversion work relative to de novo construction.  And so that gives you a good sense of where the breakout is, and then of course, we continue to look at ways to find better opportunities in North America especially, but also Europe where as demand builds and as there's no construction, we still maintain that there is going to be a day out in the future where rates will be so compelling and financing will finally be available that there will be quite a bit of development.  And we want to be ready for that moment, and we'll continue to look at ways to do that. So with that, Vasant, you want to talk about 2011?"

I would say our North American hotels will have margin improvements that are north of 200, but our international hotels will be below 150. Mostly because in Europe, we'll do well, but in Latin America, the margin pressure continues, although it's getting a little better.

First, from our perspective, Bal Harbour is a completely different animal from SVO. And our point of view on Bal Harbour, of course, is that it is a onetime episodic development of something that wouldn't be on strategy today. But given the improving macro environment and particularly given the increase in demand among the kinds of high net worth buyers from around the world that are looking at that property, we think we're going to exit that whole project far better than we could have imagined a couple of years ago. So the real issue is around Vacation Ownership. And we've been very clear for some time now about our strategy to be 80% fee-driven and 20% driven by owned real estate, which would include Vacation Ownership from our perspective. And we do think that as time passes, there will be sufficiently high IRR places for us to invest in the Vacation Ownership business. Although at the same time, we have no expectation that the size of that business will get to anywhere near where it was before the downturn.  And in terms of the team there, they continue to do a spectacular job. The morale in the leadership there is very strong. We're keeping the people that we want. The fact that we, Starwood, have stayed committed to that organization is a great selling point for us and the industry. So we believe we can be both right-sized, generating high returns and still maintain a high quality of smaller team than where it was before."

And more specifically, as you look at the U.S., the U.S. economy is clearly losing an opportunity to generate economic growth and jobs by turning Chinese away or we're making it too difficult for Chinese, and by the way, travelers from other markets to come to the U.S. As a point of fact, something like 5x as many Chinese today go to Europe has come to the United States.  And if you think about the difference between 2 to 4 weeks to get a visa in your hometown versus 90 days or longer to get a visa having to travel to a different city if you're Chinese, you can imagine why someone would choose to go elsewhere. It also means that when people think about booking conventions or other meetings business, and they know that there will be Chinese people coming, that they don't consider the U.S. as quickly as they otherwise might. So have we been vocal about this? Absolutely. Do the gears of government turn far more slowly and in a much more frustrating ways than the gears of business? Absolutely. And I think that's why we're on the business side in our own lives. That said, the good part about our business is we don't just have hotels in the United States.  And so while we would love to generate more jobs in the U.S. and more growth here from that, we are enjoying the growth in Chinese travelers around the world.  And around the announcement of our China personalized travel program, we mentioned some of the triple-figure increases we're seeing in gateway cities around the world and places you'd expect, places like Paris, places like Buenos Aires, places like London.  And so we know the demands there. We also believe that as you look at the distribution of income in China today and the threshold level for people to become high-end travelers, while that economy may grow at let's say 8%, the number of people, the percentage growth and the number of people who cross that threshold grows at a much higher rate. So this is already an important business for us, but we believe in the coming years, it will be an increasingly important business. And for those of you with longer memories, going back to the waves of Japanese tourists, this is a far greater wave. You have 10x as many people in China as in Japan. The whole country of Japan would have to have emptied out to equal what we think ultimately will happen once the Chinese become even more active traveling outbound. So short answer, we're very vocal. Second is, we see the growth in other markets, and we hope that it comes to the U.S. as well."

In Europe, the Same-Store set had margins going up 350 basis points. We also -- we have a small base of Owned hotels in Asia, the margins went up there too. In fact, they're doing very well, especially given the Australian economy. In Latin America, certainly the margins are under some pressure, although the pressure on the margins has eased a little bit. I think yes, the margins may have been down between 100 and 200 basis points in Latin America in Q3. The comparability issues come from 2 factors, the biggest, of course, is asset sales. Second in line is we have 2 hotels in there that are new in the non-Same-Store set, one is the St. Regis Osaka, which suffers not just from being new, but also being affected by the earthquake. The second is the W Leicester Square, which is doing very well but just opened in February. And then of course, there's the renovation impact. But I would say the biggest impacts are the new hotels in there, as well as the asset sales, which does make sort of simple comparisons from what we have in our reported P&L somewhat harder to do. And this is why we try to give you a little bit of the breakdown in our comments today."

And the value we provided you before is north of $1 billion in terms of the condos. Now, there'll also be a hotel there that we intend to keep. We have got deposits already for many of the sales done prior to this year in the 20% range. And then more recently, our deposits have been much higher than that, as I said earlier, more than 40%. We have been contacting people who signed contracts going back to '08, '09, '07, letting them know that we're getting ready for closings. Our indications are very good that the closing rates will be high. There's no way to know until you actually -- you get people to sign on the dotted line and give you the check. Our view is yes, there may be some falloff, but close rates are going to be high. The good news is the square footage rates we're selling at right now are at precrisis levels, which means that there isn't sort of recent sales going on -- no recent sales going on that are below prices people paid when they signed up a couple of years ago.  And in terms of square footage, you can find out if you're in the market. It does vary depending upon the units. But it's well north of $1,000 and could be north of $1,300 and $1,400, depending upon the unit."

When we look at comparisons with precrisis levels, what we look at are units that are truly comparable. And in a building like this where some buyers are buying multiple units, different floor sizes, different floor patterns, for us, there is some art as well as science to seeing what's comparable. So we don't think it's appropriate to throw out an overall number because it then becomes a weighted average of what you're selling. But as we've done the analysis like-for-like with precrisis sales, as Vasant says, we're at the same point. The biggest difference being previously, we were getting 20% deposits and today, we're getting north of 40%. And so that tells us 2 things. First of all, people really want to buy, and second of all, a 40% deposit on a $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $5 million purchase is a serious transaction and something not done speculatively. So we feel very good about certainly, the sales of late. And given the strength in the market, I feel better and better about the sales from before."

So '06, '07, when the market was frothy, many things were selling and selling at extraordinary prices in great volume. The market was off 90% as we went into the crisis.  And so we've definitely seen a pickup in volume, but that pickup in volume still leaves us with a transaction pace that's still south of certainly 1/2 and more and more like 30% or 40% of where it was. But that said, it continues to build.  And so we are seeing more buyers, not just from well-capitalized REITs who've been the most active buyers of late, but we continue to see more interest from high net worth individuals and sovereign wealth funds. But I don't think that the transaction market today is anywhere near where it will be once this recovery is fully underway. And that's one of the reasons that we continue to take assets to market, but we don't feel that this is the right time to be considering a much more substantial asset sales. We think the buyer end of the market has to be much deeper than where it is now. We'd see the right trends, exactly when that will happen, I think, is not something I'm ready to speculate on.

As in prior calls, today, I'll start by offering our perspective on global events and how they influence our business. Last time we spoke, the U.S. debt ceiling debate was in the news and today, all eyes are in Europe. And there is persistent talk of a possible hard landing in China. All these uncertainties eroded business confidence and global GDP growth has slid below 4% for the first time in 8 quarters. And while it seems unlikely we can't rollout the possibility that today's issues are trailing to a fall on double debt. What we can say is, that so far, this does not feel anything like 2009. And despite the headlines, the impact in Starwood is far less dramatic than you might think. Even in a lackluster economy, both our corporate and leisure customers are doing pretty well and still traveling. 
Right now in Europe, this austerity and weak recovery of slow demand growth, but the effect is not a drastic nor uniform across the region. And our business in many emerging markets continues along its strong trajectory. So with that as a back up, I'd like to turn for today's call. First, our recent results and an update on current state of our business and pipeline. Second, a review of what we've accomplished since 2007 and why we're positioned for 2012 and beyond. And third, our outlook for the rest of 2011 and our preliminary view of 2012.
So let's start with our Q3 results. We beat the high end of our guidance EBITDA by $6 million and EPS by $0.02. Worldwide REVPAR grew by over 7% and tight cost controls helped to drive 140 basis points increase in GOP margins. Our results led the market in the developed world. North American REVPAR increased 8% with growth in Phoenix at 23%, Honolulu 14%, San Francisco, 14% and New York, 5%. 
Europe's REVPAR grew by 7%, including Paris at 19%, Barcelona at 15% and Florence 8%. And in Tokyo, occupancies are recovering well from earlier this year, but REVPAR was still down 12% compared to last year pre-disaster.
These results pointed the resilience of both our fee businesses and the sustained growth in high end global travel. We are confident it trends will continue to work in our favor. And to explain why, let me reconcile the disconnect between economic headlines and our trend lines. 
Imagine a scenario, let's call it, Economy A with a land in the house, it has full employment, a record low interest rates, corporations flesh with prospects for global growth. Economy Asian was a little slack capacity in our industry and no near-term growth. Well, Economy A pretty much sums up the high end hotel business in the U.S. if not the rest of the developed world. Unemployment, among experienced college educated workers in the U.S. for example, is around 4%. Affluent households have low personal debt and our corporate customers are enjoying another year of growth, with expectations for the S&P 500 profits to be up 13%. And travel continues to remain the key to the pursuited growth around the world. In Economy A, we weren't surprised to see occupancies reach prior peak levels in the quarter and room supplies growing at 0.5%, which is a small fraction of its average over the last 4 decades. So the basic law of supply and demand will tell us the rates will continue arising, eventually they'll reach a point where they'll trigger new hotel development and from where we sit today, supply growth remains years away as few new projects are being financed.
Unfortunately, there is also an Economy B and it's the land of have-nots. Unemployment remains high for those who are less educated or experienced and government have limited availability to help. We love to see the situation change, which is why we've been so critical of U.S. Visa policy. The U.S. is missing a huge and entirely self funding opportunity to create jobs. 
Here's what I mean. The U.S. loss 1/3 of its share of global travel over the last decade. That represents 1.3 million jobs, equal to about 20% of the 7 million jobs the entire U.S. economy lost during the crisis. This isn't a pipe dream. Here's a case in point. Today, 5x as many Chinese visit the U.S. as Europe -- excuse me, 5x Chinese visit Europe as the U.S. because it's far easier to get a Visa to go to E.U. countries. We, at Starwood, would have been vocal with lawmakers in Washington, but it's frustrating for us not to mention the range of the unemployed, that this is not getting quickly resolve.
Meanwhile, the rapidly growing regions, those outside the U.S., Japan and Europe are forging ahead. Rising economies are fueling both REVPAR growth and their pipeline. Major new travel patterns are springing up, spreads by travel and by rising wealth among billions of people. And we extend the benefit that as these emerging travelers are loyal to brand they know from home and speak to their needs. 
And these dynamics are reflected in our Q3 results. Asia-Pacific REVPAR was up 16%, excluding Japan and Shanghai. Our Chinese hotels, ex-Shanghai will grow over 20%, led by Beijing at 24%. 
Bali was up 49%, Jakarta 14% and Mumbai, 11%. Latin America is also booming with REVPAR of 19%, including Rio at 38%, Cancún 29%, Mexico City, 25% and Buenos Aires, 24%. 
We are happy to see that the long way to recovery in Mexico is beginning to play out. REVPAR for African Middle East was down 2%, but in countries not touched by political turmoil, REVPAR increased 6%, both Doha and Addis Ababa were up 30% and Dubai was up 12%. 
Growth in Africa continues to reflect global demand for commodities. In North African in the Eastern Mediterranean, everything hinges on political stability and in the Gulf states, our footprint is expanding quickly so sustaining REVPAR will depend on demand arising in tandem ahead of supply.
Let me turn to our pipeline more broadly. We continue to reap the benefits of our work over decades and markets all around the world. We stand on the shoulders of strong brand awareness, local smart operating beams and reputation as a great partner. Now 80% of our pipeline lies outside the developed world, and get this, our emerging markets pipeline is a equal in size to 70% of our entire existing footprint in those countries.
On past calls, we've talked a lot about India and China, but we've always been quick to add that there are other dynamic countries and the recent visit to Indonesia highlights this point. Le Méridien and Sheraton have been active in these markets since the 1980s and we currently have 12 hotels. Among these are world class resorts in Bali like the St. Regis, the W Retreat, the Lagoon in and the Westin. 
We also have 7 Sheratons around the country and the Le Méridien into Jakarta. Our Indonesian footprint is nearly the same size as Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton combined. We have 4 more hotels under construction and a burgeoning list of others on the way. For example, we just signed the W Jakarta and Le Méridien Bali. My read is that Indonesia is poised for long-term growth with a young and growing population of 240 million, natural resources and major tourist destinations. In 5 years, our hotel count there could easily double.
And these hotels represent high-value management contracts for 5-star hotels with first dollar incentive fees. In valuing our global pipeline, remember the average non-U.S. managed luxury contract is about 3x the present value per room of a typical American mid-market franchise. This underscores the value of our pipeline, which is comprised of 80% of emerging markets, 84% managed contracts, and over 75% of our upscale and luxury hotels.
A couple of additional points regarding our pipeline. First, we have a track record of delivering growth. This year, we'll open about 80 new hotel, making for total of 320 since 2008. This should give you confidence that the majority of the 350 hotel  pipeline will open over the next 4 years. 
Our pipeline and momentum also enable us to be very selective about the right partners and the right contract. Over the long run, we've observed that it's far better for brands and owners to do the right thing than to compromise our standards for short-term gains.
And this longer term perspective leads me right into my second topic for the day, a look back on the progress we've made over the 4 years in transforming the company according to the Starwood journey as we call our long term strategy. 
When I joined Starwood over a little 4 years ago, I saw 3 key ingredients to creating value for shareholders. First, leveraging innovative brands to a period of unprecedented global growth. Second, bringing discipline to the top line growth and controlling costs. And third, unlocking value while transforming to asset like. 
So let me walk you to each of these. During our third quarter earnings call in 2007, I mentioned Starwood's Hyatt brands should allow the company to outperform over the long run. Major innovations like Westin bed, W and SPG no blackouts had set our brands apart. These brands were in a great place to benefit from rising wealth around the world. 
Consider our luxury brands. W once known as New York brand has more than doubled in size since 2007 from 20 hotels to 41, and it's gone global. The non-U.S. hotel count gone from 3 to 13 hotels and with over 30 more Ws expected to open in the coming years, W is on track to be the first high end brand created in the last 40 years to reach 100 hotels. 
St. Regis has enjoyed a similar trajectory. In 4 years, St. Regis has increased its footprint from 13 to 24 hotels and with 17 expected to open in the next 4 years, the brand will have more than tripled in less than a decade. About 90% of these openings will be outside of U.S. We also added 5,000 distinctive luxury collection rooms to our portfolio, including Equinox in Chad and Astro Hotel  in Tianjin. So with our 3 luxury brands, we've taken the largest portfolio of luxury hotels and grown the room count by 73% in just 4 years. 
Turning to Westin. The brand's positioning around renewal has turned into a global category killer. Since third quarter 2007, we've grown Westin by 35% of markets outside the U.S.. This includes 29 hotels in markets such as India, Dubai, China and South America. Our innovations at Westin and W have also helped us rethink the Sheraton Grande, leading to the Lincoln Sheraton and revamping Club Force. These concepts were coupled with nearly $10 billion of investment by us and their owners to reshape the hotel portfolio. We took 60 properties, renovated well over 100 and added 18 new hotels. And the result is we've been reporting for a while is record high in guest satisfaction, meeting planner satisfaction and likelihood to return. 
On a REVPAR index basis, we've gained 300 basis points worldwide since we launched the brand at the start of 2010.
We've also been hard at work on our next slate of innovations. Aloft just celebrated its third birthday and it's already passed the 50 hotel  milestone. 
With Q4 openings in Colombia and Costa Rica, Aloft has also gone global right out of the gate across North America, into Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, India, Southeast Asia and China. Aloft has redefined its category and in our view is at least as disruptive to its Conceptus as the W is to Luxury.
Regarding element, I can honestly say this brand is ahead of its time as the first select serve green brand and it's already delivering.In fact, the brand resonates so well that many travelers choose element over competing full-service hotels at comparable rates.
Innovation is as important to SPG as any of our hotel brands. They pioneered no blackouts, full access to luxury properties and its unique SPG moment program. Another point of differentiation is summed up by a more luxury and more locations campaign. 
 These features have helped drive enrollment, promotion and global relevance. The result, SPG share of occupancy is up 34% to 50% in just the past 5 years. Today, we have 35% more active members and in 2007, a non-U.S. membership is up 67%. Sooner, non-U.S. membership base will be larger than our U.S. base. 
So why does this matter? Simply put, SPG members spend more money and stay more. There's also the best insurance against hard times. In 2009, non-SPG room nights were up 9%, but SPG nights were actually up 2%.
So I hope this gives you the sense of the innovative spirit is not only alive and well at Starwood, but driving results. It's our nature to see what's happening in the wider world and to take action. This spirit is behind our going to the White House to shut down the rhetoric against travel, speaking out on national television in favor of tourist Visa reform, bringing our top 100 leaders to China, temporarily moving our headquarters to Shanghai and shifting almost 90% of our marketing spend to digital platforms and social media. Incidentally, we now have 1.5 million fans to our social media outlets.
The second big opportunity I saw in 2007 was great potential to bring more discipline and alignment to our innovative spirit. Through a rigorous AVA process, for example, we were able to reduce our SG&A by $100 million. And those savings have held even while at the hotel count is grown by 20%. 
As another example, our lean operation efforts have realized $100 million in savings across 90 hotels in North America alone. But discipline and alignment aren't just about efficiency. We've also successfully rolled out our up-to-date revenue management system to our hotels. We more than doubled the reach of these systems over the last 4 years to 530 hotels today. We've invested about $100 million to support our proprietary websites as well. To borrow a phrase, where you book maters, which is why savvy travelers book where they can get the best rates, SPG points and access to more properties. And that's why our own websites bring in about 3/4 of our total online revenue.
We've also taken the same discipline to building alignment and a culture that lets our associates be their best. We measure these through our annual star voice survey. This year, 96% of our 145,000 associates weighted in and for the fourth year in a row, we saw a significant increase in engagement. For the second year in a row, we reached record high results. So why does this matter? It's a simple premise. Happy associates mean happy guests, stronger brands and better returns. And note that guest satisfaction at our hotels and that's including 880 same-store hotels has risen in each of the last 4 years and is now at record levels.
The third opportunity I saw in 2007 was unlocking value by selling owned hotels and moving towards our goal of being 80% fee-driven. In 2007, fees are 45% of EBITDA before overhead. In 2011, we're on track to be over 60%. Despite the most difficult trade for in our lifetimes, our fees have increased by 13% since 2007. And we've reduced our fixed asset base during this tumultuous period. Our asset sales have averaged to multiple of 19x EBITDA and that doesn't count the value of renovation commitments or the value of management contracts. Our vacation ownership team has returned $700 million in cash to the company net of capital over the past 3 years.
These efforts leave us with a strong balance sheet, net debt under $1.7 billion. We've also invested significantly in our own hotels, IT infrastructure and the build-out of Bal Harbour. In an uncertain world, our approach continues to be plan for the worst, but be on offense.
So we'll continue transforming to asset light using, using our best judgment to balance timing, proceed to partners and management contracts. 
Right now, we're seeing weaker demand for hotel sales. The strongest buyers over the last couple of years has been the public lodging, and they pulled back. But we can afford to be patient. Our business model is resilient, thanks to a fee-based that's 75% top line driven. Even our incentive fees are less volatile. As almost entirely based on first dollar fees and are geographically dispersed.
In my remaining comments, I'll turn to my final topic of today, our outlook for the rest of 2011 and for 2012. 
We see the balance of this year in line with what we said in our Q2 call. In fact, it's essentially in line with what we expect for 2011 at this time last year. Full year EBITDA of $980 million to $990 million, and that's up 12% over last year before adjusting for asset sales not to mention North Africa and Japan, which would have added, by the way, about another 500 basis points to EBITDA had those not occurred. 
EPS will come in at around $1.75 to $1.79 for growth of over 40% and fully REVPAR remains 7% to 9%. 
Overall, for 2012, group is up mid-single digits, corporate rate negotiations are only just beginning but unlike last year, our customers expect higher rates as they the occupancy and virtually no new supply in key cities. As you may have seen in our earnings release, occupancy is at levels now where historically rates have always risen. And that's why we are targeting negotiated rate increases close to double digits. Bear in mind, we're still recouping rate loss during the downturn. Our worldwide REVPAR range of 4% to 8% reflects a sustained recovery at the high end and a more anemic one at the low end. It does not, however, contemplate Iraqi Lehman style resolution in Europe.We're not anticipating one either, but our balance sheet is set to manage through such a scenario. 
REVPAR at 48% will be consistent with EBITDA of $1.03 billion to $1.12 billion and EPS of $1.96 to $2.25 per share. These members include an estimated impact of about $20 million from created asset this year, planned innovations and foreign exchange. 
REVPAR growth implies a continued growth in market share of at least 100 basis points, and it implies a rigorous cost control. You'll note that between 2010 and 2012, we expect SG&A to be up only about 2% to 3% per year. We plan to reinvest significantly in our own hotels as Vasant will detail in just a few minutes. This will detract from EBITDA in 2012, but importantly, will position us well when the time comes to sell assets. 
Also, we're going to continue to step up investments in technology and systems as they form a critical part of how we plan to gain more share.
We expect to have ample cash in these investments, generated by operations, Bal Harbour and time share and as a reminder, we don't  budget for asset sales so if the transaction market improves, any sells will be an additional source of cash. 
So let me close my remarks by simply saying that we find ourselves entering 2012 in great shape. Our revenues are increasingly fee driven, our team is never been better aligned, and our properties are creating brand loyalty like never before. And at the same time, our balance sheet and strong cost disciplines had prepared us for whatever may come. 
So with that, let me hand it to Vasant."

The high anxiety about the global economy in newspapers and TV news channels is not evident in the actions of corporations and the global business traveler at this point. Q3 REVPAR globally was up 7.4% in lo",2011,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. The high anxiety about the global economy in newspapers and TV news channels is not evident in the actions of corporations and the global business traveler at this point. 
Q3 REVPAR globally was up 7.4% in local currencies and 11.6% in dollars. Our EBITDA and EPS once again exceeded the high end of our outlook range. Global owner REVPAR of Starwood Hotels was up 9.2% in local currencies, 16.2% in dollars. 
Good cost control pushed on margins up 265 basis points. Owned EBITDA was modestly below our expectations due to some soft spots in London and Rome, as well as a stronger dollar. We had healthy fee growth of 16.8% despite the drag from North Africa and Japan. Ex-North Africa and Japan, fee growth would have been 250 basis points higher. The case of vacation ownership business remains stable, with good door flow and close rates. SG&A benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals relative to last year, as well as the translation benefits of a stronger dollar. We gain market share globally, once again, all in all, it was a good solid quarter from our standpoint. 
So what is the state of our businesses as we enter the last leg of 2011? In North America, our company operates operated REVPAR was up 8.5% with rates up 5.1% and occupancy at 76%. Transient REVPAR grew 9% with group REVPAR up 7%. Company-operated GOP margins were higher than 200 basis points. Group base heading into Q4 I s good with more than 90% of group business already in the books. 
Secondly indicators like lead and cancellations also remained positive. Transient booking momentum remains strong and at this point, we are not seeing any changes in trend. 
As such, we are projecting that Q4 REVPAR growth in North America will remain generally in line with what we saw in Q3. We are closely watching Canada, which is showing some signs of softness partially due to the strong Canadian dollar.
While Europe has been the epicenter of the current crisis, we did not see it in our business in Q3. Q3 REVPAR was up 7.7% in local currencies, modestly below Q2 levels. The rate was up 5.2% with 1.8 points of occupancy growth. However, we have seen some softening in booking trends as we entered September. As such, we are projecting that Q4 REVPAR growth in Europe will be in the 3% to 4% range. 
At this point, it this too early to tell if this is a generalized trend or some locals soft spots. Hopefully the announcement last night on the euro rescue plan will improve business sentiment in Europe.
REVPAR in Africa and the Middle East declined once again in Q3, but the rate of decline moderated meaningfully from Q2 levels. As you all know, the situation in North Africa remains unstable and we do not expect to return to normalcy anytime soon. 
Year-over-year fee growth comparisons will suffer in Q4 since we do not expect to earn any incentive fees in North Africa, which are generally recorded in the fourth quarter. 
In total, on 2011 fees in North Africa will be down $10 million, which is in line with what we had estimated early this year.
Asia continues to fall along in Q3 with local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels up over 9%. Ex-Shanghai, which had the World Expo last year REVPAR across Asia was up 15.4%. 
China related economies was strong, while India was soft. Japan is slowly recovering with domestic travel coming back, but international travels remain subdued. The full year profit impact of Japan remains at around $20 million as estimated earlier this year. 
As we enter Q4, booking pace remains on trend, leads are up and cancellations are down. India is weak and Thailand is still really disrupted by the flood. As such, we expect small sequential slowdown in Asia REVPAR growth in Q4.
Latin America had a very good quarter with 24% REVPAR growth and good margin gains. We do not expect this level of growth to continue into Q4 based on current booking trends. Nevertheless, Latin America will grow in the double digits. 
Finally, as tourers are up and close rates versus last year. The business remains stable and predictable. We hope to complete the securitization in the fourth quarter if turns are attractive. This fall trends continue to improve and now at 2006 levels. 
Assuming we complete the securitization, SVO will generate over $200 million in cash in 2011. Our 2011 EBITDA is expected to come in at $980 million to $990 million in the middle of our original outlook range we provided you at the start of the year. Our REVPAR growth is as projected in the 7% to 9% range in local currencies. Volume in our margins will be up by 150 to 250 basis points, again as expected SG&A will increase 3% to 4% for the year. SVO will be at the high end of expectations. 
Year-to-date, we have opened 53 hotels and remain on track to open approximately 80 hotels in 2011. Our Q4 EBITDA range of $270 million to $280 million was negatively impacted by $4 million to $5 million since we last spoke due to the strengthening of the dollar. Owned Old EBITDA in Q4 will be negatively impacted by approximately $8 million versus last year due to renovations and preopening costs at our new St. Regis Bal Harbour. 
In the fourth quarter, we will recognize income from Bal Harbour residential unit closings in addition to our core EBITDA. I will discuss this in more detail later.
Moving on to our outlook for 2012. It goes without saying that there are risks and uncertainties are plenty as we try to look at our fourth quarter. first I'll outline, the reasons for optimism. Our focus on global corporations and high end traveler our Best-in-class brands and global footprint, especially in emerging markets. The unprecedented lack of new supply in developed markets, the inexorable rise of middle classes in emerging markets, the big unknown is the global economic outlook, it's impacting corporate profits and as a result, on demand for travel. 
As such, we are providing a broad range for 2012 at this point. The upper half of our 2012 range corresponds to the continuation of a normal cyclical recovery in lodging. Since early 2010, we've had a textbook lodging recovery very much in line with past recoveries despite GDP growth in developed markets. 
At this point, as evidenced by our Q4 outlook, that trend remains intact. 6% to 8% REVPAR growth and our the upper half of our EBITDA range would be in line with this Q4 momentum being sustained through 2012. 
However, the event of the past few months have highlighted the risks to this scenario. Declining trust in governments, the impact of de-leveraging by consumers and the general uncertainty this has resulted in could cause businesses to pull in their homes at the end of 2012. This could lead to the much talked about new normal scenario of low global growth. This outcome would correspond to the lower half of our REVPAR and EBITDA ranges.
If we actually have 4% REVPAR growth, the bottom of our range, owned EBITDA growth cut realized despite cost containment initiatives. SVO was relatively flat in all scenarios in synch with our strategy for this business so whatever we growth we get at a 4% REVPAR scenario would have to come from our fee business.
These 2 scenarios are captured in the outlook range we provided. If the crisis in Europe moves into an acute stage causing another global recession or another global financial crisis, then the 2012 REVPAR and EBITDA will be below our ranges. 
At this point, and especially after the actions announced last night, these outcomes appear very unlikely. We will make sure that we're well-prepared from a liquidity and leverage standpoint should a worst case scenario play out. By the time we talk to you again in early February, we will have another 3 months to track the recovery trend, more clarity on the results of corporate negotiations, more Group business on the books of 2012 and hopefully, a satisfactory resolution of the issues in Europe. 
This year, we started all the year by giving you a REVPAR range of 7% to 9% and an EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion and we will finish right in the middle of that range while absorbing the impact of Japan, North Africa and asset sales. We will be delighted if 2012 proves to be as predictable as 2011 was. 
One point to note is that on a year-to-year comparison basis, our EBITDA outlook range for 2012 is negatively impacted by approximately $20 million due to asset sales, renovations and exchange rate shifts. 
We will have some significant capital projects underway next year, including the shutdown of the Palace in Venice and the Maria Christina in Spain. Major renovations will also be on at The Westin Murray, The Westin and the Sheraton Rio. We are also shutting down 2 other hotels in the U.S. to convert them to Aloft. 
In terms of exchange rates impacts, as we have done in the past several years, we are hedged about half our euro profit exposure in 2012 at 1.44 to mitigate the euro risk as best we can. 
Not included in our 2012 outlook range is income from residential unit closings at Bal Harbour. TCO is coming as planned and we anticipate starting closing in mid-November. We have been in contact with buyers and expect that we will have several closings before the end of the year. The bulk of the closings with contracts previously signed will be in 2011. There will be significant revenue income and cash from Bal Harbour in 2012. We will provide more details on all these in February. We will separately identify Bal Harbour numbers, so you can clearly track performance of our core hotel business. 
As Bal Harbour flows through our income statement, it will affect our reported tax rate and our interest expense as capitalized interest is expensed. We will walk you through all these on our next call.
In the final analysis, it is all positive. Bal Harbour will to our revenue, earnings and cash in 2012. For 2011, we're estimating approximately $10 million in earnings, $0.03 in EPS and $30 million in cash. The numbers for 2012 will be substantially higher.
We continue to expect that we will generate almost $1 billion in revenue from selling all 307 condos at the St. Regis Bal Harbour. By the end of this year, we expect that 70% of this value will be under contract. Average price per square foot on units under contract exceeds $1,300. Sales have been robust year-to-date in 2011 well above our initial expectations. And since we are close to completion, we've asked foreign and received almost 50% in cash deposits on 2011 contracts. The spectacular 210 room St. Regis Bal Harbour Hotel, which we've a lot open early next year adding to the many iconic St. Regis hotels we opened worldwide over the past 3 years. 
All in all, we feel very good about this project, but would like to wait until February to provide more specific numbers on revenues, earnings and cash flow in 2012. The expectations with total cash proceeds from sellout of Bal Harbour as provided at our Investor Day last year remain unchanged. 
Finally, we finished Q3 with cash in excess of working capital needs of almost $1 billion, and net debt not inclusive of vacation ownership receivables of under $1.7 billion. 
Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7. Our priorities for cash used remain reinvesting in our business to drive growth in our pipeline in our owned hotels, paying down maturing debt and returning cash to shareholders. We will shortly announce our 2011 dividend and we'll execute start buybacks as we have in the past if our criteria are met. 
With that, I will pass this back to Jay."

The transaction market for hotels today is very slow and certainly well below its peak from 3 or 4 years ago and since we have the cash and we know that there's a broader set of potential buyers when you have a hotel that's already been renovated because one of the things you do is you take whatever renovation risk out of the picture, you also take whatever approval or any other uncertainties out and not only do you have a broader base set of buyers but also the potential for higher rise. So our point of view at this point is we have the balance sheet flexibility to invest in creating a slate of hotels that are in great shape with a proven track record and as Vasant mentioned the transaction market picks up were quickly in 2012 we may turn some of these projects over to a potential owner in the same way we did with St. Regis Aspen just a little while ago."

The inflation in the development side has still not compromise the economics of building hotels in China and that's true for a few reasons. First of all, historically, the cost of building hotels in a per room basis compared to the U.S. is half or less and so it's still relatively inexpensive to build. The second is, generally now, we're seeing development in the second and third tier cities and often times we are seeing are land that's are otherwise undeveloped being put to use with a mixed-use development. And the consequence of that is as developers speak with the government, we typically would be owning the land, they're able to get a favorable land price. and so because it will be creating value through the overall development that you're doing. So on a development basis, the economics are still quite favorable, on an operating basis, we are seeing GOPs on average in excess of 40%, and so the return side still looks very good."

So just kidding. But look, this is what we are doing philosophically. We do believe that with occupancies where they are, particularly in North America, and for that matter even in Europe, that it's all about rate right now and obviously a profitability of higher rates in terms of flow-through is not much better than occupancy. And given the strength and momentum in our brands, and the build in SPG, we have an opportunity to be pretty bold on the rate side there now no don't have that kind of influence over the franchise properties but what we are doing increasingly is using our revenue management system, which is a way of forecasting load and elasticity and giving our leadership but the proper to level more confidence in setting rates that might be above or their gut feel might put them at. Then finally was almost most important right now is not what we are dallying our GMs or our sales teams and property but what we are doing in terms of corporate rate negotiations and group sales. And making sure that we're leveraging the fact that we do have high occupancies today to your point the 2007 while the most recent peak was not a true peak because it was not a full completion of a business cycle and so we have a great opportunity there and that's philosophically why we're taking things. In terms of extra F&B spend, we're seeing some strength there. We've also worked by the way on continuously improving our margins from our Food & Beverage in our catering operations and so even if we weren't to see a complete recovery on the spend their comrades of missing better flow-through from what we have I think J was that something the top line part on F&B.

And therefore pretty good sense of what we would want to sell each of our hotels for, recognizing the time about value you and money back therefore the lower rice the data and some respects may be more attractive than higher priced tomorrow. But I'm going to back again. If you look at what has happened the transaction volumes for hotels, between 2007 at the peak and the trough at the crisis, the market was off by more than 90%. While the market is considerably higher than it was in the base, it is still not even have to transaction volume from where it was before. And is generally true in real estate that transaction volume is a good leading indicator for price which would tell you that there's still a long way to go for transaction volume to recover and therefore also to see prices increase. And with hotels today still trading generally at a pretty decent discount the replacement costs, our point of view is somewhat what's the bid ask spread to the as the expectation for what we could get for this hotels tomorrow that's off the time value of money year? In terms of the loan term view of the cash and the comment a lot of it, be said we talk a bit I wonder hand it back to you if you want to restate some of our thoughts about that it may be going back even to the post transaction where we have exactly the scenario."

Obviously, we said job one is reinvesting for growth we don't have as many owned hotels as we had before therefore that isn't going to be a large quantity of capital required in owned hotels, plus will be selling them down. We've already stepped up our investment in renovating owned hotels. So there's certain capital needed there, which might be lower if we sell this hotels sooner. The fee business as you know for growth and doesn't a lot of capital a couple of hundred million dollars a year is probably as high as it gets. The vacation ownership business we are not in a mode where growth is a tough job one, it's sort of stable business, it generate cash. So I think from the standpoint of our business, we always said that we wanted the business as we transition it that was a good cash generator while delivering growth. So we remain interested in a position that complement what we have. You saw Le Méridien the last time around, we will look at those if the price is right and its complementary. So brand that in recent as much not a priority for us to be buying real estate. So that is you can see sort of where the priorities would be in terms of reinvesting in our business. In terms of the leverage, we stated our goal is to be a solid BBB. So it's not like we intend to de-leverage significantly beyond that on any kind of permanent bases and we will be solid BBB we think hopefully in the next 12 months or so, which then leaves you to returning cash to shareholders which we did in substantial quantities coincident with the asset tells in the last 5 years. You know we did that in many different ways. And we will do that again. We are definitely a dividend payer we will be looking at increases in dividends. Will shortly announce our 2011 dividend. And we will be looking at other ways to return cash to shareholders once we take through the other priorities which can be buybacks or other means and we always focus on looking at intrinsic value as we look at buybacks. So hopefully that helps frame how we approach it."

As in prior calls, today, I'll start by offering our perspective on global events and how they influence our business. Last time we spoke, the U.S. debt ceiling debate was in the news and today, all eyes are on Europe. And there is persistent talk of a possible hard landing in China. All these uncertainties eroded business confidence and global GDP growth has slid below 4% for the first time in 8 quarters. And while it seems unlikely, we can't rule out the possibility that today's issues are a prelude to a full-on double dip. What we can say is, that so far, this does not feel anything like 2009. And despite the headlines, the impact on Starwood is far less dramatic than you might think. Even in a lackluster economy, both our corporate and leisure customers are doing pretty well and still traveling. 
Right now in Europe, this caused austerity and weak recovery of slow demand growth, but the effect is neither drastic nor uniform across the region, and our business in many emerging markets continues along its strong trajectory. So with that as a back up, I'd like to turn to 3 topics for today's call. First, our recent results and an update on the current state of our business and pipeline. Second, a review of what we've accomplished since 2007 and why we're positioned for 2012 and beyond. And third, our outlook for the rest of 2011 and our preliminary view of 2012.
So let's start with our Q3 results. We beat the high end of our guidance EBITDA by $6 million and EPS by $0.02. Worldwide REVPAR grew by over 7% and tight cost controls helped to drive 140 basis points increase in GOP margins. Our results led the market in the developed world. North American REVPAR increased 8% with growth in Phoenix at 23%; Honolulu, 14%; San Francisco, 14%; and New York, 5%. 
Europe's REVPAR grew by 7%, including Paris at 19%, Barcelona at 15% and Florence at 8%. And in Tokyo, occupancies are recovering well from earlier this year, but REVPAR was still down 12% compared to last year pre-disaster.
These results pointed the resilience of both our fee businesses and the sustained growth in high-end global travel. We're confident that the trends will continue to work in our favor. And to explain why, let me reconcile the disconnect between dismal economic headlines and our trend lines. 
Imagine a scenario, let's call it, Economy A where the land of the haves. It has full employment, a record low interest rates, corporations flush with cash and prospects for global growth. Economy A shows little slack capacity in our industry and no near-term growth. Well, Economy A pretty much sums up the high end hotel business in the U.S. if not the rest of the developed world. Unemployment among experienced college educated workers in the U.S. for example, is around 4%. Affluent households have low personal debt and our corporate customers are enjoying another year of growth, with expectations for the S&P 500 profits to be up 13%. And travel continues to remain the key to their pursuit of growth around the world. In Economy A, we weren't surprised to see occupancies reach prior peak levels in the quarter and room supply is growing at scant 0.5%, which is a small fraction of its average over the last 4 decades. So the basic law of supply and demand would tell us the rates will continue rising. Eventually, they'll reach a point where they trigger new hotel development and from where we sit today, supply growth remains years away as few new projects are being financed.
Unfortunately, there is also an Economy B and it's the land of have-nots. Unemployment remains high for those who are less educated or experienced and governments have limited availability to help. We love to see the situation change, which is why we've been so critical of U.S. Visa policy. The U.S. is missing a huge, an entirely self-funding opportunity to create jobs. 
Here's what I mean. The U.S. lost 1/3 of its share of global travel over the last decade. That represents 1.3 million jobs, equal to about 20% of the 7 million jobs the entire U.S. economy lost during the crisis. This isn't a pipe dream. Here's a case in point. Today, 5x as many Chinese visit the U.S. as Europe -- excuse me, 5x as many Chinese visit Europe as the U.S. because it's far easier to get a Visa to go to EU countries. We, at Starwood, have been vocal with lawmakers in Washington, but it's frustrating for us not to mention the range of the unemployed, but this is not getting quickly resolved.
Meanwhile, the rapidly growing regions, those outside the U.S., Japan and Europe are forging ahead. Rising economies are fueling both REVPAR growth and their pipeline. Major new travel patterns are springing up, spurred by travel and by rising wealth among billions of people. And we stand the benefit as these emerging travelers are loyal to brands they know from home and that speak to their needs. 
And these dynamics are reflected in our Q3 results. Asia-Pacific REVPAR was up 16%, excluding Japan and Shanghai. Our Chinese hotels x Shanghai grew over 20%, led by Beijing at 24%. 
Bali was up 49%; Jakarta, 14%; and Mumbai, 11%. Latin America is also booming with REVPAR of 19%; including Rio at 38%; Cancún, 29%; Mexico City, 25%; and Buenos Aires, 24%. 
And we're happy to see that the long awaited lodging recovery in Mexico is beginning to play out. REVPAR for African and the Middle East was down 2%. But in countries not touched by political turmoil, REVPAR increased 6%, both Doha and Addis Ababa were up 30% and Dubai was up 12%. 
Growth in Africa continues to reflect global demand for commodities. In North African in the Eastern Mediterranean, everything hinges on political stability and in the Gulf states, our footprint is expanding quickly. So sustaining REVPAR will depend on demand rising in tandem or ahead of supply.
Let me turn to our pipeline more broadly. We continue to reap the benefits of our work over the decades in markets all around the world. We stand on the shoulders of strong brand awareness, local smart operating teams and reputation as a great partner. Now 80% of our pipeline lies outside the developed world, and get this, our emerging market pipeline is a equal in size to 70% of our entire existing footprint in those countries.
On past calls, we've talked a lot about India and China, but we've always been quick to add that there are other dynamic countries and a recent visit to Indonesia highlights this point. Le Méridien and Sheraton have been active in these markets since the 1980s and we currently have 12 hotels. Among these are world class resorts in Bali like the St. Regis, the W Retreat, the Lagoon in Nusa Dua and the Westin. 
We also have 7 Sheratons around the country and Le Méridien in Jakarta. Our Indonesian footprint is nearly the same size as Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton combined. We have 4 more hotels under construction and a burgeoning list of others on the way. For example, we just signed the W Jakarta and Le Méridien Bali. My read is that Indonesia is poised for long-term growth with a young and growing population of 240 million, natural resources and major tourist destinations. In 5 years, our hotel count there could easily double.
And these hotels represent high-value management contracts for 5-star hotels with first-dollar incentive fees. In valuing our global pipeline, remember that the average non-U.S. managed luxury contract is about 3x the present value per room of a typical American mid-market franchise. This underscores the value of our pipeline, which is comprised 80%, emerging markets; 84%, managed contracts; and over 75%, upper upscale and luxury hotels.
A couple of additional points regarding our pipeline. First, we have a track record of delivering growth. This year, we'll open about 80 new hotel, making for a total of 320 since 2008. This should give you confidence that the majority of the 350 hotel pipeline will open over the next 4 years. 
Our pipeline and momentum also enable us to be very selective about the right partners and the right contracts. Over the long run, we've observed that it's far better for brands and owners to do the right thing than to compromise our standards for short-term gains.
And this longer-term perspective leads me right into my second topic for the day, a look back on the progress we've made over the 4 years in transforming the company according to the Starwood journey as we call our long-term strategy. 
When I joined Starwood a little over 4 years ago, I saw 3 key ingredients to creating value for shareholders. First, leveraging innovative brands through a period of unprecedented global growth. Second, bringing discipline to the top line growth and controlling costs. And third, unlocking value while transforming to asset light. 
So let me walk through each of these. During our third quarter earnings call in 2007, I mentioned that Starwood's high-end brands should allow the company to outperform over the long run. Major innovations like Westin Heavenly Bed, W and SPG No Blackouts had set our brands apart. These brands were in a great place to benefit from rising wealth around the world. 
Consider our luxury brands. W once known as a New York brand has more than doubled in size since 2007 from 20 hotels to 41, and it's gone global. The non-U.S. hotel count has gone from 3 to 13 hotels and with over 30 more Ws expected to open in the coming years, W is on track to be the first high-end brand created in the last 40 years to reach 100 hotels. 
St. Regis has enjoyed a similar trajectory. In 4 years, St. Regis has increased its footprint from 13 to 24 hotels and with 17 expected to open in the next 4 years, the brand will have more than tripled in less than a decade. About 90% of these openings will be outside of the U.S. We also added 5,000 distinctive luxury collection rooms to our portfolio, including Equinox, [indiscernible] and Astor Hotel in Tianjin. So with our 3 luxury brands, we've taken the largest portfolio of luxury hotels and grown the room count by 73% in just 4 years. 
Turning to Westin. The brand's positioning around renewal has turned into a global category killer. Since third quarter 2007, we've grown Westin by 35% of markets outside the U.S. This includes 29 hotels in new markets such as India, Dubai, China and South America. Our innovations at Westin and W have also helped us rethink the Sheraton Grande, leading to the Lincoln Sheraton and revamping club force. These concepts were coupled with nearly $10 billion of investment by us and their owners to reshape the hotel portfolio. We took out 60 properties, renovated well over 100 and added 80 new hotels. And the result as we've been reporting for a while is record highs in guest satisfaction, meeting planner satisfaction and likelihood to return. 
On a REVPAR index basis, we've gained 300 basis points worldwide since relaunching the brand at the start of 2010.
We've also been hard at work on our next slate of innovations. Aloft just celebrated its third birthday and has already passed the 50-hotel  milestone. 
With Q4 openings in Colombia and Costa Rica, Aloft has also gone global right out of the gate across North America, into Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, India, Southeast Asia and China. Aloft has redefined its category and in our view, is at least as disruptive to its concept as the W is to Luxury.
Regarding element, I can honestly say this brand is ahead of its time as the first select serve green brand and it's already delivering. In fact, the brand resonates so well that many travelers choose element over competing full-service hotels at comparable rates.
Innovation is as important to SPG as any of our hotel brands. They pioneered No Blackouts, full access to luxury properties and its unique SPG Moments program. Another point of differentiation is summed up by our more luxury and more locations campaign. 
These features have helped drive enrollment, promotion and global relevance. The result, SPG share of occupancy is up 34% to 50% in just the past 5 years. Today, we have 35% more active members and in 2007, a non-U.S. membership is up 67%. Sooner, non-U.S. membership base will be larger than our U.S. base. 
So why does this matter? Simply put, SPG members spend more money and stay more. They're also the best insurance against hard times. In 2009, non-SPG room nights were up 9%, but SPG nights were actually up 2%.
So I hope this gives you the sense that the innovative spirit is not only alive and well at Starwood, but driving results. It's our nature to see what's happening in the wider world and to take action. This spirit is behind and going to the White House to shut down the rhetoric against travel, speaking out on national television in favor of tourist Visa reform, bringing our top 100 leaders to China, temporarily moving our headquarters to Shanghai and shifting almost 90% of our marketing spend to digital platforms and social media. Incidentally, we now have 1.5 million fans through our social media outlets.
The second big opportunity I saw in 2007 was great potential to bring more discipline and alignment to our innovative spirit. Through a rigorous AVA process, for example, we were able to reduce our SG&A by $100 million. And those savings have held even while the hotel count has grown by 20%. 
As another example, our lean operations efforts have realized $100 million in savings across 90 hotels in North America alone. But discipline and alignment aren't just about efficiency. We've also successfully rolled out our up-to-date revenue management system to our hotels. We more than doubled the reach of these systems over the last 4 years to 530 hotels today. We've invested about $100 million to support our proprietary websites as well. To borrow a phrase, where you book matters, which is why savvy travelers book where they can get the best rates, SPG points and access to more properties. And that's why our own websites bring in about 3/4 of our total online revenue.
We've also taken the same discipline to building alignment and a culture that lets our associates be their best. We measure this through our annual star voice survey. This year, 96% of our 145,000 associates weighed in and for the fourth year in a row, we saw a significant increase in engagement. For the second year in a row, we reached record-high results. So why does this matter? It's a simple premise. Happy associates mean happy guests, stronger brands and better returns. And note that guest satisfaction at our hotels and that's including 880 same-store hotels has risen in each over the last 4 years and is now at record levels.
The third opportunity I saw in 2007 was unlocking value by selling owned hotels and moving towards our goal of being 80% fee-driven. In 2007, fees drove 45% of EBITDA before overhead. In 2011, we're on track to be over 60%. Despite the most difficult trades for lodging in our lifetimes, our fees have increased by 13% since 2007. And we've reduced our fixed asset base during this tumultuous period. Our asset sales have averaged a multiple of 19x EBITDA and that doesn't count the value of renovation commitments or the value of management contracts. Our vacation ownership team has returned $700 million in cash to the company net of capital over the past 3 years.
These efforts leave us with a strong balance sheet, net debt under $1.7 billion. We've also invested significantly in our own hotels, IT infrastructure and the build-out of Bal Harbour. In an uncertain world, our approach continues to be plan for the worst, but be on offense.
So we'll continue transforming to asset light using, using our best judgment to balance timing, proceeds, partners and management contracts. 
Right now, we're seeing weaker demand for hotel sales. The strongest buyers over the last couple of years has been the public lodging REITs, and they pulled back. But we can afford to be patient. Our business model is resilient, thanks to a fee-based that's 75% top line driven. Even our incentive fees are less volatile as it's almost entirely based on first-dollar fees and are geographically dispersed.
In my remaining comments, I'll turn to my final topic of today, our outlook for the rest of 2011 and for 2012. 
We see the balance of this year in line with what we've said in our Q2 call. In fact, it's essentially in line with what we expect for 2011 at this time last year. Full year EBITDA of $980 million to $990 million, and that's up 12% over last year before adjusting for asset sales, not to mention North Africa and Japan, which would have added, by the way, about another 500 basis points to EBITDA had those not occurred. 
EPS will come in at around $1.75 to $1.79 for growth of over 40% and fully REVPAR remains 7% to 9%. 
Overall, for 2012, group pace is up mid-single digits, corporate rate negotiations are only just beginning but unlike last year, our customers expect higher rates as they see occupancy and virtually no new supply in key cities. As you may have seen in our earnings release, occupancy is at levels now where historically rates have always risen. And that's why we are targeting negotiated rate increases close to double digits. Bear in mind, we're still recouping rate loss during the downturn. Our worldwide REVPAR range of 4% to 8% reflects a sustained recovery at the high end and a more anemic one at the low end. It does not, however, contemplate Iraqi Lehman style resolution in Europe.We're not anticipating one either, but our balance sheet is set to manage through such a scenario. 
REVPAR at 48% would be consistent with EBITDA of $1.03 billion to $1.12 billion and EPS of $1.96 to $2.25 per share. These members include an estimated impact of about $20 million from created asset sales this year, planned renovations and foreign exchange. 
REVPAR growth implies a continued growth in market share of at least 100 basis points, and it implies rigorous cost control. You'll note that between 2010 and 2012, we expect SG&A to be up only about 2% to 3% per year. We plan to reinvest significantly in our own hotels as Vasant will detail in just a few minutes. This will detract from EBITDA in 2012, but importantly, will position us well when the time comes to sell assets. 
Also, we're going to continue to step up investments in technology and systems as they form a critical part of how we plan to gain more share.
We expect to have ample cash from these investments, generated by operations, Bal Harbour and time share and as a reminder, we don't  budget for asset sales. So if the transaction market improves, any sales will be an additional source of cash. 
So let me close my remarks by simply saying that we find ourselves entering 2012 in great shape. Our revenues are increasingly fee driven, our team has never been better aligned, and our properties are creating brand loyalty like never before. And at the same time, our balance sheet and strong cost discipline had prepared us for whatever may come. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Vasant."
341584,141337383,179363,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. The high anxiety about the global economy in newspapers and TV news channels is not evident in the actions of global corporations and the global business traveler at this point. Q3 REVPAR globally was up 7.4",2016,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. The high anxiety about the global economy in newspapers and TV news channels is not evident in the actions of global corporations and the global business traveler at this point. 
Q3 REVPAR globally was up 7.4% in local currencies and 11.6% in dollars. Our EBITDA and EPS once again exceeded the high end of our outlook range. Global owner REVPAR at Starwood branded hotels was up 9.2% in local currencies, 16.2% in dollars. 
Good cost control pushed owned margins up 265 basis points. Owned EBITDA was modestly below our expectations due to some soft spots in London and Rome, as well as the stronger dollar. We had healthy fee growth of 16.8% despite the drag from North Africa and Japan. X North Africa and Japan, fee growth would have been 250 basis points higher. The Vacation Ownership business remains stable, with good door flow and close rates. SG&A benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals relative to last year, as well as the translation benefits of a stronger dollar. We gain market share globally, once again, all in all, it was a good solid quarter from our standpoint. 
So what is the state of our businesses as we enter the last leg of 2011? In North America, our company operated REVPAR was up 8.5% with rates up 5.1% and occupancy at 76%. Transient REVPAR grew 9% with group REVPAR up 7%. Company-operated GOP margins were higher by 200 basis points. Group base heading into Q4 is good with more than 90% of group business already on the books. 
Secondary indicators like leaves and cancellations also remained positive. Transient booking momentum remains strong and at this point, we are not seeing any changes in trend. 
As such, we are projecting that Q4 REVPAR growth in North America will remain generally in line with what we saw in Q3. We are closely watching Canada, which is showing some signs of softness partially due to the strong Canadian dollar.
While Europe has been the epicenter of the current crisis, we did not see it in our business in Q3. Q3 REVPAR was up 7.7% in local currencies, modestly below Q2 levels. The rate was up 5.2% with 1.8 points of occupancy growth. However, we have seen some softening in booking trends as we entered September. As such, we are projecting that Q4 REVPAR growth in Europe will be in the 3% to 4% range. 
At this point, it is too early to tell if this is a generalized trend or some local soft spots. Hopefully the announcement last night on the euro rescue plan will improve business sentiment in Europe.
REVPAR in Africa and the Middle East declined once again in Q3, but the rate of decline moderated meaningfully from Q2 levels. As you all know, the situation in North Africa remains unstable and we do not expect to return to normalcy anytime soon. 
Year-over-year fee growth comparisons will suffer in Q4 since we do not expect to earn any incentive fees in North Africa, which are generally recorded in the fourth quarter. 
In total, our 2011 fees in North Africa will be down $10 million, which is in line with what we had estimated early this year.
Asia continues to power along in Q3 with local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels up over 9%. X Shanghai, which had the World Expo last year, REVPAR across Asia was up 15.4%. 
China related economies was strong, while India was soft. Japan is slowly recovering with domestic travel coming back, but international travel remain subdued. The full year profit impact of Japan remains at around $20 million as estimated earlier this year. 
As we enter Q4, booking pace remains on trend, leads are up and cancellations are down. India is weak and Thailand is still really disrupted by the floods. As such, we expect a small sequential slowdown in Asia REVPAR growth in Q4.
Latin America had a very good quarter with 24% REVPAR growth and good margin gains. We do not expect this level of growth to continue into Q4 based on current booking trends. Nevertheless, Latin America will grow in the double digits. 
Finally, tourers are up as of close rates versus last year. The business remains stable and predictable. We hope to complete the securitization in the fourth quarter if turns are attractive. Default trends continue to improve and are now at 2006 levels. 
Assuming we complete the securitization, SVO will generate over $200 million in cash in 2011. Our 2011 EBITDA is expected to come in at $980 million to $990 million in the middle of our original outlook range we provided you at the start of the year. Our REVPAR growth is as projected in the 7% to 9% range in local currencies. Volume in our margins will be up by 150 to 250 basis points, again as expected. SG&A will increase 3% to 4% for the year. SVO will be at the high end of expectations. 
Year-to-date, we have opened 53 hotels and remain on track to open approximately 80 hotels in 2011. Our Q4 EBITDA range of $270 million to $280 million was negatively impacted by $4 million to $5 million since we last spoke due to the strengthening of the dollar. Owned EBITDA in Q4 will be negatively impacted by approximately $8 million versus last year due to renovations and preopening costs at our new St. Regis Bal Harbour. 
In the fourth quarter, we will recognize income from Bal Harbour residential unit closings in addition to our core EBITDA. I will discuss this in more detail later.
Moving on to our outlook for 2012. It goes without saying that there are risks and uncertainties are plenty as we try to look ahead 4 quarters. First, I'll outline the reasons for optimism. Our focus on global corporation and high-end traveler, our Best-in-class brands and global footprint, especially in emerging markets. The unprecedented lack of new supply in developed markets, the inexorable rise of middle classes in emerging markets, the big unknown is the global economic outlook, it's impact on corporate profits and as a result, on demand for travel. 
As such, we are providing a broad range for 2012 at this point. The upper half of our 2012 range corresponds to the continuation of a normal cyclical recovery in lodging. Since early 2010, we've had a textbook lodging recovery very much in line with past recoveries despite subpar GDP growth in developed markets. 
At this point, as evidenced by our Q4 outlook, that trend remains intact. 6% to 8% REVPAR growth and the upper half of our EBITDA range would be in line with this Q4 momentum being sustained through 2012. 
However, the events of the past few months have highlighted the risks of this scenario. Declining trust in governments, the impact of de-leveraging by consumers and the general uncertainty this has resulted in could cause businesses to pull in their homes as we enter 2012. This could lead to the much talked about new normal scenario of low global growth. This outcome would correspond to the lower half of our REVPAR and EBITDA ranges.
If we actually have 4% REVPAR growth, the bottom of our range, owned EBITDA becomes hard to realize despite our cost containment initiatives. SVO was relatively flat in all scenarios, in synch with our strategy for this business. So whatever we grow -- whatever growth we get at a 4% REVPAR scenario will have to come from our fee business.
These 2 scenarios are captured in the outlook range we provided. If the crisis in Europe moves to an acute stage causing another global recession or another global financial crisis, then the 2012 REVPAR and EBITDA will be below our ranges. 
At this point, and especially after the actions announced last night, these outcomes appear very unlikely. We will make sure that we're well-prepared from a liquidity and leverage standpoint should a worst case scenario play out. By the time we talk to you again in early February, we will have another 3 months to track the recovery trend, more clarity on the results of corporate negotiations, more group business on the books for 2012 and hopefully, a satisfactory resolution of the issues in Europe. 
This year, we started out the year by giving you a REVPAR range of 7% to 9% and an EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion and we will finish right in the middle of that range while absorbing the impact of Japan, North Africa in asset sales. We will be delighted if 2012 proves to be as predictable as 2011 was. 
One point to note is that on a year-to-year comparison basis, our EBITDA outlook range for 2012 is negatively impacted by approximately $20 million due to asset sales, renovations and exchange rate shifts. 
We will have some significant capital projects underway next year, including the shutdown of the Gritti Palace in Venice and the Maria Christina in Spain. Major renovations will also be on at The Westin Maui, The Westin Peachtree and the Sheraton Rio. We are also shutting down 2 other hotels in the U.S. to convert them to Alofts. 
In terms of exchange rates impacts, as we have done for the past several years, we'll hedge about half our euro profit exposure in 2012 at 1.44 to mitigate the euro risk as best we can. 
Not included in our 2012 outlook range is income from residential unit closings at Bal Harbour. TCOs are coming in as planned and we anticipate starting closing in mid-November. We have been in contact with buyers and expect that we will have several closings before the end of the year. The bulk of the closings with contracts previously signed will be in 2011. There will be significant revenue income and cash from Bal Harbour in 2012. We will provide more details on all this in February. We will separately identify Bal Harbour numbers, so you can clearly track performance of our core hotel business. 
As Bal Harbour flows through our income statement, it will affect our reported tax rate and our interest expense as capitalized interest is expensed. We will walk you through all this on our next call.
In the final analysis, it is all positive. Bal Harbour will add to our revenue, earnings and cash in 2012. For 2011, we're estimating approximately $10 million in earnings, $0.03 in EPS and $30 million in cash. The numbers of 2012 will be substantially higher.
We continue to expect that we will generate almost $1 billion in revenue from selling all 307 condos at the St. Regis Bal Harbour. By the end of this year, we expect that 70% of this value will be under contract. Average price per square foot on units under contract exceeds $1,300. Sales have been robust year-to-date in 2011, well above our initial expectations. And since we are close to completion, we've asked for and received almost 50% in cash deposits on 2011 contracts. The spectacular 210 room St. Regis Bal Harbour Hotel, which we've a loan opens early next year adding to the many iconic St. Regis hotels we opened worldwide over the past 3 years. 
All in all, we feel very good about this project, but would like to wait until February to provide more specific numbers on revenues, earnings and cash flow in 2012. The expectations with total cash proceeds from sellout of Bal Harbour as provided at our Investor Day last year remain unchanged. 
Finally, we finish Q3 with cash in excess of working capital needs of almost $1 billion, and net debt noninclusive of vacation ownership receivables of under $1.7 billion. 
Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7. Our priorities for cash used remain reinvesting in our business to drive growth in our pipeline in our owned hotels, paying down maturing debt and returning cash to shareholders. We will shortly announce our 2011 dividend and we'll execute start buybacks as we have in the past if our criteria are met. 
With that, I will pass this back to Jay."

So our point of view at this point is we have the balance sheet flexibility to invest in creating a slate of hotels that are in great shape with a proven track record and as Vasant mentioned, if the transaction market picks up more quickly in 2012, we may turn some of these projects over to a potential owner in the same way we did with St. Regis Aspen just a little while ago."

Despite the increased CapEx that we talked about, there will be of course a reduction in Bal Harbour in terms of capital needs and there will be cash from Bal Harbour. We would estimate free cash flow at least in the $250  million to $350 million range after payment of dividends. So maybe a little higher than that once you consider dividends. So let's say $350 million to $400 million cash flow. As far as China goes and Frits I'm sure will add to this, [indiscernible] hotels, we're not minimum wage. Our people need a certain level of education, need some proficiency with English. We've always been about the minimum wage. Yes, there's the inflation, but the wage rate, I mean, the labor costs as a percentage of total revenue remains quite low in China. And so far, it has not had meaningful impacts on hotel performance, nor have we seen that as a reason for why people would pull back from hotel construction."

The inflation in the development side has still not compromised the economics of building hotels in China and that's true for a few reasons. First of all, historically, the cost to build a hotel in a per room basis compared to the U.S. is half or less. And so it's still relatively inexpensive to build. The second is generally now, we're seeing development in the second and third tier cities and often times what we're seeing are land that's otherwise undeveloped, it's being put to use with a mixed-use development. And the consequence of that is as developers speak with the government, who typically would be owning the land, they're able to get a very favorable land price. And so because it will be creating value through the overall development that they're doing. So on a development basis, the economics are still quite favorable. On an operating basis, we're seeing GOPs on average in excess of 40%. And so the return side still looks very good."

So, Steven, this is Frits, and I think there was a wise analyst who put out a report that said that management has little to gain by offering precise predictions. So -- just kidding but -- hey, look, here's what we're doing philosophically. We do believe that with occupancies where they are, particularly in North America, and for that matter, even in Europe, that it's all about rate now and that obviously the profitability of higher rates in terms of flow-through is that much better than occupancy. And given the strength and momentum in our brands, and the build in SPG, we have an opportunity to be pretty bold on the rate side. Now we don't have that kind of influence over the franchise properties but what we are doing increasingly is using our revenue management system, which is a way of forecasting load and elasticity and giving our leadership at the proper to level more confidence in setting rates that might be above where their gut feel might put them at. And then finally, what's almost most important right now is not what we're telling our GMs or our sales teams on property but what we're doing in terms of corporate rate negotiations and group sales. And making sure that we're leveraging the fact that we do have high occupancies today. To your point, the 2007, while the most recent peak was not a true peak because it was not a full completion of a business cycle. And so we have a great opportunity there and that's philosophically the way we're taking things. In terms of extra F&B spend, we're seeing some strength there. We've also worked by the way on continuously improving our margins from our Food & Beverage in our catering operations. And so even if we weren't to see a complete recovery on the spend there, we're absolutely seeing better flow-through from what we have. I think Jay wants to add something the top line part on F&B.

I mentioned publicly-traded U.S. REITs, but for that matter sovereign well funds, high net worth individuals around the world, private equity firms, other institutions and so forth. And the demand and the confidence right now still isn't there. If for no other reason because of the financing market today, and I think from a U.S. REIT market perspective, since equity is an important part of how the finance their deals and their stocks have taken a hit along with the broader sector, the opportunity to sell right now candidly isn't one that we think is very strong and that we've rather hold -- invest in our assets and find a time where we can get a strong price. And the reason, I mentioned the average multiple, the EBITDA in my comments for what we sold over the last 4 years is to give you confidence that the reason we're not selling faster isn't any fundamental reluctance to sell, but a belief that there is a time, a place, a buyer, a contract that makes optimal sense. And from what you're seeing right now, the current market isn't really there. as far as stock buy backs, I think Vasant has put  it well in the past and it's something we said very consistently that once we've gotten to investment grade, once we feel like our balance sheet is where we to be, should we come into considerable cash throughout the dispositions, which is an eventuality, then we would certainly look at ways to return cash to shareholders and we've talked about dividends, special dividend, buybacks, looking at investing in our business, of course, as being the top priority.

So all of those submarkets are fairly distinct and not necessarily as directly driven by what's happening in the financial community. And the fact the performance of New York because of the inbound tourist flow, if we can get Visa reform, which would allow more people to come in, New York would be literally one of the first ports of call.

This isn't a liquid market where we see trades day to day. We have a good sense from each of our properties for having studied them what the capital needs are, what the likely REVPAR numbers and cash flows would be depending on which scenario you pick overall. And therefore, a pretty good sense of what we would want to sell each of our hotels for, recognizing the time value money impact and therefore that a lower price today in some respects may be more attractive than higher price tomorrow. But I'm going to back to it again. If you look at what has happened to transaction volumes for hotels between 2007 at the peak and the trough at the crisis, the market was off by more than 90%. And while the market is considerably higher than it was in the base, it's still not even half the transaction volume from where it was before. And it's generally true in real estate that transaction volume is a good leading indicator for price which would tell you that there's still a long way to go for transaction volume to recover and therefore also to see prices increase. And with hotels today still trading generally at a pretty decent discount to replacement costs, our point of view isn't so much what's the bid/ask spread today as the expectation for what we could get for these hotels tomorrow net of the time value of money. In terms of the long-term view to cash and the fact that we're coming into a lot of it, Vasant talked a bit about that and I'm going to hand it back to you if you want to more ore less restate some of our thoughts about that and maybe going back even to the host transaction where we have exactly this scenario."

Obviously, we said job one is reinvest in our business for growth. We don't have as many owned hotels as we had before. Therefore there isn't going to be a large quantity of the capital required in owned hotels, plus we will be selling them down. We've already stepped up our investment in renovating owned hotels. So there's a certain capital needed there, which might be lower if we sell these hotels sooner. The fee business as you know for growth doesn't need a lot of capital. A couple of hundred million dollars a year is probably as high as it gets. The Vacation Ownership business we are not in a mode where growth is sort of job one, it's more about a stable business that generates cash. So I think from the standpoint of our business, we always said that we wanted a business as we transitioned it that was a good cash generator while delivering growth. So we remain interested in a acquisitions that complement what we have. You saw Le Méridien the last time around, we will look at those if the price is right and its complementary. Certainly more brand, not interested as much or is not a priority for us to be buying real estate. So that's -- so you can see sort of where the priorities would be in terms of reinvesting in our business. In terms of the leverage, we've stated that our goal is to be a solid BBB. So it's not like we intend to de-leverage significantly beyond that on any kind of permanent basis and we will be solid BBB we think hopefully in the next 12 months or so, which then leaves you to returning cash to shareholders which we did in substantial quantities coincident with the asset sales in the last 5 years. We did that in many different ways, and we will do that again. We are definitely a dividend payer and we'll be looking at increases in dividends. We'll shortly announce our 2011 dividend, and we will be looking at other ways to return cash to shareholders once we tick through the other priorities which can be buybacks or other means and we always focus on looking at intrinsic value as we look at buybacks.

As in prior calls, today, I'll start by offering our perspective on global events and how they influence our business. Last time we spoke, the U.S. debt ceiling debate was in the news and today, all eyes are on Europe. And there is persistent talk of a possible hard landing in China. All this uncertainty eroded business confidence and global GDP growth has slid below 4% for the first time in 8 quarters. And while it seems unlikely, we can't rule out the possibility that today's issues are a prelude to a full-on double dip. What we can say is, that so far, this does not feel anything like 2009. And that despite the headlines, the impact on Starwood is far less dramatic than you might think. Even in a lackluster economy, both our corporate and leisure customers are doing pretty well and still traveling. 
Right now in Europe, this caused austerity and weak recovery of slow demand growth, but the effect is neither drastic nor uniform across the region, and our business in many emerging markets continues along a strong trajectory. So with that as a back up, I'd like to turn to 3 topics for today's call. First, our recent results and an update on the current state of our business and pipeline. Second, a review of what we've accomplished since 2007 and why we're positioned for 2012 and beyond. And third, our outlook for the rest of 2011 and our preliminary view of 2012.
So let's start with our Q3 results. We beat the high end of our guidance EBITDA by $6 million and EPS by $0.02. Worldwide REVPAR grew by over 7% and tight cost controls helped to drive 140 basis points increase in GOP margins. Our results led the market in the developed world. North American REVPAR increased 8% with growth in Phoenix at 23%; Honolulu, 14%; San Francisco, 14%; and New York, 5%. 
Europe's REVPAR grew by 7%, including Paris at 19%, Barcelona at 15% and Florence at 8%. And in Tokyo, occupancies are recovering well from earlier this year, but REVPAR was still down 12% compared to last year pre-disaster.
These results point to the resilience of both our fee businesses and the sustained growth in high-end global travel. We're confident that the trends will continue to work in our favor. And to explain why, let me reconcile the disconnect between dismal economic headlines and our trend lines. 
Imagine a scenario, let's call it, Economy A, or the land of the haves. It has full employment, record low interest rates, corporations flush with cash and prospects for global growth. Economy A shows little slack capacity in our industry and no near-term growth. Well, Economy A pretty much sums up the high-end hotel business in the U.S. if not the rest of the developed world. Unemployment among experienced college educated workers in the U.S. for example, is around 4%. Affluent households have low personal debt and our corporate customers are enjoying another year of growth, with expectations for the S&P 500 profits to be up 13%. And travel continues to remain the key to their pursuit of growth around the world. In Economy A, we weren't surprised to see occupancies reach prior peak levels in the quarter and room supply is growing at scant 0.5%, which is a small fraction of its average over the last 4 decades. So the basic law of supply and demand would tell us the rates will continue rising. Eventually, they'll reach a point where they trigger new hotel development, but from where we sit today, supply growth remains years away as few new projects are being financed.
Unfortunately, there is also an Economy B and it's the land of have-nots. Unemployment remains high for those who are less educated or experienced and governments have limited availability to help. We’d love to see the situation change, which is why we've been so critical of U.S. Visa policy. The U.S. is missing a huge, an entirely self-funding opportunity to create jobs. 
Here's what I mean. The U.S. lost 1/3 of its share of global travel over the last decade. That represents 1.3 million jobs, equal to about 20% of the 7 million jobs the entire U.S. economy lost during the crisis. This isn't a pipe dream. Here's a case in point. Today, 5x as many Chinese visit the U.S. as Europe -- excuse me, 5x as many Chinese visit Europe as the U.S. because it's far easier to get a Visa to go to EU countries. We, at Starwood, have been vocal with lawmakers in Washington, but it's frustrating for us not to mention the ranks of the unemployed, but this is not getting quickly resolved.
Meanwhile, the rapidly growing regions, those outside the U.S., Japan and Europe, are forging ahead. Rising economies are fueling both REVPAR growth and their pipeline. Major new travel patterns are springing up, spurred by travel and by rising wealth among billions of people. And we stand to benefit as these emerging travelers are loyal to brands they know from home and that speak to their needs. 
And these dynamics are reflected in our Q3 results. Asia-Pacific REVPAR was up 16%, excluding Japan and Shanghai. Our Chinese hotels X Shanghai grew over 20%, led by Beijing at 24%. 
Bali was up 49%; Jakarta, 14%; and Mumbai, 11%. Latin America is also booming with REVPAR up 19%; including Rio at 38%; Cancún, 29%; Mexico City, 25%; and Buenos Aires, 24%. 
And we're happy to see that the long awaited lodging recovery in Mexico is beginning to play out. REVPAR for Africa and the Middle East was down 2%. But in countries not touched by political turmoil, REVPAR increased 6%, both Doha and Addis Ababa were up 30% and Dubai was up 12%. 
Growth in Africa continues to reflect global demand for commodities. In North Africa in the Eastern Mediterranean, everything hinges on political stability and in the Gulf states, our footprint is expanding quickly. So sustaining REVPAR will depend on demand rising in tandem or ahead of supply.
Let me turn to our pipeline more broadly. We continue to reap the benefits of our work over the decades in markets all around the world. We stand on the shoulders of strong brand awareness, local smart operating teams and our reputation as a great partner. Now 80% of our pipeline lies outside the developed world, and get this, our emerging market pipeline is equal in size to 70% of our entire existing footprint in those countries.
On past calls, we've talked a lot about India and China, but we've always been quick to add that there are other dynamic countries and a recent visit to Indonesia highlights this point. Le Méridien and Sheraton have been active in these markets since the 1980s and we currently have 12 hotels. Among these are world class resorts in Bali like the St. Regis, the W Retreat, the Laguna Nusa Dua and the Westin. 
We also have 7 Sheratons around the country and Le Méridien in Jakarta. Our Indonesian footprint is nearly the same size as Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton combined. We have 4 more hotels under construction and a burgeoning list of others on the way. For example, we just signed the W Jakarta and Le Méridien Bali. My read is that Indonesia is poised for long-term growth with a young and growing population of 240 million, natural resources and major tourist destinations. In 5 years, our hotel count there could easily double.
And these hotels represent high-value management contracts for 5-star hotels with first-dollar incentive fees. In valuing our global pipeline, remember that the average non-U.S. managed luxury contract is about 3x the present value per room of a typical American mid-market franchise. This underscores the value of our pipeline, which is comprised of 80% emerging markets; 84%, managed contracts; and over 75%, upper upscale and luxury hotels.
A couple of additional points regarding our pipeline. First, we have a track record of delivering growth. This year, we'll open about 80 new hotels, making for a total of 320 since 2008. This should give you confidence that the majority of the 350 hotel pipeline will open over the next 4 years. 
Our pipeline and momentum also enable us to be very selective about the right partners and the right contracts. Over the long run, we've observed that it's far better for brands and owners to do the right thing than to compromise our standards for short-term gains.
And this longer-term perspective leads me right into my second topic for today, a look back on the progress we've made over the 4 years in transforming the company according to the Starwood journey, as we call our long-term strategy. 
When I joined Starwood a little over 4 years ago, I saw 3 key ingredients to creating value for shareholders. First, leveraging innovative brands through a period of unprecedented global growth. Second, bringing discipline to the top line growth and controlling costs. And third, unlocking value while transforming to asset light. 
So let me walk through each of these. During our third quarter earnings call in 2007, I mentioned that Starwood's high-end brands should allow the company to outperform over the long run. Major innovations like the Westin Heavenly Bed, W and SPG No Blackouts had set our brands apart. These brands were in a great place to benefit from rising wealth around the world. 
Consider our luxury brands. W once known as a New York brand has more than doubled in size since 2007 from 20 hotels to 41, and it's gone global. The non-U.S. hotel count has gone from 3 to 13 hotels and with over 30 more Ws expected to open in the coming years, W is on track to be the first high-end brand created in the last 40 years to reach 100 hotels. 
St. Regis has enjoyed a similar trajectory. In 4 years, St. Regis has increased its footprint from 13 to 24 hotels and with 17 expected to open in the next 4 years, the brand will have more than tripled in less than a decade. About 90% of these openings will be outside of the U.S. We also added 5,000 distinctive luxury collection rooms to our portfolio, including Equinox, the Chatwal and the Astor Hotel in Tianjin. So with our 3 luxury brands, we've taken the largest portfolio of luxury hotels and grown the room count by 73% in just 4 years. 
Turning to Westin. The brand's positioning around renewal has turned into a global category killer. Since third quarter 2007, we've grown Westin by 35% of markets outside the U.S. This includes 29 hotels in new markets such as India, Dubai, China and South America. Our innovations at Westin and W have also helped us rethink the Sheraton Grande, leading to the Lincoln Sheraton and revamping club force. These concepts were coupled with nearly $10 billion of investment by us and our owners to reshape the hotel portfolio. We took out 60 properties, renovated well over 100 and added 80 new hotels. And the result as we've been reporting for a while is record highs in guest satisfaction, meeting planner satisfaction and likelihood to return. 
On a REVPAR index basis, we've gained 300 basis points worldwide since relaunching the brand at the start of 2010.
We've also been hard at work on our next slate of innovations. Aloft just celebrated its third birthday and has already passed the 50-hotel  milestone. 
With Q4 openings in Colombia and Costa Rica, Aloft has also gone global right out of the gate across North America, and into Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, India, Southeast Asia and China. Aloft has redefined its category and in our view, is at least as disruptive to its concept as the W is to Luxury.
Regarding Element, I can honestly say that this brand is ahead of its time as the first select serve green brand and it's already delivering. In fact, the brand resonates so well that many travelers choose Element over competing full-service hotels at comparable rates.
Innovation is as important to SPG as any of our hotel brands. They pioneered No Blackouts, full access to luxury properties and its unique SPG Moments program. Another point of differentiation is summed up by our more luxury and more locations campaign. 
These features have helped drive enrollment, promotion and global relevance. The result, SPG’s share of occupancy is up 34% to 50% in just the past 5 years. Today, we have 35% more active members than in 2007, a non-U.S. membership is up 67%. Soon our non-U.S. membership base will be larger than our U.S. base. 
So why does this matter? Simply put, SPG members spend more money and stay more. They're also the best insurance against hard times. In 2009, non-SPG room nights were up 9%, but SPG nights were actually up 2%.
So I hope this gives you the sense that the innovative spirit is not only alive and well at Starwood, but driving results. It's our nature to see what's happening in the wider world and to take action. This spirit is behind our going to the White House to shut down the rhetoric against travel, speaking out on national television in favor of tourist Visa reform, bringing our top 100 leaders to China, temporarily moving our headquarters to Shanghai and shifting almost 90% of our marketing spend to digital platforms and social media. Incidentally, we now have 1.5 million fans through our social media outlets.
The second big opportunity I saw in 2007 was great potential to bring more discipline and alignment to our innovative spirit. Through our rigorous AVA process, for example, we were able to reduce our SG&A by $100 million. And those savings have held even while the hotel count has grown by 20%. 
As another example, our lean operations efforts have realized $100 million in savings across 90 hotels in North America alone. But discipline and alignment aren't just about efficiency. We've also successfully rolled out our up-to-date revenue management systems to our hotels. We more than doubled the reach of these systems over the last 4 years to 530 hotels today. We've invested about $100 million to support our proprietary websites as well. To borrow a phrase, where you book matters, which is why savvy travelers book where they can get the best rates, SPG points and access to more properties. And that's why our own websites bring in about 3/4 of our total online revenue.
We've also taken the same discipline to building alignment and a culture that lets our associates be their best. We measure this through our annual Star Voice Survey. This year, 96% of our 145,000 associates weighed in and for the fourth year in a row, we saw a significant increase in engagement. For the second year in a row, we reached record-high results. So why does this matter? It's a simple premise. Happy associates mean happy guests, stronger brands and better returns. And note that guest satisfaction at our hotels, and that's including 880 same-store hotels, has risen in each over the last 4 years and is now at record levels.
The third opportunity I saw in 2007 was unlocking value by selling owned hotels and moving towards our goal of being 80% fee-driven. In 2007, fees drove 45% of EBITDA before overhead. In 2011, we're on track to be over 60%. Despite the most difficult period for lodging in our lifetimes, our fees have increased by 13% since 2007. And we've reduced our fixed asset base during this tumultuous period. Our asset sales have averaged a multiple of 19x EBITDA and that doesn't count the value of renovation commitments or the value of management contracts. Our vacation ownership team has returned $700 million in cash to the company net of capital over the past 3 years.
These efforts leave us with a strong balance sheet, net debt under $1.7 billion. We've also invested significantly in our own hotels, IT infrastructure and the build-out of Bal Harbour. In an uncertain world, our approach continues to be plan for the worst, but be on offense.
So we'll continue transforming to asset light, using our best judgment to balance timing, proceeds, partners and management contracts. 
Right now, we're seeing weaker demand for hotel sales. The strongest buyers over the last couple of years has been the public lodging REITs, and they’ve pulled back. But we can afford to be patient. Our business model is resilient, thanks to a fee-based that's 75% top line driven. Even our incentive fees are less volatile as they are almost entirely based on first-dollar fees and are geographically dispersed.
In my remaining comments, I'll turn to my final topic of today, our outlook for the rest of 2011 and for 2012. 
We see the balance of this year in line with what we've said in our Q2 call. In fact, it's essentially in line with what we expect for 2011 at this time last year. Full year EBITDA of $980 million to $990 million, and that's up 12% over last year before adjusting for asset sales, not to mention North Africa and Japan, which would have added, by the way, about another 500 basis points to EBITDA had those not occurred. 
EPS will come in at around $1.75 to $1.79 for growth of over 40% and fully REVPAR remains at 7% to 9%. 
Overall, for 2012, group pace is up mid-single digits, corporate rate negotiations are only just beginning but unlike last year, our customers expect higher rates as they see occupancy and virtually no new supply in key cities. As you may have seen in our earnings release, occupancy is at levels now where historically rates have always risen. And that's why we are targeting negotiated rate increases close to double digits. Bear in mind, we're still recouping rate loss during the downturn. Our worldwide REVPAR range of 4% to 8% reflects a sustained recovery at the high end and a more anemic one at the low end. It does not, however, contemplate Iraqi Lehman style resolution in Europe. We're not anticipating one either, but our balance sheet is set to manage through such a scenario. 
REVPAR at 48% would be consistent with EBITDA of $1.03 billion to $1.12 billion and EPS of $1.96 to $2.25 per share. These numbers include an estimated impact of about $20 million from completed asset sales this year, planned renovations and foreign exchange. 
REVPAR growth implies a continued growth in market share of at least 100 basis points, and it implies rigorous cost control. You'll note that between 2010 and 2012, we expect SG&A to be up only about 2% to 3% per year. We plan to reinvest significantly in our own hotels as Vasant will detail in just a few minutes. This will detract from EBITDA in 2012, but importantly, will position us well when the time comes to sell assets. 
Also, we're going to continue to step up investments in technology and systems as they form a critical part of how we plan to gain more share.
We expect to have ample cash from these investments, generated by operations, Bal Harbour and time share and as a reminder, we don't  budget for asset sales. So if the transaction market improves, any sales will be an additional source of cash. 
So let me close my remarks by simply saying that we find ourselves entering 2012 in great shape. Our revenues are increasingly fee driven, our team has never been better aligned, and our properties are creating brand loyalty like never before. And at the same time, our balance sheet and strong cost discipline had prepared us for whatever may come. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Vasant."
341584,141337383,179614,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. The high anxiety about the global economy in newspapers and TV news channels is not evident in the actions of global corporations and the global business traveler at this point. Q3 REVPAR globally was up 7.4",2016,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. The high anxiety about the global economy in newspapers and TV news channels is not evident in the actions of global corporations and the global business traveler at this point. 
Q3 REVPAR globally was up 7.4% in local currencies and 11.6% in dollars. Our EBITDA and EPS once again exceeded the high end of our outlook range. Global owner REVPAR at Starwood branded hotels was up 9.2% in local currencies, 16.2% in dollars. 
Good cost control pushed owned margins up 265 basis points. Owned EBITDA was modestly below our expectations due to some soft spots in London and Rome, as well as the stronger dollar. We had healthy fee growth of 16.8% despite the drag from North Africa and Japan. X North Africa and Japan, fee growth would have been 250 basis points higher. The Vacation Ownership business remains stable, with good door flow and close rates. SG&A benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals relative to last year, as well as the translation benefits of a stronger dollar. We gain market share globally, once again, all in all, it was a good solid quarter from our standpoint. 
So what is the state of our businesses as we enter the last leg of 2011? In North America, our company operated REVPAR was up 8.5% with rates up 5.1% and occupancy at 76%. Transient REVPAR grew 9% with group REVPAR up 7%. Company-operated GOP margins were higher by 200 basis points. Group base heading into Q4 is good with more than 90% of group business already on the books. 
Secondary indicators like leaves and cancellations also remained positive. Transient booking momentum remains strong and at this point, we are not seeing any changes in trend. 
As such, we are projecting that Q4 REVPAR growth in North America will remain generally in line with what we saw in Q3. We are closely watching Canada, which is showing some signs of softness partially due to the strong Canadian dollar.
While Europe has been the epicenter of the current crisis, we did not see it in our business in Q3. Q3 REVPAR was up 7.7% in local currencies, modestly below Q2 levels. The rate was up 5.2% with 1.8 points of occupancy growth. However, we have seen some softening in booking trends as we entered September. As such, we are projecting that Q4 REVPAR growth in Europe will be in the 3% to 4% range. 
At this point, it is too early to tell if this is a generalized trend or some local soft spots. Hopefully the announcement last night on the euro rescue plan will improve business sentiment in Europe.
REVPAR in Africa and the Middle East declined once again in Q3, but the rate of decline moderated meaningfully from Q2 levels. As you all know, the situation in North Africa remains unstable and we do not expect to return to normalcy anytime soon. 
Year-over-year fee growth comparisons will suffer in Q4 since we do not expect to earn any incentive fees in North Africa, which are generally recorded in the fourth quarter. 
In total, our 2011 fees in North Africa will be down $10 million, which is in line with what we had estimated early this year.
Asia continued to power along in Q3 with local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels up over 9%. X Shanghai, which had the World Expo last year, REVPAR across Asia was up 15.4%. 
China related economies was strong, while India was soft. Japan is slowly recovering with domestic travel coming back, but international travel remains subdued. The full year profit impact of Japan remains at around $20 million as estimated earlier this year. 
As we enter Q4, booking pace remains on trend, leads are up and cancellations are down. India is weak and Thailand is severely disrupted by the floods. As such, we expect a small sequential slowdown in Asia REVPAR growth in Q4.
Latin America had a very good quarter with 24% REVPAR growth and good margin gains. We do not expect this level of growth to continue into Q4 based on current booking trends. Nevertheless, Latin America will grow in the double digits. 
Finally, [indiscernible] tours are up as of close rates versus last year. The business remains stable and predictable. We hope to complete the securitization in the fourth quarter if turns are attractive. Default trends continue to improve and are now at 2006 levels. 
Assuming we complete the securitization, SVO will generate over $200 million in cash in 2011. Our 2011 EBITDA is expected to come in at $980 million to $990 million in the middle of our original outlook range we provided you at the start of the year. Our REVPAR growth is as projected in the 7% to 9% range in local currencies. Volume in our margins will be up by 150 to 250 basis points, again as expected. SG&A will increase 3% to 4% for the year. SVO will be at the high end of expectations. 
Year-to-date, we have opened 53 hotels and remain on track to open approximately 80 hotels in 2011. Our Q4 EBITDA range of $270 million to $280 million was negatively impacted by $4 million to $5 million since we last spoke due to the strengthening of the dollar. Owned EBITDA in Q4 will be negatively impacted by approximately $8 million versus last year due to renovations and preopening costs at our new St. Regis Bal Harbour. 
In the fourth quarter, we will recognize income from Bal Harbour residential unit closings in addition to our core EBITDA. I will discuss this in more detail later.
Moving on to our outlook for 2012. It goes without saying that there are risks and uncertainties aplenty as we try to look ahead 4 quarters. First, I'll outline the reasons for optimism. Our focus on global corporation and high-end traveler, our Best-in-class brands and global footprint, especially in emerging markets, the unprecedented lack of new supply in developed markets, the inexorable rise of middle classes in emerging markets. The big unknown is the global economic outlook, it's impact on corporate profits and as a result, on demand for travel. 
As such, we are providing a broad range for 2012 at this point. The upper half of our 2012 range corresponds to the continuation of a normal cyclical recovery in lodging. Since early 2010, we've had a textbook lodging recovery very much in line with past recoveries despite subpar GDP growth in developed markets. 
At this point, as evidenced by our Q4 outlook, that trend remains intact. 6% to 8% REVPAR growth and the upper half of our EBITDA range would be in line with this Q4 momentum being sustained through 2012. 
However, the events of the past few months have highlighted the risks of this scenario. Declining trust in governments, the impact of de-leveraging by consumers and the general uncertainty this has resulted in could cause businesses to pull in their homes as we enter 2012. This could lead to the much talked about new normal scenario of low global growth. This outcome would correspond to the lower half of our REVPAR and EBITDA ranges.
If we actually have 4% REVPAR growth, the bottom of our range, owned EBITDA growth becomes hard to realize despite our cost containment initiatives. SVO was relatively flat in all scenarios, in synch with our strategy for this business. So whatever we grow -- whatever growth we get at a 4% REVPAR scenario will have to come from our fee business.
These 2 scenarios are captured in the outlook range we provided. If the crisis in Europe moves to an acute stage causing another global recession or another global financial crisis, then the 2012 REVPAR and EBITDA will be below our ranges. 
At this point, and especially after the actions announced last night, these outcomes appear very unlikely. We have made sure that we're well-prepared from a liquidity and leverage standpoint should a worst case scenario play out. By the time we talk to you again in early February, we will have another 3 months to track the recovery trend, more clarity on the results of corporate negotiations, more group business on the books for 2012 and hopefully, a satisfactory resolution of the issues in Europe. 
This year, we started out the year by giving you a REVPAR range of 7% to 9% and an EBITDA range of $975 million to $1 billion and we will finish right in the middle of that range while absorbing the impact of Japan, North Africa in asset sales. We would be delighted if 2012 proves to be as predictable as 2011 was. 
One point to note is that on a year-to-year comparison basis, our EBITDA outlook range for 2012 is negatively impacted by approximately $20 million due to asset sales, renovations and exchange rate shifts. 
We will have some significant capital projects underway next year, including the shutdown of the Gritti Palace in Venice and the Maria Christina in Spain. Major renovations will also be on at The Westin Maui, The Westin Peachtree and the Sheraton Rio. We are also shutting down 2 other hotels in the U.S. to convert them to Alofts. 
In terms of exchange rate impacts, as we have done for the past several years, we'll hedge about half our euro profit exposure in 2012 at 1.44 to mitigate the euro risk as best we can. 
Not included in our 2012 outlook range is income from residential unit closings at Bal Harbour. TCOs are coming in as planned and we anticipate starting closings in mid-November. We have been in contact with buyers and expect that we will have several closings before the end of the year. The bulk of the closings with contracts previously signed will be in 2011. There will be significant revenue income and cash from Bal Harbour in 2012. We will provide more details on all this in February. We will separately identify Bal Harbour numbers, so you can clearly track performance of our core hotel business. 
As Bal Harbour flows through our income statement, it will affect our reported tax rate and our interest expense as capitalized interest is expensed. We will walk you through all this on our next call.
In the final analysis, it is all positive. Bal Harbour will add to our revenue, earnings and cash in 2012. For 2011, we're estimating approximately $10 million in earnings, $0.03 in EPS and $30 million in cash. The numbers of 2012 will be substantially higher.
We continue to expect that we will generate almost $1 billion in revenue from selling all 307 condos at the St. Regis Bal Harbour. By the end of this year, we expect that 70% of this value will be under contract. Average price per square foot on units under contract exceeds $1,300. Sales have been robust year-to-date in 2011, well above our initial expectations. And since we are close to completion, we've asked for and received almost 50% in cash deposits on 2011 contracts. The spectacular 210 room St. Regis Bal Harbour Hotel, which we will own opens early next year adding to the many iconic St. Regis hotels we opened worldwide over the past 3 years. 
All in all, we feel very good about this project, but would like to wait until February to provide more specific numbers on revenues, earnings and cash flow in 2012. The expectations with total cash proceeds from sellout of Bal Harbour as provided at our Investor Day last year remain unchanged. 
Finally, we finish Q3 with cash in excess of working capital needs of almost $1 billion, and net debt noninclusive of vacation ownership receivables of under $1.7 billion. 
Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7. Our priorities for cash used remain reinvesting in our business to drive growth in our pipeline and our owned hotels, paying down maturing debt and returning cash to shareholders. We will shortly announce our 2011 dividend and we'll execute start buybacks as we have in the past if our criteria are met. 
With that, I will pass this back to Jay."

In total, between ForEx and capital impact and asset sales, we estimate it at approximately EUR 20 million a year impact. I then throw the fact that we will have several hotels shut for renovation. A couple in Europe, a couple in the U.S. And then we have some major renovations in other hotels. So you should expect that our capital spend year-over-year will remain high. The Bal Harbour spend will come down, but some of the capital on owned hotels spend will go up."

So our point of view at this point is we have the balance sheet flexibility to invest in creating a slate of hotels that are in great shape with a proven track record and as Vasant mentioned, if the transaction market picks up more quickly in 2012, we may turn some of these projects over to a potential owner in the same way we did with St. Regis Aspen just a little while ago."

Despite the increased CapEx that we talked about, there will be of course a reduction in Bal Harbour in terms of capital needs and there will be cash from Bal Harbour. We would estimate free cash flow at least in the $250  million to $350 million range after payment of dividends. So maybe a little higher than that once you consider dividends. So let's say $350 million to $400 million free cash flow. As far as China goes and Frits I'm sure will add to this, our wage rates at our hotels, we're not minimum wage. Our people need a certain level of education, need some proficiency with English. We've always been above the minimum wage. Yes, there's the inflation, but the wage rate, I mean, the labor costs as a percentage of total revenue remains quite low in China. And so far, it has not had meaningful impacts on hotel performance, nor have we seen that as a reason for why people would pull back from hotel construction."

The inflation in the development side has still not compromised the economics of building hotels in China and that's true for a few reasons. First of all, historically, the cost to build a hotel in a per room basis compared to the U.S. is half or less. And so it's still relatively inexpensive to build. The second is generally now, we're seeing development in the second and third tier cities and often times what we're seeing are land that's otherwise undeveloped being put to use with a mixed-use development. And the consequence of that is as developers speak with the government, who typically would be owning the land, they're able to get a very favorable land price. And so because they will be creating value through the overall development that they're doing. So on a development basis, the economics are still quite favorable. On an operating basis, we're seeing GOPs on average in excess of 40%. And so the return side still looks very good."

On SG&A, there's always a little bit of movement quarter-to-quarter of some expenses. And so I wouldn't make too much of that. What we look at is our corporate headcount and our overall trend line SG&A spend. And I think the important take away is from -- in 2009, we made a significant reduction in costs with the new run rate that you saw starting in 2010.

So, Steven, this is Frits, and I think there was a wise analyst who put out a report that said that management has little to gain by offering precise predictions. So -- just kidding but -- hey, look, here's what we're doing philosophically. We do believe that with occupancies where they are, particularly in North America, and for that matter, even in Europe, that it's all about rate now and that obviously the profitability of higher rates in terms of flow-through is that much better than occupancy. And given the strength and momentum in our brands, and the build in SPG, we have an opportunity to be pretty bold on the rate side. Now we don't have that kind of influence over the franchise properties but what we are doing increasingly is using our revenue management system, which is a way of forecasting load and elasticity and giving our leadership at the property level more confidence in setting rates that might be above where their gut feel might put them at. And then finally, what's almost most important right now is not what we're telling our GMs or our sales teams on property but what we're doing in terms of corporate rate negotiations and group sales. And making sure that we're leveraging the fact that we do have high occupancies today. To your point, the 2007, while the most recent peak, was not a true peak because it was not a full completion of a business cycle. And so we have a great opportunity there and that's philosophically the way we're taking things. In terms of extra F&B spend, we're seeing some strength there. We've also worked, by the way, on continuously improving our margins from our Food & Beverage in our catering operations. And so even if we weren't to see a complete recovery on the spend there, we're absolutely seeing better flow-through from what we have. I think Jay wants to add something the top line part on F&B.

I mentioned publicly-traded U.S. REITs, but for that matter sovereign well funds, high net worth individuals around the world, private equity firms, other institutions and so forth. And the demand and the confidence right now still isn't there. If for no other reason because of the financing market today, and I think from a U.S. REIT market perspective, since equity is an important part of how they finance their deals and their stocks have taken a hit along with the broader sector, the opportunity to sell right now, candidly, isn't one that we think is very strong and that we've rather hold -- invest in our assets and find a time where we can get a strong price. And the reason, I mentioned the average multiple, the EBITDA in my comments for what we sold over the last 4 years is to give you confidence that the reason we're not selling faster isn't any fundamental reluctance to sell, but a belief that there is a time, a place, a buyer, a contract that makes optimal sense. And from what we're seeing right now, the current market isn't really there. As far as stock buy backs, I think Vasant has put  it well in the past and it's something we said very consistently that once we've gotten to investment grade, once we feel like our balance sheet is where we want to be, should we come into considerable cash throughout the dispositions, which is an eventuality, then we would certainly look at ways to return cash to shareholders and we've talked about dividends, special dividends, buybacks, looking at investing in our business, of course, as being the top priority.

Having said that, I mean, the trends are fairly good in New York. We're not concerned about it. It has absorbed most of the supply that it had. It is a global city, definitely depends on Wall Street. So there will be impact if there is a significant shrinkage on Wall Street. There will be impact if financial market activity whether it's roadshows, IPOs, debt deals, et cetera are not significant. But it is much more than the financial services industry in New York. We are not expecting New York to be the leader in terms of REVPAR growth as it was in the start of the recovery. It tends not to be when you are at that stage of the recovery."

And the dynamic of the financial service industry is obviously a challenge for the lodging market overall. But I would also point to the fact that not only is New York resilient, but it's economic base is increasingly diverse. And by that I mean also across different parts of the city. And I would point you to the opening of the Aloft in Brooklyn, the opening of the W in Hoboken, which, I guess, technically isn't New York City, but you know what I mean. And for that matter, also the opening of the Sheraton and Aloft in Brooklyn. So all of those submarkets are fairly distinct and not necessarily as directly driven by what's happening in the financial community. And in fact the performance of New York because of the inbound tourist flow, if we can get Visa reform, which would allow more people to come in, New York would be literally one of the first ports of call. And I think if you look at the overall number of visits into New York, which is getting close to 50 million and essentially already where it was in '07, New York is strong, will continue to be that way but probably off of a higher base, not the same kind of percentage growth that we saw earlier in the recovery."

I know you're not in the market, but how wide do you think the price per key [ph] gap is between your expectations for your owned hotels versus what you think a buyer would pay you today. And then looking to longer term, you have significant recurring cash flow proceeds in Bal Harbour and obviously the possibility of continued asset sales. You've got the potential to generate significant cash over the next several years more than you can probably invest back into the business. Is your philosophy to reduce leverage as the cycle matures, shrink the company to repurchases, if the price is right. Or maybe growth through RAND acquisition. I'm just curious what your preferences are longer term beyond the next few months."

This isn't a liquid market where we see trades day to day. We have a good sense from each of our properties for having studied them what the capital needs are, what the likely REVPAR numbers and cash flows would be depending on which scenario you pick overall. And therefore, a pretty good sense of what we would want to sell each of our hotels for, recognizing the time value money impact and therefore that a lower price today in some respects may be more attractive than a higher price tomorrow. But I'm going to back to it again. If you look at what has happened to transaction volumes for hotels between 2007 at the peak and the trough at the crisis, the market was off by more than 90%. And while the market is considerably higher than it was on the base, it's still not even half the transaction volume from where it was before. And it's generally true in real estate that transaction volume is a good leading indicator for price which would tell you that there's still a long way to go for transaction volume to recover and therefore also to see prices increase. And with hotels today still trading generally at a pretty decent discount to replacement costs, our point of view isn't so much what's the bid/ask spread today as the expectation for what we could get for these hotels tomorrow net of the time value of money. In terms of the long-term view to cash and the fact that we're coming into a lot of it, Vasant talked a bit about that and I'm going to hand it back to you if you want to more or less restate some of our thoughts about that and maybe going back even to the host transaction where we had exactly this scenario."

Obviously, we said job one is reinvest in our business for growth. We don't have as many owned hotels as we had before. Therefore there isn't going to be a large quantity of the capital required in owned hotels, plus we will be selling them down. We've already stepped up our investment in renovating owned hotels. So there's a certain amount of capital needed there, which might be lower if we sell these hotels sooner. The fee business as you know for growth doesn't need a lot of capital. A couple of hundred million dollars a year is probably as high as it gets. The Vacation Ownership business we are not in a mode where growth is sort of job one, it's more about a stable business that generates cash. So I think from the standpoint of our business, we always said that we wanted a business as we transitioned it that was a good cash generator while delivering growth. So we remain interested in acquisitions that complement what we have. You saw this in Le Méridien the last time around, we will look at those if the price is right and its complementary. Certainly more brand, not interested as much or is not a priority for us to be buying real estate. So that's -- so you can see sort of where the priorities would be in terms of reinvesting in our business. In terms of the leverage, we've stated that our goal is to be a solid BBB. So it's not like we intend to de-leverage significantly beyond that on any kind of permanent basis and we will be solid BBB we think hopefully in the next 12 months or so, which then leads you to returning cash to shareholders which we did in substantial quantities coincident with the asset sales in the last 5 years. We did that in many different ways, and we will do that again. We are definitely a dividend payer and we'll be looking at increases in dividends. We'll shortly announce our 2011 dividend, and we will be looking at other ways to return cash to shareholders once we tick through the other priorities which can be buybacks or other means and we always focus on looking at intrinsic value as we look at buybacks. So hopefully that helps frame how we approach it."
