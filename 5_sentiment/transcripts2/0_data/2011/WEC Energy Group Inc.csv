We found Colleen under 7 feet of snow this morning but she’s doing fine. Well, good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our conference call to review the company’s 2010 year-end results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation; Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Jeff West, our Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller.
Alan will review our financial results in detail in just a moment but as you saw from our news release last yesterday we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.84 a share for 2010. This compares with $3.19 a share for 2009.
During 2010 we began to see an economic recovery across the region we serve as well as a return to more normal weather. Our earnings were also boosted by nearly a full year’s contribution from our investment in the first expansion unit at Oak Creek. Overall I’m very pleased with our financial and our operational performance for 2010, from customer satisfaction to network reliability to completion of our Power of the Future plan, the company made great strides during the year.
Now I’d like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power of the Future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle natural gas fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee, the construction of two super critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city, and building a significant amount of renewable generation.
I’m delighted to report that since our last call Unit 2 at Oak Creek passed all of its performance tests and was placed into commercial service in the early morning hours of January 12, 2011. You may recall that the guaranteed turn over date for Unit 2 at Oak Creek was November 28, 2010. However during the final stages of testing, Bechtel experienced vibration problems with one of the main boiler feed pumps for Unit 2.
During December and early January Bechtel addressed the technology issues and we were able to reach agreement on a number of other contractual items clearing the way for the Unit to achieve commercial service. As part of that agreement, Bechtel will pay liquidated damages totaling nearly $6 million as compensation for not meeting the guaranteed date. The $6 million will ultimately be passed to the benefit of our customers.
Now the critical performance measures that Bechtel was required to meet before Unit 2 was declared ready for commercial operation, included an efficiency test, various emission tests, a capacity test and a 15-day reliability run. And I believe the results of these tests are of particular note.
The efficiency test, or as we call it the heat rate test, measures the efficiency as which the unit converts fuel into electricity. The more efficient the unit obviously the less coal we have to burn and therefore the lower costs for each unit of electricity produced. For Unit 2 at Oak Creek, the demonstrated heat rate is more than 6% better than the guarantee and places this unit among the most efficient base load power plants anywhere in the country.
With regard to emissions, we have been even more impressed by the plant’s performance. The recorded emission level for each of the 15 pollutants measured at the stack is significantly lower than the levels allowed by our permit. In many cases, such as sulfur dioxide, particulate matter at mercury, the levels actually were a fraction of that allowed in our permit. The guaranteed capacity of each unit is 615 megawatts net - excuse me - and that means that the unit must be capable of delivering 615 megawatts into the transmission networks.
During testing, the output was measured at 625 megawatts and we believe the unit can actually deliver more than 625 megawatts based on the extra margin available in both the boiler and the steam turbine generator or to put it simply, we’re getting more capacity and more efficient capacity than we paid for.
Turnover of Unit 2 at Oak Creek is a significant milestone and brings to a conclusion the development of the conventional generation in our Power the Future plan. The program was conceived as you recall just over a decade ago to insure that our customers would have a source of competitive reliable power for years to come and to insure that Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would have an energy supply network that could support new jobs and economic growth.
It’s not been an easy journey. Along the way we even took an interesting detour to the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, but I’m delighted with the perseverance and the dedication of our staff and our contractors, who delivered on the largest construction effort by far in the history of the state. Of course this is not the end of the road, we still have much more to achieve. In particular we’ll be focusing in the year ahead on unit reliability at Oak Creek. And to that end I’m pleased to report that Unit 1 achieved an average availability during November, December and January of more than 94% and continues to operate very well.
Now as you know, we also have a number of other major projects underway that form the foundation for our next leg of growth. Construction is proceeding very well on the second largest project in our history. The upgrade of the year quality controls for the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. At year end the project was 65% complete. We’re investing, as you may recall, approximately $910 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue-gas desulfurization at selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these air quality controls to be completed in 2012.
Another prime example is our investment plan for renewable energy, which is designed to meet the standards that are currently in place in Wisconsin. These standards call for an increase in the amount of electricity supplied by renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. Now the standard sets targets for each of the utilities in Wisconsin using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewables by the year 2015.
Nearly three years ago we purchased a new wind farm development site, approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. The site called the Glacier Hills Wind Park is an ideal location for our newest wind far. In January of a year ago, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines, subject to modifications, the Commission may do our turbine siting criteria. After modifying a number of the turbine locations and negotiating additional agreements with land donors, we were able to maintain 90 turbines at the site. Each turbine will have a capacity of 1.8 megawatts, bringing the total generating capacity at Glacier Hills to 162 megawatts, the largest wind farm in the state.
Construction at Glacier Hills began in May of 2010. Turbines are scheduled to begin arriving this spring with full commercial operation expected by the end of this year. Glacier Hills as I mentioned, will eclipse our 88-turbine Blue Sky Green Field Energy Center as the largest wind generating facility in Wisconsin. Our current estimate of the capital cost for Glacier Hills is $367 million; that excludes allowance for funds used during construction and reimbursable transmission costs. The project remains on schedule and on budget.
Now as you may recall in the fall of 2009 we also announced our plans to build a 50-megawatt biomass fuel generating plant at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin. The paper mill was owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. We’re fortunate to be close to significant forestlands that can be harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant.
As I’ve mentioned before, diversification of our renewable energy supply is one of our important goals. As compared to wind the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. Our investment in this project is projected to be approximately $255 million excluding AFUDC with a targeted in-service date in late 2013. We have received all the local permits necessary to move forward and the Wisconsin Public Service Commission has indicated that it will make a final decision in the case in the next four to six weeks. Construction could begin later this spring.
Turning now to other major developments in the quarter, last month our board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. That brings the annual dividend from $1.60 to $2.08 a share. Our new dividend policy targets a payout ratio of 50% to 55% of earnings going forward. Our first quarterly dividend for this year will be payable on March 1st at a rate of $0.52 a share.
And as I’m sure you’re aware the board of Directors also approved a two-for-one split of our common shares. This is structured as a stock dividend with a record date of February 14th and a payable date of March 1st. I believe the stock split which is the company’s first since 1992 will help maintain a trading arranged for our stock that is attractive to a wide range of institutional and individual investors.
And just a reminder, unless we note otherwise, all of the per share amounts that we are discussing today are before the impact of the stock dividend.
One other important note. Allen will talk in a moment about the cash impacts that we expect bonus depreciation to have on the company. Given the way our utility rate base is calculated the bonus depreciation will reduce our rate base somewhat. However, given the additional cash flow that bonus depreciation will provide we may well be in a position to move to the upper end of the range of our dividend payout ratio as early as 2012. And as a reminder, our policy calls for us to pay out between 50% and 55% of our earnings in dividends.
And now I’ll turn the call over to Allen who will give you an update on financial performance for 2010 and our outlook for 2011. Alan?

315117,118530548,98332,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gale. Now as Gale mentioned earlier, our annual 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $3.84 a share. And I’ll focus on operating income by segment, and then touch on other income statement items.

And I’ll focus on operating income by segment, and then touch on other income statement items. I’ll also discuss cash flows for the year and cover our earnings guidance for 2011.
Our consolidated operating income in 2010 was $810 million as compared to $660 million in 2009 for an increase of $150 million. Operating income in our Utility Energy segment totaled $564 million, an increase of $13 million versus 2009.
The trends that we saw for the first nine months of the year continued through the fourth quarter. On an annual basis, we estimate that our Utility operating income was helped by $160 million of pricing increases, the largest of which related to our General Rate case in Wisconsin that was implemented in January of 2010.
In addition we estimate that more favorable weather helped our Utility business by approximately $49 million, primarily as a result of a hot summer of 2010 as compared to the cool summer of 2009. Finally, our Utility depreciation expense was lower by $62 million as we implemented new depreciation rates in conjunction with the new Electric rates in January of 2010.
On the other side of the ledger, we estimate that our Utility operating and maintenance cost increased by $215 million as compared to 2009. The significant portion of these costs were considered when the new rates were set. The largest items relate to the lease costs for the new coal units, operating costs associated with new units, increased costs to maintain our electric distributions system and higher accrued bad debt expense.
In addition, our recovery of fuel expense was $63 million unfavorable as compared to 2009. In 2010, we under-collected fuel and purchased power costs by approximately $44 million, and in 2009 we had favorable recoveries of fuel by approximately $19 million. Finally, all other items were $20 million favorable including the impact of higher electric sales associated with improved economic conditions. When you add all these items together, you come to the $13 million in operating income at the Utility level.
Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which primarily includes We Power, was up $132 million. This increase was driven by the earnings on Unit 1 at Oak Creek which was placed in the commercial operation in early February of 2010. Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $6 million in 2010 compared to an operating loss of $11 million in 2009. The largest factor in this $5 million change was a $4 million favorable adjustment in 2010 related to corporate benefits expense. During 2010 we were able to settle certain benefit liabilities for amounts below their recorded value.
Taking the changes for each of these segments together brings you back to the $150 million increase in operating income for 2010. During 2010 earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $60 million for a slight increase over the $59 million we reported for 2009. Other income increased by $11 million primarily because of increased allowance for funds used during construction on large utility construction projects including the air quality control systems in our existing Oak Creek plants.
Net interest expense increased by almost $49 million. As we mentioned in prior calls, the increased interest expense was primarily driven by two factors related to the commercial operation of Unit 1 at Oak Creek. First, while the plant was being constructed we capitalized interest expense and our overall cost of debt, which was approximately 6%. Once the plant was placed into commercial operation, we no longer capitalized interest expense.
The second factor relates to interest rates. Once the plant was placed into commercial operation, we issued long-term debt to finance a portion of the unit. The proceeds of the long-term debt were used to repay short-term debt incurred during construction. So the higher interest rates on the long-term debt led to higher interest expense. I would like to remind you though that the long-term interest rates were considered when the lease payments on the new unit were set.
Consolidated income tax expense increased approximately $35 million because of higher pre-tax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 35.5% compared to 36.5% in 2009. This decline was primarily a result of a greater equity AFUDC and Section 199 production-related tax deductions. I expect that our effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 35% and 36%.
Combining all of these items brings you to $454 million on net income from continuing operations for 2010 or earnings of $3.84 per share. Now during 2010 we generated $810 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis which is up $182 million when compared to the same period in 2009. The single largest factor that accounts for this improvement was the $289 million contribution we made to our benefit trust in 2009. We did not make any contributions to our benefit trusts in 2010.
On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $996 million. The adjusted number includes the $186 million of cash impacts from the Point Beach bill credits. Under GAAP the cash from the bill credits is reflected as a change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From a management standpoint we consider this as a source of cash as it relates directly to the bill credits. I would note that as of the end of 2010 we had provided all of the credits of Point Beach to our customers.
Total capital expenditures were approximately $798 million in 2010. About $687 million of this was dedicated to our utility businesses and the balance was primarily for the generating units being constructed as part of our Power the Future plan. In 2011, our total capital budget is approximately $953 million, $916 million of this is in our utility operations and the balance is primarily for our Power the Future program. Within the utility, we estimate that approximately $335 million will be spent on the Glacier Hills Wind Project and $166 million will be spent on environmental-related upgrades to our power plants. The remaining amount is expected to be spent on recurring utility projects.
We paid $187 million in common dividends in 2010. Consistent with our dividend announcement last month, we expect to pay $243 million of dividends in 2011. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 56.9% as of December 31, 2010 and we were at 54.1% on an adjusted basis. These ratios are somewhat better than our December 31, 2009 levels. The adjusted amount treats half of our $500 million in hybrid securities of common equity, which is the approach used by the majority of the rating agencies.
Looking to 2011, I expect that our debt to capital ratio will increase slightly this year, however, the debt to capital ratio should remain below 55% on adjusted basis. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, with the exception of the stock dividend to be paid on March 1, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Consistent with our financial plan, we did not make a contribution to our pension trust in 2010. However, our plan this year called for just over a $100 million contribution to our pension trust. We made this contribution on January 7 of this year. This contribution, along with the 11.5% trust investment returns in 2010, put us in a well-funded position.
Going forward we are assuming long-term asset returns of 7.25%. I expect that our pension expense this year will be comparable to 2010 levels. As shown in the earnings package we posted on our Web site yesterday our actual 2010 retail sales of electricity increased 6%, as compared to 2009. On a weather normalized basis 2010 retail electric sales increased 2.3%. This is somewhat better than 0.9% weather normalized increase we had forecast in October. For 2011 we are projecting to see a slight decrease of 0.6% in the electricity sales versus normalized 2010 sales. This nominal decline is caused by a small forecasted drop in residential sales, because of low housing starts and the assumption that there will be continued conservation efforts.
In the small commercial and industrial class, we expect to see moderate growth. Our large commercial and industrial class is forecasted to decline by 1.6%, because of plant closings, such as the Chrysler automotive plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In addition, a couple of our customers are in the process of building renewable generation projects, excluding these customers we expect our large commercial and industrial group to be relatively flat.
On January 19, we completed the long term debt financing associated with the second coal-fired unit of our Power the Future plant. We issued $420 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first tranche was the $205 million note, with a coupon rate of 4.673% and a final maturity of January 19, 2031. The second tranche was a $215 million note, with a coupon rate of 5.848% and a final maturity of January 19, 2041. The net proceeds were used to repay short-term debt incurred during construction.
On April 1, Wisconsin Energy has a $450 million, 6.5% note with matures. We expect to repay this maturity with internal cash and short-term debt. Later this year we expect Wisconsin Electric Power Company to issue approximately $300 million of long-term debt to help fund its construction program.
In December we entered into a new three-year bank credit facilities to replace the old facilities that were expiring this spring. The new facilities are sized at $450 million for Wisconsin Energy, $500 million for Wisconsin Electric and $300 million for Wisconsin Gas.
Our earnings guidance range for 2011 remains the same as what we provided to you in December. We expect our earnings in 2011 to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.20 per share before the stock split and $2.04 to $2.10 on a post-split basis.
Now from this point forward in my presentation I will refer to our earnings per share on a basis that includes the new shares that will be issued in connection with the March 1st stock dividend. The earnings contribution from our Utilities segment, which includes Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, was $1.34 per share in 2010. Rate base for the combined utilities was about $5.6 billion in 2010 and we earned approximately 10.2% on equity for our overall retail utility business which excludes our ownership in American Transmission Company.
Looking to this year combined rate base is expected to grow to $6.35 billion. We believe that our earned rate of return on equity will be about 9.7% in 2011, again excluding our American Transmission Company earnings and investment. At this point I expect our equity level at the utilities will be at or near the top of the 48.5% to 53.5% range set by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.
So to summarize we expect the earnings contribution of the Utility segment will increase to $1.39 per share in 2011. We expect the earnings contribution from our investment in the American Transmission Company to grow from $0.15 per share in 2010 to $0.16 per share this year.
Moving now to We Power which includes the units at Port Washington as well as the units at Oak Creek, we expect the earnings contribution from We Power to increase from $0.48 per share in 2010 to $0.66 per share this year. Note that in order to be consistent with the basis of presentation we have used in the past this includes an allocation of holding company interest to We Power and does not include any impact of capitalized interest. Also, the estimated earnings for this year included about 11 months of earnings from Unit 2 at Oak Creek. In 2012, of course, we expect a full year of earnings contribution from both of the Oak Creek units.
Finally, moving to the holding company we expect that the earnings reduction from unallocated holding company debt will increase from $0.05 to $0.13 per share. This is primarily because of the reduction in capitalized interest now that the Oak Creek units are complete.
So to review, starting from the $1.92 per share that we earned in 2010 pro forma, for the shares to be issued in the stock dividend, Utility earnings are expected to increase $0.05 a share. Added to this is a projected $0.01 per share at ATC. We expect We Power to add $0.18 per share, and the holding company interests to reduce earnings $0.08 per share. Adding these changes together brings you from the actual base of earnings of $1.92 per share in 2010 to $2.08 a share, which is the midpoint of the guidance range this year. Again, all of these values for 2010 and 2011 include the new shares from the stock dividend.
In December of 2010, the President signed several income tax changes into law. These included an extension of the bonus depreciation rules to projects acquired and placed in service in 2011 and 2012. As a result of this change in law, we anticipate that certain projects will benefit from the increased bonus depreciation in 2011 and 2012, such as our Glacier Hills and South Oak Creek Air Quality projects. Given our interpretation of the bonus depreciation rules, it does not appear that Oak Creek Unit 2 will benefit from bonus depreciation.
Also, the rules appear to require 50% as opposed to 100% bonus depreciation for Glacier Hills and the South Oak Creek Air Quality Control System. At this point, we estimate $100 million in cash benefits from bonus depreciation this year and another $200 million in 2012. I expect that there will be a small amount of additional benefits post 2012.
Now as Gale mentioned, the bonus depreciation will also have an impact on our Utility rate base because of the additional build-up of deferred tax liability caused by the increased tax depreciation. At this point I estimate that our total Utility rate base will be approximately $6.7 million in 2012. This is down from the $7 million projection we made last year because of bonus depreciation as well as favorable working capital balances and better than budget capital spending.
However, just to reiterate what Gale said earlier, we believe the additional cash positions us to move faster on the dividend. Just for example, a move from a 50 to a 55% payout ratio would translate into a 10% increase in the dividend before factoring in expected earnings growth.
I would also like to provide you with some input on our expectations for earnings in the first quarter. Overall we expect our first quarter 2011 earnings to be higher than our first quarter 2010 earnings. As a starting point, when you take into consideration the additional shares from the March 1 stock dividend, our first quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 per share. We expect to see higher earnings in the Utility segment because last year we were hurt by warm winter weather and a significant under recovery of fuel and purchase power costs.
Overall I would expect utility earnings to be up $0.08 to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The contribution from ATC should be roughly level compared to last year. Then, if you turn to the non-utility energy segment, during the first quarter of 2011 we expect to see three months of earnings from Unit 1 at Oak Creek as well as 2.5 months of earnings from Unit 2 at Oak Creek. Last year, Unit 2 was placed into commercial operation in early February and Unit 2 was under construction.
In total, I estimate that We Power earnings contribution will be up about $0.05 per share. The earnings contribution at the holding company is expected to be down about $0.03 per share primarily because of a decreased ability to capitalized interest.
So, to review starting from the $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2010 add $0.08 to $0.12 per share at the utilities, $0.05 per share for We Power and subtract $0.03 per share for the holding company, which brings you to a range of $0.65 to $0.69 per share for the first quarter of 2011. So with that, I’ll turn things back over to Gale.

Let me first say that one of the ways, Greg, we put together our sales forecast is with one-on-one discussions with about 200 of our largest commercial and industrial customers. So if there’s conservatism built into the forecast it’s really coming straight from our customers. So that’s one piece of information that might be helpful but you are absolutely correct. We did see a stronger return in terms of demand from our large commercial and industrial customers and either they or we have been projecting in 2010.
Having said that, one off the factors and Allen mentioned this that is affecting the 2011 forecast is the fact that the automotive - it was actually the engine assembly plant for Chrysler in Kenosha has closed its doors and we have factored that into our forecast. The other thing that I think is influencing the forecast, Greg, is that two of our very largest customers, the iron ore mines in the upper peninsula of Michigan and a major specialty steel company here in Wisconsin, both are running at very high levels of capacity and those two customers were very much responsible for a lot of the uptick we saw in terms of our industrial demand last year and we think that further increases from here won’t be as strong as what we’ve seen.
So that just gives you a sense but if we’ve erred on the conservative side, so be it. And I think the basic message that I would leave with you is unlike lots of other companies we are not counting on any material increase at all in customer demand to achieve our earnings targets for 2011. Allen?

I guess maybe just to add two things, Greg. On the residential class if you look normal-to-normal, so you take 2011 forecast assuming normal weather and normalized 2010, we’re expecting about a 0.4 of 1% reduction in residential. And I think as I",204,"Yeah. I guess maybe just to add two things, Greg. On the residential class if you look normal-to-normal, so you take 2011 forecast assuming normal weather and normalized 2010, we’re expecting about a 0.4 of 1% reduction in residential. And I think as I mentioned in the script, part of our reason for that forecast is the assumption that there will be continued conservation efforts. Honestly, I mean that’s somewhat speculative. We don’t yet know how people are going to behave as it relates to conservation efforts. So to use Gale’s words, we could be overly conservative from that standpoint.
And then the only other thing I mean, if you - just to give you a feel for just the sensitivity of our earnings to sales growth, let’s just say if instead of a 0.6% decline overall in sales, let’s say there was a 1% excursion up. So instead of a 0.6 reduction say we had a 0.4% increase in sales, normal-to-normal, well that would mean about $16 million of pre-tax margin for us which on the new base of shares is about $0.04 a share. So that gives you a feel for how sensitive things would be if we are being overly conservative.

The first is that obviously our next major focus as I mentioned in our prepared remarks is the biomass plant that we proposed for northern Wisconsin, about a $255 million project. We think it’s a very solid project and we expect a decision from the commission in the next four to six weeks. Now if you step back and say, okay, with the two major wind farms that we will have in place by the end of this year, and assuming we get approval on the biomass project, and with the way the formula works that allows banking for early compliance, with all of those things we could meet the 2015 standard for one year. So without any further renewable construction if you will, but just given Glacier Hills, given Blue Sky Green Field, given the biomass project and the banking of credits from early compliance, for one year in 2015 we could meet the standard.
And I think what we need to do now, other than continuing to push forward with the biomass plan if approved, is really take a pause and see what the Walker administration wants to do related to renewables spending in the state going forward after 2015. I don’t believe that will be one of the first two or three things on his agenda, but by the end of 2011, I do expect there will be some attention paid by the legislature and the Walker administration to what that looks like, what the renewable goals look like with this new administration.
A couple of the things that have been beginning to be discussed, and there’s nothing set in concrete in terms of a change in policy at this stage of the game, but a couple of the things that are beginning to be discussed are things like, should the definition of renewables be changed? Or should the utilities be given an extra five years, say to 2020, to meet the compliance standard? Those are all things that are in the discussion stage and the thought stage at this point in time.
So we’re actually in a very good position in that with the work we’ve done so far and with the biomass project that we have teed up final approval I hope at the Commission, we could actually deliver the goal for 2015, but that would require using a - the bank of credits and therefore the question becomes what after 2015 and we’ll get clarity on that I believe this year. Does that help?

The three plants are the Valley plant, which is an older coal-fired unit just south of the downtown area of Milwaukee. The second is called the Milwaukee County Grounds plant, that is a much smaller - much, much smaller plant that provides steam-chilled water to a huge medical complex on the western side of city and then the third plant is the Presque Isle plant, which is an older coal-fired facility in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
All three of the plants have reliability, must run characteristics. The Valley plant for example is the only remaining operating power plant inside the city of Milwaukee and provides not only steam to all of the major downtown buildings, but also provides voltage support for the load pocket. So that’s a must-run facility and Rick has a team studying what our options, our best options there should we need to make modifications.
And then we have a similar study underway for the Milwaukee County grounds and also we’re now beginning to take a very hard look at what might need to be done in the Upper Peninsula with the Presque Isle plant. I think the next milestone will be probably February 22 when the EPA is expected to come out with its new Industrial Boiler MACT, Maximum Available Control Technology rules. But we are thinking that we will have to devote at least a couple of hundred million dollars of capital spending to modifications of the plant. Rick, how about add to that?

Timelines we would expect by this year we’d be making some decisions on Milwaukee Kennedy (ph) which is subject to the Industrial Boiler MACT rules and probably also for Valley which is not subject to Industrial Boiler MACT rules, they’re subject to the Electric Generating Unit MACT rules. And the dividing line is 25 megawatts: above 25 megawatts, EGU; below 25 megawatts, it’s Industrial Boiler.
I expect on those two plants we’ll be making decision this year, implementation kind of middle of the decade. Presque Isle is going to be just right behind that and so I think the capital that we’ll be spending will be primarily in the ‘12 through ‘14 to ‘15 timeframe.

The driver for the increase was almost exclusively for really two lines, two new 345-kV lines.

And the drivers clearly will be - Allen?

So first of all I think we are just fine with our growth prospects, with the economies of scale that we have and I would just say to you, it’s not one of the top ten things that I’m overly concerned about at the moment. If the stars and moon align then it would certainly be something we would look at.
Related to the holding company act in Wisconsin, I don’t believe it would be a huge impediment for a merger or acquisition or combination inside the state. But there clearly needs to be demonstrated customer benefit and I think the easier - obviously the easier demonstration of customer benefit would be for combinations inside the state, but I don’t see the holding company act in Wisconsin being a tremendous impediment if there was friendly merger or combination that was on the horizon.
For us, we would apply the same type of criteria we have mentioned in the past to any type of potential acquisition and that would be we would want it to be accretive certainly by the end of year one. We would want it to be at a minimum credit neutral and we would want it to be at least neutral to positive to our long-term earnings per share growth rate. I’m a firm believe that you really need to apply those kinds of criteria for a combination to deliver shareholder value that what our job really is to do. So we would be pretty strict about applying those type of criteria to any potential acquisition that we might look at and I hope that answers your question, Jim.

So if I just sort of narrow down, Ted, and look at the bonus depreciation impact on rate base and say look in the 2012 test period, do all the averaging that’s done, the bonus depreciation only has about $100 million impact in 2012.

And obviously, the window for 50% is much broader in time than the 100%. Then what you do is to determine whether you qualify for a window, you apply a two-part test. The first part of that test is placed in service. So that’s pretty straightforward. A piece of property that goes commercial in that window you can put a check mark by that test. The second test is the so-called acquired-in test.

In Wisconsin, the governor has the automatic right once there is a vacancy on the commission to appoint the chairman. So the person that will be appointed by the Walker administration will become the new chairman probably sometime in March. And we, obviously, don’t know yet who that person will be.

And so we have going into 2011 a new set of rules that are a modest improvement I think from the prior rules, in that each utility will be asked to come in, in the fall of the year and present their projected fuel costs for the next year. And then there will be a brief one-day hearing and the Commission will set a new fuel rate if required that would take effect in January 1 of a given year and apply for the next year. So that should be somewhat helpful in terms of reducing the volatility.
And then secondly the 2% bandwidth that has applied in the past, in other words a fuel rate is set and unless your costs deviate plus or minus 2% or more than 2% from the rate that’s been set, you have the upside potential and the downside risk and that stays in place. But a new fuel rule is now in place in the state of Wisconsin. And Allen?

And again, as Allen mentioned, the range that the Wisconsin Commission has historically provided would be about a 48.5% to a 53.5% equity ratio at the utilities.
And then in terms of the entire enterprise, well, we said that we want - we at least want to get to - we at least want to again maintain solid investment grade credit rating and have a total debt-to-capital that basically supports those credit ratings. So everything in terms of our look at a capital structure is driven by where we want to be on a credit rating standpoint. But clearly, we’ve now taken a lot of risk out of the business in terms of the successful execution of the construction Program. Our debt-to-total capital on an adjusted basis is now down around 54%, but I would think that we would want to keep it in that 54 to 55% range over the longer term. Allen?

And then the only other long-term obligations we would have, we’d have $200 million worth of unsecured debt that secures in 2033 and then the $500 million of hybrids which has the step-up in May of 2017. So we certainly will have the opportunity over the next few years to either leave those out if we wanted to and use the cash for other investments within our business, or if we wanted to have opportunities to pay those down, we’d also have opportunities to pay them down.

And for those listening who may not be quite familiar with it, we were the first in the country to really test a new technology for carbon capture that uses chilled ammonia to attract the carbon.

It achieved its operating goals for capture rate and is now, so the technology the next step now, the technology is being scaled up from where we had it by a factor of 10, at the Mountaineer power plant which is operated by American Electric Power in West Virginia.
So actually that technology is - it really performed very well for the first time out of a laboratory setting and the first time in the field.

We appreciate you joining us on our call to review the company's 2011 first quarter results.

We appreciate you joining us on our call to review the company's 2011 first quarter results. As always, let me begin by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy Management team who are here with me today. We’ve Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We Generation; Jim Fleming, our venerable General Counsel; Steve Dickson, our Controller; and Pat Keyes, who has joined the company as our new Treasurer. Pat, of course, is taking the reins from Jeff West. As many of you know, Jeff retired at the end of April after 41 years of service.
Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.72 a share for the first quarter of 2011. This compares with $0.55 a share for the first quarter a year ago.
The uplift in earnings for this year’s first quarter driven by the commercial operation of the second expansion unit at Oak Creek, which as you know was placed in service in the early morning hours of January 12.
Across our utility operations, we experienced improved fuel recovery in the first quarter and colder winter weather. Overall, we’re off to a solid start for the year.
Now, I’d like to briefly touch on the state of the economy across our service areas. Overall, electric sales to large commercial and industrial customers rose just 0.4% over the first quarter of 2010, but a deeper look inside the numbers will give you a more complete picture.
First, as you may remember, a Chrysler engine plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin shut down last year, and that is a permanent shut down. This plant was one of our larger customers and we have factored this closing into our 2011 forecast.
In addition, on February 2 of this year, we experienced a blizzard that shut down much of the region for a good couple of days. If you exclude these two items growth in energy used by our large commercial and industrial customers would have been in the 2% to 3% range which is right in line with our forecast, we’re seeing strength in iron ore mining, especially steel production and printing, and we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue throughout 2011.
Now, as I mentioned on our February call, we reached a milestone event in the first quarter as construction was completed on our Power the Future plan. More than 10 years ago, we developed a roadmap that we called Power the Future. It was fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency.
Key components of achieving self sufficiency include investing in two combined cycled gas fired units at Port Washington, which is north of Milwaukee and the construction of two super critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek which is south of the city and building a significant amount of renewable generation.
With the commercial operation of Unit 2 at Oak Creek, we've now completed the last of the four major units that were designed to provide our customers with a state-of-the-art generation fleet and provide clean reliable energy for many years to come.
The two natural gas fired units and the two coal fired units required a total investment of more than $2.6 billion, and we are very pleased with the efficiency and the environmental performance of these units.
Our customers are now receiving the operational benefits of these plants and our patient stockholders are beginning to realize the full benefit of their investments.
While we have largely completed our Power the Future effort there is clearly much more work to be done and more value to be created. We’ve several major projects underway and in the pipeline. To help us meet the States renewable energy standard we are building the Glacier Hills Wind Park on more than 17,000 acres of rolling farmland approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. When completed this will be the largest wind project in the State of Wisconsin.
It will consist of 90 turbines with the total generating capacity of 162 MW or about 1.8 MW per wind site. Construction began at Glacier Hills about a year ago and we're currently on track to begin full operation by the end of 2011. The total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $360 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction and reimbursable transmission costs.
As you know, we’ve also proposed a 50 MW cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin that is owned by the Domtar Corporation. This site, as I’ve mentioned, is close to significant forest lands that are harvested in a sustainable manner, yielding the wood waste that would power the land.
We received all the local permits necessary to move forward, and last week, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission held an open meeting on the matter. The Commission has expressed concern about the overall cost of the project and asked if Domtar would be willing to bear a greater share of the cost by paying more for the steam that the plant would produce. We and Domtar have filed a joint response actually just at noon today, and we expect the final decision from the Commission in the next week or so, and I believe that response you will find to be a very positive response.
Finally, on the construction front, we continue to make excellent progress on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the older coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We're investing approximately $900 million.
I might add, this is the second largest construction project in the history of the company. Approximately, $900 million including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas de-sulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these controls to be completed in 2012. As we speak, the project is more than 75% complete, and again, we're on time and on budget.
Another development during the first quarter, we completed the sale to Allied Energy of our 25% interest in Edgewater Unit 5. Edgewater 5 is an existing 380 MW coal-fired unit in Eastern Wisconsin. We sold the 95 MW of capacity that we owned at Edgewater for approximately $38 million. The sale price reflected our net book value including working capital. So, as a result we did not record any book gain or any book loss.
Turning to regulatory matters, I'd like to briefly touch on two items for you. First, late last week the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved a rate adjustment of less than 1% related to the higher fuel and purchase power cost that we’re incurring this year.
In our last general rate case, you may recall, we were allowed to file for our projected fuel and purchase power cost for the year 2011 and we filed for that increase back in September of 2010. Commission action on our request was delayed, but we’re pleased that an appropriate fuel recovery rate is now in place.
As a result of the delay, however, we expect to under collect our fuel cost by between $20 million and $25 million this year, but under the new fuel rules that went into effect this year, we estimate that our financial exposure will be limited to about $16 million, which should be the Wisconsin share and the $16 million is already factored into our guidance. The second regulatory matter is our upcoming rate filing. We expect to present a new rate proposal to the Wisconsin Commission within the next month.
Finally, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker recently appointed a new Public Service Commissioner to fill a vacancy that occurred this spring when Commission Meyer’s six-year term came to an end. The new Commissioner and the new Commission’s Chairman is Phil Montgomery. Phil brings a wealth of experience to the position having worked on utility, energy, and telecommunication issues while serving for 12 years as a Wisconsin State Legislator. For a number of those 12 years, Mr. Montgomery was Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Energy and Utilities. Confirmation hearing for Commission Chairman Montgomery is expected to take place in the State Senate in May, however, he may act with full authority prior to the confirmation. Needless to say, we're pleased that the Commission is back at full strength.
In summary, with the completion of our Power the Future plan, the company is at a very positive inflection point. We expect to have approximately $600 million of free cash flow from 2011 through 2015 and that's after retirement of $450 million of holding company debt.
Along with a stronger balance sheet, we've clearly lowered the risk profile of this company. The majority of our construction risk is now behind us and when the point of each units were sold in 2007, we put nuclear operating and regulatory risk behind us as well.
We're turning our efforts now to our renewable and environmental projects and continuing to upgrade the energy infrastructure of the region. We’re planning a capital budget of up to $3.4 billion over the next five years or about $1.9 billion to $2 billion of net rate base growth after ongoing depreciation expense. By mid-year we plan to announce or revise dividend policy, debt reduction, share repurchases or a combination of all three with internally generated cash.
Now in more details on our first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here is a familiar face but in a slightly different chair, our new Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?

Before I discuss our first quarter operating results, I’d like to remind you that our 2 for 1 stock split was effective on March 1, 2011. As a result of the split, we have changed the reporting of all prior earnings per share to reflect a new number of shares outstanding, so the $1.10 a share that we reported in the first quarter of 2010 is now $0.55 a share after the split.
As Gale mentioned, our 2011 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.72 a share as compared to $0.55 a share in 2010. I’ll focus on the earnings drivers at the operating income level by segment and then touch on the other income statement items. I’ll also discuss cash flows in the quarter.
Our consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2011 was $296 million as compared to $228 million in the 2010, an increase of $68 million. As expected, our utility operating earnings were higher because of favorable fuel recoveries as compared to 2010 and earnings from our non-utility energy segment were up with the commercial operations with a second unit at Oak Creek and a full quarter of earnings from the first Oak Creek unit. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $213 million, an increase of $35 million versus 2010.
On the positive side our revenues associated with the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs were up $24 million when compared to the first quarter of 2010. Last year we under collected fuel and purchase power costs by $23 million.
During the first quarter this year we were in a slightly favorable position. We also experienced a significantly colder first quarter this year and we estimate that our electric and gas margins were up $22 million as compared to last year.
On the negative side our utility O&M cost increased $10 million due to additional Power the Future costs, the timing of outages at our power plants and increased work on our distributions network.
Operating income in the non-utility energy segment which consists primarily of the Power the Future units was up $32 million. Unit 2 at Oak Creek was placed in service on January 12, 2011 and we realized full quarter's earnings on Unit 1. Last year we only realized partial quarter's earnings on Unit 1 as it was placed in the service on February 2, 2010.
Taking the changes for each of these segments together with a small increase in our corporate and other segment brings you back to the $68 million increase in operating income for the first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter of 2011, earnings from our investments in the American Transmission company increased just slightly over 2010.
Net interest expense increased by $14 million, primarily because of interest expense associated with Unit 2 at Oak Creek. When we placed the unit into service, we stopped capitalizing interest associated with construction of the plant.
We also issued $420 million of long-term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short-term debt incurred to finance the construction of Unit 2 and for other corporate purposes.
Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $18 million because of the higher pre-tax earnings offset in part by a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be between 34% and 35%. Combined all of these items brings you to $171 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2011 or earnings of $0.72 per share.
During the first quarter we generated $391 million of cash from operations which is up $87 million from the same period in 2010. Our cash earnings, which we define as net income plus depreciation and amortization, plus deferred income taxes increased by $120 million as compared to the first quarter of 2010.
In addition to higher net income, we deferred more income tax as a result of bonus depreciation and increased depreciation expense associated with new coal units. The largest change in our uses of operating cash flows relates to our benefit plans. In the first quarter of 2011, we contributed $122 million to our qualified benefit plans no such contributions were made in 2010.
Our total capital expenditures decreased by approximately $59 million in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to first quarter of 2010 because of the completion of the Oak Creek units. However, for the year we expect to see capital expenditures of approximately $950 million which is about a $150 million more than our 2010 expenditures.
Over the next nine months we should see higher capital spending related to our air quality control system at South Oak Creek and the Glacier Hills wind farm. As Gale mentioned earlier, we received approximately $38 million from the sale of Edgewater 5 in March 2011.
We also paid $61 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2011 which was 30% increase over the same period last year. The first quarter dividends equate to an annual dividend rate of $1.04 a share.
Our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 53.7% as of March 31, 2011. Our adjusted calculation treats half our hardwood securities as common equity which is consistent with past presentation. We used $223 million of cash on hand at March 31, 2011 to retire long-term debt that matured on April 1, 2011.
Adjusting for the use of cash on hand, our adjusted debt to total capital ratio was 52.5%. We’re very pleased with our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. We’re using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. As shown in the earnings package that we posted on our Web site this morning, our actual first quarter retail sales of electricity increased 1.4% as compared to 2010.
Our residential sales were helped by a colder than normal winter, and our large commercial and industrial customers are slightly below forecast because of the February 2 closure. We see some decline in average use by our residential customers. We believe this is the result of conservation efforts, but, overall, our electric sales are in line with our annual forecast.
As we look at our natural gas sales, we saw 11.4% increase in sales, primarily because of the cold winter. We’re also seeing our weather normalize natural gas sales in line with our annual forecasts.
As we mentioned on the February call, when the second unit at Oak Creek was placed into service, we issued $420 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first tranche was a $205 million note with a coupon rate of 4.673% and the final maturity in 2031. The second tranche was a $215 million note with a coupon rate of 5.848% and the final maturity in 2041. We used the net proceeds to repay debt incurred to finance the construction of Unit 2 at Oak Creek and for other corporate purposes.
As discussed earlier, on April 1, 2011, we retired $450 million of long-term debt with $223 million of existing cash in commercial paper borrowings. Later this year, we expect Wisconsin Electric to issue approximately $300 million of long-term debt to help fund its construction program.
Our 2011 earnings guidance remains the same as what we provided to you on our February conference call. We expect our earnings for 2011 to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.10 per share. While our first quarter earnings exceeded our forecast range because of favorable weather, we still have nine more months of weather ahead of us.
Before I turn things back over to Gale, I would like to briefly discuss our earnings outlook for the second quarter. As a starting point, our 2010 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.37 a share, adjusted for the 2 for 1 stock split.
When we look at our utility earnings, we expect to see a decline in operating income on a quarter-over-quarter basis because of favorable weather in 2010 and higher O&M cost in 2011.
Last year, we had an early summer and benefitted from some cooling out in June. This year our forecast assumed normal weather. However, we expect increased earnings from the second Oak Creek unit to offset the lower earnings from our utility in the second quarter.
In the past, we said that Unit 2 should contribute $0.02 a month pre-split or $0.01 a month post-split. As a result, we are expecting second quarter 2011 earnings to be in the $0.36 per share to $0.39 per share range or flat with the prior year.
With that I’ll turn things back over to Gale.

So We Power records revenue and the Utility records expense. This year We Power with the Unit 2 coming on line had about $30 million more of revenue and therefore, on the consolidation entries, we eliminated $30 million more revenue at We Power and $30 million more expense on a consolidated basis, so it's an accounting anomaly, which shows why the O&M is down.

The plant would produce both steam to power Domtar’s paper mill operations and renewable electricity for the grid.
And one of the major questions that the Commissioners had during their open meeting last week was, could there be a different allocation of cost between the cost that go to electric customers and the cost that Domtar would accept for the production of steam. And so Domtar has agreed to, what we think is, a very major price change. We’ll let Allen cover the details for you.

We believe that based on the conversation at the Commission last week, we believe this puts the cost of the project as compared to a wind project within a range that at least one of the Commissioners was looking for. So, as Gale mentioned, we would expect the decision in the near future from the Commission, but from a practical standpoint, we really need a decision by May 15 if we’re going to move forward with the project.

Second, you may remember in 2003, we entered into a consent decree with EPA, which drove controls at many of our other major plants.
And then, finally, we as a company unlike many others, we don't have ash impoundments. We’ve 100% beneficial reuse of the ash that comes from the combustion of the coal. So, we don't really see much many impact from EGU MACT or IB MACT on the company. The only three plants that we see they are mainly impacts on down the road, you have heard us talk about our Valley and our Milwaukee County power plants which are actually CoGen plants that produce steam as well as electricity and an electric plant that we have in the UP.
We see little impact on those units there could be a small amount of investment of those units because of EGU and or IB MACT, but the bigger impacts if there are going to be impacts than those plants would be out in the 2017 timeframe. They wouldn’t be driven by MACT, they would be driven by NAAQS, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for SO2 in particular now, but again, we wouldn’t see impacts there if any until 2017.

He was concerned that it looked like based on staff analysis that this proposal was more expensive than generic wind. He said gosh, he would feel comfortable he said, if we could have some kind of, as he put it wind bogie against which to compare.
Now, when we look at the staff assumption on generic wind and the cost of generic wind, there are a couple of items here that I think, are worth pointing out. The staff's analysis on the cost of generic wind assumed that the federal production tax credit for wind would go on for a very long time. We don't think it's prudent to make that assumption because under the current law the federal production tax credit for wind expires at the end of 2012.
And then when you factor that into the fact that generic wind may not represent the real cost of building wind in Wisconsin in light of the flux that the state is in regarding the citing rules. I mean, we think the real generic cost of wind can be materially higher than what the staff indicated. And then if you couple that with price reduction that Allen described from what Domtar and we filed at noon today, you get much, much closer. In fact, we think and hope we’ve achieved what Commissioner Callisto was looking for which was a proposal that would be quite close to the cost of generic wind. Guys, would you like to add anything?

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 second quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy Management team who are here with me today.
We have Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, our generous General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, our Controller.
Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 a share for the second quarter of 2011. This compares with $0.37 a share for the comparable period last year.
Our second quarter 2011 were driven by earnings from our $668 million investment in the second expansion unit at expansion unit at Oak Creek, which as you know came on line in January this year. Overall, we are quite pleased with our second quarter and our year-to-date performance.
Now I would like to focus for a few minutes on the economy across our service area. After nearly double-digit rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by a little more than 1% in the first half of the 2011.
When we take a look a little deeper inside the numbers, we see that the demand destruction from five large plant closings during the great recession is now being largely offset by modest growth and recovery in other sectors of the region’s economy. For example, we are seeing strength in iron ore mining, specialty steel production and in the paper and printing industries. And from talking with our largest customers, we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue throughout the remainder of the year.
Now, when we look at our residential customers, we see flat sales for the first half of this year compared to the first six months of 2010. As you know, however, the Midwest was in the grip of old-fashioned heat wave and residential and commercial dimension was strong. In fact the peak demand on our system rose to within 2.5% of our all-time record one-hour demand.
One other point about recent heat wave, I’m pleased to report that our for new power the future units, the two natural-gas fired units at Port Washington and the two coal-fire units at Oak Creek performed very well. Before units were online the throughout the hot spell, they were war course units. Helping to meet customer needs in a very cost-effective manner. As a result, there were no runouts, no blankouts, no threats of curtailment and no long calls to interrupt our industrial customers.
The experience reaffirms our decision to complete our Power the Future plan, investing in critical energy infrastructure to ensure the liability from Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. And now I would like to update you on the three significant construction projects that we have underway. The 50 Megawatt biomass plant in northern Wisconsin, the glazier hills wind park, north-east of Madison and the air quality control upgrade of original Oak Creek units.
As a mention on previous call, 50 megawatt cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin, which is owned by Domtar Corporation was proposed by our company really know almost 2 years ago generation plan will help us to diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We will have the ability, as you know, to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology will clearly benefit the existing paper mill.
In the second quarter of this year the Wisconsin Public Service Commission gave the final approval for the project. The project was also approved by our board and by the Domtar Corporation Board of Directors.
In late June we broke around and began construction. The investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between 245 and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. At the early stage of the project, we are on schedule and on budget to meet the completion day by the end of 2013.
The other large renewable project on our pipeline is the Glacier Hills Wind Park, the 162 MW energy center located approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. We’re now erecting 90 wind towers across more than 15,000 acres of rolling farmland and we’re scheduled to complete the project on time and on budget by the end of this year.
Our current estimate of the capital cost for Glacier Hills is $361 million. This estimate does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs. The Glacier Hills Wind Park and the biomass projects are two key components that will allow us to meet Wisconsin’s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015.
To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 20% in 2015 at a state-wide level. The standard also sets targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.
As I mentioned, when the complete the two large renewable projects, we now have under construction, we will be well positioned to meet the 2015 standard. I should point out however that we will be depleting our bank of our renewable credits after 2015 and as a result, we expect to need additional renewable capacity by the year 2017.
Finally, we are well along on the air quality control upgrade at the original coal-fired units on the Old Creek site. The older units at Oak Creek are among the most efficient base load units in the mid-west. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities.
We expect the new controls to be completed in 2012. Construction is progressing very well, the project now is about 83% complete and once again we are on time and on budget.
And now I’d like to briefly mention where we stand on the Wisconsin and Michigan regulatory fronts on May 26 we filed an application with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission requesting no net increase in base rates for the year 2012. Our proposal includes the following key items. First authorization to suspend the amortization of a $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012.
Second authorization to include $148 million of the carrying costs and depreciation, for the air quality controls of that will creek and for the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Third a fuel cost plan for 2012, and finally a one-time credit to customers of $26 million. The credits stand for most Wisconsin Electric’s settlement and spread nuclear field litigation in the US Department of energy.
We also ask for the authority to re-open the rate proceeding next year, for new rates that would be effective in 2013. Now keep in mind that under a traditional rate case, we would have filed for a base rate increase of approximately 6% for Wisconsin Electric’s retail customers in the year 2012.
We also said that if the commission was not comfortable with our creative approach. We’d proceed with a traditional rate case. After reviewing our request, the commission stab issued a memo last week with several alternatives for the commission to consider. A stab asked for final comments from all the parties in the case by the end of the day tomorrow July, 29. So as to think about our request and about the stab memo. There are several things to keep in mind. First, the stab ordered of our projected revenue needs points as we expected to a revenue deficiency for 2012.
Using the stab numbers, we believe the revenue deficiency would be approximately $100 million in 2012. And that’s before any company - to the stab’s proposed adjustments. Company would take place in any additional rate proceedings. This clearly implies that a traditional rate case would result in rate increase in 2012.
Secondly, we offered, what we believe was a unique approach to keeping base rate flat for customers during the economic recovery. And finally the company has big ability to file a full rate case at any point in time. So after assessing the stab memo, we believe the only viable alternatives are the two past, we’re originally proposed.
A zero based at increased by 2012 with our recommended approach or a traditional rate case. We expect to this constant commission to decide in August. Starting that to our Michigan operations. Earlier this month we be filed $17.5 million rate increase request with Michigan Public Service Commission.
The request is recover from a Michigan customers, they’ll provide a share of renewable generation, environment controls and costs associated with the unit 2 at Oak Creek. These costs are already by the way being recovered in the Wisconsin jurisdiction in Michigan recovery takes place only after an asset is completed and placed into commercial service. As provided for under Michigan law, we planned to self-implement 7.7 million of our rate increase request in January of 2012 we expect the Michigan commission to rule on the entire request by July of next year.
In summary, at the halfway point of 2011, the companies performing at a high-level and our power in the future investments are clearly providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stock holders. And while we systematically look for solid utility investments in the future that we meet our risk profile, we’re pleased that our board is approved two measures that will deliver additional shareholder value.
As I mentioned in May we have approval to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock between now and the end of 2013. The board has also approved a dividend policy that will target a 60% payout ratio by the year 2015. This policy of course should support dividend increases of about 8% to 9% a year for the next several years. And now with more details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here’s our Chief Financial Officer Rick Kuester. Rick?

315117,129798366,148290,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Gale.

As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2011 second quarter earnings from continuing operation were $0.41 per share. The results were slightly better than our plan because of lower than the expected benefits cost and a favorable adjustment related to income tax expense. Although, I’ll focus my comments in operating income from continuing operations by segment and then touch on other income statement items, I did want to mention that we also recorded a gain of $0.05 per share from discontinued operations. As a result of the resolution of several state and federal tax issues. I will also discuss year-to-date cash flows and guidance for the third quarter and the full year.
Our consolidated operating income in the second quarter of 2011 was $174 million as compared to $163 million in last year’s second quarter, an increase of $11 million. We clearly benefited from a full quarter’s earnings from the second expansion unit at (inaudible). Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $88 million which is down $10 million from the prior year. As we discuss on our last call we expect our utility earnings to be down this quarter because of warmer than normal second quarter in 2010 and increased operating cost in 2011.
Colder weather negatively impacted this quarter results but our calls came in slightly better than anticipated. We estimate that a cooler April and May helped our gas margins by $11 million as compared to second quarter 2010. However we experienced a mild June this year and we estimate weather reduced our electrical margins $16 million as compared to second quarter last year. When we combine the electric and gas margins. We experienced to decline of $5 million on the year-over-year basis due to weather. The other significant factor in packing utility operating income for the quarter relates to the collection of fuel revenues.
On the net basis, we were $9 million worse in the second quarter of 2011 as compared with last year. When you take the weather and fuel recovery together, with all other items you see the $10 million decline in the operating income at the utility.
Our operating income in the non-utility energy segment which includes repower came in as expected. We saw higher operating income of $21 million that was driven by the commercial operation of unit 2 Widow Creek.
We would expect this favorable variance to continue in the third and the fourth quarter. Taking the changes for these two segments together, you arrive at $11 million increase in operating income for the second quarter of 2011.
During the second quarter of 2011 earnings from our investment in the American transmission Company total just over $15 million. Other income increased by $5 million because of higher APDC on our utility construction projects.
Primarily the air quality control system for the elder Creek units and the Glacier Hills went par. Net interest expense increased by $4 million primarily because of interest expense associated with the second unit at Oak Creek.
In January we issued $420 million of long-term debt, to replace short-term debt used to finance the construction of the unit 2.
In addition once unit 2 achieves commercial operation, we no longer capitalized interest on the construction work in the progress. While we saw increased interest expense at to the power level, our holding company interest expense a decline as we retired $450 million or 6.5% long-term debt on April 1 of this year.
Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $2 million because of higher pre-tax earnings, offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. During the second quarter, our income tax expenses was reduced by $2.2 billion because of our favorable resolution of uncertain tax decision in our continuing operations. For the year we expect our effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%.
Combining all of these items brings you to get $98 of net income from continuing operation for the second quarter of 2011 or earnings of $.41 per share.
During the first six months of 2011 we generated $649 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $225 million in the same period in 2010.
Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and a higher non-cash charge of related to depreciation and deferred income tax. On an adjusted basis our cash of operation increased by $106 million. The adjustment related to how GAAP treat changes in restrictive cash as in inventing activity, while we look at this as an operating on item.
Our 2011 cash flows were also reduce by $122 million, because of contributions to our benefit plans. No such contributions were made in 2010. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $347 million in the first six months of 2011. And we are forecasting annual capital expenditure this year of approximately $950 million. The majority of our capital expenditures are in the utility business and the largest project the air quality control system at the Oak Creel site and the Glacier Hills in Wind Park.
We also paid $122 million in common dividends in first half 2011, which was a 30% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-cap ratio was 55.2% and we were at 52.4% on an adjusted basis. These ratios were an improvement over our December 31, 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We might see a slight uptick these ratios by the end of the year as we fulfill our capital budget commitments and repurchase shares.
However, we expect our year-end ratios to be well under the prior year numbers. Consistent with our past practice, we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Through July 25, 2011, we have repurchased approximately 650,000 common shares at an average price of approximately $31.40 under the $300 million share repurchase program that Gale mentioned.
We will update you each quarter on the progress of our share repurchase program.
As Gale mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic that the investment recovery will continue through the year based on our electric sales volume for the first half. Anticipated declines due to plant closings in some segments were offset by growth in other segments. To-date, our weather normalized retail sales have grown by 0.8% as compared to 2010. Excluding sales to our largest customers the iron ore mine, normalized sales were leveled with 2010 for the first half of the year. These results were in line with our overall forecast.
I will now discuss our earnings guidance for this year. We are raising our annual earnings guidance from a range of $2.05 to $2.10 a share to a revised range of $2.10 to $2.14 a share from the continuing operations. We’re comfortable rising this range, because of our strong results through the first half of the year, which were driven by cold weather, slightly strong electric sales to our largest customers and effective cost controls. We will also benefit from the extremely hot weather we have experienced in July, but with that said, we still have over five months to avoid the risk. Offsetting these factors will be unfavorable fuel collections as compared to our original plan.
For the third quarter of 2011, we are forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations in the $0.47 to $0.50 a share range. Last year we earned $0.47 a share in the third quarter, restated for the 2 for 1 stock split earlier this year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we see four large items that are expected to cause variance in quarterly earnings.
First, last year was very hard and we estimate that weather helped our third quarter earnings by $0.8 a share. Second, with the implementation of new fuel rules, we expect to see a favorable variance of $0.05 in fuel recoveries this quarter. We expect to undercollect fuel cost in the third quarter, but collect more than in 2010. Third, we expect increased O&M expenses associated with strong damage in July and a major maintenance project that went about 18 facilities.
Finally, the income from unit 2 at Oak Creek should boast third quarter earnings by $0.3 a share. These four factors get us to about $0.48 a share from continuing operation for the third quarter of 2011. We increased the range slightly for the hot July weather.
With that, I will turn things back over to Gale.

First of all, we do expect that the commission will vote on our proposal in August. So I don’t think we’re going to see a significant delay from here in getting a decision from the commission on Door A or Door B. Door A being our creative approach to holding base rates flat or us filing a full rate case and moving through that proceeding. One bit of insight into, if we had to go through Door B, which obviously we believe the company would be just fine going through Derby.
We have already filed - when we filed on May 26, we already filed all the backup data related to our projected revenue requirements for 2012. And when the staff did its memo relating to various options or various ideas that they had, what they actually published in that memo was a preliminary audit of our 2012 - what a 2012 rate case might look like. So we are not as far behind procedurally if we had to go through Derby as one might expect because all the data has been on file. We would refresh the data and if the Commission wants us to proceed with a full general rate case, my guess is, we could file the remaining refreshed data within a couple of weeks after that decision.

The staffs did seem to - as we went through the staff memo, the staffs certainly did seem to provide some potential alternatives adjustments. I’m not sure as I’ve read through that they have actually recommended anything except that they put on the table several other options. One, I think compelling point, as we’ve read through that staff memo is that, if the answer is zero then getting to zero with staff adjustments versus getting the zero with our proposal, leaves the customer in exactly the same spot in 2012.
The customers now better off. But if the staff makes adjustments, then the company would be weaker. So our view as I mentioned in the script is really our only two viable, workable options here. One is, the creative approach with the order that we described or we will certainly proceed with the full case and that’s because the real issue here is how to make room for and how to begin recovering almost $1.3 billion of new investments in projects the commission is already approved and projects are on time and on budget.
So the issue we are trying to deal with here is, we clearly have under Wisconsin regulation, we clearly have $1.3 billion but has to begin being recovered in rates next year and we thought we could find a way through the accounting order and the seizing of the amortization of some of the commission I’ll use, they’ve given us. We thought we could manage the company and stay flat with base rates next year but if that’s not the case, in other words if they feel like that’s just not the way to go. Then you’re correct, the only viable alternative is to proceed with the full case.

These facilities have traditionally been owned by the state operated by state employees and generally provide energy services or steam services to state buildings ranging from the University of Wisconsin campus in Madison to the state actually.
Walker administration has taken a position that they believe given the major amounts of capital that will probably have to be spend to upgrade a number of these plants with modern environmental control, that they might consider a sale, of those state own power plants, that would take a piece of legislation. We believe the legislation might be introduced this fall, to enable the Department of Administration, to basically conduct a sale of some or all of those plants. So that is probably what you are hearing. We would have some interest in some of those facilities and it certainly could be if the legislation pass, the potential investment opportunity for us right here inside the state of Wisconsin.

Of those regulations and those proposals are being debated right now by FERC and the Congress.
But remember we have a pretty sizable natural gas distribution business.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 third quarter results.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today.
We have Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We Generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer and Steve Dickson, of the Controls. Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment.
But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.69 a share for the first nine months of this year. That compares with earnings of $1.39 a share from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2010. For this year’s third quarter, our earnings from continuing operations came in at $0.55 a share, up from $0.47 a share in the third quarter a year ago.
Now, compared to our forecast, two factors influenced our positive results in the latest quarter. The first was weather. The Midwest recorded warm temperatures and high humidity this summer which led to strong demand for air conditioning. It literally was hot time in the summer in the city during much of July and August. In fact, the peak demand on our system rose to within 2.5% of our all-time record one hour demand. We also saw slightly stronger growth across the commercial sector of the region.
When we compare our numbers to the prior year third quarter, we realized higher earnings from our Power the Future assets driven by our investment in the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. We also benefited from booking higher allowance per funds used during construction at Wisconsin Electric as we continued to invest in utility projects that have been approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and our year-to-date performance.
Now, I’d like to focus for a few minutes on the economy across our service area. After a nearly double-digit increase and rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by a little less than 1% in the first three quarters of 2011. When we take a closer look inside the numbers, we see that the demand destruction from five large plant closings during the great recession is now being largely offset by modest growth in recovery and other sectors of the region’s economy. For example, we are seeing strength in iron ore mining, in specialty steel, and metal fabrication, paper and printing and in the production of industrial machinery. And from talking with our largest customers, we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue.
Next, I’d like to update you on the three significant construction projects we have underway, a 50-megawatt biomass plant at Northern Wisconsin, The Glacier Wind Park, Northeast of Madison, and the Air Quality Control upgrade of the original Oak Creek units. You may recall last quarter we announced that construction was underway on a 50-megawatt cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill owned by Domtar Corporation in Northern Wisconsin. Good progress has been made on critical underground work and on the foundation for the boiler.
On August 25, 1,700 cubic yards of concrete was continuously delivered on port for the foundation. Of course, the biomass plant will help us diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We will be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will be used to produce steam will clearly benefit the existing paper mill. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We are on schedule and on budget to meet a completion date by the end of 2013.
The other large renewable project in our pipeline, of course, is the Glacier Hills Wind Park, a 162 megawatt energy center located on more than 15,000 acres of rolling farmland about 45 miles northeast of Madison. Ironically, higher than normal winds in late spring and early summer slowed our construction, but we are on track now and making excellent progress. As of yesterday, 88 of the 90 wind turbines planned for the site had been erected and approximately half of the turbines are already producing power for the grid. We are scheduled to complete the project on time and on budget by the end of this year.
Our current estimate of the capital cost for the Glacier Hills site is $361 million. This estimate does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs.
The biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park are key components that will position us to meet Wisconsin’s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, standard calls for an increase and the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources, from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.
When we complete the two large projects we have underway, we will be on target to meet the 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewable credits, and as a result, we project the need for additional credits by the year 2017.
Finally, we are making excellent progress on the air quality control upgrade in the original coal-fired units at the Oak Creek side. These units are among the most efficient baseload units in the Midwest. So, the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities. As of today, the project is about 90% complete. Our project team is now finalizing an extensive testing protocol, which is a key step of course in the final stages of construction. And once again we are on time and on budget. We expect the new controls at Oak Creek to be completed during 2012.
Now, I would like to switch gears and briefly review where we stand on the regulatory fronts in both Wisconsin and Michigan. As you know on October 6, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved our creative approach to keep base rates flat for customers, as the economy continues to recover. We were pleased that the commission found value for customers in our proposed plan. And in this fragile economy, our customers now have certainty on the cost of electricity for the year ahead, with base rates to remain at 2011 levels through 2012.
The rate plan also authorizes us to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012. Then the plan authorizes us to recover $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation for the air quality controls at Oak Creek and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. In addition, we have filed a fuel cost plan for the year 2012.
And finally as part of that fuel cost plan, we will provide customers with a one-time credit of $26 million. The credit stems from Wisconsin Electric settlement of spent nuclear fuel litigation with the U.S. Department of Energy. We expect an order on our fuel cost recovery plan in January 2012. It’s also important to note that we have the authority to file a full rate case next year for new rates to be effective in January of 2013.
Turning now to our Michigan operations, you will recall that earlier this year we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for a rate increase of $17.5 million annually. We are seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls, and cost associated with Unit 2 of Oak Creek.
As provided for under our Michigan law, we plan to self implement $7.7 million of our request in January of 2012 and that would represent a 4.4% rate increase. If the Commission accepts our proposal that amount would be partially offset by the Michigan portion of the DOE settlement. So, the net result would be an interim rate increase for customers of 2.8%. We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on the entire request by July of 2012.
On another important topic, the Environmental Protection Agency issued on August 8 its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule commonly known as CSAPR. Earlier this month, the EPA announced a plan to revise CSAPR with a provisional hearing set for tomorrow actually October 28 in Washington. We believe that our additional cost to comply with CSAPR will be far less than many of our peers, because of the investments we have made in Air Quality Control technology. Investments that are complete or nearing completion at our older coal-fired units and because of the new state-of-the-art generation we’ve built through our Power the Future plan. However, we do have some concerns about CSAPR as it relates to the upper peninsula of Michigan. Based on our analysis, we believe that the EPA has failed to allocate sufficient allowances to support minimum levels of generation at our Presque Isle Power Plant.
Operations at the Presque Isle facility are necessary to maintain system reliability in what has historically been a very constrained region. We have filed petitions with both the EPA and the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals supporting our position. Our preferred approach is simply to have one assurance area for our integrated combined system. EPA’s current approach is to have separate and distinct assurance areas for Wisconsin and for Michigan.
Finally, I’d like to address our share repurchase plan and our dividend policy. To maintain appropriate financial strength and provide value to our stockholders, we have implemented a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buyback up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.
Through today, we have repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at an average price of $30.32. Earlier this year, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy that calls for a pay-out ratio of 60% of earnings in the year 2015. Trending toward a 60% pay-out ratio will allow us to be more competitive with the dividend policies of other regulated utilities across the industry. And as a first step in implementing our new dividend policy, I am pleased to report that management will recommend to the Board a dividend increase in the range of 13% to 15% for the year 2012.
In summary, with three quarters of this year already in the books, the company continues to perform at a high level and our Power the Future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stockholders.
And now with more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here is our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?

As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2011 third quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 a share. The results were better than our plan because of hotter than normal summer weather, a slightly better than expected growth in commercial sales and a continued emphasis on cost management. I will focus my comments on operating income from continuing operations by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss year-to-date cash flows and earnings guidance for the full year.
Our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2011 was $224 million as compared to $203 million in last year's third quarter, an increase of $21 million. We clearly benefited from the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. Operating income in our Utility Energy segment totaled $136 million, which is up $2 million from the prior year. When we look at our electric margins, we see a $2 million improvement.
When we breakdown the components of our electric margin, we see that weather had a negative impact of $9 million in 2011. While this summer was significantly hotter than normal, it was not as hot as the prior year. We estimate that weather helped our margins this quarter by approximately $21 million.
However, we estimate that last year’s hot summer helped our margins about $30 million. Offsetting this impact, was a stronger than expected growth in electric sales to our commercial sector and an increase in electric demand in our industrial segment. We estimate that these two items helped our margins by approximately $10 million as compared to the third quarter of 2010.
When you look at the rest of the detail of our utility operating income, you see several small items that net to a positive impact of approximately $1 million. Our operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which includes repower came in as expected and was consistent with prior quarters. We saw higher operating income of $21 million that was driven by the commercial operation of Unit 2 at Oak Creek. Unit 2 achieved commercial operation in January of this year, so we did not have any earnings associated with Unit 2 in the prior years.
Taking the changes for these two segments together, along with corporate charges and other miscellaneous items, you arrived with a $21 million increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled nearly $16 million. Other income increased by $6 million, because of higher allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC on our utility construction projects, primarily to air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills wind park. AFUDC of course allows us to earn a return on these approved utility projects during construction.
Our net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily because of interest expense associated with the second unit at Oak Creek. In January, we issued $420 million of long term debt to replace short term debt used to finance the construction of Unit II. In addition, once Unit II achieved commercial operations, we no longer capitalized interest on the construction work in progress.
While we saw increased interest expense at We Power level, our holding company interest expense declined as we retired $450 million of 6.5% long-term debt on April the 1st of this year. In addition, we were able take advantage of the low interest rate environment in September when our Wisconsin Electric subsidiary issued 10-year bonds with a coupon rate below 3%.
Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $6 million because of higher pre-tax earnings, offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. Combining all of these items brings you to $130 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 or earnings of $0.55 per share.
During the first nine months of 2011, we generated $828 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $174 million from the same period in 2010. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operation increased by $5 million. The adjustments relate to how GAAP treats changes in restricted cash as an investing activity while we look at this as an operating item. Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and higher non-cash charges related to depreciation and deferred income tax benefits as a result of bonus depreciation.
Our 2011 operating cash flows were reduced by $257 million because of contributions to our qualified benefit plans. We made a $122 million contribution to our benefit plans in January and another $135 million contribution in September. No such contributions were made in 2010.
Our total capital expenditures were approximately $612 million in the first nine months of 2011 and we are forecasting annual capital expenditures this year of approximately of $900 million, which is below our plan of $950 million. The reduction is primarily related to the timing of expenditures on the biomass project given a later start date than originally planned.
The majority of our capital expenditures are in the utility business, and the largest projects are the air quality control system on the original Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills wind park. We also paid a $182 million in common dividends for the first 9 months of 2011, which was a 30% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis our debt-to-cap at the end of the third quarter was 56.5% and we were at 53.7% on an adjusted basis.
These ratios are slight improvement over our December 31, 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We may see a slight uptick in these ratios by the end of the year as we fulfill our capital budget commitment and repurchase shares.
Consistent with our past practice we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for a 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any shares, any additional shares. As we discussed in the past our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock through 2013.
As Gale noted through today we have repurchased approximately $2.5 million common shares at an average price of $30.32 a share. Year-to-date, our weather normalized retail sales have grown by 1.2% compared to 2010. Excluding sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, year-to-date normalized sales increased by 0.6% compared to 2010. These results excluding the iron ore mines are about 0.5% better than our original forecast due to modest economic recovery and delaying some customer owned generation projects.
I will now discuss our earnings guidance. We are raising our guidance for 2011 from a range of a $2.10 to $2.14 a share to a revised range of $2.13 to $2.16 a share from continuing operations. We’re comfortable raising the range because of our strong results for the first nine months of the year, which were driven by cold winter weather, hot summer weather, improved electric sales and effective cost controls.
With that, I will turn the things back over to Gale.

Let me first back up and talk about the policy that our board has adopted. As you will recall, our payout ratio because we had such a very solid use for our cash generation in investing in the Power the Future units, our payout ratio among utilities that do pay a dividend, is and remains one of the lowest payout ratios in the industry.
Clearly now, as Power the Future is behind us, we want to become more competitive with our peers in terms of the dividend payout ratio. So, as we looked at our earnings profile and our cash generation over the next five years in our analysis, we believe we could afford, while maintaining very solid credit ratings. We could afford to move to a roughly 60% payout ratio and trend toward that 60% payout ratio by the year 2015.
In our analysis, we said that that would support roughly an 8% to 9% annual dividend increase every year between now and 2015. Clearly, our cash generation is better this year than we projected, as you saw in Rick’s numbers on our debt-to-total cap, we continue to improve, and it was pretty clear to us that we could afford to move a little quicker in implementing that policy. So the policy remains same right now, of moving toward a 60% and trending toward a 60% payout ratio in 2015, is just we can move quicker with the strength of the underlying cash flows and the strength of the underlying earnings. And so, we will recommend to the board a 13% to 15% dividend increase for 2012, and then beyond that, we still believe we can support a roughly 8% annual dividend increase through 2015. I hope that responds to your question, Greg.

And the answer to that is what provides the best after tax return for our shareholders. So clearly the number one priority would be to invest in solid utility projects where there is a need and clearly we cannot, should not, and will not propose a utility project that’s not needed for reliability or for customer growth or for safety and regulation and continued safe operation of the system.
But as you can see we have about $3.4 billion of those kinds of utility projects on the horizon between 2011 and 2015. So number one use of the cash is to continue to be the most reliable utility in the country. Second then after that is asking the same question, what is the best after tax return for our shareholders, within the parameters of maintaining our credit ratings. And we simply drive our decisions off of that question.
Right now, if the share price that we’ve been able to buy back share so far, Rick mentioned $30.32 a share on average. That still provides a better after tax return then paying a premium to lower our debt levels. So, we continue to look for appropriate utility projects. As you know, we have a list of other projects that we have on the horizon that we're looking at. Some of them would be outside the utility for example, if the state decided to try to put up for sale some of the state owned power plants, we would view that as a potential solid utility investment perhaps outside the rate base. But in general terms to Jim kind of how we look at the business and how we try to deploy the cash.

In addition, right now, we are accruing AFUDC on the projects, and once those projects go into service, the AFUDC will stop. So, those are two items that will stop - that will be reduced as compared to our forecast for 2011.
Then what we will have when the plans go into service, we will have additional depreciation on those units. And so our depreciation costs will go up. So, our O&M should go down. Our depreciation will go up. Our AFUDC which is in other income will go down. Net, net, net, if everything else is equal our net income should be up and in effect that reflects the recovery of the plants that will go into service. And a key point here is that revenues everything else being equal will not change. So, our customers will not pay any additional amounts so revenues are flat. Does that make sense?

Obviously we are open and continue to look at what might make sense in terms of mergers, acquisitions, consolidation.

So those are the criteria that we apply and frankly, if - I think those criteria are very important, because if you don’t adhere to those criteria, my own view is you are not creating shareholder value. So Rick and Al and I are very related to those criteria. And then beyond that there has to be a willing seller and a willing buyer.

First of all, I would caution you a little bit about looking quarter-to-quarter sequentially because some of our larger customers like for example, the iron ore mines. They might have planned outages for their own maintenance at different times in the year and I know for example, Rick and I were talking about this the other day.
Our September, individual month of September industrial sales were impacted by the fact that the mines took a planned outage earlier this year than they did last year. So, I think it's more instructive to look at a bit longer period of time, like a half or three quarters. When you look at that, industrial sales - we were I think appropriately cautious about our projections for growth in industrial sales, but we’re not seeing any substantial weakening and the sectors that I mentioned in the prepared script, iron ore mining, specialty steel and metal fabrication, production of industrial machinery, paper and printing, they are continuing to show some growth.
Then in addition to that, I’ve been very encouraged. We’ve had a number of expansions in relocation announcements in the Milwaukee region in the last few weeks and I know from personal involvement there are more to come.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today.We",1846,"Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today.
We have Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We Generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer and Steve Dickson, of the Controls. Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment.
But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.69 a share for the first 9 months of this year. That compares with earnings of $1.39 a share from continuing operations for the first 9 months of 2010. For this year’s third quarter, our earnings from continuing operations came in at $0.55 a share, up from $0.47 a share in the third quarter a year ago.
Now, compared to our forecast, 2 factors influenced our positive results in the latest quarter. The first was weather. The Midwest recorded warm temperatures and high humidity this summer which led to strong demand for air conditioning. It literally was hot town in the summer, summer in the city, during much of July and August. In fact, the peak demand on our system rose to within 2.5% of our all-time record 1 hour demand. We also saw slightly stronger growth across the commercial sector of the region.
When we compare our numbers to the prior year third quarter, we realized higher earnings from our Power the Future assets driven by our investment in the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. We also benefited from booking higher allowance per funds used during construction at Wisconsin Electric as we continued to invest in utility projects that have been approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and our year-to-date performance.
Now, I’d like to focus for a few minutes on the economy across our service area. After a nearly double-digit increase and rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by a little less than 1% in the first 3 quarters of 2011. When we take a closer look inside the numbers, we see that the demand destruction from five large plant closings during the great recession is now being largely offset by modest growth in recovery and other sectors of the region’s economy. For example, we are seeing strength in iron ore mining, in specialty steel, and metal fabrication, paper and printing and in the production of industrial machinery. And from talking with our largest customers, we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue.
Next, I’d like to update you on the 3 significant construction projects we have underway, a 50-megawatt biomass plant at Northern Wisconsin, the Glacier Wind Park, Northeast of Madison, and the Air Quality Control upgrade of the original Oak Creek units. You may recall last quarter we announced that construction was underway on a 50-megawatt cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill owned by Domtar Corporation in Northern Wisconsin. Good progress has been made on critical underground work and on the foundation for the boiler.
On August 25, 1,700 cubic yards of concrete was continuously delivered on port for the foundation. Of course, the biomass plant will help us diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We will be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will be used to produce steam will clearly benefit the existing paper mill. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We are on schedule and on budget to meet a completion date by the end of 2013.
The other large renewable project in our pipeline, of course, is the Glacier Hills Wind Park, a 162 megawatt energy center located on more than 15,000 acres of rolling farmland about 45 miles northeast of Madison. Ironically, higher than normal winds in late spring and early summer slowed our construction, but we are on track now and making excellent progress. As of yesterday, 88 of the 90 wind turbines planned for the site had been erected and approximately half of the turbines are already producing power for the grid. We are scheduled to complete the project on time and on budget by the end of this year.
Our current estimate of the capital cost for the Glacier Hills site is $361 million. This estimate does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs.
The biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park are key components that will position us to meet Wisconsin’s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, standard calls for an increase and the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources, from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.
When we complete the 2 large projects we have underway, we will be on target to meet the 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewable credits, and as a result, we project the need for additional credits by the year 2017.
Finally, we are making excellent progress on the air quality control upgrade in the original coal-fired units at the Oak Creek side. These units are among the most efficient baseload units in the Midwest. So, the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities. As of today, the project is about 90% complete. Our project team is now finalizing an extensive testing protocol, which is a key step of course in the final stages of construction. And once again we are on time and on budget. We expect the new controls at Oak Creek to be completed during 2012.
Now, I would like to switch gears and briefly review where we stand on the regulatory fronts in both Wisconsin and Michigan. As you know on October 6, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved our creative approach to keep base rates flat for customers, as the economy continues to recover. We were pleased that the commission found value for customers in our proposed plan. And in this fragile economy, our customers now have certainty on the cost of electricity for the year ahead, with base rates to remain at 2011 levels through 2012.
The rate plan also authorizes us to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012. Then the plan authorizes us to recover $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation for the air quality controls at Oak Creek and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. In addition, we have filed a fuel cost plan for the year 2012.
And finally as part of that fuel cost plan, we will provide customers with a one-time credit of $26 million. The credit stems from Wisconsin Electric settlement of spent nuclear fuel litigation with the U.S. Department of Energy. We expect an order on our fuel cost recovery plan in January 2012. It’s also important to note that we have the authority to file a full rate case next year for new rates to be effective in January of 2013.
Turning now to our Michigan operations, you will recall that earlier this year we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for a rate increase of $17.5 million annually. We are seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls, and cost associated with Unit 2 of Oak Creek.
As provided for under our Michigan law, we plan to self implement $7.7 million of our request in January of 2012 and that would represent a 4.4% rate increase. If the Commission accepts our proposal that amount would be partially offset by the Michigan portion of the DOE settlement. So, the net result would be an interim rate increase for customers of 2.8%. We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on the entire request by July of 2012.
On another important topic, the Environmental Protection Agency issued on August 8 its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule commonly known as CSAPR. Earlier this month, the EPA announced a plan to revise CSAPR with a provisional hearing set for tomorrow actually October 28 in Washington. We believe that our additional cost to comply with CSAPR will be far less than many of our peers because of the investments we have made in Air Quality Control technology. Investments that are complete or nearing completion at our older coal-fired units and because of the new state-of-the-art generation we’ve built through our Power the Future plan. However, we do have some concerns about CSAPR as it relates to the upper peninsula of Michigan. Based on our analysis, we believe that the EPA has failed to allocate sufficient allowances to support minimum levels of generation at our Presque Isle Power Plant.
Operations at the Presque Isle facility are necessary to maintain system reliability in what has historically been a very constrained region. We have filed petitions with both the EPA and the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals supporting our position. Our preferred approach is simply to have 1 assurance area for our integrated combined system. EPA’s current approach is to have separate and distinct assurance areas for Wisconsin and for Michigan.
Finally, I’d like to address our share repurchase plan and our dividend policy. To maintain appropriate financial strength and provide value to our stockholders, we have implemented a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buyback up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.
Through today, we have repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at an average price of $30.32. Earlier this year, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy that calls for a pay-out ratio of 60% of earnings in the year 2015. Trending toward a 60% pay-out ratio will allow us to be more competitive with the dividend policies of other regulated utilities across the industry. And as a first step in implementing our new dividend policy, I am pleased to report that management will recommend to the Board a dividend increase in the range of 13% to 15% for the year 2012.
In summary, with 3 quarters of this year already in the books, the company continues to perform at a high level and our Power the Future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stockholders.
And now with more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here is our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?"
315117,129798434,208439,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale.

As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2011 third quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 a share. The results were better than our plan because of hotter than normal summer weather, a slightly better than expected growth in commercial sales and a continued emphasis on cost management. I will focus my comments on operating income from continuing operations by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss year-to-date cash flows and earnings guidance for the full year.
Our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2011 was $224 million as compared to $203 million in last year's third quarter, an increase of $21 million. We clearly benefited from the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. Operating income in our Utility Energy segment totaled $136 million, which is up $2 million from the prior year. When we look at our electric margins, we see a $2 million improvement.
When we breakdown the components of our electric margin, we see that weather had a negative impact of $9 million in 2011. While this summer was significantly hotter than normal, it was not as hot as the prior year. We estimate that weather helped our margins this quarter by approximately $21 million.
However, we estimate that last year’s hot summer helped our margins about $30 million. Offsetting this impact, was a stronger than expected growth in electric sales to our commercial sector and an increase in electric demand in our industrial segment. We estimate that these 2 items helped our margins by approximately $10 million as compared to the third quarter of 2010.
When you look at the rest of the detail of our utility operating income, you see several small items that net to a positive impact of approximately $1 million. Our operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which includes repower came in as expected and was consistent with prior quarters. We saw higher operating income of $21 million that was driven by the commercial operation of Unit 2 at Oak Creek. Unit 2 achieved commercial operation in January of this year, so we did not have any earnings associated with Unit 2 in the prior years.
Taking the changes for these 2 segments together, along with corporate charges and other miscellaneous items, you arrived with a $21 million increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled nearly $16 million. Other income increased by $6 million, because of higher allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC on our utility construction projects, primarily to air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills wind park. AFUDC of course allows us to earn a return on these approved utility projects during construction.
Our net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily because of interest expense associated with the second unit at Oak Creek. In January, we issued $420 million of long term debt to replace short term debt used to finance the construction of Unit II. In addition, once Unit II achieved commercial operations, we no longer capitalized interest on the construction work in progress.
While we saw increased interest expense at We Power level, our holding company interest expense declined as we retired $450 million of 6.5% long-term debt on April the 1st of this year. In addition, we were able take advantage of the low interest rate environment in September when our Wisconsin Electric subsidiary issued 10-year bonds with a coupon rate below 3%.
Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $6 million because of higher pre-tax earnings, offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. Combining all of these items brings you to $130 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 or earnings of $0.55 per share.
During the first 9 months of 2011, we generated $828 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $174 million from the same period in 2010. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operation increased by $5 million. The adjustments relate to how GAAP treats changes in restricted cash as an investing activity while we look at this as an operating item. Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and higher non-cash charges related to depreciation and deferred income tax benefits as a result of bonus depreciation.
Our 2011 operating cash flows were reduced by $257 million because of contributions to our qualified benefit plans. We made a $122 million contribution to our benefit plans in January and another $135 million contribution in September. No such contributions were made in 2010.
Our total capital expenditures were approximately $612 million in the first nine months of 2011 and we are forecasting annual capital expenditures this year of approximately of $900 million, which is below our plan of $950 million. The reduction is primarily related to the timing of expenditures on the biomass project given a later start date than originally planned.
The majority of our capital expenditures are in the utility business, and the largest projects are the air quality control system on the original Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills wind park. We also paid a $182 million in common dividends for the first 9 months of 2011, which was a 30% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis our debt-to-cap at the end of the third quarter was 56.5% and we were at 53.7% on an adjusted basis.
These ratios are slight improvement over our December 31, 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We may see a slight uptick in these ratios by the end of the year as we fulfill our capital budget commitment and repurchase shares.
Consistent with our past practice we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for a 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any shares, any additional shares. As we discussed in the past our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock through 2013.
As Gale noted through today we have repurchased approximately $2.5 million common shares at an average price of $30.32 a share. Year-to-date, our weather normalized retail sales have grown by 1.2% compared to 2010. Excluding sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, year-to-date normalized sales increased by 0.6% compared to 2010. These results excluding the iron ore mines are about 0.5% better than our original forecast due to modest economic recovery and delaying some customer owned generation projects.
I will now discuss our earnings guidance. We are raising our guidance for 2011 from a range of a $2.10 to $2.14 a share to a revised range of $2.13 to $2.16 a share from continuing operations. We’re comfortable raising the range because of our strong results for the first9 months of the year, which were driven by cold winter weather, hot summer weather, improved electric sales and effective cost controls.
With that, I will turn the things back over to Gale."

Let me first back up and talk about the policy that our board has adopted. As you will recall, our payout ratio because we had such a very solid use for our cash generation in investing in the Power the Future units, our payout ratio among utilities that do pay a dividend, is and remains one of the lowest payout ratios in the industry. Clearly now, as Power the Future is behind us, we want to become more competitive with our peers in terms of the dividend payout ratio. So, as we looked at our earnings profile and our cash generation over the next 5 years in our analysis, we believe we could afford, while maintaining very solid credit ratings. We could afford to move to a roughly 60% payout ratio and trend toward that 60% payout ratio by the year 2015. In our analysis, we said that that would support roughly an 8% to 9% annual dividend increase every year between now and 2015. Clearly, our cash generation is better this year than we projected, as you saw in Rick’s numbers on our debt-to-total cap, we continue to improve, and it was pretty clear to us that we could afford to move a little quicker in implementing that policy. So the policy remains same right now, of moving toward a 60% and trending toward a 60% payout ratio in 2015, is just we can move quicker with the strength of the underlying cash flows and the strength of the underlying earnings. And so, we will recommend to the board a 13% to 15% dividend increase for 2012, and then beyond that, we still believe we can support a roughly 8% annual dividend increase through 2015. I hope that responds to your question, Greg."

So c",314,"Very good question, Jim and we look at it really very simply and that is what is the best after-tax return for our shareholders. What is the best use of our cash? And the answer to that is what provides the best after tax return for our shareholders. So clearly the number one priority would be to invest in solid utility projects where there is a need and clearly we cannot, should not, and will not propose a utility project that’s not needed for reliability or for customer growth or for safety and regulation and continued safe operation of the system. But as you can see we have about $3.4 billion of those kinds of utility projects on the horizon between 2011 and 2015. So number one use of the cash is to continue to be the most reliable utility in the country. Second then after that is asking the same question, what is the best after tax return for our shareholders, within the parameters of maintaining our credit ratings. And we simply drive our decisions off of that question. Right now, if the share price that we’ve been able to buy back share so far, Rick mentioned $30.32 a share on average. That still provides a better after tax return then paying a premium to lower our debt levels. So, we continue to look for appropriate utility projects. As you know, we have a list of other projects that we have on the horizon that we're looking at. Some of them would be outside the utility for example, if the state decided to try to put up for sale some of the state owned power plants, we would view that as a potential solid utility investment perhaps outside the rate base. But in general terms to Jim kind of how we look at the business and how we try to deploy the cash."

The first thing that will happen is, within our O&M, there is a $148 million of amortization that will stop. So, everything else being equal, our O&M should be $148 million better. In addition, right now, we are accruing AFUDC on the projects, and once those projects go into service, the AFUDC will stop. So, those are 2 items that will stop -- that will be reduced as compared to our forecast for 2011. Then what we will have when the plans go into service, we will have additional depreciation on those units. And so our depreciation costs will go up. So, our O&M should go down. Our depreciation will go up. Our AFUDC which is in other income will go down. Net, net, net, if everything else is equal our net income should be up and in effect that reflects the recovery of the plants that will go into service. And a key point here is that revenues everything else being equal will not change. So, our customers will not pay any additional amounts so revenues are flat. Does that make sense?"

First of all, I would caution you a little bit about looking quarter-to-quarter sequentially because some of our larger customers like for example, the iron ore mines. They might have planned outages for their own maintenance at different times in the year and I know for example, Rick and I were talking about this the other day. Our September, individual month of September industrial sales were impacted by the fact that the mines took a planned outage earlier this year than they did last year. So, I think it's more instructive to look at a bit longer period of time, like a half or 3 quarters. When you look at that, industrial sales -- we were I think appropriately cautious about our projections for growth in industrial sales, but we’re not seeing any substantial weakening and the sectors that I mentioned in the prepared script, iron ore mining, specialty steel and metal fabrication, production of industrial machinery, paper and printing, they are continuing to show some growth. Jay, I’ve been very encouraged. We’ve had a number of expansions in relocation announcements in the Milwaukee region in the last few weeks and I know from personal involvement there are more to come. So, we see some traction in terms of the industrial sector of the economy here. Again, nothing robust but steady and I think cautiously optimistic for continued modest growth."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We",1847,"Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2011 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We Generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer and Steve Dickson, of the Controls. Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment.
But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.69 a share for the first 9 months of this year. That compares with earnings of $1.39 a share from continuing operations for the first 9 months of 2010. For this year’s third quarter, our earnings from continuing operations came in at $0.55 a share, up from $0.47 a share in the third quarter a year ago.
Now compared to our forecast, 2 factors influenced our positive results in the latest quarter. The first was weather. The Midwest recorded warm temperatures and high humidity this summer which led to strong demand for air conditioning. It literally was hot town in the summer, summer in the city, during much of July and August. In fact, the peak demand on our system rose to within 2.5% of our all-time record one hour demand. We also saw slightly stronger growth across the commercial sector of the region.
When we compare our numbers to the prior year third quarter, we realized higher earnings from our Power the Future assets driven by our investment in the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. We also benefited from booking higher allowance per funds used during construction at Wisconsin Electric as we continued to invest in utility projects that have been approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and our year-to-date performance.
Now I’d like to focus for a few minutes on the economy across our service area. After a nearly double-digit increase and rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by a little less than 1% in the first 3 quarters of 2011. When we take a closer look inside the numbers, we see that the demand destruction from 5 large plant closings during the great recession is now being largely offset by modest growth in recovery and other sectors of the region’s economy. For example, we are seeing strength in iron ore mining, in specialty steel, and metal fabrication, paper and printing and in the production of industrial machinery. And from talking with our largest customers, we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue.
Next, I’d like to update you on the 3 significant construction projects we have underway, a 50-megawatt biomass plant at Northern Wisconsin, the Glacier Wind Park, Northeast of Madison, and the Air Quality Control upgrade of the original Oak Creek units. You may recall last quarter we announced that construction was underway on a 50-megawatt cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill owned by Domtar Corporation in Northern Wisconsin. Good progress has been made on critical underground work and on the foundation for the boiler.
On August 25, 1,700 cubic yards of concrete was continuously delivered on port for the foundation. Of course, the biomass plant will help us diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We will be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will be used to produce steam will clearly benefit the existing paper mill. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We are on schedule and on budget to meet a completion date by the end of 2013.
The other large renewable project in our pipeline, of course, is the Glacier Hills Wind Park, a 162 megawatt energy center located on more than 15,000 acres of rolling farmland about 45 miles northeast of Madison. Ironically, higher than normal winds in late spring and early summer slowed our construction, but we are on track now and making excellent progress. As of yesterday, 88 of the 90 wind turbines planned for the site had been erected and approximately half of the turbines are already producing power for the grid. We are scheduled to complete the project on time and on budget by the end of this year.
Our current estimate of the capital cost for the Glacier Hills site is $361 million. This estimate does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs.
The biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park are key components that will position us to meet Wisconsin’s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, standard calls for an increase and the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources, from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.
When we complete the 2 large projects we have underway, we will be on target to meet the 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewable credits, and as a result, we project the need for additional credits by the year 2017.
Finally, we are making excellent progress on the air quality control upgrade in the original coal-fired units at the Oak Creek side. These units are among the most efficient baseload units in the Midwest. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities. As of today, the project is about 90% complete. Our project team is now finalizing an extensive testing protocol, which is a key step of course in the final stages of construction. And once again we are on time and on budget. We expect the new controls at Oak Creek to be completed during 2012.
Now I would like to switch gears and briefly review where we stand on the regulatory fronts in both Wisconsin and Michigan. As you know on October 6, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved our creative approach to keep base rates flat for customers, as the economy continues to recover. We were pleased that the commission found value for customers in our proposed plan. And in this fragile economy, our customers now have certainty on the cost of electricity for the year ahead, with base rates to remain at 2011 levels through 2012.
The rate plan also authorizes us to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012. Then the plan authorizes us to recover $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation for the air quality controls at Oak Creek and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. In addition, we have filed a fuel cost plan for the year 2012.
And finally, as part of that fuel cost plan, we will provide customers with a one-time credit of $26 million. The credit stems from Wisconsin Electric settlement of spent nuclear fuel litigation with the U.S. Department of Energy. We expect an order on our fuel cost recovery plan in January 2012. It’s also important to note that we have the authority to file a full rate case next year for new rates to be effective in January of 2013.
Turning now to our Michigan operations. You will recall that earlier this year we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for a rate increase of $17.5 million annually. We are seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls, and cost associated with Unit 2 of Oak Creek.
As provided for under our Michigan law, we plan to self implement $7.7 million of our request in January of 2012 and that would represent a 4.4% rate increase. If the Commission accepts our proposal that amount would be partially offset by the Michigan portion of the DOE settlement. So the net result would be an interim rate increase for customers of 2.8%. We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on the entire request by July of 2012.
On another important topic, the Environmental Protection Agency issued on August 8 its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule commonly known as CSAPR. Earlier this month, the EPA announced a plan to revise CSAPR with a provisional hearing set for tomorrow actually October 28 in Washington. We believe that our additional cost to comply with CSAPR will be far less than many of our peers because of the investments we have made in Air Quality Control technology. Investments that are complete or nearing completion at our older coal-fired units and because of the new state-of-the-art generation we’ve built through our Power the Future plan. However, we do have some concerns about CSAPR as it relates to the upper peninsula of Michigan. Based on our analysis, we believe that the EPA has failed to allocate sufficient allowances to support minimum levels of generation at our Presque Isle Power Plant.
Operations at the Presque Isle facility are necessary to maintain system reliability in what has historically been a very constrained region. We have filed petitions with both the EPA and the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals supporting our position. Our preferred approach is simply to have one assurance area for our integrated combined system. EPA’s current approach is to have separate and distinct assurance areas for Wisconsin and for Michigan.
Finally, I’d like to address our share repurchase plan and our dividend policy. To maintain appropriate financial strength and provide value to our stockholders, we have implemented a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.
Through today, we have repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at an average price of $30.32. Earlier this year, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy that calls for a pay-out ratio of 60% of earnings in the year 2015. Trending toward a 60% pay-out ratio will allow us to be more competitive with the dividend policies of other regulated utilities across the industry. And as a first step in implementing our new dividend policy, I am pleased to report that management will recommend to the Board a dividend increase in the range of 13% to 15% for the year 2012.
In summary, with 3 quarters of this year already in the books, the company continues to perform at a high level and our Power the Future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stockholders.
And now with more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here is our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?"

As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2011 third quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 a share. The results were better than our plan because of hotter than normal summer weather, a slightly better than expected growth in commercial sales and a continued emphasis on cost management. I will focus my comments on operating income from continuing operations by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss year-to-date cash flows and earnings guidance for the full year.
Our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2011 was $224 million as compared to $203 million in last year's third quarter, an increase of $21 million. We clearly benefited from the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. Operating income in our Utility Energy segment totaled $136 million, which is up $2 million from the prior year. When we look at our electric margins, we see a $2 million improvement.
When we breakdown the components of our electric margin, we see that weather had a negative impact of $9 million in 2011. While this summer was significantly hotter than normal, it was not as hot as the prior year. We estimate that weather helped our margins this quarter by approximately $21 million.
However, we estimate that last year’s hot summer helped our margins about $30 million. Offsetting this impact, was a stronger than expected growth in electric sales to our commercial sector and an increase in electric demand in our industrial segment. We estimate that these 2 items helped our margins by approximately $10 million as compared to the third quarter of 2010.
When you look at the rest of the detail of our utility operating income, you see several small items that net to a positive impact of approximately $1 million. Our operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which includes repower came in as expected and was consistent with prior quarters. We saw higher operating income of $21 million that was driven by the commercial operation of Unit 2 at Oak Creek. Unit 2 achieved commercial operation in January of this year, so we did not have any earnings associated with Unit 2 in the prior years.
Taking the changes for these 2 segments together, along with corporate charges and other miscellaneous items, you arrived with a $21 million increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled nearly $16 million. Other income increased by $6 million, because of higher allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC on our utility construction projects, primarily to air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills wind park. AFUDC of course allows us to earn a return on these approved utility projects during construction.
Our net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily because of interest expense associated with the second unit at Oak Creek. In January, we issued $420 million of long term debt to replace short term debt used to finance the construction of Unit II. In addition, once Unit II achieved commercial operations, we no longer capitalized interest on the construction work in progress.
While we saw increased interest expense at We Power level, our holding company interest expense declined as we retired $450 million of 6.5% long-term debt on April the 1st of this year. In addition, we were able take advantage of the low interest rate environment in September when our Wisconsin Electric subsidiary issued 10-year bonds with a coupon rate below 3%.
Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $6 million because of higher pre-tax earnings, offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. Combining all of these items brings you to $130 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 or earnings of $0.55 per share.
During the first 9 months of 2011, we generated $828 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $174 million from the same period in 2010. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operation increased by $5 million. The adjustments relate to how GAAP treats changes in restricted cash as an investing activity while we look at this as an operating item. Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and higher non-cash charges related to depreciation and deferred income tax benefits as a result of bonus depreciation.
Our 2011 operating cash flows were reduced by $257 million because of contributions to our qualified benefit plans. We made a $122 million contribution to our benefit plans in January and another $135 million contribution in September. No such contributions were made in 2010.
Our total capital expenditures were approximately $612 million in the first 9 months of 2011 and we are forecasting annual capital expenditures this year of approximately of $900 million, which is below our plan of $950 million. The reduction is primarily related to the timing of expenditures on the biomass project given a later start date than originally planned.
The majority of our capital expenditures are in the utility business, and the largest projects are the air quality control system on the original Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills wind park. We also paid a $182 million in common dividends for the first 9 months of 2011, which was a 30% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis our debt-to-cap at the end of the third quarter was 56.5% and we were at 53.7% on an adjusted basis.
These ratios are slight improvement over our December 31, 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We may see a slight uptick in these ratios by the end of the year as we fulfill our capital budget commitment and repurchase shares.
Consistent with our past practice we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for a 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any shares, any additional shares. As we discussed in the past our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock through 2013.
As Gale noted through today we have repurchased approximately $2.5 million common shares at an average price of $30.32 a share. Year-to-date, our weather normalized retail sales have grown by 1.2% compared to 2010. Excluding sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, year-to-date normalized sales increased by 0.6% compared to 2010. These results excluding the iron ore mines are about 0.5% better than our original forecast due to modest economic recovery and delaying some customer owned generation projects.
I will now discuss our earnings guidance. We are raising our guidance for 2011 from a range of a $2.10 to $2.14 a share to a revised range of $2.13 to $2.16 a share from continuing operations. We’re comfortable raising the range because of our strong results for the first9 months of the year, which were driven by cold winter weather, hot summer weather, improved electric sales and effective cost controls.
With that, I will turn the things back over to Gale."

Let me first back up and talk about the policy that our board has adopted. As you will recall, our payout ratio because we had such a very solid use for our cash generation in investing in the Power the Future units, our payout ratio among utilities that do pay a dividend, is and remains one of the lowest payout ratios in the industry. Clearly now, as Power the Future is behind us, we want to become more competitive with our peers in terms of the dividend payout ratio. So as we looked at our earnings profile and our cash generation over the next 5 years in our analysis, we believe we could afford, while maintaining very solid credit ratings. We could afford to move to a roughly 60% payout ratio and trend toward that 60% payout ratio by the year 2015. In our analysis, we said that that would support roughly an 8% to 9% annual dividend increase every year between now and 2015. Clearly, our cash generation is better this year than we projected, as you saw in Rick’s numbers on our debt-to-total cap, we continue to improve, and it was pretty clear to us that we could afford to move a little quicker in implementing that policy. So the policy remains same right now, of moving toward a 60% and trending toward a 60% payout ratio in 2015, is just we can move quicker with the strength of the underlying cash flows and the strength of the underlying earnings. And so, we will recommend to the board a 13% to 15% dividend increase for 2012, and then beyond that, we still believe we can support a roughly 8% annual dividend increase through 2015. I hope that responds to your question, Greg."

What is the best use of our cash? And the answer to that is what provides the best after tax return for our shareholders. So",314,"Very good question, Jim, and we look at it really very simply and that is what is the best after-tax return for our shareholders. What is the best use of our cash? And the answer to that is what provides the best after tax return for our shareholders. So clearly the number one priority would be to invest in solid utility projects where there is a need and clearly we cannot, should not, and will not propose a utility project that’s not needed for reliability or for customer growth or for safety and regulation and continued safe operation of the system. But as you can see we have about $3.4 billion of those kinds of utility projects on the horizon between 2011 and 2015. So number one use of the cash is to continue to be the most reliable utility in the country. Second then after that is asking the same question, what is the best after tax return for our shareholders, within the parameters of maintaining our credit ratings. And we simply drive our decisions off of that question. Right now, if the share price that we’ve been able to buy back share so far, Rick mentioned $30.32 a share on average. That still provides a better after tax return then paying a premium to lower our debt levels. So we continue to look for appropriate utility projects. As you know, we have a list of other projects that we have on the horizon that we're looking at. Some of them would be outside the utility for example, if the state decided to try to put up for sale some of the state owned power plants, we would view that as a potential solid utility investment perhaps outside the rate base. But in general terms to Jim kind of how we look at the business and how we try to deploy the cash."

The first thing that will happen is, within our O&M, there is a $148 million of amortization that will stop. So everything else being equal, our O&M should be $148 million better. In addition, right now, we are accruing AFUDC on the projects, and once those projects go into service, the AFUDC will stop. So those are 2 items that will stop -- that will be reduced as compared to our forecast for 2011. Then what we will have when the plans go into service, we will have additional depreciation on those units. And so our depreciation costs will go up. So our O&M should go down. Our depreciation will go up. Our AFUDC which is in other income will go down. Net, net, net, if everything else is equal our net income should be up and in effect that reflects the recovery of the plants that will go into service. And a key point here is that revenues everything else being equal will not change. So our customers will not pay any additional amounts so revenues are flat. Does that make sense?"

Obviously we are open and continue to look at what might make sense in terms of mergers, acquisitions, consolidation.

So those are the criteria that we apply and frankly, if -- I think those criteria are very important, because if you don’t adhere to those criteria, my own view is you are not creating shareholder value. So Rick and Al and I are very wed to those criteria. And then beyond that there has to be a willing seller and a willing buyer.

First of all, I would caution you a little bit about looking quarter-to-quarter sequentially because some of our larger customers like for example, the iron ore mines. They might have planned outages for their own maintenance at different times in the year and I know for example, Rick and I were talking about this the other day. Our September, individual month of September industrial sales were impacted by the fact that the mines took a planned outage earlier this year than they did last year. So I think it's more instructive to look at a bit longer period of time, like a half or 3 quarters. When you look at that, industrial sales -- we were I think appropriately cautious about our projections for growth in industrial sales, but we’re not seeing any substantial weakening and the sectors that I mentioned in the prepared script, iron ore mining, specialty steel and metal fabrication, production of industrial machinery, paper and printing, they are continuing to show some growth. Jay, I’ve been very encouraged. We’ve had a number of expansions in relocation announcements in the Milwaukee region in the last few weeks and I know from personal involvement there are more to come. So we see some traction in terms of the industrial sector of the economy here. Again, nothing robust but steady and I think cautiously optimistic for continued modest growth."
