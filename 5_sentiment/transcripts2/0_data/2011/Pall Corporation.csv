Before we begin, like to extend my concern and our condolences to the citizens of Japan after the horrific earthquake and tsunami. And we wish the best and we'll be helping however we can. I'm pleased to be here tod",1908,"Yes, thank you very much. Good morning. Before we begin, like to extend my concern and our condolences to the citizens of Japan after the horrific earthquake and tsunami. And we wish the best and we'll be helping however we can. I'm pleased to be here today to review Pall's second quarter results. Thank you for joining us.
Joining me are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. Also joining us today is today Ken Frank, who leads the BioPharmaceuticals Food and Beverage and Laboratory Groups under the Life Sciences umbrella. Ken is the lead architect of Pall's both expanding presence in the BioPharmaceutical markets. He'll share with us his perspective on how Pall steadily becoming a supplier of choice for broadening range of total fluid management requirements. 
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter and update you on our outlook for the balance of the year. And following that we, of course, look forward to your questions.
Pall's execution of the strategic growth initiatives continues to yield positive results. The strong top line, coupled with Pall's deeply ingrained productivity improvement culture, resulted gross margins up to 51%. Operating margins continued their upward trend, reaching almost 18% in the quarter. And with the global economy now improving, we see significant opportunities for sustainable revenue and profit growth to further drive value creation for our shareholders.
And so we are pleased with our overall progress this year and confident in capitalizing on the opportunities ahead. 
First half results demonstrate Pall's marketing geographic strength in the power of our productivity initiatives. We were strong out of the gate in the first quarter, and the second quarter results are even better. 
Second quarter sales of $645 million is about a 15% local currency increase over last year and follows on Q1's 12% performance. Exchange rates were slightly negative on the top line in the quarter. Revenues increased by double digits in Life Sciences and Industrial. Growth was broad based by market and geography. 
The BioPharmaceuticals and Microelectronics market in particular have performed our expectation in the quarter. So did Industrial in the Western Hemisphere, where every market to a strong collectively, growing by more than 40%.
Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew 14%, following up on a 10% increase in Q1. Operating margins also improved. 
In the first quarter, Pall Industrial grew 14% on the incoming tide of economic recovery. Second quarter sales increased almost 18%. Industrial's gross margins jumped 280 basis points, reaching 47.5%. Operating profit more than doubled from a year ago.
Now on geographic basis, both Pall Industrial and Life Sciences grew in all regions. The Western Hemisphere was strongest increasing 27%, and that was led by the 42.5% growth in Industrial. 
We're gratified to see Europe return to double-digit growth after it string of economic woes. It grew almost 11% on broad market strength. Sales in Asia were also up double digits about 10%. 
Overall orders kept pace with sales, increasing 15%. Every major market but municipal water was solidly positive. Orders for consumables are the leading indicator for Pall's business, and they grew almost 13%. You could look at them as an analogy to the retail market where same-store sales in our and put an indicator. For us it's consumables.
The backlog of consumables and systems is up 23%.  Now bear in mind, this includes orders for both consumables and systems that won't ship this year. 
The emerging regions that we have been focus of this year that, that's Latin America, Eastern Europe, MENA, China and in the Southeast Asian areas, now represent about 20% of total Pall sales. With the current Middle East situation, it is important to note that Pall's sales for the countries in turmoil are not significant. We do see considerable long-term opportunity in the region, particularly in the energy and water markets. By their very nature, these markets transcend politics, and so we remain optimistic about Pall's prospects. 
With that, let's look at the sales details, starting with Industrial.
Sales overall as I said increased about 18%. Aeropower grew close to 12% in Q2. Energy and Water were up 21%, with growth in all markets. And MicroE grew over 21%. it's fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. machinery in equipment posted double-digit growth for the fourth quarter in a row, up 15%. Sales increased 24% in the Western Hemisphere, 18% in Europe and almost 6% and Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets remain in high gear in other parts of the market were also strong. Q2 orders were up almost 22%.
Aerospace sales grew 8%. Orders increased over 22%,  with stronger demand from both submarkets. Now looking at those markets, Military Aerospace was flat overall, while the Western Hemisphere, the largest part of the military market for us, grew 20%. 
Shipments variety of military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter and spares for the U.S. government. Commercial Aerospace grew 17% in the quarter, with strength in all regions. Growth was aided by some inventory restocking for airlines support and a modest increase in aircraft build rates, including the private jet market which is finally reviving.
Energy and water sales increased 21% on solid performance from all markets. Orders grew in line with shipment. 
Fuels and Chemicals returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 6% despite lagging large capital system sales. Growth is driven by the Western Hemisphere at 32% and Europe at 26%. And it's reflecting production of oil, gas and polymers, all markets have an improving economy. Asia was down 20%, largely reflected core capital orders from last year. Globally, consumable sales increased 15%. This is the third quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit declines.
Power generation sales increased over 16% on strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key growth drivers were essentially the same as in Q1, that is water treatment systems for you aspire generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. 
Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery area and from reduced demand for power tied to industrial production. 
Municipal sales increased over 80% of the quarter, this remains the U.S.-centric business for now, although the opportunity is decidedly global.
Sales in the Western Hemisphere more than tripled, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with regulations. Europe has been weak but orders for the last three quarters increased by double-digit. 
Public financing issues endemic to the region has been putting the shackles a new orders for municipal projects of the increase in order volume is encouraging. Overall, backlog in municipal water stands at over $400 million.
Now as we said each time oil prices shoot up. High oil prices are both a challenging an opportunity. The challenges offset their impact on operating costs, which we endeavor to do. The opportunity comes from customers motivated to reduce energy consumption by extending the process fluids, and it comes from refiners looking to maximize production and also from alternative energy developers and producers with filtration-reliant technology to become more economically attractive. 
Now let's move on to Microelectronics. They reported their fifth straight quarter, as I said, of double-digit growth, increasing over 21%. All region and key customer markets grew. Growth continues to reflect our capacity utilization rates producers as well as the month or product like smartphones, tablet computers another advanced electronics with LED technology as key contributor. We do not expect these very high rates of growth to continue. They should normalize as production catches up with underlying demand and as the comps get tougher. We expect a relatively flat second half of the year, followed by a pickup in calendar 2012, as major investment programs of chip producers of all.
Orders, which have been up sharply five quarters this time increased just under 10%. 
With that, let's move on to the Life Sciences business.
Share sales increased 14%, with medical up 3%, Food and Beverage, 7.5% operating margin BioPharmaceuticals growing almost 24%. Medical grew modestly in all region. While blood filter sales, which represents a little bit more than half of our Medical business were flat. 
The next two largest submarkets OEM in Hospital Critical Care were up. Blood filter sales grew 50% of the Western Hemisphere despite an estimate of 4% drop in the blood collections. 
The OEM submarket grew almost 7%, driven by strong demand for IV filters in the Western Hemisphere. The hospital critical care market had a strong quarter with sales up almost 15%. This growth came largely from Europe were standards governing point-of-use water filtration are more embedded that they are in the United States. We also got sales filters were deployed in response to outbreaks of waterborne illness, primarily.
In Food and Beverage, sales were up 7.5% were consumable sales up 4% and all regions contributing. System sales increased 25%, with both results reflecting continued recovery in the market. 
As further proof, orders in F&B were up almost 18% in the quarter. 
Several game-changing new products are taking hold about this comment in one of them today. that's the members system for production. The growing industry is beginning to shift a member infiltration from filter RDE. DE is all technology with a number of problems, including worker health and process consistency. It's messy to work with, costly to dispose of and breweries our transition into post disruptive technology because it is more efficient, effective and environmental friendly. The large system as might be used any of the 1,200 large brewers in the world million dollars. And more significantly, it can generate $500,000 in annuity sales each year. Now there's another 4,000 midsized breweries that are also potential candidates for our smaller version of the technology.
Now since our first quarter call with you, President Obama modernization act into law According to the White House club, this historical legislation directs Food and Drug Administration to build a new system of whatever side purpose of buying the best available science to prevent the problems that make people sick. Regulation typically benefits Pall's business, and we have every reason to believe that ultimately will as well. It's already this is the rapid microdetection of food pathogens.
And finally, let's move on to BioPharmaceuticals and steal Ken Frank's thunder here. Quarter two was another very good one for BioPharma. Revenue increased 23%. Consumable sales increased 19% and system sales more than doubled. Pall regions restaurant with the Western Hemisphere and Asia leading the way at 36.5% and 30%, respectively. 
Europe which is our largest region posted 14.5% growth in the quarter. This was its best performance in some time. Pharmaceuticals grew by 25% and Lab another good quarter with almost 50% growth. Q2 sales were positively influenced by the timing of stocking orders by some customers in Asia and large chromatography sales and Western Hemisphere. 
Overall, orders in BioPharmaceuticals 11% driven by orders for consumables, which grew 13.5%. Orders for systems, which can be quite lumpy decreased. The backlog is still healthy. And at the half year mark, sales in BioPharmaceuticals are up 19%, with consumables growing 16.5% and systems up 17%. This growth is coming from all regions. 
And now Ken Frank will speak to us and tell us why is this business represents over a quarter of total sales and continues to perform so well. Ken?"

It's a pleasure for me to be here today to talk about BioPharmaceuticals, which is the key growth strong operation. 
The month including biotech jobs vaccines and plasma derivatives continues to grow and is the key focus my pharmaceuticals business. About 60% of BioPharmaceuticals sales Biologics market fastest-growing market. it is important to recognize that this quarter sales as result of the last 12 weeks worth are the last 12 months. As a direct outcome of the continuing execution of our key strategies, that we've been working one over the last several years, at our investor day back in December 2009.
Our strategy is based on three elements. Technology, applications and world-class local customer support. Over the last several years, we've broadened our technology portfolio brought by work on a guaranty an acquisition to increase our customers and to support our total food management strategy. We have significantly strengthened our ability to serve customers by improving our sales channels and technical support capability globally. We have progressively switched from distribution to a direct sales model in many key biotech regions as is the U.S. West Coast and the Northeast. And excluding Lab, which is primarily distribution model, 90% of this business is now direct.
This focus has happens helped us to drive sales growth over the last several quarters in the high-single digit to double-digit range, which medium-term target. The latest S&P report on the healthcare industry stated Biologics on the bright spot of the pharmaceuticals industry double the pharmaceuticals.
Biotech and is now mainstream all the big pharma companies looking at this jobs to offset lost revenue of many blockbuster drugs. Almost half of the 100 top-selling drugs by 2016 are expected to be biologics. 15 of the 34 innovative treatments approved by FDA in 2009 or Biologics. So with 10 of 18 approved the first half of 2010 there are more than 1000 Biologics and clinical development. So a takeaway from this as the investment in new biological manufacturing capacity is to continue. Biological manufacturing multiple step process with the requirements of filtration of each stage book to find product and to protect it from Mike of contamination. Most of you based on subculture with a group product itself produced by genetically modified organism within a bioreactor. Everything going into in coming out of the bioreactor has to be. So doused of recovery end. edition a product is heavily dependent on chromatography. And they've been to a typical biotech driven manufacturing process 10x more filtration intensive than the classical pharmaceuticals process.
How business is driven by both manufacturing volumes and the number of specific process utilizing Pall products. And over the last year's we significantly expanded our portfolio, which now includes filtration, chromatography, used acquisitions, as well as the longest membrane and flow filters we sell. Pall is now one of the very few companies wide range of technologies used in the development and manufacture of biologically-based therapeutics. This broad product offering coupled with applications knowledge and didn't capability is making results for our customers. Up our we expect revenue growth of 10% to 12% for fiscal 2011 and looking out to 2013, we believe that we're on track to meet the goals outlined at our Investor Day. Thank you. Now I'll turn."
185333,127615977,110107,"Pall Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 11, 2011",2011-03-11,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you can, and good morning, everyone. I pose financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $75.7 million or $0.64 per share. This compares to $49.6 million or $0.42 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined on",1918,"Thank you can, and good morning, everyone. I pose financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $75.7 million or $0.64 per share. This compares to $49.6 million or $0.42 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 26, were $0.68 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 62%. Net earnings in the six months were $147.1 million or $1.25 per share. And this compares to $116.6 million or $0.98 per share last year. And poor marks or $1.29 compared to $0.82 per share, an increase of 57%. Of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by 1 cent in the quarter and six-month. This is an anomaly given the detriment of the top line that Eric mentioned earlier. And this reflects the combined strength of the Asian profits and the impact of Asian currency translation for profitability there compared to effective weakening euro on the European profit.
Sales increased 15% in the quarter and 13% in the six months compared to the same period in fiscal 2010. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $3 million or about 1% in the quarter and by about $11 million or about 1% in the six months. Local currency sales were up almost expect 60% of the quarter. Consumable sales increased 13% and systems were up 47%. In the six-month, local currency sales grew 14%, reflecting a 13% increase in consumables and eight at 1.5% increase in system sales.
Overall, pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and over $7 million in the six months, an improving trend. Gross margins in the second quarter improved 80 basis points compared to last year to 51.5% as an improvement in Industrial was partly offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Gross margin in the six months increased 120 basis points to 51.3% and I'll provide some color on this by business in a moment.
SG&A was 30.5% of sales in the second quarter, down from 33.4% last year. In the six-month, SG&A expenses was 30.3% compared to 32.8% last year. These improvements reflect top line leverage and tight cost controls and easily overcame the added expenses of going direct in some territories as Ken mentioned before.
Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased by 6.5% in the quarter and 5.5% in the six months year-over-year. Approximately 1/3 of the increase in the quarter and 40% year-to-date relates to the investments we've spoken about before such as the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the publication of our global ERP system and investments in emerging regions. The remainder of the increase in the quarter and year reflects the inflationary increases in payroll, as well as increases in selling relate to variable cost. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, R&D spending rose about 30% in the quarter and 60% in the six months. We expect that it'll be just under 3.5% of sales for the year and this is a plan to ramp up an in investment for new products.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the six months was 27% as compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. Excluding the benefits from the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax orders last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year in the tax rate of about 4%. And this is in line with our forecast. The reduction has contributed about $9 million or $0.08 to the bottom line so far. 
The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters and puts us solidly on track to achieve our 2013 goal of 24% to 26%. 
And net interest expense in the first half of last year also primarily reflects the benefit related to the resolution of the foreign tax audits I just mentioned. And this resulted in the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $9 million. 
Excluding this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million, driven by slightly higher average interest rates an average debt levels throughout the quarter compared to the same period of last year. 
In December, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our new revolver, which were repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. So at January 31, we had $170 million of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Looking at our performance compared to the first quarter of this year, sales in the second quarter increased sequentially about 7%. Life Sciences grew 7%, driven by 11% sequential growth in BioPharmaceuticals. Industrial grew by about 6% sequentially, and this was driven by growth of approximately 25% in Energy and Water and was principally systems driven. 
Quarter-over-quarter, gross margins improved by 50 basis points, and this reflects improvements in both businesses. In Life Sciences, this principally reflects favorable mix; for Industrial, manufacturing cost savings job improvement sequentially, offset by negative mix. 
Now SG&A increased 7%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of 30.5% of sales in the second quarter compared to 30.1% in the first. And this reflects as well increases in payroll, which, primarily occur in the second quarter an annual grant of certain restricted, which also occur in the quarter.
Higher expenses of variable compensation and depreciation of the investment at our global ERP system, as more locations went live in our second quarter. 
Now I'll provide some color on segment performance. As mentioned previously, Pall Industrial sales growth was 17.7%,  reflecting a 14.5% increase in consumables on strength in all markets. System sales grew by about 40%, primarily driven by the Municipal Water. Systems represented about 15.5% of sales compared with about 13% last year. We expect the mid single-digit growth in the second half in Pall Industrial. This reflects our expectation that Microelectronics, after five consecutive quarters of very high growth, will be flattish in the second half of the year, year-over-year.
Pall Industrial gross margins in the quarter improved 280 basis points to 47.5%. This reflects a three key factors. One, cost savings for manufacturing efficiencies net of inflation. Two, better absorption of manufacturing overheads and lastly, favorable mix despite the increasing systems. 
During the quarter, we announced the proposal that will likely result of the closure of our one of our European manufacturing facilities. We accrued costs related to severance and restructuring and other charges this quarter. We expect to incur some costs in the second half that will be a headwind to Industrial's gross margin.
Now looking at SG&A, we were able to give our SG&A expenses in check which enabled us to leverage our growing top line. And operating margins was just under 15.5% compared to about 9% a year ago. So overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in Pall Industrial. 
I'll switch now to Life Life Sciences' performance.  Strong sales growth reflects about 11.5% increase in consumables. This was driven by both the pharmaceuticals and laboratory markets of BioPharmaceuticals. Systems grew about 70%, with Pharmaceutical system sales systems is more than doubled in Food and Beverage up 25%. Systems is represented about 7% of sales compared to about 4.5% of sales last year. 
As we look at second half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth. This reflects our expectation that BioPharmaceuticals will grow by high-single digits. Consumables in Pharma will continue to trend up by low-double digits. However, Laboratory after six consecutive quarters of double-digit increases, is expected to deliver mid single-digit growth. And this is still a good result for the lab market.
Now despite continuing manufacturing efficiencies and price improvements, Life Sciences gross margins dropped a bit. This was caused by the effect of a weakening euro on foreign goods in the eurozone and some unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overheads. Operating margin came in at 25%, and this is a real breakthrough level. This represents a 200 basis points improvement year-over-year leveraging top line growth would have been disciplined cost control.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the six months was $156 million. This is flat compared to the six months of fiscal year 2010 and is the one are where we have not met our expectations. And this is mainly attributable to an increase in inventory. We expect to improve our year-over-year operating cash flows in the second half, as we work down our inventory level, helping us to achieve full year operating cash flows in the range of $435 million to $460 million. 
Significant uses of cash during the six months included $67 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $30 million of stock buyback. $60 million in capital spending and $130,000,000.133 million repayment of debt net of new borrowings. We expect capital spending to increase slightly to between $170 million and $180 million for the full year.
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $435 million at January, and our net debt to net equity was 14%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
In light of all first half performance and with what we see ahead, we are increasing sales and earnings guidance for the year. We expect local currency sales to increase high single to low-double digit at similar rates of growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. This compares to our previous estimate of mid to high-single digit. This outlook is based on the strengthening it kind of me and the effects of Pall's growth strategies. The improvement in our outlook relates to three key markets that have outperformed expectations during the first half, and that we now expect it to grow double digits for the full year. These are Pharmaceuticals, Aeropower and Microelectronics. 
And in Aeropower, the improvement is coming from M&A which just posted many for the second quarter of solid double-digit sales growth and it's fixed of double-digit order growth. Our expectations of our operating margins for the year have risen to 17.5% to 18.5%, with outperformance and top line volume and in high-margin markets.
We continue to expect gross margin so finished the year at 50% to 51% range likely on the higher end. this reflects continued benefit from pricing, volume and manufacturing cost reductions in the second half. However, we expect to see margin headwinds, as system sales surge, cost are incurred for the facility closer I mentioned earlier and factory overheads absorption reduces from the adjustment of inventory levels I also referred to earlier.
Returning to SG&A, were improved revenue outlook combined with a level of cost discipline should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales now less than 30%. 
In closing, fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be another good year for Pall. The first half was solid by most measures, and the outlook for the second half remains strong. Including a $0.09 benefit from foreign currency translation, based upon current exchange rates, we now expect projected pro forma earnings per share will be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 for fiscal 2011. 
The full year outlook tracking to achieve our 2013 goal our strategic plan is working. We are confident in our plant in our ability to execute it to deliver further shareholder value. 
Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

Before we begin, I'd like to extend my concern and our condolences to the citizens of Japan after the horrific earthquake and tsunami. And we wish them the best, and we'll be helping however we can.
Now I'm pleased to be here today to review Pall's second quarter results. Thank you for joining us. Joining me are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. Also joining us today is Ken Frank, who leads the BioPharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage and Laboratory Groups under the Life Sciences umbrella. Ken is the lead architect of Pall's expanding presence in the BioPharmaceutical markets. He'll share with us his perspective on how Pall is steadily becoming the supplier of choice for a broadening range of total fluid management requirements. 
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter and update you on our outlook for the balance of the year. And following that we, of course, look forward to your questions.
Pall's execution of its strategic growth initiatives continues to yield positive results. The strong top line, coupled with Pall's deeply ingrained productivity improvement culture, drove consolidated gross margins up to 51 1/2%.
Operating margins continued their upward trend, reaching almost 18% in the quarter. And with the global economy now improving, we see significant opportunities for sustainable revenue and profit growth to further drive value creation for our shareholders. And so we are pleased with our overall progress this year and confident on capitalizing on the opportunities ahead. 
First quarter -- first half results demonstrate Pall's market and geographic strength and the power of our productivity initiatives. We were strong out of the gate in the first quarter, and the second quarter results are even better. 
Second quarter sales of $645 million is about a 15% local currency increase over last year and follows on Q1's 12% performance. Exchange rates were slightly negative on the top line in the quarter. Revenues increased by double digits in Life Sciences and Industrial. Growth was broad based by market and geography. 
The BioPharmaceuticals and Microelectronics market, in particular, outperformed our expectations in the quarter. So did Industrial in the Western Hemisphere, where every market was strong collectively, growing by more than 40%.
Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew 14%, following up on a 10% increase in Q1. Operating margins also improved. 
In the first quarter, Pall Industrial grew 14% on the incoming tide of economic recovery. Second quarter sales increased almost 18%. Industrial's gross margins jumped 280 basis points, reaching 47 1/2%. Operating profit more than doubled from a year ago.
Now on a geographic basis, both Pall Industrial and Life Sciences grew in all regions. The Western Hemisphere was strongest, increasing 27%, and that was led by the 42 1/2% growth in Industrial. 
We're gratified to see Europe return to double-digit growth after its string of economic woes. It grew almost 11% on broad market strength. Sales in Asia were also up double digits, about 10%. 
Overall orders kept pace with sales, increasing 15%. Every major market but Municipal Water was solidly positive. Orders for consumables are the leading indicator for Pall's business, and they grew almost 13%. You could look at them as an analogy to the retail market where same-store sales are an important indicator. For us, it's consumables. The backlog of consumables and systems is up 23%.  Now bear in mind, this includes orders for both consumables and systems that won't ship this year. 
The emerging regions that we have been focusing on, that's Latin America, Eastern Europe, MENA, China, India and the Southeast Asian areas, now represent about 20% of total Pall sales. With the current Middle East situation, it's important to note that Pall's sales for the countries in turmoil are not significant. We do see considerable long-term opportunity in the region, particularly in the energy and water markets. By their very nature, these markets transcend politics, and so we remain optimistic about Pall's prospects. 
With that, let's look at the sales details, starting with Industrial. Sales overall, as I said, increased about 18%. Aeropower grew close to 12% in Q2. Energy and Water were up 21%, with growth in all markets. And MicroE grew over 21%. That's its fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. 
Within Aeropower, Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the fourth quarter in a row, up 15%. Sales increased 24% in the Western Hemisphere, 18% in Europe and almost 6% and Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets remain in high gear, and other parts of the market were also strong. Q2 orders were up almost 22%. Aerospace sales grew 8%. Orders increased over 22%, with strong demand from both submarkets. 
Now looking at those markets, Military Aerospace was flat overall, while the Western Hemisphere, the largest part of the military market for us, grew 20%. Shipments were tied to a variety of military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter and spares for the U.S. government. 
Commercial Aerospace grew 17% in the quarter, with strength in all regions. Growth was aided by some inventory restocking for airline support and a modest increase in aircraft build rates, including the private jet market, which is finally reviving.
Energy and Water sales increased 21% on solid performance from all markets. Orders grew in line with shipments. Fuels and Chemicals returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 6% despite lagging large capital system sales. Growth is driven by the Western Hemisphere at 32% and Europe at 26%. And it's reflecting production of oil, gas, chemicals and polymers. All markets have an improving economy. Asia was down 20%, largely reflecting core capital orders from last year. Globally, consumable sales increased 15%. This is the third quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit decline.
Power Generation sales increased over 16% on strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key growth drivers were essentially the same as in Q1, that is water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery area and from reduced demand for power tied to industrial production. 
Municipal Water sales increased over 80% in the quarter. This remains a U.S.-centric business for now, although the opportunity is decidedly global. Sales in the Western Hemisphere more than tripled, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with regulations. Europe has been weak, but orders for the last three quarters increased by double digits. 
Public financing issues endemic to the region have been putting the shackles on new orders for municipal projects, so the increase in order volume is encouraging. Overall, backlog in Municipal Water stands at over $100 million.
Now as we said each time oil prices shoot up, high oil prices are both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to offset their impact on operating costs, which we endeavor to do. The opportunity comes from customers motivated to reduce energy consumption by extending the useful life of process fluids, and it comes from refiners looking to maximize production and also from alternative energy developers and producers with filtration-reliant technology to become more economically attractive. 
Now let's move on to Microelectronics. They reported their fifth straight quarter, as I said, of double-digit growth, increasing over 21%. All regions and key customer markets grew. Growth continues to reflect high capacity utilization rates at chip producers as well as demand for products like smartphones, tablet computers another advanced electronics, with LED technology as key contributor. 
We do not expect these very high rates of growth to continue. They should normalize as production catches up with underlying demand and as the comps get tougher. We expect a relatively flat second half of the year, followed by a pickup in calendar 2012, as major investment programs of chip producers unfold. Orders, which have been up sharply for five quarters, this time increased just under 10%. 
With that, let's move on to the Life Sciences business. Here, sales increased 14%, with Medical up 3%, Food and Beverage, 7 1/2% up and BioPharmaceutical growing almost 24%. Medical grew modestly in all regions, while blood filter sales, which represents a little bit more than half of our Medical business, were flat. 
The next two largest submarkets, OEM and Hospital Critical Care, were up. Blood filter sales grew about 2% in the Western Hemisphere despite an estimated 4% drop in blood collections. 
The OEM submarket grew almost 7%, driven by strong demand for IV filters in the Western Hemisphere. The Hospital Critical Care market had a strong quarter with sales up almost 15%. This growth came largely from Europe, where standards governing point-of-use water filtration are more embedded than they are in the United States. We also got a boost in sales as Pall-Aquasafe filters were deployed in response to outbreaks of waterborne illness, primarily Legionella.
In Food and Beverage, sales were up 7 1/2%, with consumable sales up 4% and all regions contributing. System sales increased 25%, with both results reflecting continued recovery in the market. As further proof, orders in F&B were up almost 18% in the quarter. 
Several game-changing new products are taking hold, and I'll just comment on one of them today. That's the PROFi membrane system for beer production. The brewing industry is beginning to shift to membrane filtration from filter aides like diatomaceous earth or DE. DE is old technology with a number of problems, including worker health and process consistency. It's messy to work with, costly to dispose of and it's a known carcinogen. So breweries are transitioning to Pall's disruptive technology because it is more efficient, effective and environmentally friendly. 
A large PROFi system as might be used at any of the 1,200 large breweries in the world can sell for several million dollars. And more significantly, it can generate $500,000 in annuity sales each year. Now there's another 4,000 midsized breweries that are also potential candidates for our smaller version of the PROFi technology.
Now since our first quarter call with you, President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act into law. According to the White House blog, this historic legislation directs the Food and Drug Administration to build a new system of food oversight focused on applying the best available science to prevent the problems that make people sick. Regulation typically benefits Pall's business, and we have every reason to believe this ultimately will as well. It's already creating interest in our new GeneDisc system for rapid microdetection of food pathogens.
And finally, let's move on to BioPharmaceuticals, and I'll try not to steal Ken Frank's thunder here. Quarter two was another very good one for BioPharma. Revenues increased some 23%. Consumable sales increased 19% and system sales more than doubled. All regions were strong, with the Western Hemisphere and Asia leading the way at 36 1/2% and 30%, respectively. Europe, which is our largest region, posted 14 1/2% growth in the quarter. This was its best performance in some time. 
Pharmaceuticals grew by 25% and Lab had another good quarter with almost 15% growth. Q2 sales were positively influenced by the timing of stocking orders by some customers in Asia and large chromatography sales in the Western Hemisphere. 
Overall, orders in BioPharmaceuticals increased about 11% driven by orders for consumables, which grew 13 1/2%. Orders for systems, which can be quite lumpy, decreased. The backlog is still healthy, and at the half year mark, sales in BioPharmaceuticals are up 19%, with consumables growing 16 1/2% and systems up 17%. This growth is coming from all regions. 
And now, Ken Frank will speak to us and tell us why this business that represents over a quarter of total sales continues to perform so well. Ken?"
185333,127615977,110263,"Pall Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 11, 2011",2011-03-11,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure for me to be here today to talk about Pall BioPharmaceuticals, which is a key growth driver for Pall Corporation. The market of biologics, including biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives,",623,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure for me to be here today to talk about Pall BioPharmaceuticals, which is a key growth driver for Pall Corporation. 
The market of biologics, including biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives, continues to grow and is a key focus of our BioPharmaceuticals business. About 60% of BioPharmaceuticals sales are from the biologics market, our fastest-growing market. It is important to recognize that these quarter sales figures are not just a result of the last 12 weeks work, not even the last 12 months. It is a direct outcome of the continuing execution of our key strategies that we've been working on for the last several years, I believe last outlined to you during Investor Day back in December 2009.
Our strategy is based on three elements: Technology, applications knowledge and world-class local customer support. Over the last several years, we've broadened our technology portfolio, both by organic R&D and acquisition, to increase our value to our customers and to support our Total Fluid Management or TFM strategy. We have significantly strengthened our ability to serve customers by improving our sales channels and technical support capabilities globally. We have progressively switched from distribution to a direct sales model in many key biotech regions such as the U.S. West Coast and the Northeast. And excluding Lab, which is primarily a distribution model, 90% of this business is now direct.
This focus has helped us to drive sales growth over the last several quarters in the high-single digit to double-digit range, which is our medium-term target. The latest S&P report on the healthcare industry states that biologics are one of the bright spot of the pharmaceutical industry, with growth rates of roughly double that of classical pharmaceuticals.
Biotech is now mainstream, with all of the big pharma companies looking to this class of drugs to offset lost revenues as patents expire on many blockbuster drugs. Almost half of the 100 top-selling drugs by 2016 are expected to be biologics. 15 of the 34 innovative treatments approved by FDA in 2009 were biologics. So with 10 of 18 approved in the first half of 2010, there are more than 1,000 biologics and clinical development. And the takeaway from this are the investments in new biological manufacturing capacity is set to continue. 
Biological manufacturing is a multiple-step process with requirements of filtration at each stage, both to purify the product and to protect it from microbiological contamination. Most processes are based on cell culture with the drug product itself produced by a genetically-modified organism within a bioreactor. Everything going into and coming out of the bioreactor has to be sterile. Solid and liquid and [ph] downstream recovery and purification of a product is heavily dependent on membrane separation chromatography. And this means a typical biotech drug manufacturing process can be 10x more filtration intensive than a classical pharmaceutical process.
Our business is driven both by manufacturing volumes and the number of steps in each specific process utilizing Pall products. And over the last few years, we've significantly expanded our portfolio, which now includes depth filtration, chromatography, single-use technologies as well as the long established membrane and tangential flow filters we sell. Pall is now one of the very few companies ever to offer the wide range of technologies used in the development and manufacture of biologically-based therapeutics. This broad product offering, coupled with our applications knowledge and engineering capability, is making the great resource for our customers. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 12% for fiscal 2011, and looking out to 2013, we believe that we're on track to meet the goals outlined at our last Investor Day. Thank you. Now I'll turn the mic over to Lisa."
185333,127615977,110263,"Pall Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 11, 2011",2011-03-11,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by recapping Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $75.7 million or $0.64 per share. This compares to $49.6 million or $0.42 per share last year. Pro forma earning",1937,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by recapping Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $75.7 million or $0.64 per share. This compares to $49.6 million or $0.42 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 26 were $0.68 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 62%. 
Net earnings in the six months were $147.1 million or $1.25 per share, and this compares to $116.6 million or $0.98 per share last year. And pro forma earnings per share were $1.29 compared to $0.82 per share, an increase of 57%. Now foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter and six months. This is an anomaly given the detriment to the top line that Eric mentioned earlier. And this reflects the combined strength of Asian profits and the impact of Asian currency translation to profitability there compared with the effect of the weakening euro on European profit.
Sales increased 15% in the quarter and 13% in the six months compared to the same period in fiscal 2010. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $3 million or about 1% in the quarter and by about $11 million or about 1% in the six months. Local currency sales were up almost 16% in the quarter. Consumable sales increased 13% and systems were up 47%. In the six months, local currency sales grew 14%, reflecting a 13% increase in consumables and a 21 1/2% increase in system sales.
Overall, pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and over $7 million in the six months, an improving trend. Gross margins in the second quarter improved 80 basis points compared to last year to 51 1/2% as an improvement in Industrial was partly offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Gross margin in the six months increased 120 basis points to 51.3%. And I'll provide some color on this by business in a moment.
SG&A was 30 1/2% of sales in the second quarter, down from 33.4% last year. In the six months, SG&A expenses were 30.3% compared to 32.8% last year. These improvements reflect top line leverage and tight cost controls and easily overcame the added expenses of going direct in some territories, as Ken mentioned before.
Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased about 6 1/2% in the quarter and 5 1/2% in the six months year-over-year. Approximately 1/3 of the increase in the quarter and 40% year-to-date relates to the investments we've spoken about before such as the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our global ERP system and investments in emerging regions. The remainder of the increase in the quarter and year reflects inflationary increases in payroll, as well as increases in selling-related variable costs. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, R&D spending rose about 13% in the quarter and 16% in the six months. We expect it will be just under 3 1/2% of sales for the year, and this is a plan to ramp up in investment for new products.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the six months was 27% as compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax audits last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year in the tax rate of about 4%. And this is in line with our forecast. The reduction has contributed about $9 million or $0.08 to the bottom line so far. 
The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters and puts us solidly on track to achieve our 2013 goal of 24% to 26%. 
And net interest expense in the first half of last year also primarily reflects the benefit related to the resolution of the foreign tax audits I just mentioned. And this resulted in the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $9 million.  Including this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million, driven by slightly higher average interest rates and average debt levels throughout the quarter compared to the same period of last year. 
In December, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our new revolver, which were repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. So at January 31, we had $170 million of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Looking at our performance compared to the first quarter of this year, sales in the second quarter increased sequentially about 7%. Life Sciences grew 7%, driven by 11% sequential growth in BioPharmaceuticals. Industrial grew by about 6% sequentially, and this was driven by a growth of approximately 25% in Energy and Water and was principally systems driven. 
Quarter-over-quarter, gross margins improved by 50 basis points, and this reflects improvements in both businesses. In Life Sciences, this principally reflects favorable mix whereas Industrial, manufacturing cost savings drove improvement sequentially, offset by negative mix. 
Now SG&A increased 7%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, to 30.5% of sales in the second quarter compared to 30.1% in the first. And this reflects annual increases in payroll, which primarily occur in the second quarter, and annual grants of certain restricted stock units, which also occur in the quarter, higher expenses of variable-based compensation and depreciation on the investment on our global ERP system, as more locations went live in our second quarter. 
Now I'll provide some color on segment performance. As mentioned previously, Pall Industrial sales growth was 17.7%,  reflecting a 14 1/2% increase in consumables on strength in all markets. System sales grew by about 40%, primarily driven by Municipal Water. Systems represented about 15 1/2% of sales compared with about 13% last year. We expect mid single-digit growth in the second half in Pall Industrial. This reflects our expectation that Microelectronics, after five consecutive quarters of very high growth, will be flattish in the second half of the year, year-over-year.
Pall Industrial's gross margins in the quarter improved 280 basis points to 47 1/2%. This reflects three key factors: One, cost savings for manufacturing efficiencies net of inflation; two, better absorption of manufacturing overheads; and lastly, favorable mix despite the increasing systems. 
During the quarter, we announced the proposal that will likely result in the closure of one of our European manufacturing facilities. We accrued costs related to employee severance and restructuring and other charges this quarter. We expect to incur some costs in the second half that will be a headwind to Industrial's gross margins.
Now looking at SG&A, we were able to keep our SG&A expenses in check, which enabled us to leverage a growing top line. And operating margins were just under 15 1/2% compared to about 9% a year ago. So overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in Pall Industrial. 
I'll switch now to Life Sciences' performance.  Strong sales growth there reflects about an 11 1/2% increase in consumables. This was driven by both the Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory markets of BioPharmaceuticals. Systems grew about 70%, with Pharmaceutical system sales more than doubling and Food and Beverage up 25%. System sales represented about 7% of sales compared to about 4 1/2% of sales last year. 
As we look at second half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth. This reflects our expectation that BioPharmaceuticals will grow by high-single digits. Consumables in Pharma will continue to trend up by low-double digits. However, Laboratory, after six consecutive quarters of double-digit increases, is expected to deliver mid single-digit growth. And this is still a good result for the Lab market.
Now despite continuing manufacturing efficiencies and pricing improvements, Life Sciences' gross margins dropped a bit. This was caused by the effect of a weakening euro on foreign-sourced goods into the eurozone and some unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overheads. Operating margin came in at 25%, and this is a real breakthrough level. This represents a 200 basis points improvement year-over-year, leveraging top line growth with, again, disciplined cost control.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the six months was $156 million. This is flat compared to the six months of fiscal year 2010 and is the one area where we have not met our expectations. And this is mainly attributable to an increase in inventories. We expect to improve our year-over-year operating cash flows in the second half, as we work down our inventory level, helping us to achieve full year operating cash flows in the range of $435 million to $460 million. 
Significant uses of cash during the six months included $67 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $30 million of stock buybacks, $60 million in capital spending and $130 million -- $133 million in repayment of debt net of new borrowings. We expect capital spending to increase slightly to between $170 million and $180 million for the full year.
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $435 million at January, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 14%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
In light of all first half performance and what we see ahead, we are increasing sales and earnings guidance for the year. We expect local currency sales to increase high single to low-double digits with similar rates of growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. This compares to our previous estimate of mid to high-single digit. This outlook is based on the strengthening economy and the effects of Pall's growth strategies. The improvement in our outlook relates to three key markets that have outperformed expectations during the first half and that we now expect to grow by low double digits for the full year. These are: BioPharmaceuticals, Aeropower and Microelectronics. 
And in Aeropower, the improvement is coming from M&E, which just posted its fourth consecutive quarter of solid double-digit sales growth and its fifth of double-digit order growth. Our expectations for operating margins for the year have risen to 17 1/2% to 18 1/2%, with outperformance in top line volume and in high-margin markets.
We continue to expect gross margins will finish the year on a 50% to 51% range, likely on the higher end. This reflects continued benefit from pricing, volume and manufacturing cost reductions in the second half. However, we expect to see margin headwinds, as system sales surge, costs are incurred for the facility closure I mentioned earlier and factory overheads absorption reduces from the adjustment of inventory levels I also referred to earlier.
Returning to SG&A, our improved revenue outlook, combined with the level of cost discipline, should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales now less than 30%. 
In closing, fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be another good year for Pall. The first half was solid by most measures, and the outlook for the second half remains strong. Including a $0.09 benefit from foreign currency translation, based upon current exchange rates, we now expect projected pro forma earnings per share will be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 for fiscal 2011. 
The full year outlook had us tracking to achieve our 2013 goal. Our strategic plan is working. We are confident in the plan and in our ability to execute it to deliver further shareholder value. Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand it back to Eric."

We've carefully positioned Pall to benefit and even outpace the economic recovery. Our first half results attest to the demand for Pall technologies and solid execution of our growth plans. They gave us added confidence to raise our full year guidance. 
We believe that the global economy will continue to improve, albeit not always steadily. Our strategic plan is crafted to yield sustained revenue and profit growth and drive further value creation for shareholders. 
Now we've covered a lot of ground this morning and appreciate your patience. Before getting to your questions, I do want to address an important issue, and that's the status of the search for my successor. The board has formed a search committee, retained a leading executive search firm and that search is officially underway. The board is working diligently to identify the right candidate to build on Pall's leading position. 
I can assure you also that I am fully engaged in the business and focused on maintaining our strong performance and momentum. And now with the help of the conference operator, we look forward to your questions."

Before we begin, I'd like to extend my concern and our condolences to the citizens of Japan after the horrific earthquake and tsunami. And we wish them the best, and we'll be helping however we can.
Now I'm pleased to be here today to review Pall's second quarter results. Thank you for joining us. Joining me are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. Also joining us today is Ken Frank, who leads the BioPharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage and Laboratory Groups under the Life Sciences umbrella. Ken is the lead architect of Pall's expanding presence in the BioPharmaceutical markets. He'll share with us his perspective on how Pall is steadily becoming the supplier of choice for a broadening range of total fluid management requirements. 
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter and update you on our outlook for the balance of the year. And following that we, of course, look forward to your questions.
Pall's execution of its strategic growth initiatives continues to yield positive results. The strong top line, coupled with Pall's deeply ingrained productivity improvement culture, drove consolidated gross margins up to 51 1/2%.
Operating margins continued their upward trend, reaching almost 18% in the quarter. And with the global economy now improving, we see significant opportunities for sustainable revenue and profit growth to further drive value creation for our shareholders. And so we are pleased with our overall progress this year and confident on capitalizing on the opportunities ahead. 
First quarter -- first half results demonstrate Pall's market and geographic strength and the power of our productivity initiatives. We were strong out of the gate in the first quarter, and the second quarter results are even better. 
Second quarter sales of $645 million is about a 15% local currency increase over last year and follows on Q1's 12% performance. Exchange rates were slightly negative on the top line in the quarter. Revenues increased by double digits in Life Sciences and Industrial. Growth was broad based by market and geography. 
The BioPharmaceuticals and Microelectronics market, in particular, outperformed our expectations in the quarter. So did Industrial in the Western Hemisphere, where every market was strong collectively, growing by more than 40%.
Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew 14%, following up on a 10% increase in Q1. Operating margins also improved. 
In the first quarter, Pall Industrial grew 14% on the incoming tide of economic recovery. Second quarter sales increased almost 18%. Industrial's gross margins jumped 280 basis points, reaching 47 1/2%. Operating profit more than doubled from a year ago.
Now on a geographic basis, both Pall Industrial and Life Sciences grew in all regions. The Western Hemisphere was strongest, increasing 27%, and that was led by the 42 1/2% growth in Industrial. 
We're gratified to see Europe return to double-digit growth after its string of economic woes. It grew almost 11% on broad market strength. Sales in Asia were also up double digits, about 10%. 
Overall orders kept pace with sales, increasing 15%. Every major market but Municipal Water was solidly positive. Orders for consumables are the leading indicator for Pall's business, and they grew almost 13%. You could look at them as an analogy to the retail market where same-store sales are an important indicator. For us, it's consumables. The backlog of consumables and systems is up 23%.  Now bear in mind, this includes orders for both consumables and systems that won't ship this year. 
The emerging regions that we have been focusing on, that's Latin America, Eastern Europe, MENA, China, India and the Southeast Asian areas, now represent about 20% of total Pall sales. With the current Middle East situation, it's important to note that Pall's sales for the countries in turmoil are not significant. We do see considerable long-term opportunity in the region, particularly in the energy and water markets. By their very nature, these markets transcend politics, and so we remain optimistic about Pall's prospects. 
With that, let's look at the sales details, starting with Industrial. Sales overall, as I said, increased about 18%. Aeropower grew close to 12% in Q2. Energy and Water were up 21%, with growth in all markets. And MicroE grew over 21%. That's its fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. 
Within Aeropower, Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the fourth quarter in a row, up 15%. Sales increased 24% in the Western Hemisphere, 18% in Europe and almost 6% and Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets remain in high gear, and other parts of the market were also strong. Q2 orders were up almost 22%. Aerospace sales grew 8%. Orders increased over 22%, with strong demand from both submarkets. 
Now looking at those markets, Military Aerospace was flat overall, while the Western Hemisphere, the largest part of the military market for us, grew 20%. Shipments were tied to a variety of military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter and spares for the U.S. government. 
Commercial Aerospace grew 17% in the quarter, with strength in all regions. Growth was aided by some inventory restocking for airline support and a modest increase in aircraft build rates, including the private jet market, which is finally reviving.
Energy and Water sales increased 21% on solid performance from all markets. Orders grew in line with shipments. Fuels and Chemicals returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 6% despite lagging large capital system sales. Growth is driven by the Western Hemisphere at 32% and Europe at 26%. And it's reflecting production of oil, gas, chemicals and polymers. All markets have an improving economy. Asia was down 20%, largely reflecting core capital orders from last year. Globally, consumable sales increased 15%. This is the third quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit decline.
Power Generation sales increased over 16% on strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key growth drivers were essentially the same as in Q1, that is water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery area and from reduced demand for power tied to industrial production. 
Municipal Water sales increased over 80% in the quarter. This remains a U.S.-centric business for now, although the opportunity is decidedly global. Sales in the Western Hemisphere more than tripled, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with regulations. Europe has been weak, but orders for the last three quarters increased by double digits. 
Public financing issues endemic to the region have been putting the shackles on new orders for municipal projects, so the increase in order volume is encouraging. Overall, backlog in Municipal Water stands at over $100 million.
Now as we said each time oil prices shoot up, high oil prices are both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to offset their impact on operating costs, which we endeavor to do. The opportunity comes from customers motivated to reduce energy consumption by extending the useful life of process fluids, and it comes from refiners looking to maximize production and also from alternative energy developers and producers with filtration-reliant technology to become more economically attractive. 
Now let's move on to Microelectronics. They reported their fifth straight quarter, as I said, of double-digit growth, increasing over 21%. All regions and key customer markets grew. Growth continues to reflect high capacity utilization rates at chip producers as well as demand for products like smartphones, tablet computers and other advanced electronics, with LED technology as key contributor. 
We do not expect these very high rates of growth to continue. They should normalize as production catches up with underlying demand and as the comps get tougher. We expect a relatively flat second half of the year, followed by a pickup in calendar 2012, as major investment programs of chip producers unfold. Orders, which have been up sharply for five quarters, this time increased just under 10%. 
With that, let's move on to the Life Sciences business. Here, sales increased 14%, with Medical up 3%, Food and Beverage, 7 1/2% up and BioPharmaceutical growing almost 24%. Medical grew modestly in all regions, while blood filter sales, which represents a little bit more than half of our Medical business, were flat. 
The next two largest submarkets, OEM and Hospital Critical Care, were up. Blood filter sales grew about 2% in the Western Hemisphere despite an estimated 4% drop in blood collections. 
The OEM submarket grew almost 7%, driven by strong demand for IV filters in the Western Hemisphere. The Hospital Critical Care market had a strong quarter with sales up almost 15%. This growth came largely from Europe, where standards governing point-of-use water filtration are more embedded than they are in the United States. We also got a boost in sales as Pall-Aquasafe filters were deployed in response to outbreaks of waterborne illness, primarily Legionella.
In Food and Beverage, sales were up 7 1/2%, with consumable sales up 4% and all regions contributing. System sales increased 25%, with both results reflecting continued recovery in the market. As further proof, orders in F&B were up almost 18% in the quarter. 
Several game-changing new products are taking hold, and I'll just comment on one of them today. That's the PROFi membrane system for beer production. The brewing industry is beginning to shift to membrane filtration from filter aides like diatomaceous earth or DE. DE is old technology with a number of problems, including worker health and process consistency. It's messy to work with, costly to dispose of and it's a known carcinogen. So breweries are transitioning to Pall's disruptive technology because it is more efficient, effective and environmentally friendly. 
A large PROFi system as might be used at any of the 1,200 large breweries in the world can sell for several million dollars. And more significantly, it can generate $500,000 in annuity sales each year. Now there's another 4,000 midsized breweries that are also potential candidates for our smaller version of the PROFi technology.
Now since our first quarter call with you, President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act into law. According to the White House blog, this historic legislation directs the Food and Drug Administration to build a new system of food oversight focused on applying the best available science to prevent the problems that make people sick. Regulation typically benefits Pall's business, and we have every reason to believe this ultimately will as well. It's already creating interest in our new GeneDisc system for rapid microdetection of food pathogens.
And finally, let's move on to BioPharmaceuticals, and I'll try not to steal Ken Frank's thunder here. Quarter two was another very good one for BioPharma. Revenues increased some 23%. Consumable sales increased 19% and system sales more than doubled. All regions were strong, with the Western Hemisphere and Asia leading the way at 36 1/2% and 30%, respectively. Europe, which is our largest region, posted 14 1/2% growth in the quarter. This was its best performance in some time. 
Pharmaceuticals grew by 25% and Lab had another good quarter with almost 15% growth. Q2 sales were positively influenced by the timing of stocking orders by some customers in Asia and large chromatography sales in the Western Hemisphere. 
Overall, orders in BioPharmaceuticals increased about 11% driven by orders for consumables, which grew 13 1/2%. Orders for systems, which can be quite lumpy, decreased. The backlog is still healthy, and at the half year mark, sales in BioPharmaceuticals are up 19%, with consumables growing 16 1/2% and systems up 17%. This growth is coming from all regions. 
And now, Ken Frank will speak to us and tell us why this business that represents over a quarter of total sales continues to perform so well. Ken?"
185333,127615977,110309,"Pall Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 11, 2011",2011-03-11,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure for me to be here today to talk about Pall BioPharmaceuticals, which is a key growth driver for Pall Corporation. The market of biologics, including biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives,",621,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure for me to be here today to talk about Pall BioPharmaceuticals, which is a key growth driver for Pall Corporation. 
The market of biologics, including biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives, continues to grow and is a key focus of our BioPharmaceuticals business. About 60% of BioPharmaceutical sales are from the biologics market, our fastest-growing market. It is important to recognize that these quarter sales figures are not just a result of the last 12 weeks work, not even the last 12 months. It is a direct outcome of the continuing execution of our key strategies that we've been working on for the last several years, I believe last outlined to you during Investor Day back in December 2009.
Our strategy is based on three elements: Technology, applications knowledge and world-class, local customer support. Over the last several years, we've broadened our technology portfolio, both by organic R&D and acquisition, to increase our value to our customers and to support our Total Fluid Management or TFM strategy. We have significantly strengthened our ability to serve customers by improving our sales channels and technical support capabilities globally. We have progressively switched from distribution to a direct sales model in many key biotech regions such as the U.S. West Coast and the Northeast. And excluding Lab, which is primarily a distribution model, 90% of this business is now direct.
This focus has helped us to drive sales growth over the last several quarters in the high-single digit to double-digit range, which is our medium-term target. The latest S&P report on the healthcare industry states that biologics are one of the bright spots of the pharmaceutical industry, with growth rates of roughly double that of classical pharmaceuticals.
Biotech is now mainstream, with all of the big pharma companies looking to this class of drugs to offset lost revenues as patents expire on many blockbuster drugs. Almost half of the 100 top-selling drugs by 2016 are expected to be biologics. 15 of the 34 innovative treatments approved by FDA in 2009 were biologics. So with 10 of 18 approved in the first half of 2010, there are more than 1,000 biologics in clinical development. And the takeaway from this are the investments in new biological manufacturing capacity is set to continue. 
Biological manufacturing is a multiple-step process with requirements of filtration at each stage, both to purify the product and to protect it from microbiological contamination. Most processes are based on cell culture with the drug product itself produced by a genetically-modified organism within a bioreactor. Everything going into and coming out of the bioreactor has to be sterile. Solid and liquid downstream recovery and purification of a product is heavily dependent on membrane separation chromatography. And this means a typical biotech drug manufacturing process can be 10x more filtration intensive than a classical pharmaceutical process.
Our business is driven both by manufacturing volumes and the number of steps in each specific process utilizing Pall products. And over the last few years, we've significantly expanded our portfolio, which now includes depth filtration, chromatography, single-use technologies as well as the long established membrane and tangential flow filters we sell. Pall is now one of the very few companies ever to offer the wide range of technologies used in the development and manufacture of biologically-based therapeutics. This broad product offering, coupled with our applications knowledge and engineering capability, is making the greatest resource for our customers. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 12% for fiscal 2011, and looking out to 2013, we believe that we're on track to meet the goals outlined at our last Investor Day. Thank you. Now I'll turn the mic over to Lisa."
185333,127615977,110309,"Pall Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 11, 2011",2011-03-11,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by recapping Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $75.7 million or $0.64 per share. This compares to $49.6 million or $0.42 per share last year. Pro forma earning",1937,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by recapping Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $75.7 million or $0.64 per share. This compares to $49.6 million or $0.42 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 26 were $0.68 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 62%. 
Net earnings in the six months were $147.1 million or $1.25 per share, and this compares to $116.6 million or $0.98 per share last year. And pro forma earnings per share were $1.29 compared to $0.82 per share, an increase of 57%. Now foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter and six months. This is an anomaly given the detriment to the top line that Eric mentioned earlier. And this reflects the combined strength of Asian profits and the impact of Asian currency translation to profitability there compared with the effect of the weakening euro on European profit.
Sales increased 15% in the quarter and 13% in the six months compared to the same period in fiscal 2010. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $3 million or about 1% in the quarter and by about $11 million or about 1% in the six months. Local currency sales were up almost 16% in the quarter. Consumable sales increased 13% and systems were up 47%. In the six months, local currency sales grew 14%, reflecting a 13% increase in consumables and a 21 1/2% increase in system sales.
Overall, pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and over $7 million in the six months, an improving trend. Gross margins in the second quarter improved 80 basis points compared to last year to 51 1/2% as an improvement in Industrial was partly offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Gross margin in the six months increased 120 basis points to 51.3%. And I'll provide some color on this by business in a moment.
SG&A was 30 1/2% of sales in the second quarter, down from 33.4% last year. In the six months, SG&A expenses were 30.3% compared to 32.8% last year. These improvements reflect top line leverage and tight cost controls and easily overcame the added expenses of going direct in some territories, as Ken mentioned before.
Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased about 6 1/2% in the quarter and 5 1/2% in the six months year-over-year. Approximately 1/3 of the increase in the quarter and 40% year-to-date relates to the investments we've spoken about before such as the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our global ERP system and investments in emerging regions. The remainder of the increase in the quarter and year reflects inflationary increases in payroll, as well as increases in selling-related variable costs. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, R&D spending rose about 13% in the quarter and 16% in the six months. We expect it will be just under 3 1/2% of sales for the year, and this is a plan to ramp up in investment for new products.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the six months was 27% as compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax audits last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year in the tax rate of about 4%. And this is in line with our forecast. The reduction has contributed about $9 million or $0.08 to the bottom line so far. 
The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters and puts us solidly on track to achieve our 2013 goal of 24% to 26%. 
Now net interest expense in the first half of last year also primarily reflects the benefit related to the resolution of the foreign tax audits I just mentioned. And this resulted in the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $9 million.  Including this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million, driven by slightly higher average interest rates and average debt levels throughout the quarter compared to the same period of last year. 
In December, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our new revolver, which were repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. So at January 31, we had $170 million of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Looking at our performance compared to the first quarter of this year, sales in the second quarter increased sequentially about 7%. Life Sciences grew 7%, driven by 11% sequential growth in BioPharmaceuticals. Industrial grew by about 6% sequentially, and this was driven by a growth of approximately 25% in Energy and Water and was principally systems driven. 
Quarter-over-quarter, gross margins improved by 50 basis points, and this reflects improvements in both businesses. In Life Sciences, this principally reflects favorable mix whereas Industrial, manufacturing cost savings drove improvement sequentially, offset by negative mix. 
Now SG&A increased 7%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, to 30.5% of sales in the second quarter compared to 30.1% in the first. And this reflects annual increases in payroll, which primarily occur in the second quarter, and annual grants of certain restricted stock units, which also occur in the quarter, higher expenses of variable-based compensation and depreciation on the investment on our global ERP system, as more locations went live in our second quarter. 
Now I'll provide some color on segment performance. As mentioned previously, Pall Industrial sales growth was 17.7%,  reflecting a 14 1/2% increase in consumables on strength in all markets. System sales grew by about 40%, primarily driven by Municipal Water. Systems represented about 15 1/2% of sales compared with about 13% last year. We expect mid single-digit growth in the second half in Pall Industrial. This reflects our expectation that Microelectronics, after five consecutive quarters of very high growth, will be flattish in the second half of the year, year-over-year.
Pall Industrial's gross margins in the quarter improved 280 basis points to 47 1/2%. This reflects three key factors: One, cost savings for manufacturing efficiencies net of inflation; two, better absorption of manufacturing overheads; and lastly, favorable mix despite the increasing systems. 
During the quarter, we announced the proposal that will likely result in the closure of one of our European manufacturing facilities. We accrued costs related to employee severance and restructuring and other charges this quarter. We expect to incur some costs in the second half that will be a headwind to Industrial's gross margins.
Now looking at SG&A, we were able to keep our SG&A expenses in check, which enabled us to leverage a growing top line. And operating margins were just under 15 1/2% compared to about 9% a year ago. So overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in Pall Industrial. 
I'll switch now to Life Sciences' performance.  Strong sales growth there reflects about an 11 1/2% increase in consumables. This was driven by both the Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory markets of BioPharmaceuticals. Systems grew about 70%, with Pharmaceutical system sales more than doubling and Food and Beverage up 25%. System sales represented about 7% of sales compared to about 4 1/2% of sales last year. 
As we look at second half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth. This reflects our expectation that BioPharmaceuticals will grow by high-single digits. Consumables in Pharma will continue to trend up by low-double digits. However, Laboratory, after six consecutive quarters of double-digit increases, is expected to deliver mid single-digit growth. And this is still a good result for the Lab market.
Now despite continuing manufacturing efficiencies and pricing improvements, Life Sciences' gross margins dropped a bit. This was caused by the effect of a weakening euro on foreign-sourced goods into the eurozone and some unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overheads. Operating margin came in at 25%, and this is a real breakthrough level. This represents a 200 basis points improvement year-over-year, leveraging top line growth with, again, disciplined cost control.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the six months was $156 million. This is flat compared to the six months of fiscal year 2010 and is the one area where we have not met our expectations. And this is mainly attributable to an increase in inventories. We expect to improve our year-over-year operating cash flows in the second half, as we work down our inventory level, helping us to achieve full year operating cash flows in the range of $435 million to $460 million. 
Significant uses of cash during the six months included $67 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $30 million of stock buybacks, $60 million in capital spending and $130 million -- $133 million in repayment of debt net of new borrowings. We expect capital spending to increase slightly to between $170 million and $180 million for the full year.
Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $435 million at January, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 14%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
In light of all first half performance and what we see ahead, we are increasing sales and earnings guidance for the year. We expect local currency sales to increase high single to low-double digits with similar rates of growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. This compares to our previous estimate of mid to high-single digit. This outlook is based on the strengthening economy and the effects of Pall's growth strategies. The improvement in our outlook relates to three key markets that have outperformed expectations during the first half and that we now expect to grow by low double digits for the full year. These are: BioPharmaceuticals, Aeropower and Microelectronics. 
And in Aeropower, the improvement is coming from M&E, which just posted its fourth consecutive quarter of solid double-digit sales growth and its fifth of double-digit order growth. Our expectations for operating margins for the year have risen to 17 1/2% to 18 1/2%, with outperformance in top line volume and in high-margin markets.
We continue to expect gross margins will finish the year on a 50% to 51% range, likely on the higher end. This reflects continued benefit from pricing, volume and manufacturing cost reductions in the second half. However, we expect to see margin headwinds, as system sales surge, costs are incurred for the facility closure I mentioned earlier and factory overheads absorption reduces from the adjustment of inventory levels I also referred to earlier.
Returning to SG&A, our improved revenue outlook, combined with the level of cost discipline, should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales now less than 30%. 
In closing, fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be another good year for Pall. The first half was solid by most measures, and the outlook for the second half remains strong. Including a $0.09 benefit from foreign currency translation, based upon current exchange rates, we now expect projected pro forma earnings per share will be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 for fiscal 2011. 
The full year outlook has us tracking to achieve our 2013 goal. Our strategic plan is working. We are confident in the plan and in our ability to execute it to deliver further shareholder value. Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand it back to Eric."

We appreciate your joining us on our third quarter conference call. I am here on these very sultry morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, the Corporate Controller. Now our first 3 quarters have been strong and places around the higher end of our earnings guidance for fiscal 2011. The company also continues to make progress towards its long-term performance goals to create further value for shareholders.
Today, we will update you on our business and we look forward to your questions.
There are a number of factors driving growth. Pall has an accomplished and capable management team with solid depth throughout the organization. Top and bottom line growth strategies have differentiated Pall from its competitors. We provide total fluid management and are now well-respected systems engineering company, a business developer organically. We have positioned the company to capitalize on improving economic conditions and emerging market trends. We're continuing to execute these strategies to expand opportunities and improve performance.
Our confluence of trends are supporting the business and setting the stage for future growth. Among them improving economies, a rising middle-class and developing regions, game changing technologies in areas such as electronics and via technology and of course the economics of environmentalism and increasing regulations. All of these drive Pall's enabling technologies. It's clear that it is a good time to be a leader and I want to quote from a annual report of Pall's from 1959. The existence and growth of Pall Corporation goes hand in hand with the requirements of modern technology. Now that statement is as true today as it was for more than 1/2 a century ago. Our business mix of real difference in industries, customers and society. Pall management and employees look forward to continuing to build on the company's success.
With that, let's now get into the details for the quarter. Fiscal '11 sales have increased by double digits throughout the year. Third quarter sales grew 11% in local currency so that $710 million. Life Sciences is up 12% and Industrial grew close to 10%. I of Pharmaceutical continued to deliver strong results, reflecting Pall's broadening presence throughout the biotech production process. Microelectronics still grew after last year's mediocre 78% increase. New Pall products service the proliferation of semiconductor and consumer electronics products are driving forces.
Machinery and Equipment's healthy performance also continued, that group posted its fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Mining in particular remained strong.
Food and Beverage, Life Sciences OEM, Commercial Aerospace and Energy sales all grew at or above 10%. You'll hear more about them as we go along. Now on a geographic basis, both Industrial Life Sciences grew in all regions. The Western Hemisphere was strongest with sales increasing 14%. Europe again grew over 10% with Military Aerospace the only weak spot. Sales in Asia were up about 7% overall, but if we take Japan out, Asia sales grew about 11%.
China and India in particular did very well. Sales in Japan, which is our largest Asian market, were down about $700,000 or about 1%. Life Sciences grew despite the disaster at Pharmaceutical customers increased purchases and accelerated production schedules in anticipation of possible supply-chain disruptions and power outages. Pall's industrial markets in Japan were down 6% overall, largely driven by the semiconductor industry there. Our Microelectronics sales decreased 11% in Japan.
So some of these was offset as other producers in other geographies rev up production. We could continue to see business disruptions in Japan in the short term, longer term opportunities with the third's largest economy in the world as they rebuild will improve our prospects. Total orders kept pace with sales, increasing 10%. Every major market but Energy and Water was solidly positive. We Logged double-digit orders growth in Asia. Orders grew by double digits for the first time this year and orders in the Western Hemisphere increased 6% compared to over 30% a year ago. Orders for consumables grew 6% compared to 21% last year when the company's began restocking inventories as the economy began to recover. Our backlog of consumables and systems is up over 25%. Now bear in mind this includes orders for both consumables and systems that will ship over time.
With that, let's look at the sales details starting first with Industrial. Both Industrial sales overall increased about 10% and that's up 14% for the 9 months. Aeropower grew close to 11% in the third quarter. Energy and Water was up 10% with growth in all markets. Microelectronics grew almost 7% instead of the flattish results projected in response to the industry forecast. Within Aeropower, Machinery and Equipment posted double-digit growth for the fifth quarter in a row. Q3 sales increased about 24%. And sales in the Western Hemisphere were up 65%, 15% up in Europe and slightly up in Asia. Global mining business, as I mentioned before, remains in high gear both at the producer and at the OEM level. Investments in new mining equipment continues to signal ongoing confidence and future requirements for mining materials. Q3 orders were up 10% for the 6 quarter of double-digit growth in Machinery and Equipment. Aerospace sales were down 3% overall while orders were up 45%. Commercial Aerospace grew about 13% and this once again reflects restocking of inventories for airline support, and modest demand as OEM production rates pickup for new airframes.
Military was down 16% and this was primarily driven by Europe. Overall Military orders increased 66% there and have grown by double digits for the previous 3 quarters. Most of this order growth is coming from the U.S. although the procurement process is taking longer, orders are coming through. As you may have seen, Pall recently received a large order we had been waiting for from the U.S. government. We booked a $14 million order for Centrisep systems for 59 of the Army's CH-47 helicopter to protect this valuable asset in Sandy environments. Shipments are slated to begin in December 2011 and to be completed by November 2012. Energy and Water sales increased 10% on solid performance from all submarkets. Within the Energy market, Fuels and Chemicals grew almost 10% and Power Generation grew about 15%. The oil and gas market have been particularly strong with alternative Energy, polymer and chemical contributing. There's some weakness in the refinery market, which has to cope with the decreased demand brought on by higher oil prices.
The Power Generation story has been the same all year, strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia were largely the same reasons. Water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of wind turbine markets particularly in China. Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied to Industrial production. Orders in Energy were down almost 5% in the quarter. The comparable quarter last year contained a very large order for a $5 billion gas processing plant in Abu Dhabi. That was the price of the plant, not the order. Municipal water sales increased 7% in the quarter and sales growth was in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. Europe seems to be stabilizing, although public spending is still under pressure. Overall, the backlog in Municipal Water remains over $100 million totally. Now Microelectronics. That group was up 18% for the year and almost 7% in the quarter. As I mentioned, before the industry stayed stronger than predicted. Q3 orders increased over 8%, marking 6 consecutive quarters of orders growth. The growth continues to reflect high capacity utilization rates at chip producers and demand for products like smartphones, tablet computers, solar cells, and other advanced electronics, including LEDs. The LED market is an exciting emerging opportunity for Pall. These are a semiconductor light sources with the manufacturing process similar to that used to make IC devices. And in fact, they are actually known as LED semiconductor chips. We're leveraging our expertise in filtration for the semiconductor market in applying its production of LEDs. As you probably know in many countries, including the U.S., have passed measures to phase out incandescent light bulb for general lighting. U.S. legislation specifies that general-purpose lighting must be at least 25% more efficient than incandescent bulbs. And that's good for the new technology as that is our technology is supporting.
Now let's go on to the Life Sciences. Overall, sales in Life Sciences increased about 12% in both the quarter and for the 9 months. In the third quarter, Medical grew 5%, Food and Beverage 12% and biopharma, 16%. Medical grew in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, which lead with 10% growth. The Western Hemisphere growth was driven by balanced strength in every submarket from the largest blood to the smallest cell therapy. Western Hemisphere blood filter sales grew of over 4% against the backdrop of declining blood collections. Hospital Critical Care grew 26%, an increased apposite water sales. And our medical OEM business was up 19% in the Western Hemisphere and 12% globally. This is largely due to the addition of IV filters, the drug infusion pumps to prevent air from being pumped in to patients a recent FDA draft guidance document recommends that manufacturers take measures to mitigate risks associated with the rightly used pump equipment. Sales in Food and Beverage were up 12%, marking 4 quarters of growth. Consumables sales increased 8% with all regions contributing but particularly in the Western Hemisphere. System sales increased 30%, with both results reflecting continuing recovery in the Food and Beverage market. A further proof is that Food and Beverage orders were up 13% in the quarter. As a sidenote, Pall sciences are currently assisting leading national authorities in Europe in their race to find a source of the deadly E. coli outbreak. On Tuesday, Senator in the U.S. introduced new meat safety deregulations that call for testing wider range of pathogens than currently required. One she specifically named as the leading cause of food bourne illness and death in the U.S. is non e-coli. Pall has to validate of this bacteria in meat. And finally, last but not least, BioPharmaceuticals. Biopharma which accounted for about 28% of total Pall sales in the quarter is firing on all cylinders. Revenues increased 16% in the quarter and are up 18% for the year. Consumables sales increased almost 15% and systems sales were up about 35%. Every region was strong, with Asia and Europe leading at 22% and 18% growth, respectively. Pharmaceuticals grew by 17% and Lab had another good quarter with 11% growth. These results have a direct outcome of continuing execution of key growth strategies. These include fluid management, providing customers with enabling technology to meet them, meet their performance goals and adding the infrastructure for Pall to serve these customers around the world. Our efforts are paying off particularly at the biotech industry accounts for a much higher proportion of the overall market. Every one of the 6 top-selling drugs by 2014 is projected to be a biotech drugs and that compares with just 2 biotech drugs in the top 6 only 3 years ago. Orders in BioPharmaceuticals increased 22%. Consumables orders were up 22%. And orders for systems increased 34%. So it's pretty clear we're closing in on a very strong year in biopharma and for Pall overall. This is enormously gratifying for all of us. And now with that, let's hear from Lisa."
185333,133338291,135007,"Pall Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2011",2011-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the financial details, I'd like to start a little off with some more good news. As you may recall, in 2007, the company announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal year",1926,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the financial details, I'd like to start a little off with some more good news. As you may recall, in 2007, the company announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2006 for the under payment of income taxes, primarily in the United States. We reported last evening that late last month, the IRS concluded its audits of fiscal year 1999 through 2005. While we are still in the process of finalizing the impact of this to our financial position, I would like to highlight 3 key items. First, no penalties were assessed. Secondly, our current estimate is a reduction of net liabilities in the range of $20 million to $30 million, such benefits to be recognized in this year's fourth quarter. And this has no impact to the company. And thirdly, of the $127 million of additional unrecorded potential penalties that we've disclosed previously, we have now concluded that the likelihood of assessment of about $106 million of these penalties is remote. The balance, primarily related to some foreign matters.
So with that update, let's get to the financial review of the quarter and 9 months. Net earnings in the quarter was $71.1 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to a $69.7 million or $0.58 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined in the appendix slide were $0.72 compared to $0.58 per share, an increase of 24%. Net earnings in the 9 months was $218.1 million or $1.84 per share, and this compares to $186.3 million or $1.56 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share were $2.01 compared to $1.40 per share, an increase of 44%. The foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by about $0.04 in the quarter and $0.05 in the 9 months.
The sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the 9 months compared to the same period in fiscal 2010. The foreign currency translation increased the top line by about $28 million or 4% in the quarter and by about $70 million or about 1% in 9 months. Local currency sales were up almost 11% in the quarter. Consumables sales increased about 9% and systems sales were up over 29%, bringing system sales to just over 12% of total sales compared to 10.5% in the third quarter of 2010.
In the 9 months, local currency sales grew 13%, reflecting about a 12% increase in consumables and a 25% increase in system sales. Overall, pricing gains contributed approximately $3 million in the top line in the quarter and $10 million in the 9 months. Gross margins for the 9 months stand at 50.8%, a 40 basis points year-over-year, as an improvement in Industrial was partly offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Now this is down 50 basis points from the 6 months ended January as we sold gross margins deep in the third quarter. I'll provide the key drivers of these results by business in a moment.
SG&A was 29.5% of sales in the third quarter, down from 30.4% last year. And in the 9 months, SG&A came in at 30% compared to 32% last year. These improvements reflect top line leverage and tight cost controls on G&A spend while spending in other key areas is ramping up. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased about 8% in the quarter year-over-year and 7% in 9 months. Looking at the quarter, most of the increase reflects a ramp-up in spend on sales and marketing at 3 key areas, investments in emerging regions, variable performance related costs and marketing. In addition, we continued to see expense increases from our investments in our IT infrastructure and corporate costs also reflect performance related cost, as well as certain covenants related items. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, R&D spending rose about 10% in the quarter and almost 14% in the 9 months. We expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year and this reflects a plans of ramp up of investment in new products.
Turning to income taxes. The effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter was 35.1% and for the 9 months, 29.8%. This includes tax costs recorded in the quarter associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. This compares to an effective tax rate of 31.6% in the third quarter and 25.2% for the first 9 months of last year, which included the favorable resolution of a foreign tax audit. So excluding these items, the effective tax rate in the first 9 months reflects a sustainable reduction of 4 percentage points year-over-year. The reduction in the rate have contributed about $13 million or about $0.11 to the bottom line year-to-date. Including the cost of the establishment of the Asian headquarters as well as the benefit at the conclusion of the IRS audits I mentioned earlier, we expect the effective rate to be about 24% for fiscal year 2011.
The full year forecasted underlying rate of about 27% does not reflect these items, which we consider to be discrete. It does reflect the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters and puts us solidly on track to achieve our 2013 goal of 24% to 26%. The change in net interest expense in the third quarter and 9 months reflects that in fiscal year 2010, certain benefits were recorded related to the resolution of the foreign tax audits and expiring statutes of limitation. Excluding these items, net interest expense have been running about $250,000 higher per quarter this year, driven by a slightly higher interest rates and debt levels. The 3 key items that I will comment on regarding sequential performance are revenues, gross margins and orders. Sales in the third quarter increased by $65 million or 10% sequentially. Almost 8% in local currency, 6% in base and 19% in systems. Life Sciences grew 10%, approximately 7.5% local currency. This was driven by a 7% sequential growth in BioPharmaceuticals, 18% growth in Food and Beverage, and 4% growth in Medical. Industrial also grew by almost 10% sequentially, about 7.5% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 13% in Aeropower, 5.5% in microelectrnics and 4% in Energy and Water. Compared to the second quarter, gross margins trended down. This reflects the in both businesses relating to 3 key factors, manufacturing overhead absorption, unfavorable mix and some special charges to certain inventory and contract related items. Orders were up 7.5% sequentially, approximately 5% in local currency, bringing our backlog up 11% compared to the end of the second quarter, 9% up in base and 15% up in systems.
Now I'll provide some color on segment performance. Pall Industrial sales growth was about 10% local currency, reflecting a 6% increase in consumables with all markets growing. System sales grew by 28%, units over water and Machinery and Equipment sales were particularly strong. Systems represented about 16.7% of sales compared with about 14.5% last year. Pall Industrial's gross margin in the quarter decreased 120 basis points to 46.1%. And this principally reflects unfavorable mix. At the 9 months, gross margins improved 140 basis points to 46.9%, primarily driven by volume, cost savings, and partly offset by unfavorable mix. Industrial SG&A grew by 9% in local currency, reflecting increased spend of about 13% in sales and marketing costs, and in particular spend for our European and Asian headquarters. Operating margins were 14.8% in the quarter compared to about 15.7% a year ago. This reflects the decline in gross margin I mentioned earlier. At the 9-month mark, operating margins were 15.2%, a 370 basis point improvement over last year. So overall, we are pleased with the progress we're making in Pall Industrial.
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew almost 12% in the quarter. Consumables sales increased over 10%, with all markets contributing. Consumables growth in Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory was particularly strong. Systems grew about 32% with Pharmaceutical sales system sales up about 35% and Food and Beverage system sales up 30%. System sales represented 8% of sales compared to 6.7% of sales last year. Now despite continued manufacturing efficiencies and pricing improvements, Life Sciences gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 53.3%. This was impacted by certain inventory related charges. We also have lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output. Together, these items reduced gross margins by about 300 basis points. Cost savings and the benefit of pricing partly offset. Life Sciences SG&A increased 4.5% in local currency in the quarter, again driven by increases in sales and marketing cost. G&A cost reductions were offset by Life Sciences share of the increased spend on IT. At the 9-month mark, SG&A as a percentage of sales in Life Sciences was 26.1%, a 200 basis point improvement over last year. Now operating margins came in at 24.2%, 100 basis points improvement. And at the 9-month mark, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.2%.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the 9 months was $281 million, an increase of about $24 million or 9% compared to the 9 months of fiscal year 2010. This does reflect the continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory improving by 9 days. However, the improvement in working capital in 2010 was higher as the improvement in the cash conversion cycle versus 2009 was more pronounced. Significant uses of cash during the 9-month included $122 million return to shareholders with dividends of $57 million and stock repurchases of $65 million line close to 1.3 million sales. These leads approximately $288 million of our current authorization, $103 million in capital spending and $154 million in repayments of debt net of new borrowings.
We expect full year operating cash flow in the range of $435 million to $450 million. The capital spending is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $491 million in April 30 and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010, reflecting the strong generation of cash in the U.S. this year.
Our results through April at the high end of our 2011 expectations. We expect local currency sales for the year to be up high single to low double-digits with similar rate of growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial likely on the higher end of this range. We also expect operating margins for the year to be at a higher end of the range at 17.5% to 18.5% with gross margins for the year at the high end of our range of 50% to 51%. This reflects continued benefit from pricing and manufacturing efficiencies. We do expect gross margins in the fourth quarter to improve compared to the third quarter due to the unusual items in the third quarter. We expect, we continued to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be less than 30%.
In closing, fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be another good year for Pall. Based on our results at the 9-month mark, our expectations for the fourth quarter and with foreign currency at current rates a tailwind, we expect a comment around the high end of our pro forma EPS range of $2.80 to $2.90 for fiscal 2011. We thank you for attention this morning. With that, I will this hand this back to Eric."

And how that plays out over the next 12 months. Principally, the negative mix in the quarter related to a surge on system sales. System sales were up significantly in the quarter in both year-over-year as well as sequentially, coming in for the quarter at over 12% of our total sales. In addition, particularly in Pall Industrial, we saw some negative mix with the growth in Aerospace and PowerGen. For instance, we're at the beginning of the wind turbine market and given it's at the beginning and it's growing quite well but the margins right now are not so strong on that. So that's what we saw in the quarter. As we look at the balance of the year, we continued to expect mix pressure although as I said, we do expect the fourth quarter gross margins to bounce back from the third quarter because we don't expect to see the unusual charges that we took in the third quarter. I won't comment on fiscal year 2012 and I will wait to comment on that with our fourth quarter earnings call."

Those are major drivers for our business. And we also, with our blood business continued to grow. And a lot of that growth both in biopharma and in medical is in the emerging regions. Now that's the thing we also see on the Industrial side, very large growth in the areas that we've invested in infrastructure in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East, North Africa and in Southeast Asia.

We appreciate your joining us on our third quarter conference call. I am here on this very sultry morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, the Corporate Controller. Now our first 3 quarters have been strong and places around the higher end of our earnings guidance for fiscal 2011. The company also continues to make progress towards its long-term performance goals to create further value for shareholders.
Today, we will update you on our business and then look forward to your questions.
There are a number of factors driving growth. Pall has an accomplished and capable management team with solid depth throughout the organization. Top and bottom line growth strategies had differentiated Pall from its competitors. We provide total fluid management and are now a well-respected systems engineering company, a business developer organically. We have positioned the company to capitalize on improving economic conditions and emerging market trends. We're continuing to execute these strategies to expand opportunities and improve performance.
A confluence of trends are supporting the business and setting the stage for future growth. Among them improving economies, a rising middle-class and developing regions, game-changing technologies in areas such as electronics and biotechnology and of course the economics of environmentalism and increasing regulation. All of these drive Pall's enabling technologies. It's clear that it's a good time to be a leader and I want to quote from a annual report of Pall's from 1959. ""The existence and growth of Pall Corporation goes hand in hand with the requirements of modern technology."" Now that statement is as true today as it was for more than half a century ago. Our business makes up real difference to industries, customers and society. Pall management employees look forward to continuing to build on the company's success.
With that, let's now get into the details for the quarter. Fiscal '11 sales have increased by double digits throughout the year. Third quarter sales grew 11% in local currency so that's $710 million. Life Sciences is up 12% and Industrial grew close to 10%. BioPharmaceuticals continues to deliver strong results, reflecting Pall's broadening presence throughout the biotech production process. Microelectronics still grew after last year's meteoric 78% sales increase. New Pall products to service the proliferation of semiconductor and consumer electronics products are driving forces.
Machinery & Equipment's healthy performance also continued. That group posted its fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Mining in particular remained strong.
Food and Beverage, Life Sciences, OEM, Commercial Aerospace and Energy sales all grew at or above 10%. You'll hear more about them as we go along. Now on a geographic basis, both Industrial and Life Sciences grew in all regions. The Western Hemisphere was strongest with sales increasing 14%. Europe again grew over 10% with Military Aerospace the only weak spot. Sales in Asia were up about 7% overall, but if we take Japan out, Asia sales grew about 11%.
China and India in particular did very well. Sales in Japan, which is our largest Asian market, were down about $700,000 or about 1%. Life Sciences grew despite the disaster as Pharmaceutical customers increased purchases and accelerated production schedules in anticipation of possible supply-chain disruptions and power outages. Pall's industrial markets in Japan were down 6% overall, largely driven by the semiconductor industry there. Our Microelectronics sales decreased 11% in Japan.
Though some of this was offset as other producers in different geographies revved up production. We could continue to see business disruptions in Japan in the short-term, longer-term opportunities with the third's largest economy in the world as they rebuild will improve our prospects. Total orders kept pace with sales, increasing 10%. Every major market but Energy & Water was solidly positive. We logged double-digit orders growth in Asia. Orders grew by double digits for the first time this year and orders in the Western Hemisphere increased 6% compared to over 30% a year ago. Orders for consumables grew 6% compared to 21% last year when companies began restocking inventories as the economy began to recover. Our backlog of consumables and systems is up over 25%. Now bear in mind that this includes orders for both consumables and systems that will ship over time.
With that, let's look at the sales details starting first with Industrial. Both Industrial sales overall increased about 10% and that's up 14% for the 9 months. Aeropower grew close to 11% in the third quarter. Energy & Water was up 10% with growth in all markets. Microelectronics grew almost 7% instead of the flattish result projected in response to the industry forecasts. Within Aeropower, Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the fifth quarter in a row. Q3 sales increased about 24%. And sales in the Western Hemisphere were up 65%, 15% up in Europe and slightly up in Asia. Global mining, as I mentioned before, remains in high gear both at the producer and at the OEM level. Investment in new mining equipment continues to signal ongoing confidence and future requirements for mining materials. Q3 orders were up 10% for the sixth quarter of double-digit growth in Machinery & Equipment. Aerospace sales were down 3% overall while orders were up 45%. Commercial Aerospace grew about 13% and this once again reflects restocking of inventories for airline support, and modest demand as OEM production rates pickup for new airframes.
Military was down 16% and this was primarily driven by Europe. Overall Military orders increased 66% there and have grown by double digits for the previous 3 quarters. Most of this order growth is coming from the U.S. although the procurement process is taking longer, orders are coming through. As you may have seen, Pall recently received a large order we had been waiting for from the U.S. government. We booked a $14 million order for Centrisep systems for 59 of the army's CH-47 helicopters to protect these valuable asset in sandy environments. Shipments are slated to begin in December 2011 and to be completed by November 2012. Energy & Water sales increased 10% on solid performance from all submarkets. Within the Energy market, Fuels and Chemicals grew almost 10% and Power Generation grew about 15%. The oil and gas market have been particularly strong with alternative energy, polymer and chemical contributing. There's some weakness in the refinery market, which has to cope with the decreased demand brought on by higher oil prices.
The Power Generation story has been the same all year, strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia for largely the same reasons. Water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of wind turbine markets particularly in China. Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied to industrial production. Orders in Energy were down almost 5% in the quarter. The comparable quarter last year contained a very large order for a $5 billion gas processing plant in Abu Dhabi. That was the price of the plant, not the order. Municipal Water sales increased 7% in the quarter and sales growth was in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. Europe seems to be stabilizing, although public spending is still under pressure. Overall, the backlog in Municipal Water remains over $100 million totally. Now Microelectronics. That group was up 18% for the year and almost 7% in the quarter. As I mentioned, before the industry has stayed stronger than predicted. Q3 orders increased over 8%, marking 6 consecutive quarters of orders growth. The growth continues to reflect high-capacity utilization rates at chip producers and demand for products like smartphones, tablet computers, solar cells, and other advanced electronics, including LEDs. The LED market is an exciting emerging opportunity for Pall. These are semiconductor light sources with the manufacturing process similar to that used to make IC devices. And in fact, they're actually known as LED semiconductor chips. We're leveraging our expertise in filtration for the semiconductor market in applying its production of LEDs. As you probably know, many countries, including the U.S., have passed measures to phase out incandescent light bulbs for general lighting. U.S. legislation specifies that general-purpose lighting must be at least 25% more efficient than incandescent bulbs. And that's good for the new technology that our technology is supporting.
Now let's go on to the Life Sciences. Overall, sales in Life Sciences increased about 12% in both the quarter and for the 9 months. In the third quarter, Medical grew 5%; food and Beverage, 12% and BioPharm, 16%. Medical grew in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, which led with 10% growth. The Western Hemisphere growth was driven by balance strength in every submarket from the largest blood to the smallest cell therapy. Western Hemisphere blood filter sales grew up to over 4% against the backdrop of declining blood collections. Hospital Critical Care grew 26% on increased Aquasafe water sales. And our Medical OEM business was up 19% in the Western Hemisphere and 12% globally. This is largely due to the addition of IV filters to drug infusion pumps to prevent air from being pumped into patients. A recent FDA draft guidance document recommends that manufacturers take measures to mitigate risks associated with the rightly used pump equipment. Sales in Food and Beverage were up 12%, marking 4 quarters of growth. Consumables sales increased 8% with all regions contributing but particularly in the Western Hemisphere. System sales increased 30%, with both results reflecting continuing recovery in the Food and Beverage market. A further proof is that Food and Beverage orders were up 13% in the quarter. As a sidenote, Pall sciences are currently assisting leading national authorities in Europe in their race to find the source of the deadly E. coli outbreak. On Tuesday, Senator Gillibrand in the U.S. introduced new meat safety regulations that calls for testing for a wider range of pathogens than currently required. One she specifically named as a leading cause of food-bourne illness and death in the U.S. is non-O157 E. coli. Pall has a validated test to detect for this bacteria in meat. And finally, last but not least, BioPharmaceuticals. BioPharma which accounted for about 28% of total Pall sales in the quarter is firing on all cylinders. Revenues increased 16% in the quarter and are up 18% for the year. Consumables sales increased almost 15% and systems sales were up about 35%. Every region was strong, with Asia and Europe leading at 22% and 18% growth, respectively. Pharmaceuticals grew by 17% and Lab had another good quarter with 11% growth. These results have a direct outcome of continuing execution of key growth strategies. These include total fluid management, providing customers with enabling technology to meet them, meet their performance goals and adding the infrastructure for Pall to serve these customers around the world. Our efforts are paying off particularly at the biotech industry accounts for a much higher proportion of the overall market. Every one of the 6 top-selling drugs by 2014 is projected to be a biotech drug and that compares with just 2 biotech drugs in the top 6 only 3 years ago. Orders in BioPharmaceuticals increased 22%. Consumables orders were up 22%. And orders for systems increased 34%. So it's pretty clear we're closing in on a very strong year in BioPharma and for Pall overall. Overall, this is enormously gratifying for all of us. And now with that, let's hear from Lisa."
185333,133338291,135094,"Pall Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2011",2011-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the financial details, I'd like to start off with some more good news. As you may recall, in 2007, the company announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 th",1919,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the financial details, I'd like to start off with some more good news. As you may recall, in 2007, the company announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2006 for the under payment of income taxes, primarily in the United States. We reported last evening that late last month, the IRS concluded its audits of fiscal year 1999 through 2005. While we are still in the process of finalizing the impact of this to our financial position, I would like to highlight 3 key items. First, no penalties were assessed. Secondly, our current estimate is a reduction of net liabilities in the range of $20 million to $30 million, such benefits to be recognized in this year's fourth quarter. And this has no impact to the company. And thirdly, of the $127 million of additional unrecorded potential penalties that we've disclosed previously, we have now concluded that the likelihood of assessment of about $106 million of these penalties is remote. The balance, primarily related to some foreign matters.
So with that update, let's get to the financial review of the quarter and 9 months. Net earnings in the quarter was $71.1 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $69.7 million or $0.58 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined in the appendix slide were $0.72 compared to $0.58 per share, an increase of 24%. Net earnings in the 9 months was $218.1 million or $1.84 per share, and this compares to $186.3 million or $1.56 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share were $2.01 compared to $1.40 per share, an increase of 44%. The foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by about $0.04 in the quarter and $0.05 in the 9 months.
The sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the 9 months compared to the same period in fiscal 2010. Foreign currency translation increased the top line by about $28 million or 4% in the quarter and by about $70 million or about 1% in 9 months. Local currency sales were up almost 11% in the quarter. Consumables sales increased about 9% and systems sales were up over 29%, bringing system sales to just over 12% of total sales compared to 10.5% in the third quarter of 2010.
In the 9 months, local currency sales grew 13%, reflecting about a 12% increase in consumables and a 25% increase in system sales. Overall, pricing gains contributed approximately $3 million in the top line in the quarter and $10 million in the 9 months. Gross margins for the 9 months stand at 50.8%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, as an improvement in Industrial was partly offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Now this is down 50 basis points from the 6 months ended January as we sold gross margins deep in the third quarter. I'll provide the key drivers of these results by business in a moment.
SG&A was 29.5% of sales in the third quarter, down from 30.4% last year. And in the 9 months, SG&A came in at 30% compared to 32% last year. These improvements reflect top line leverage and tight cost controls on G&A spend while spending in other key areas is ramping up. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased about 8% in the quarter year-over-year and 7% in 9 months. Looking at the quarter, most of the increase reflects a ramp-up in spend on sales and marketing in 3 key areas, investments in emerging regions, variable flash performance related costs and marketing. In addition, we continue to see expense increases from our investments in our IT infrastructure and corporate costs also reflect performance related cost, as well as certain governance-related items. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, R&D spending rose about 10% in the quarter and almost 14% in the 9 months. We expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year and this reflects a plan to ramp up in investment for new products.
Turning to income taxes. The effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter was 35.1% and for the 9 months, 29.8%. This includes tax costs recorded in the quarter associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. This compares to an effective tax rate of 31.6% in the third quarter and 25.2% for the first 9 months of last year, which included the favorable resolution of a foreign tax audit. So excluding these items, the effective tax rate in the first 9 months reflects a sustainable reduction of 4 percentage points year-over-year. The reduction in the rate have contributed about $13 million or about $0.11 for the bottom line year-to-date. Including the cost of the establishment of the Asian headquarters as well as the benefit at the conclusion of the IRS audits I mentioned earlier, we expect the effective rate to be about 24% for fiscal year 2011.
The full year forecasted underlying rate of about 27% does not reflect these items, which we consider to be discrete. It does reflect the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters and puts us solidly on track to achieve our 2013 goal of 24% to 26%. The change in net interest expense in the third quarter and 9 months reflects that in fiscal year 2010, certain benefits were recorded related to the resolution of the foreign tax audits and expiring statutes of limitation. Including these items, net interest expense has been running about $250,000 higher per quarter this year, driven by slightly higher interest rates and debt levels. The 3 key items that I will comment on regarding sequential performance are revenues, gross margins and orders. Sales in the third quarter increased by $55 million or 10% sequentially. Almost 8% in local currency, 6% in base and 19% in systems. Life Sciences grew 10%, approximately 7.5% local currency. This was driven by 7% sequential growth in BioPharmaceuticals, 18% growth in Food and Beverage, and 4% growth in Medical. Industrial also grew by almost 10% sequentially, about 7.5% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 13% in Aeropower, 5.5% in Microelectrnics and 4% in Energy & Water. Compared to the second quarter, gross margins trended down. This reflects declines in both businesses relating to 3 key factors, manufacturing overhead absorption, unfavorable mix and some special charges for certain inventory and contract related items. Orders were up 7.5% sequentially, approximately 5% in local currency, bringing our backlog up 11% compared to the end of the second quarter, 9% up in base and 15% up in systems.
Now I'll provide some color on segment performance. Pall Industrial sales growth was about 10% in local currency, reflecting a 6% increase in consumables with all markets growing. System sales grew by 28%, Municipal Water and Machinery & Equipment sales were particularly strong. Systems represented about 16.7% of sales compared with about 14.5% last year. Pall Industrial's gross margin in the quarter decreased 120 basis points to 46.1%. And this principally reflects unfavorable mix. At the 9-month mark, gross margins improved 140 basis points to 46.9%, primarily driven by volume, cost savings, partly offset by unfavorable mix. Industrial SG&A grew by 9% in local currency, reflecting increased spend of about 13% in sales and marketing costs, and in particular spend for our European and Asian headquarters. Operating margins were 14.8% in the quarter compared to about 15.7% a year ago. This reflects the decline in gross margin I mentioned earlier. At the 9-month mark, operating margins were 15.2%, a 370 basis point improvement over last year. So overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in Pall Industrial.
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew almost 12% in the quarter. Consumables sales increased over 10%, with all markets contributing. Consumables growth in Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory was particularly strong. Systems grew about 32% with Pharmaceutical sales system sales up about 35% and Food and Beverage system sales up 30%. System sales represented 8% of sales compared to 6.7% of sales last year. Now despite continued manufacturing efficiencies and pricing improvements, Life Sciences gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 53.3%. This was impacted by certain inventory-related charges. We also have lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output. Together, these items reduced gross margins by about 300 basis points. Cost savings and the benefit of pricing partly offset. Life Sciences SG&A increased 4.5% in local currency in the quarter, again driven by increases in sales and marketing cost. G&A cost reductions were offset by Life Sciences share of the increased spend on IT. At the 9-month mark, SG&A as a percentage of sales in Life Sciences was 26.1%, a 200 basis point improvement over last year. Now operating margins came in at 24.2%, a 100 basis point improvement. And at the 9-month mark, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.2%.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the 9 months was $281 million, an increase of about $24 million or 9% compared to the 9 months of fiscal year 2010. This does reflect continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory improving by 9 days. However, the improvement in working capital in 2010 was higher as the improvement in the cash conversion cycle versus 2009 was more pronounced. Significant uses of cash during the 9-month included $122 million return to shareholders with dividends of $57 million and stock repurchases of $65 million lying close to 1.3 million shares. This leads approximately $288 million of our current authorization, $103 million in capital spending and $154 million in repayments of debt net of new borrowings.
We expect full year operating cash flow in the range of $435 million to $450 million. The capital spending is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $491 million at April 30 and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010, reflecting the strong generation of cash in the U.S. this year.
Our results through April put us at the high end of our 2011 expectation. We expect local currency sales for the year to be up high-single to low-double-digits with similar rates of growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial likely on the higher end of this range. We also expect operating margins for the year to be at the higher end of the range at 17.5% to 18.5% with gross margins for the year at the high end of our range of 50% to 51%. This reflects continued benefit from pricing and manufacturing efficiencies. We do expect gross margins in the fourth quarter to improve compared to the third quarter due to the unusual items in the third quarter. We expect -- we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be less than 30%.
In closing, fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be another good year for Pall. Based on our results at the 9-month mark, our expectations for the fourth quarter and with foreign exchange that currently is a tailwind, we expect to come in around the high end of our pro forma EPS range of $2.80 to $2.90 for fiscal 2011. We thank you for attention this morning. With that, I will this hand this back to Eric."

Principally, the negative mix in the quarter related to a surge on system sales. System sales were up significantly in the quarter in both year-over-year as well as sequentially, coming in for the quarter at over 12% of our total sales. In addition, particularly in Pall Industrial, we saw some negative mix with the growth in Aerospace and Power Gen. For instance, we're at the beginning of the wind turbine market and given it's at the beginning and it's growing quite well but the margins right now are not so strong on that. So that's what we saw in the quarter. As we look at the balance of the year, we continue to expect mix pressure although as I said, we do expect the fourth quarter gross margins to bounce back from the third quarter because we don't expect to see the unusual charges that we took in the third quarter. I won't comment on fiscal year 2012 and I will wait to comment on that with our fourth quarter earnings call."

Those are major drivers for our business. And we also, with our Blood business continued to grow. And a lot of that growth both in BioPharma and in Medical is in the emerging regions. Now that's the thing we also see on the Industrial side, very large growth in the areas that we've invested in infrastructure in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East, North Africa and in Southeast Asia. The Industrial markets overall, we think, of course, that our mix is so varied that we have confidence that mining is strong. The production of energy, of alternative energy and the increase filtration, purification requirements of the environmentalist issues, those are monetary issues now to producers in economies. So I think overall, even if there is a modest decline, let's say, in GDP in some of the West, primarily the Western countries, that we'd still be able to post results that will lead us to our 2013 goals."

As we mentioned in the second quarter, our plan in the back half of the year was to very much focus on bringing our inventory levels down. We did build our inventory levels up to a point that we felt comfortable that we could take the so called pedal up the metal. So principally, in our media plants and our medical plants, on the Life Sciences side, we did see a lower level of production, and therefore, although sales are up, that's being underwritten to some extent by the inventory level at the end of the second quarter. We did bring inventory levels down in Life Sciences so we saw that there.

We appreciate your joining us on our third quarter conference call. I am here on this very sultry morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, the Corporate Controller. Now our first",1906,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us on our third quarter conference call. I am here on this very sultry morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, the Corporate Controller. Now our first 3 quarters have been strong and place us around the higher end of our earnings guidance for fiscal 2011. The company also continues to make progress towards its long-term performance goals to create further value for shareholders.
Today, we will update you on our business and then look forward to your questions.
There are a number of factors driving growth. Pall has an accomplished and capable management team with solid depth throughout the organization. Top and bottom line growth strategies had differentiated Pall from its competitors. We provide total fluid management and are now a well-respected systems engineering company, a business developed organically. We have positioned the company to capitalize on improving economic conditions and emerging market trends. We're continuing to execute these strategies to expand opportunities and improve performance.
A confluence of trends are supporting the business and setting the stage for future growth. Among them, improving economies, arising middle-class and developing regions, game-changing technologies in areas such as electronics and biotechnology and of course the economics of environmentalism and increasing regulation. All of these drive Pall's enabling technologies. It's clear that it's a good time to be a leader, and I want to quote from an annual report of Pall's from 1959: ""The existence and growth of Pall Corporation goes hand in hand with the requirements of modern technology."" Now that statement is as true today as it was prophetic more than half a century ago. Our business makes up real difference to industries, customers and society. Pall management employees look forward to continuing to build on the company's success.
With that, let's now get into the details for the quarter. Fiscal '11 sales have increased by double digits throughout the year. Third quarter sales grew 11% in local currency to about $710 million. Life Sciences was up 12%, and Industrial grew close to 10%. BioPharmaceuticals continues to deliver strong results, reflecting Pall's broadening presence throughout the biotech production process. Microelectronics still grew after last year's meteoric 78% sales increase. New Pall products to service the proliferation of semiconductor and consumer electronic products are driving forces.
Machinery & Equipment's healthy performance also continued. That group posted its fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Mining in particular remained strong.
Food and Beverage, Life Sciences, OEM, Commercial Aerospace and Energy sales all grew at or above 10%. You'll hear more about them as we go along. Now on a geographic basis, both Industrial and Life Sciences grew in all regions. The Western Hemisphere was strongest with sales increasing 14%. Europe again grew over 10% with Military Aerospace the only weak spot. Sales in Asia were up about 7% overall, but if we take Japan out, Asia sales grew about 11%.
China and India in particular did very well. Sales in Japan, which is our largest Asian market, were down about $700,000 or about 1%. Life Sciences grew despite the disaster as Pharmaceutical customers increased purchases and accelerated production schedules in anticipation of possible supply-chain disruptions and power outages. Pall's industrial markets in Japan were down 6% overall, largely driven by the semiconductor industry there. Our Microelectronics sales decreased 11% in Japan, though some of this was offset as other producers in different geographies revved up production.
We could continue to see business disruptions in Japan in the short-term. Longer-term opportunities with the third's largest economy in the world as they rebuild will improve our prospects. Total orders kept pace with sales, increasing 10%. Every major market but Energy & Water was solidly positive. We logged double-digit orders growth in Asia. Orders grew by double digits for the first time this year, and orders in the Western Hemisphere increased 6% compared to over 30% a year ago. Orders for consumables grew 6% compared to 21% last year when companies began restocking inventories as the economy began to recover. Our backlog of consumables and systems is up over 25%. Now bear in mind that this includes orders for both consumables and systems that will ship over time.
With that, let's look at the sales details, starting first with Industrial. Pall’s Industrial sales overall increased about 10%, and that's up 14% for the 9 months. Aeropower grew close to 11% in the third quarter. Energy & Water was up 10% with growth in all markets. Microelectronics grew almost 7% instead of the flattish result projected in response to the industry forecasts. Within Aeropower, Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the fifth quarter in a row. Q3 sales increased about 24%. And sales in the Western Hemisphere were up 65%, 15% up in Europe and slightly up in Asia. Global mining, as I mentioned before, remains in high gear both at the producer and at the OEM level. Investment in new mining equipment continues to signal ongoing confidence and future requirements for mining materials. Q3 orders were up 10% for the sixth quarter of double-digit growth in Machinery & Equipment. Aerospace sales were down 3% overall, while orders were up 45%. Commercial Aerospace grew about 13%, and this once again reflects restocking of inventories for airline support and modest demand as OEM production rates pick up for new airframes.
Military was down 16%, and this was primarily driven by Europe. Overall Military orders increased 66% there and have grown by double digits for the previous 3 quarters. Most of this order growth is coming from the U.S. Although the procurement process is taking longer, orders are coming through. As you may have seen, Pall recently received a large order we had been waiting for from the U.S. government. We booked a $14 million order for Centrisep systems for 59 of the army's CH-47 helicopters to protect these valuable assets in sandy environments. Shipments are slated to begin in December 2011 and to be completed by November 2012. Energy & Water sales increased 10% on solid performance from all submarkets. Within the Energy market, Fuels and Chemicals grew almost 10%, and Power Generation grew about 15%. The oil and gas market have been particularly strong with alternative energy, polymer and chemical contributing. There's some weakness in the refinery market, which has to cope with the decreased demand brought on by higher oil prices.
The Power Generation story has been the same all year: strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia for largely the same reasons. Water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of wind turbine markets particularly in China. Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied to industrial production. Orders in Energy were down almost 5% in the quarter. The comparable quarter last year contained a very large order for a $5 billion gas processing plant in Abu Dhabi. That was the price of the plant, not the order. Municipal Water sales increased 7% in the quarter, and sales growth was in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. Europe seems to be stabilizing, although public spending is still under pressure. Overall, the backlog in Municipal Water remains over $100 million totally.
Now Microelectronics. That group was up 18% for the year and almost 7% in the quarter. As I mentioned before, the industry has stayed stronger than predicted. Q3 orders increased over 8%, marking 6 consecutive quarters of orders growth. The growth continues to reflect high-capacity utilization rates at chip producers and demand for products like smartphones, tablet computers, solar cells and other advanced electronics, including LEDs. The LED market is an exciting emerging opportunity for Pall. These are semiconductor light sources with the manufacturing process similar to that used to make IC devices. And in fact, they're actually known as LED semiconductor chips. We're leveraging our expertise in filtration for the semiconductor market in applying it to production of LEDs. As you probably know, many countries, including the U.S., have passed measures to phase out incandescent light bulbs for general lighting. U.S. legislation specifies that general-purpose lighting must be at least 25% more efficient than incandescent bulbs. And that's good for the new technology that our technology is supporting.
Now let's go on to the Life Sciences. Overall, sales in Life Sciences increased about 12% in both the quarter and for the 9 months. In the third quarter, Medical grew 5%; Food and Beverage, 12% and BioPharm, 16%. Medical grew in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, which led with 10% growth. The Western Hemisphere growth was driven by balance strength in every submarket from the largest, blood, to the smallest, cell therapy. Western Hemisphere blood filter sales grew up to over 4% against the backdrop of declining blood collections. Hospital Critical Care grew 26% on increased Aquasafe water sales. And our Medical OEM business was up 19% in the Western Hemisphere and 12% globally. This is largely due to the addition of IV filters to drug infusion pumps to prevent air from being pumped into patients. A recent FDA draft guidance document recommends that manufacturers take measures to mitigate risks associated with the widely used pump equipment.
Sales in Food and Beverage were up 12%, marking 4 quarters of growth. Consumables sales increased 8% with all regions contributing but particularly in the Western Hemisphere. System sales increased 30%, with both results reflecting continuing recovery in the Food and Beverage market. Further proof is that Food and Beverage orders were up 13% in the quarter. As a side note, Pall scientists are currently assisting leading national authorities in Europe in their race to find the source of the deadly E. coli outbreak. On Tuesday, Senator Gillibrand in the U.S. introduced new meat safety regulations that calls for testing for a wider range of pathogens than currently required. One she specifically named as a leading cause of food-borne illness and death in the U.S. is non-O157 E. coli. Pall has a validated test to detect for this bacteria in meat.
And finally, last but not least, BioPharmaceuticals. BioPharm, which accounted for about 28% of total Pall sales in the quarter, is firing on all cylinders. Revenues increased 16% in the quarter and are up 18% for the year. Consumables sales increased almost 15%, and systems sales were up about 35%. Every region was strong, with Asia and Europe leading at 22% and 18% growth, respectively. Pharmaceuticals grew by 17%, and Lab had another good quarter with 11% growth. These results are the direct outcome of continuing execution of key growth strategies. These include total fluid management, providing customers with enabling technology to meet them -- meet their performance goals and adding the infrastructure for Pall to serve these customers around the world. Our efforts are paying off particularly as the biotech industry accounts for a much higher proportion of the overall market. Every one of the 6 top-selling drugs by 2014 is projected to be a biotech drug. Now that compares with just 2 biotech drugs in the top 6 only 3 years ago. Orders in BioPharmaceuticals increased 22%. Consumables orders were up 22%. And orders for systems increased 34%. So it's pretty clear we're closing in on a very strong year in BioPharm and for Pall overall. Overall, this is enormously gratifying for all of us. And now with that, let's hear from Lisa."
185333,133338291,135120,"Pall Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2011",2011-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the financial details, I'd like to start off with some more good news. As you may recall, in 2007, the company announced that it would restate its financial statements for the fiscal years 199",1919,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the financial details, I'd like to start off with some more good news. As you may recall, in 2007, the company announced that it would restate its financial statements for the fiscal years 1999 through 2006 for the under payment of income taxes, primarily in the United States. We reported last evening that late last month, the IRS concluded its audits of fiscal year 1999 through 2005. While we are still in the process of finalizing the impact of this to our financial position, I would like to highlight 3 key items. First, no penalties were assessed. Secondly, our current estimate is a reduction of net liabilities in the range of $20 million to $30 million, such benefits to be recognized in this year's fourth quarter. And this has no impact to the company. And thirdly, of the $127 million of additional unrecorded potential penalties that we've disclosed previously, we have now concluded that the likelihood of assessment of about $106 million of these penalties is remote. The balance primarily relates to some foreign matters.
So with that update, let's get to the financial review of the quarter and 9 months. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.1 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $69.7 million or $0.58 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined in the appendix slide were $0.72 compared to $0.58 per share, an increase of 24%. Net earnings in the 9 months were $218.1 million or $1.84 per share, and this compares to $186.3 million or $1.56 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share were $2.01 compared to $1.40 per share, an increase of 44%. The foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by about $0.04 in the quarter and $0.05 in the 9 months.
The sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the 9 months compared to the same periods in fiscal 2010. Foreign currency translation increased the top line by about $28 million or 4% in the quarter and by about $17 million or about 1% in 9 months. Local currency sales were up almost 11% in the quarter. Consumables sales increased about 9%, and systems sales were up over 29%, bringing system sales to just over 12% of total sales compared to 10.5% in the third quarter of 2010.
In the 9 months, local currency sales grew 13%, reflecting about a 12% increase in consumables and a 25% increase in system sales. Overall, pricing gains contributed approximately $3 million to the top line in the quarter and $10 million in the 9 months. Gross margins for the 9 months stand at 50.8%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, as an improvement in Industrial was partly offset by a decline in Life Sciences. Now this is down 50 basis points from the 6 months ended January as we saw gross margins dip in the third quarter. I'll provide the key drivers of these results by business in a moment.
SG&A was 29.5% of sales in the third quarter, down from 30.4% last year. And in the 9 months, SG&A came in at 30% compared to 32% last year. These improvements reflect top line leverage and tight cost controls on G&A spend while spending in other key areas is ramping up. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased about 8% in the quarter year-over-year and 7% in 9 months. Looking at the quarter, most of the increase reflects a ramp-up in spend on sales and marketing in 3 key areas: investments in emerging regions, variable flash performance related costs and marketing. In addition, we continue to see expense increases from our investments in our IT infrastructure, and corporate costs also reflect performance related cost, as well as certain governance-related items. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, R&D spending rose about 10% in the quarter and almost 14% in the 9 months. We expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year, and this reflects a planned ramp-up in investment for new products.
Turning to income taxes. The effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter was 35.1% and for the 9 months, 29.8%. This includes tax costs recorded in the quarter associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. This compares to an effective tax rate of 31.6% in the third quarter and 25.2% for the first 9 months of last year, which included the favorable resolution of a foreign tax audit. So excluding these items, the effective tax rate in the first 9 months reflects a sustainable reduction of 4 percentage points year-over-year. The reduction in the rate has contributed about $13 million or about $0.11 for the bottom line year-to-date. Including the cost of the establishment of the Asian headquarters as well as the benefit at the conclusion of the IRS audits I mentioned earlier, we expect the effective rate to be about 24% for fiscal year 2011.
The full year forecasted underlying rate of about 27% does not reflect these items, which we consider to be discrete. It does reflect the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters and puts us solidly on track to achieve our 2013 goal of 24% to 26%. The change in net interest expense in the third quarter and 9 months reflects that in fiscal year 2010, certain benefits were recorded related to the resolution of the foreign tax audits and expiring statutes of limitation. Including these items, net interest expense has been running about $250,000 higher per quarter this year, driven by slightly higher interest rates and debt levels. The 3 key items that I will comment on regarding sequential performance are revenues, gross margins and orders. Sales in the third quarter increased by $65 million or 10% sequentially. Almost 8% in local currency, 6% in base and 19% in systems. Life Sciences grew 10%, approximately 7.5% local currency. This was driven by 7% sequential growth in BioPharmaceuticals, 18% growth in Food and Beverage and 4% growth in Medical. Industrial also grew by almost 10% sequentially, about 7.5% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 13% in Aeropower, 5.5% in Microelectronics and 4% in Energy & Water. Compared to the second quarter, gross margins trended down. This reflects declines in both businesses relating to 3 key factors: manufacturing overhead absorption, unfavorable mix and some special charges for certain inventory and contract related items. Orders were up 7.5% sequentially, approximately 5% in local currency, bringing our backlog up 11% compared to the end of the second quarter, 9% up in base and 15% up in systems.
Now I'll provide some color on segment performance. Pall Industrial sales growth was about 10% in local currency, reflecting a 6% increase in consumables with all markets growing. System sales grew by 28%, Municipal Water and Machinery & Equipment sales were particularly strong. Systems represented about 16.7% of sales compared with about 14.5% last year. Pall Industrial's gross margin in the quarter decreased 120 basis points to 46.1%. And this principally reflects unfavorable mix. At the 9-month mark, gross margins improved 140 basis points to 46.9%, primarily driven by volume, cost savings, partly offset by unfavorable mix. Industrial SG&A grew by 9% in local currency, reflecting increased spend of about 13% in sales and marketing costs and, in particular, spend for our European and Asian headquarters. Operating margins were 14.8% in the quarter compared to about 15.7% a year ago. This reflects the decline in gross margin I mentioned earlier. At the 9-month mark, operating margins were 15.2%, a 370 basis point improvement over last year. So overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in Pall Industrial.
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew almost 12% in the quarter. Consumables sales increased over 10%, with all markets contributing. Consumables growth in Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory was particularly strong. Systems grew about 32% with Pharmaceutical sales system sales up about 35% and Food and Beverage system sales up 30%. System sales represented 8% of sales compared to 6.7% of sales last year. Now despite continued manufacturing efficiencies and pricing improvements, Life Sciences gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 53.3%. This was impacted by certain inventory-related charges. We also had lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output. Together, these items reduced gross margins by about 300 basis points. Cost savings and the benefit of pricing partly offset. Life Sciences SG&A increased 4.5% in local currency in the quarter, again driven by increases in sales and marketing cost. G&A cost reductions were offset by Life Sciences share of the increased spend on IT. At the 9-month mark, SG&A as a percentage of sales in Life Sciences was 26.1%, a 200 basis point improvement over last year. Now operating margins came in at 24.2%, a 100 basis point improvement. And at the 9-month mark, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.2%.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the 9 months was $281 million, an increase of about $24 million or 9% compared to the 9 months of fiscal year 2010. This does reflect continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory improving by 9 days. However, the improvement in working capital in 2010 was higher as the improvement in the cash conversion cycle versus 2009 was more pronounced. Significant uses of cash during the 9 months included $122 million return to shareholders with dividends of $57 million and stock repurchases of $65 million buying close to 1.3 million shares. This leaves approximately $288 million of our current authorization, $103 million in capital spending and $154 million in repayments of debt net of new borrowings.
We expect full year operating cash flow in the range of $435 million to $450 million. The capital spending is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. Wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position stood at $491 million at April 30, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010, reflecting the strong generation of cash in the U.S. this year.
Our results through April put us at the high end of our 2011 expectation. We expect local currency sales for the year to be up high-single to low-double-digits with similar rates of growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial likely on the higher end of this range. We also expect operating margins for the year to be at the higher end of the range at 17.5% to 18.5% with gross margins for the year at the high end of our range of 50% to 51%. This reflects continued benefit from pricing and manufacturing efficiencies. We do expect gross margins in the fourth quarter to improve compared to the third quarter due to the unusual items in the third quarter. We expect -- we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be less than 30%.
In closing, fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be another good year for Pall. Based on our results at the 9-month mark, our expectations for the fourth quarter and with foreign exchange at current rates a tailwind, we expect to come in around the high end of our pro forma EPS range of $2.80 to $2.90 for fiscal 2011. And thank you for attention this morning. With that, I will this hand this back to Eric."

Principally, the negative mix in the quarter related to a surge in system sales. System sales were up significantly in the quarter both year-over-year as well as sequentially, coming in for the quarter at over 12% of our total sales. In addition, particularly in Pall Industrial, we saw some negative mix with the growth in Aerospace and Power Gen. For instance, we're at the beginning of the wind turbine market and given it's at the beginning and it's growing quite well but the margins right now are not so strong on that. So that's what we saw in the quarter. As we look at the balance of the year, we continue to expect some mix pressure, although as I said, we do expect the fourth quarter gross margins to bounce back from the third quarter because we don't expect to see the unusual charges that we took in the third quarter. I won't comment on fiscal year 2012, and I will wait to comment on that with our fourth quarter earnings call."

Those are major drivers for our business. And we also, with our Blood business continue to grow. And a lot of that growth both in BioPharm and in Medical is in the emerging regions. Now that's the thing we also see on the Industrial side, very large growth in the areas that we've invested in infrastructure in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East, North Africa and in Southeast Asia. The Industrial markets overall, we think, of course, that our mix is so varied that we have confidence that mining is strong. The production of energy, of alternative energy and the increased filtration, purification requirements of the environmentalist issues, those are monetary issues now to producers in economies. So I think overall, even if there is a modest decline, let's say, in GDP in some of the West, probably primarily the Western countries, that we'd still be able to post results that will lead us to our 2013 goals."

As we mentioned in the second quarter, our plan in the back half of the year was to very much focus on bringing our inventory levels down. We did build our inventory levels up to a point that we felt comfortable that we could take the so-called pedal up the metal. So principally, in our media plants and our medical plants, on the Life Sciences side, we did see a lower level of production, and therefore, although sales are up, that's being underwritten to some extent by the inventory level at the end of the second quarter. We did bring inventory levels down in Life Sciences, so we saw that there. And although inventory levels are slightly up compared to the second quarter, in the context of the overall volume level, as you're pointing out, our days in inventory have reduced pretty significantly against the second quarter.

I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 2001 overall was a decent year. Life Sci",2450,"Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 2001 overall was a decent year. Life Sciences turned in another excellent performance. Pall Industrial faced challenges in the fourth quarter of the year. This morning, we'll provide exposition of the factors that despite achieving targeted top line growth, Pall Industrial profit below our expectation. Along with that, we will outline actions that were taken to address those decisions. We'll also talk about what we saw as we exited the year and current outlook for fiscal 2012 and of course, there will be ample time for your questions. 
We're not going to make excuses for the disappointing finish to the year. We will keep some perspective. To paraphrase in English aphorism, one swallowed does not a summer make and for Pall, one quarter does not a trend make. The hard work we have done is solid results over time and the company is well-positioned to capitalize on tomorrow's opportunities and continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth. 
Now let's start with overall fiscal 2011. Sales grew double digits in both Life Sciences and Pall Industrial and all of our markets group. While the earnings per share we achieved were not what they wanted, they are 32% better than a year ago. This quarter's results showed there are still some bumps in the road, but they are basically either discrete, onetime issues or correctable. Now this is my 68th earnings call, earnings cycle, as you know, it is also my last call. I'll be retiring shortly as CEO. Our management transition is well underway and I'm confident that our next CEO, Larry Kingsley, will build on our solid foundation and strong culture to take Pall Corporation to ever greater heights. 
So now, let's turn to the business. Life Sciences, which represents just over half of sales and 63% of segment operating profit, had a good year. Sales increased 11% and operating margin rose to 24%, achieving a 34% incremental margin year-over-year. BioPharmaceuticals, the largest and most profitable piece of Life Sciences, grew about 16%. Medical sales increased 5% and Food & Beverage was up 10%. Industrial also had strong top line growth of 11% and good performance from all markets. Microelectronic sales increased over 14%, Aerospace grew 11% and Energy & Water, the largest of the Industrial markets, was up almost 9%. Pall Industrial's operating profit, while less than we expected, increased 19% over fiscal '10. It's clear we still have work to do and Lisa will discuss this in more detail later. 
Now going to the fourth quarter, sales came in at $780 million and this is up 15% over last year on an as-reported basis and 6% in local currency. Life Science sales grew by 8% and Industrial moderated to turn 5% growth. Sales in the Western Hemisphere increased 2%, after 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. and Europe posted its third consecutive quarter of 10% plus growth. Asia grew about 6%, a better measure for that is to exclude Japan, and then we see Asian sales increasing 14%. Q4 orders were up 1% compared to 19% a year ago. Orders in Life Sciences increased about 1.5% and Industrial orders were flat, reflecting 29% growth of systems, offset by a 5% decline in consumables. Almost all submarkets showed a decline in consumable orders, with the exception of M&A within Industrial. 
So what's happening with orders? On the full Industrial side of the business, we are seeing signs of contraction in Microelectronics. In the Western Hemisphere, OEM activity, a leading indicator for this industry, slowed. We also saw slowing in Asia. Microelectronics orders in August continue to be down. We believe some of the slowing in orders, particularly in the more lumpy Energy & Water markets, is due to timing. Some is to comparison to the prior period. This is the case with Aerospace where orders are flat in Military compared to last year's 41% increase. In August, we saw Military orders almost doubled compared to August of last year. 
Now looking at Life Sciences. Pharmaceutical consumables orders grew by mid-single digits after double-digit growth all year. Systems were down in the quarter and this is the lumpy part of BioPharmaceuticals' business. Lab orders were also down high-single digits. In August, BioPharmaceuticals orders rebounded to double-digit growth, actually 45% and order growth in Food & Beverage was driven by systems in the quarter, and this continued into August. Now both consumables and systems orders were up in August. 
Clearly, we are in a period of economic uncertainty that is unlikely to drive some customer behavior. We have all seen this movie before and I believe that this has impacted our Q4 orders but by how much, it's hard to say. Many of our customers across markets are now carrying less inventory, perhaps a lesson in the last financial crisis. Assuming customer production levels keep up, full consumable orders should continued to flow. We started fiscal '12 with a backlog of over $800 million, which is up almost 15% from the prior year end. Not all of these will shift in fiscal '12, but it is a very good place to start the year. 
Now let's look at the markets within specific an eye toward specific trend and issues that we factored into our fiscal year '12 performance a starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, representing a quarter of total Pall Corporation sales, grew over 9% in the quarter. Sales, which were derived from both classical Pharmaceuticals and biologicals markets, outpaced annual growth rates in the biotech market. 3/4 of BioPharm sales are now derived from the filtration intensive biologicals markets, that is biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives. Consumable sales grew almost 12% in the fourth quarter. Biofilters and single-used technology did particularly well and all regions grew, led by Europe. These results reflect our broadening presence on a growing number of biotech drugs and vaccines that are now in full production. They also reflect increasing adoption of single-use technologies and a strong new Pall product pipeline. 
We have good reason to believe fiscal '12 will be another sound year for biopharmaceuticals with growth in the high single-digit range. That said, economic uncertainty may hamper customers' capital and investment plans, which would likely impact system sales while consumables are tied more closely to drug production. 
Medical grew almost 5% in the quarter and this growth reflects impact of adoption of new products. Approximately a quarter of Medical sales in the year came from products introduced within the last 5 years such as our [indiscernible] filters, [indiscernible] and our AquaSafe water filters. We expect Medical fiscal '12's performance be in the low single digits. 
Food & Beverage grew 10% in the quarter with all regions up. Pall is now phasing market growth by helping producers economically realize their quality and yield targets. New products and applications for emerging regions have been driving growth. Q4 orders grew 10% driven by systems and the backlog here is up 37% over fiscal '11. The strong order rate is carried over into the early days of fiscal '12. August, in fact, was over 30%. The fact that system sales remain strong is encouraging to us. So based on what we see today, Food & Beverage sales could be up mid-single digits in 2012. 
Now switch gear for a review of Pall Industrial. Energy & Water accounts for about 20% of Pall's 2011 sales and is composed of 3 submarkets: Fuels & Chemicals, the largest system market Power Generation and musical water. These markets combined grew 7% in the quarter and almost 9% for the year. They share common imperatives for high yield protecting customer infrastructure and leading increasingly stringent environmental rates. They are also the most capital intensive parts of Pall's business. Fuels & Chemicals services are the backbone industry's oil and gas production refining, alternative energy and chemical production and customers in these industries are investing aggressively to increase output. This is particularly the case in the oil and gas industry in the Middle East and in other developing regions. 
In the context of this CapEx boom, Fuels & Chemicals had a record fourth quarter, outpacing expectations, largely in system sales and capital goods. Sales were $105 million, 1/3 of the year's revenues on broad market and geographic strength. Sales were up 27% for the quarter and full year sales increased 8%. In addition to the $105 million shipments in the quarter that I mentioned, systems orders were strong in the quarter. Capital equipment is sold at lower margins, [indiscernible] the effectiveness can have in the fourth quarter when gross margins were pulled down by higher-than-forecast demand for capital goods later in the fiscal year. 
When we talk about capital goods in this context, we're not just referring to systems. In general, capital goods are also metal housings and [indiscernible] hardware that hold or support filters. Gross margins for this product range from 20% to 30% and we shipped a great deal of housing from the fourth quarter with enough of them in the 20% or lower gross margin range to hurt performance. [indiscernible] generally do bring with then a long-term consumables stream and we see capital equipment margins as an opportunity for operational improvement. Lisa will discuss these in more detail in a minute. 
So depending upon the applications, housing can be several feet in diameter, more than 15 feet tall and weigh more than a ton. A good news is that they are packed with filters, some can hold more than 100 filter elements that ultimately all need to be replaced. Like systems, they do create long-term annuity potential. Large housings can generate $1 million to $2 million in annuity sales and Pall's average gross margin once the equipment is operational. This is the silver line to the high volume of capital goods shipped in the quarter. 
Switching briefly to Power Generation, sales were down 2% in the quarter, up 10% for the year. This is generally among the most resilient of the Industrial markets. There are 2 caveats we factored into our outlook of low-single digit growth for 2012. If Industrial production worldwide contracts, so will demand for power. We've also factored in the low sales due to the fact that Japan, which derives 30% of its power from nuclear reactors, has taken many of those offline. This has an immediate and potentially longer term effects as new nuclear projects understandably where we see closer scrutiny. 
Now overall, the Energy backlog exceeds $200 million, not all of this is shippable this year. This is more so than the 23% increase over fiscal '11's order backlog. Our forecast for the year for Energy overall is for mid-single digit growth. This assumes strong demand in emerging markets such as [indiscernible] and Brazil. 
Now let's focus on the $120 million Municipal Water business. A market with a high longer-term growth potential. Fourth quarter sales were down 20%, largely on shipment timing but increased 8% for the year. This is almost an entirely systems business and the volume is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. The backlog now exceeds $100 million, which is almost last year's sales. 60% of this businesses in the U.S. where large portion of sales are driven by regulations and funded through cash flows from ratepayers rather than taxpayers. And in our experience, U.S. orders usually come through even when the economy is flagging. Uniwater sells have been softer in Europe throughout the year and I think we can attribute much of this to sovereign debt and general financial concerns. Project activity is accelerating in Asia, we received almost 20 million in orders in Asia in the second half of the year, that came too late to ship in fiscal year '11. So as things now stand, we're expecting mid-single digit sales growth from Municipal Water in fiscal '12. 
Now going on to Aeropower, which accounts for 17% which accounts for 17% of total Pall sales and is composed of Machinery & Equipment and Aerospace markets, these, combined, grew slightly in the quarter and 11% in the year. This is another area where we saw growth in low-margin capital goods. Machinery & Equipment, which represents more than half of Aeropower, grew up 17% for the year. Sales were flat in the quarter, after 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Q4 orders for consumables were strong, and increased about 11%, making 7 straight quarters of solid orders growth. Mining, still a locomotive production, has been driving sales growth and the mining industry is expected to remain strong in calendar 2012 while some of the other submarkets may cool off. We have decided to exit the market for filtration for onboard passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks. Now this will represent about $8 million in low-margin business in 2012. 
We estimate a growth of mid-single digit for the Machinery & Equipment markets in '12. Aerospace, a combination of commercial and military, grew slightly in the quarter and 5% for the year. Commercial Aerospace represents half of the business, and then drove the growth. We're expecting a strong 2012 from aerospace, driven by military sales and high-single digit growth. And despite concerns surrounding severe but our budget does particularly in the United States, we entered 2012 for the $100 million Military backlog. This is the equivalent of our total military sales in '11 and the backlog is up 36% over last year. This includes $14 million in orders for the U.S. Military [indiscernible] 47 helicopter fleet that is scheduled to ship starting in December. We are not expecting any of the potential major program cancellations in 2012 out of the U.S. budget to affect Pall significantly. The total backlog for Aeropower now is over $200 million. 
And finally, Microelectronics. MicroE grew almost 5% and full year sales increased, as I said before, 14%. Orders contracted in the quarter for the first time in 6, despite the ubiquity of semiconductor chips and consumer electronics, this market is extremely sensitive to changes in the economy. Some of these market remain bullish while others, including Pall, have a more cautious outlook. The most recent external data on fab utilization shows a declining rate and we are expecting volatility in this market this year. Our outlook for Microelectronics sales expect that they will be flat to down mid-single digit. Regardless of what happens in the short-term, the electronics industry remains the engine of modern society and it runs on high-tech sophisticated filters. 
Now so with that, Lisa will provide her financial report, including more granularity on the current outlook for fiscal '12."
185333,139987561,167824,"Pall Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 15, 2011",2011-09-15,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results and will then move on to a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and year and conclude with our current expectations for fiscal year 20",2270,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results and will then move on to a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and year and conclude with our current expectations for fiscal year 2012. So let's start with the profit issues in Pall Industrial. While sales growth of 5% in the quarter came in at about our expectations, mix was different than forecast. Why? Fuels & Chemicals and Aeropower sales contain lower-margin capital goods, including both systems and housing, which outperformed in volume but underperformed in profit. Looking year-over-year, systems and capital goods sales and Pall Industrial grew by over 20% or about $25 million. Taken together, these comprise over 40% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to about 35% in last year's fourth quarter. Moreover, as Eric mentioned earlier, the gross margins of these incremental sales were 20% or less. The combination of negative mix and suboptimal gross margins were a headwind of about $10 million or 270 basis points compared to last year. 
Now Pall Industrial's profitability profile can be lumpy with the timing of systems and capital goods. This is the nature of much of that business. That said, we won't sugar coat it. There's a sloppy execution on several fronts, including contract execution, pricing and forecast of capital timing. We are taking measures to improve margins on capital goods and the annuity pull-through. This includes improving our contract-risk assessment, pricing and costing review and approval processes to enhance governance and transparency. It also includes exiting from certain low-margin product lines, such as the example that Eric cite earlier. 
Unfavorable absorption from the lower production level were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency, driven mainly from Asia but also in the Eurozone. Margin degradation was also related to the 3 key operational performance challenges. First, inflation eroding continues improvements cost savings; second, excess cost for the closure of our plant in Ireland and transfer of manufacturing lines to a sister plant; and lastly, suboptimal processes at several plants, resulting in write-off to such things as scrap and obsolescence. 
Now the excess plant closure costs and write-offs are not expected to be recurring items. Inflation of oil-based commodities we used in our manufacturing processes such as resins, plastics and steel is a reality. Our continuous improvement initiatives are geared up to offset inflationary pressure just as we did in the full year of fiscal 2011. 
Industrial SG&A grew by $10.6 million or 12% in local currency in the quarter and this exceeded spend expectations by about 4%. Sales and marketing-related expenses were up 18.5%, reflecting second half additions of sales related personnel of approximately 8%, principally in emerging markets as we've seen in the third quarter. Increases in the variable compensation and selling-related activities also contributed to the dollar increase year-over-year and exceeded forecasts. These items are expected to remunerate in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations for a different sales mix and activity level, as well as measures we are taking to bring them in. G&A was up about 3.5%, including some additional spends for the ramp up of Pall Industrial's European supply chain consolidation into our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore. 
SG&A, as a percentage of sales in the quarter, was 27.4% compared with 25.3% last year. For the full year, SG&A increased 8% in local currency and as a percentage of sales, was 28.8%, a 90-basis point improvement over last year. To improve Pall Industrial's profit leverage, we are implementing several restructuring initiatives in fiscal year 2012. While these initiatives are expected to be dilutive to fiscal 2012 net earnings, the ROI estimates are compelling. We will discuss them in more detail as we move through the year. What I will mention now is the restructuring of the sales and marketing management of Aeropower and Energy & Water. This will result in cost savings by rationalizing the structure globally and enhance contract administration in these capital-incentive sectors. 
To wrap up, Pall Industrial's operating margins were 13.4% in the quarter compared to about 20.4% a year ago. This reflects a decline of operating profit of $18 million or 26%. We are disappointed with this result and are taking the measures I describe to bring about timely improvement. 
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew 8% in the quarter. Consumable sales increased almost 8% with BioPharmaceuticals leading with 11% growth. Systems grew over 11%. Food and Beverage system sales were up over 32%, while Pharmaceutical system sales declined almost 10% and system sales represented 11.1% of sales compared to 10.8% of sales last year. Life Sciences gross margins increased 150 basis points to 53.4%. And this primarily reflects the benefit of exchange rates from foreign currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the Eurozone and improved pricing. This was offset by lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output as inventory levels continue to be adjusted, as well as the inflationary pressure I mentioned a moment ago and my remarks about Pall Industrial. SG&A increased $7.5 million or 8.5% in local currency in the fourth quarter and consistent with Pall Industrial are investments in sales and marketing under [indiscernible] increase with a 6% increase in customer-phasing employees in the quarter, primarily in emerging markets, as well as marketing expenses and inflation. G&A was up 3.5% and SG&A as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 26.2% compared with 26% last year. And for the full year SG&A was up 6%, excluding FX and as a percentage of sales was 26.2%, down from 27.5% last year. Operating profit came in at $92 million or 24% increased. And operating margin came in at 23.3%, a 130-basis point improvement. 
Now looking at total Pall Corporation for both the quarter and year, sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the year compared to the same periods in fiscal 2010. In local currency sales were up 6% in the quarter and 11% for the year. [indiscernible] impact [indiscernible] was a benefit of about $60 million and $76 million in the quarter and the year, respectively. Overall pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and $14 million in the year, namely in Life Sciences. Gross margins for the year came in at 50.1%, down 10 basis points year-over-year as the slight improvement in Life Sciences was offset by the decline in Industrial. Excluding FX, overall SG&A expenses increased about 10% in the quarter and 7% for the year. And as I've mentioned earlier, almost all of the increase in SG&A was driven by the business segment selling-related spending I discussed a moment ago. This year also reflects increased investments in our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore, as well as our IT infrastructure. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the year declined to 29.7% compared to 30.8% in 2010. 
Now excluding foreign exchange, R&D spending rose 20% in the quarter and 15% in the year, reflecting increased spending in both Life Sciences and Industrial as we allocate more capital to investment in core technology innovation. R&D was 3.2% of sales in both the quarter and the year, on par with the same period last year. Excluding the benefits of FX, the company's operating profits were down by 11% in the quarter but up approximately 15% for the year. 
Turning now to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as-reported rate was 10.3% for the quarter and 24.8% for the year. This reflects the benefit of the resolution of the U.S. tax audit mentioned in our release last night, partly offset by tax cost related to repatriation of foreign earnings. This year also includes tax cost associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying rate of 26.7% for fiscal year 2011 reflects the achievement of a sustainable reduction of about 4% year-over-year. The reduction in the rate has contributed almost $19 million or about $0.16 to the bottom line last year. This is attributable to the slight change reorganization in Europe within Life Sciences. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $97.4 million or $0.82 per share compared to $55 million or $0.46 per share last year and pro forma EPS, as defined in the Appendix to the Slides, were $0.76 compared to $0.72 per share, an increase of about 6%. And this was propelled by the benefit from foreign currency translation of about $0.08 and the reduction in tax cost. Net earnings in the year were $315.5 million or $2.67 per share compared to $241.2 million or $2.03 per share last year. Pro forma EPS was $2.77 compared to $2.12 a year ago, an increase of almost 31%. Foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.13 in the year. 
Now looking for a moment at our performance in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, sales in the fourth quarter increased by almost $71 million or 10% sequentially and local currency sales grew about 8%, 3% base and 48% in systems. Life Sciences grew 7%, 5% in local currency. This was driven by 20% sequential growth in Food & Beverage and 6% in Medical. Q4 sales in BioPharmaceuticals were flat compared to a strong third quarter. Industrial sales grew over 13% sequentially, 12% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 25% in Energy & Water, 4% in Microelectronics and 3% in Aeropower. Compared to quarter 3, overall gross margins were down and this reflect a decline in Industrial segment of 290 basis point, relating to the items I covered earlier. And SG&A sequentially increased 5% or about $10 million and this is the 5% is in local currency. This largely reflects increases in variable based compensation and sales-related activities in both business just. G&A sequentially remains flat.  Overall, company operating profit was about 4%, reflecting a sequential decline in corporate expenses while both businesses were up about 2.5% to 3%. 
Turning now to cash flow, operating cash flow in the year was $430 million, an increase of $52 million or 14% compared to fiscal year 2010. This was driven by increased earnings and continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory. Significant uses of cash during the year included $161 million in capital spending, $89 million in net repayments of debt, and $228 million return to shareholders with dividends of $78 million and stock repurchases of $150 million and this leaves approximately $200 million of our current authorization. 
Now wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position for the $558 million at July 31 and our net debt-to-net plus equity was 9.1%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
Now looking at 2012, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-single digits in both businesses. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% positive to revenue. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single digit growth for Medical, high-single digit growth in BioPharmaceutical and mid-single digit growth in Food and Beverage. In Industrial, we expect Energy, Water and Machinery & Equipment to grow by mid-single digits and aerospace to deliver high-single digit growth, driven by Military spending, largely as Eric mentioned, already in backlog. Finally, our current thinking backlog on Microelectronics is flat to down 5%. 
Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51.25% and EBIT margins in the range of 17% to 18.5%. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2012 is approximately 24.5%, reflecting incremental benefit of the headquarters in Switzerland, as well as the impact going live in our Singapore headquarters last month. Our current organizational changes are likely to generate restructuring and other charges of between $30 million to $40 million, most of which will be cash items. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.32. And this contemplates a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, a stock buyback of approximately $150 million accretive to earnings by about $0.03 to $0.04 and finally, the benefit of our reduction in tax rate of approximately $0.10. 
Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $490 million to $540 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and laboratory. 
That concludes my report. Before handing this back to Eric, I want to make it clear that the company remains strong and we already begun addressing the events that impacted our fourth quarter earnings. The main issues in the quarter related to Industrial and has to do with mix, profitability of capital goods and SG&A spending levels. Pall Life Sciences again, performed well. To reiterate some key points from our action plans, we're enhancing internal transparency around the timing of capital goods, we're taking measures to improve margins on capital goods, as well as attendant annuity pull-through and finally, we're preparing to take significant costs out of the organization. Looking forward, we are well-positioned to navigate a turbulent economy as we've done before and are focused on achieving our 24 goals. 
As I turn the call over to Eric for one final time, I would like to take a moment to express on behalf of all Pall Corporation employees, our appreciation for everything he has done for the company and over a long and distinguished career. It has been a rewarding experience to work alongside of him these past 5 years for me. Eric, well miss you and we wish you well."

Thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 2001 overall was a decent year. Life Sciences turned in another excellent performance. Pall Industrial faced challenges in the fourth quarter of the year. This morning, we'll provide an exposition of the factors that despite achieving targeted top line growth combined to place Pall Industrial profit below our expectation. Along with that, we will outline actions that were taken to address those issues. We'll also talk about what we saw as we exited the year and the current outlook for fiscal 2012 and, of course, there will be ample time for your questions. 
We're not going to make excuses for the disappointing finish to the year. We will keep some perspective. To paraphrase in English aphorism, one swallow does not a summer make, and for Pall, one quarter does not a trend make. The hard work we have done has produced solid results over time, and the company is well positioned to capitalize on tomorrow's opportunities and continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth.   
Now let's start with overall fiscal 2011. Sales grew by double digits in both Life Sciences and Pall Industrial, as all of our markets grew. While the earnings per share we achieved were not what we wanted, they are 32% better than a year ago. This quarter's results show there are still some bumps in the road, but they are basically either discrete, onetime issues or correctable. Now this is my 68th earnings call, earnings cycle. As you know, it is also my last call. I'll be retiring shortly as CEO. Our management transition is well underway, and I'm confident that our next CEO, Larry Kingsley, will build on our solid foundation and strong culture to take Pall Corporation to ever greater heights. 
So now, let's turn to the business. Life Sciences, which represents just over half of sales and 63% of segment operating profit, had a good year. Sales increased 11%, and operating margin rose to 24%, achieving a 34% incremental margin year-over-year. BioPharmaceuticals, the largest and most profitable piece of Life Sciences, grew about 16%. Medical sales increased 5%, and Food & Beverage was up 10%. Industrial also had strong top line growth of 11% and good performance from all markets. Microelectronic sales increased over 14%. Aerospace sales grew 11%. And Energy & Water, the largest of the Industrial markets, was up almost 9%. Pall Industrial's operating profit, while less than we expected, increased 19% over fiscal '10. It's clear we still have work to do, and Lisa will discuss this in more detail later. 
Now going to the fourth quarter, sales came in at $780 million, and this is up 15% over last year on an as-reported basis and 6% in local currency. Life Science sales grew by 8%, and Industrial moderated to turn at 5% growth. Sales in the Western Hemisphere increased 2% after 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, and Europe posted its third consecutive quarter of 10%-plus growth. Asia grew about 6%, a better measure for that is to exclude Japan, and then we see Asian sales increasing 14%. Q4 orders were up 1% compared to 19% a year ago. Orders in Life Sciences increased about 1.5%, and Industrial orders were flat, reflecting 29% growth in systems offset by a 5% decline in consumables. Almost all submarkets showed a decline in consumable orders with the exception of M&A within Industrial. 
So what's happening with orders? On the full Industrial side of the business, we are seeing signs of contraction in Microelectronics. In the Western Hemisphere, OEM activity, a leading indicator for this industry, slowed. We also saw a slowing in Asia. Microelectronics orders in August continue to be down. We believe some of the slowing in orders, particularly in the more lumpy Energy & Water markets, is due to timing, some is the comparison to the prior period. This is the case with Aerospace where orders were flat in Military compared to last year's 41% increase. In August, we saw our Military orders almost doubled compared to August of last year. 
Now looking at Life Sciences. Pharmaceutical consumables orders grew by mid-single digits after double-digit growth all year. Systems were down in the quarter, and this is the lumpy part of BioPharmaceuticals' business. Lab orders were also down high-single digits. In August, BioPharmaceuticals orders rebounded to double-digit growth, actually 45%. And order growth at Food & Beverage was driven by systems in the quarter, and this continued into August. Now both consumables and systems orders were up in August. 
Clearly, we are in a period of economic uncertainty that is unlikely -- is likely to drive some cautious customer behavior. We have all seen this movie before, and I believe that this has impacted our Q4 orders but by how much, it's hard to say. Many of our customers across markets are now carrying less inventory, perhaps a lesson from the last financial crisis. Assuming customer production levels keep up, full consumable orders should continue to flow. We started fiscal '12 with a backlog of over $800 million, which is up almost 15% from the prior year end. Not all of this will shift in fiscal '12, but it is a very good place to start the year. 
Now let's look at the markets with an eye toward specific trends or issues that we factored into our fiscal year '12 performance, starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, representing a quarter of total Pall Corporation sales, grew over 9% in the quarter. Sales, which are derived from both classic Pharmaceuticals and the biologicals markets, outpaced annual growth rates in the biotech market. 3/4 of BioPharm sales are now derived from the filtration intensive biologicals markets, that is biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives. Consumable sales grew almost 12% in the fourth quarter. Biofilters and single-used technology did particularly well, and all regions grew, led by Europe. These results reflect our broadening presence on a growing number of biotech drugs and vaccines that are now in full production. They also reflect increasing adoption of single-use technologies and a strong new Pall product pipeline. 
We have good reason to believe fiscal '12 will be another sound year for BioPharmaceuticals with growth in the high single-digit range. That said, economic uncertainty may hamper customers' capital investment plan, which would likely impact system sales while consumables are tied more closely to drug production. 
Medical grew almost 5% in the quarter, and this growth reflects the impact of adoption of new products. Approximately 1/4 of Medical sales for the year came from products introduced within the last 5 years, such as the RC2D blood filters, Acrodose and our Aquasafe water filters. We expect Medical fiscal '12 performance to be in the low single digits. 
Food & Beverage grew 10% in the quarter with all regions up. Pall is now pacing market growth by helping producers economically realize their quality and yield targets. New products and applications for emerging regions have been driving growth. Q4 orders grew 10%, driven by systems; and the backlog here is up 37% over fiscal '11. A strong order rate is carried over into the early days of fiscal '12; August, in fact, was over 30%. The fact that system sales remained strong is encouraging to us. So based on what we see today, Food & Beverage sales could be up mid-single digits in 2012. 
Now switch gears for a review of Pall Industrial. Energy & Water accounts for about 20% of Pall's 2011 sales and is composed of 3 submarkets: Fuels & Chemicals, the largest system market Power Generation and Municipal Water. These markets combined grew 7% in the quarter and almost 9% for the year. They share common imperatives for high yield, protecting customer infrastructure and leading increasingly stringent environmental rigs. They're also the most capital intensive parts of Pall's business. 
Fuels & Chemicals services are the backbone industries of oil and gas production refining, alternative energy and chemical production. And customers in these industries are investing aggressively to increase output. This is particularly the case in the oil and gas industry in the Middle East and in other developing regions. 
In the context of this CapEx boom, Fuels & Chemicals had a record fourth quarter, outpacing expectations, largely in system sales and capital goods. Sales were $105 million, 1/3 of the year's revenues on broad market and geographic strength. Sales were up 27% for the quarter, and full year sales increased 8%. In addition to the $105 million shipments in the quarter that I mentioned, systems orders were strong in the quarter. Capital equipment is sold at lower margins, still the effectiveness can have in the fourth quarter when gross margins were pulled down by higher-than-forecast demand for capital goods later in the fiscal year. 
When we talk about capital goods in this context, we're not just referring to systems. In general, capital goods are also metal housings and a pertinent hardware that hold or support filters. Gross margins for this product typically range from 20% to 30%. And we shipped a great deal of housing from the fourth quarter with enough of them in the 20% or lower gross margin range to hurt performance. How these generally do bring with them a long-term consumables stream, and we see capital equipment margins as an opportunity for operational improvement. Lisa will -- can discuss this in more detail in a minute. 
So depending upon the application, housings can be several feet in diameter, more than 15 feet tall and weigh more than a ton. A good news is that they are packed with filters, some can hold more than 100 filter elements that ultimately all need to be replaced. Like systems, they do create long-term annuity potential. Large housings can generate $1 million to $2 million in annuity sales at Pall's average gross margins once the equipment is operational. This is the silver lining to the high volume of capital goods shipped in the quarter. 
Switching briefly to Power Generation, sales were down 2% in the quarter, up 10% for the year. This is generally among the most resilient of the Industrial markets. There are 2 caveats we factored into our outlook of low-single digit growth for 2012. If Industrial production worldwide contracts, so will demand for power. We've also factored in lost sales due to the fact that Japan, which derives 30% of its power from nuclear reactors, has taken many of those offline. This has an immediate and potentially longer-term effect as new nuclear projects understandably where we see a closer scrutiny. 
Now overall, the Energy backlog exceeds $200 million, not all of this is shippable this year. This is more than a 23% increase over fiscal '11's order backlog. Our forecast for the year for Energy overall is for mid-single digit growth. This assumes strong demand in emerging markets such as MENA and Brazil. 
Now let's focus on the $120 million Municipal Water business, a market with high longer-term growth potential. Fourth quarter sales were down 20%, largely on shipment timing but increased 8% for the year. This is almost an entirely systems business, and the volume is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. The backlog now exceeds $100 million, which is almost last year's sales. 60% of this business is in the U.S. where a large portion of sales are driven by regulations and funded through cash flows from tax payers -- from rate payers rather than tax payers. And in our experience, U.S. orders usually come through even when the economy is flagging. Muni Water sells have been softer in Europe throughout the year, and I think we can attribute much of this to sovereign debt and general financial concerns. Project activity is accelerating in Asia. We received almost 20 million in orders in Asia in the second half of the year that came too late to ship in fiscal year '11. So as things now stand, we're expecting mid-single digit sales growth from Municipal Water in fiscal '12. 
Now going on to Aeropower, which accounts for 17% of total Pall sales and is composed of Machinery & Equipment and Aerospace markets. These, combined, grew slightly in the quarter and 11% in the year. This is another area where we saw a growth in low-margin capital goods. Machinery & Equipment, which represents more than half of Aeropower, grew up 17% for the year. Sales were flat in the quarter after 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Q4 orders for consumables were strong, increased about 11%, making 7 straight quarters of solid orders growth. Mining, steel and automotive production have been driving sales growth. And the mining industry is expected to remain strong in calendar '12 while some of the other submarkets may cool off. We have decided to exit the market for filtration for onboard passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks. Now this will represent about $8 million in low-margin business in 2012. 
We estimate a growth of mid-single digit for the Machinery & Equipment markets in '12. Aerospace, a combination of commercial and military, grew slightly in the quarter and 5% for the year. Commercial Aerospace represents half of the business that drove -- and that drove the growth. We're expecting a strong 2012 from Aerospace, driven by military sales and high-single digit growth. And despite concerns surrounding severe military budget cuts, particularly in the United States, we entered 2012 for the $100 million military backlog. This is the equivalent of our total military sales in '11, and the backlog is up 36% over last year. This includes $14 million in orders for the U.S. Army CH-47 helicopter fleet that is scheduled to ship starting in December. We are not expecting any of the potential major program cancellations in 2012 out of the U.S. budget to affect Pall significantly. The total backlog for Aeropower now is over $200 million. 
And finally, Microelectronics. MicroE grew almost 5%, and full year sales increased, as I said before, 14%. Orders contracted in the quarter for the first time in 6. Despite the ubiquity of semiconductor chips and consumer electronics, this market is extremely sensitive to changes in the economy. Some in this market remain bullish while others, including Pall, have a more cautious outlook. The most recent external data on fab utilization shows a declining rate, and we are expecting volatility in this market this year. Our outlook for Microelectronics sales expect they will be flat to down mid-single digit. Regardless of what happens in the short term, the electronics industry remains the engine of modern society, and it runs on high-tech sophisticated filters. 
Now so with that, Lisa will provide her financial report, including more granularity on the current outlook for fiscal '12."

So let's start with the profit issues in Pall Industrial. While sales growth of 5% in the quarter came in at about our expectations, mix was different than forecast. Why? Fuels & Chemicals and Aeropower sales contained lower-margin capital goods, including both systems and housing, which outperformed in volume but underperformed in profit. Looking year-over-year, systems and capital goods sales and Pall Industrial grew by over 20% or about $25 million. Taken together, these comprised over 40% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to about 35% in last year's fourth quarter. Moreover, as Eric mentioned earlier, the gross margins of these incremental sales were 20% or less. The combination of negative mix and suboptimal gross margins were a headwind of about $10 million or 270 basis points compared to last year. 
Now Pall Industrial's profitability profile can be lumpy with the timing of systems and capital goods. This is the nature of much of that business. That said, we won't sugarcoat it, the sloppy execution on several fronts, including contract execution, pricing and forecast of capital timing. We are taking measures to improve margins on capital goods and the annuity pull-through. This includes improving our contract risk assessment, pricing and costing review and approval processes to enhance governance and transparency. It also includes exiting from certain low-margin product lines, such as the example that Eric cited earlier. 
Unfavorable absorption from lower production levels were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency, driven mainly from Asia but also in the Eurozone. Margin degradation was also related to 3 key operational performance challenges: first, inflation eroding continuous improvement cost savings; second, excess cost for the closure of our plant in Ireland and transfer of manufacturing lines to a sister plant; and lastly, suboptimal processes at several plants, resulting in write-off to such things as scrap and obsolescence. 
Now the excess plant closure costs and write-offs are not expected to be recurring items. Inflation of oil-based commodities we used in our manufacturing processes such as resins, plastics and steel is a reality. Our continuous improvement initiatives are geared up to offset inflationary pressure, just as we did in the full year of fiscal 2011. 
Industrial SG&A grew by $10.6 million or 12% in local currency in the quarter, and this exceeded spend expectations by about 4%. Sales and marketing-related expenses were up 18.5%, reflecting second half additions of sales-related personnel of approximately 8%, principally in emerging markets as we've seen in the third quarter. Increases in the variable compensation and selling-related activities also contributed to the dollar increase year-over-year and exceeded forecasts. These items are expected to remunerate in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations for a different sales mix and activity level, as well as measures we are taking to bring them in. G&A was up about 3.5%, including some additional spends for the ramp-up of Pall Industrial's European and Asian supply chain consolidation into our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore. 
SG&A, as a percentage of sales in the quarter, was 27.4% compared with 25.3% last year. For the full year, SG&A increased 8% in local currency and as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a 90-basis point improvement over last year. To improve Pall Industrial's profit leverage, we are implementing several restructuring initiatives in fiscal year 2012. While these initiatives are expected to be dilutive to fiscal 2012 net earnings, the ROI estimates are compelling. We will discuss them in more detail as we move through the year. What I will mention now is the restructuring of the sales and marketing management of Aeropower and Energy & Water. This will result in cost savings by rationalizing the structure globally and enhance contract administration in these capital-intensive sectors. 
To wrap up, Pall Industrial's operating margins were 13.4% in the quarter compared to about 20.4% a year ago. This reflects a decline in operating profit of $18 million or 26%. We are disappointed with this result and are taking the measures I described to bring about timely improvement. 
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew 8% in the quarter. Consumable sales increased almost 8% with BioPharmaceuticals leading with 11% growth. Systems grew over 11%. Food and Beverage system sales were up over 32%, while Pharmaceutical system sales declined almost 10%. And system sales represented 11.1% of sales, compared to 10.8% of sales last year. Life Sciences gross margins increased 150 basis points to 53.4%. And this primarily reflects the benefit of exchange rates from foreign currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the Eurozone and improved pricing. This was offset by lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output as inventory levels continue to be adjusted, as well as the inflationary pressure I mentioned a moment ago and my remarks about Pall Industrial. SG&A increased $7.5 million or 8.5% in local currency in the fourth quarter. And consistent with Pall Industrial, investments in sales and marketing underlie the increase, with a 6% increase in customer-facing employees in the quarter, primarily in emerging markets, as well as marketing expenses and inflation. G&A was up 3.5%. And SG&A, as a percentage of sales in the quarter, was 26.2% compared with 26% last year. And for the full year, SG&A was up 6%, excluding FX, and as a percentage of sales was 26.2%, down from 27.5% last year. Operating profit came in at $92 million for a 24% increase. And operating margin came in at 23.3%, a 130-basis point improvement. 
Now looking at total Pall Corporation for both the quarter and year, sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the year compared to the same periods in fiscal 2010. And local currency sales were up 6% in the quarter and 11% for the year. The dollar impact of FX [ph] was a benefit of about $60 million and $76 million in the quarter and the year, respectively. Overall pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and $14 million in the year, namely in Life Sciences. Gross margins for the year came in at 50.1%, down 10 basis points year-over-year, as the slight improvement in Life Sciences was offset by the decline in Industrial. Excluding FX, overall SG&A expenses increased about 10% in the quarter and 7% for the year. And as I've mentioned earlier, almost all of the increase in SG&A was driven by the business segment selling-related spending I discussed a moment ago. This year also reflects increased costs related to investments in our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore, as well as our IT infrastructure. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the year declined to 29.7% compared to 30.8% in 2010. 
Now excluding foreign exchange, R&D spending rose 20% in the quarter and 15% in the year, reflecting increased spending in both Life Sciences and Industrial as we allocate more capital to investment in core technology innovation. R&D was 3.2% of sales in both the quarter and the year, on par with the same period last year. Excluding the benefits of FX, the company's operating profits were down by 11% in the quarter but up approximately 15% for the year. 
Turning now to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as-reported rate was 10.3% for the quarter and 24.8% for the year. This reflects the benefit of the resolution of the U.S. tax audit mentioned in our release last night, partly offset by tax costs related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. This year also includes tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying rate of 26.7% for fiscal year 2011 reflects the achievement of a sustainable reduction of about 4% year-over-year. The reduction in the rate has contributed almost $19 million or about $0.16 to the bottom line last year. This is attributable to the supply chain reorganization in Europe within Life Sciences. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $97.4 million or $0.82 per share, compared to $55 million or $0.46 per share last year. And pro forma EPS, as defined in the appendix to the slides, were $0.76 compared to $0.72 per share, an increase of about 6%. And this was propelled by the benefit from foreign currency translation of about $0.08 and the reduction in tax cost. Net earnings in the year were $315.5 million or $2.67 per share compared to $241.2 million or $2.03 per share last year. Pro forma EPS was $2.77 compared to $2.12 a year ago, an increase of almost 31%. Foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.13 in the year. 
Now looking for a moment at our performance in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, sales in the fourth quarter increased by almost $71 million or 10% sequentially. And local currency sales grew about 8%, 3% in base and 48% in systems. Life Sciences grew 7%, 5% in local currency. This was driven by 20% sequential growth in Food & Beverage, and 6% in Medical. Q4 sales in BioPharmaceuticals were flat compared to a strong third quarter. Industrial sales grew over 13% sequentially, 12% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 25% in Energy & Water, 4% in Microelectronics and 3% in Aeropower. Compared to quarter 3, overall gross margins were down, and this reflect a decline in the Industrial segment of 290 basis points relating to the items I covered earlier. And SG&A sequentially increased 5% or about $10 million and this is -- the 5% is in local currency. This largely reflects increases in variable-based compensation and sales-related activities in both businesses. G&A sequentially remains flat. Overall, company operating profit was about 4%, reflecting a sequential decline in corporate expenses, while both businesses were up about 2.5% to 3%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year was $430 million, an increase of $52 million or 14% compared to fiscal year 2010. This was driven by increased earnings and continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory. Significant uses of cash during the year included $161 million in capital spending, $89 million in net repayments of debt and $228 million return to shareholders with dividends of $78 million and stock repurchases of $150 million, and this leaves approximately $200 million of our current authorization. 
Now wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position for the $558 million at July 31 and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9.1%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
Now looking at 2012, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-single digits in both businesses. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% positive to revenue. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single digit growth for Medical, high-single digit growth in BioPharmaceutical and mid-single digit growth in Food and Beverage. In Industrial, we expect Energy, Water and Machinery & Equipment to grow by mid-single digits and Aerospace to deliver high-single digit growth, driven by military spending largely, as Eric mentioned, already in backlog. Finally, our current thinking on Microelectronics is flat to down 5%. 
Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51.25%, and EBIT margins in the range of 17% to 18.5%. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2012 is approximately 24.5%, reflecting incremental benefit of the headquarters in Switzerland, as well as the impact of going live in our Singapore headquarters last month. Our current organizational changes are likely to generate restructuring and other charges of between $30 million to $40 million, most of which will be cash items. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.32. And this contemplates a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, a stock buyback of approximately $150 million accretive to earnings by about $0.03 to $0.04 and finally, the benefit of our reduction in tax rate of approximately $0.10. 
Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $490 million to $540 million. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and laboratory. 
That concludes my report. Before handing this back to Eric, I want to make it clear that the company remains strong, and we already begun addressing the events that impacted our fourth quarter earnings. The main issues in the quarter related to Industrial and had to do with mix, profitability of capital goods and SG&A spending levels, Pall Life Sciences again, performed well. To reiterate some key points from our action plans, we're enhancing internal transparency around the timing of capital goods. We're taking measures to improve margins on capital goods as well as the attendant annuity pull-through. And finally, we're preparing to take significant costs out of the organization. Looking forward, we are well positioned to navigate a turbulent economy as we've done before and are focused on achieving our 24 goals. 
As I turn the call over to Eric for one final time, I would like to take a moment to express on behalf of all Pall Corporation's employees, our appreciation for everything he has done for the company and over a long and distinguished career. It has been a rewarding experience to work alongside of him these past 5 years for me. Eric, we'll miss you, and we wish you well."

I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer, and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. Now 2001 overall was a decent year. Life",2464,"Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer, and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. Now 2001 overall was a decent year. Life Sciences turned in another excellent performance. Pall Industrial faced challenges in the fourth quarter of the year. This morning, we'll provide an exposition of the factors that, despite achieving targeted top line growth, combined to place Pall Industrial profit below our expectation. Along with that, we will outline actions that were taken to address those issues. We'll also talk about what we saw as we exited the year and the current outlook for fiscal 2012.  And, of course, there will be ample time for your questions. 
We're not going to make excuses for the disappointing finish to the year. We will keep some perspective. To paraphrase an English aphorism, one swallow does not a summer make, and for Pall, one quarter does not a trend make. The hard work we have done has produced solid results over time, and the company is well positioned to capitalize on tomorrow's opportunities and continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth.   
Now let's start with overall fiscal 2011. Sales grew by double digits in both Life Sciences and Pall Industrial, as all of our markets grew. While the earnings per share we achieved were not what we wanted, they are 32% better than a year ago. This quarter's results show there are still some bumps in the road, but they are basically either discrete, onetime issues or correctable. Now this is my 68th earnings call, earnings cycle. As you know, it is also my last call. I'll be retiring shortly as CEO. Our management transition is well under way, and I'm confident that our next CEO, Larry Kingsley, will build on our solid foundation and strong culture to take Pall Corporation to ever-greater heights. 
So now, let's turn to the business. Life Sciences, which represents just over half of sales and 63% of segment operating profit, had a good year. Sales increased 11%, and operating margin rose to 24%, achieving a 34% incremental margin year-over-year. BioPharmaceuticals, the largest and most profitable piece of Life Sciences, grew about 16%. Medical sales increased 5%, and Food & Beverage was up 10%. Industrial also had strong top line growth of 11% on good performance from all markets. Microelectronic sales increased over 14%. Aerospace sales grew 11%. And Energy & Water, the largest of the Industrial markets, was up almost 9%. Pall Industrial's operating profit, while less than we expected, increased 19% over fiscal '10. It's clear we still have work to do, and Lisa will discuss this in more detail later. 
Now going to the fourth quarter, sales came in at $780 million, and this is up 15% over last year on an as-reported basis and 6% in local currency. Life Science sales grew by 8%, and Industrial moderated to turn at 5% growth. Sales in the Western Hemisphere increased 2% after 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, and Europe posted its third consecutive quarter of 10%-plus growth. Asia grew about 6%.  A better measure for that is to exclude Japan, and then we see Asian sales increasing 14%. Q4 orders were up 1% compared to 19% a year ago. Orders in Life Sciences increased about 1.5%, and Industrial orders were flat, reflecting 29% growth in systems, offset by a 5% decline in consumables. Almost all submarkets showed a decline in consumable orders, with the exception of M&A within Industrial. 
So what's happening with orders? On the full Industrial side of the business, we are seeing signs of contraction in Microelectronics. In the Western Hemisphere, OEM activity, a leading indicator for this industry, slowed. We also saw a slowing in Asia. Microelectronics orders in August continued to be down. We believe some of the slowing in orders, particularly in the more lumpy Energy & Water markets, is due to timing.  Some is the comparison to the prior period. This is the case with Aerospace, where orders were flat in Military compared to last year's 41% increase. In August, we saw Military orders almost double compared to August of last year. 
Now looking at Life Sciences. Pharmaceutical consumables orders grew by mid-single-digits after double-digit growth all year. Systems were down in the quarter, and this is the lumpy part of BioPharmaceuticals' business. Lab orders were also down high single-digits. In August, BioPharmaceuticals orders rebounded to double-digit growth, actually 45%, and order growth at Food & Beverage was driven by systems in the quarter, and this continued into August. Both consumables and systems orders were up in August. 
Clearly, we are in a period of economic uncertainty that is unlikely -- is likely to drive some cautious customer behavior. We have all seen this movie before, and I believe that this has impacted our Q4 orders, but by how much, it's hard to say. Many of our customers across markets are now carrying less inventory, perhaps a lesson from the last financial crisis. Assuming customer production levels keep up, full consumable orders should continue to flow. We started fiscal '12 with a backlog of over $800 million, which is up almost 15% from the prior year end. Not all of this will shift in fiscal '12, but it is a very good place to start the year. 
Now let's look at the markets with an eye toward specific trends or issues that we factored into our fiscal year '12 performance, starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, representing a quarter of total Pall Corporation sales, grew over 9% in the quarter. Sales, which are derived from both classic Pharmaceuticals and the biologicals markets, outpaced annual growth rates in the biotech market. 3/4 of BioPharm sales are now derived from the filtration-intensive biologicals markets, that is biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives. Consumable sales grew almost 12% in the fourth quarter. Biofilters and single-use technology did particularly well, and all regions grew, led by Europe. These results reflect our broadening presence on a growing number of biotech drugs and vaccines that are now in full production. They also reflect increasing adoption of single-use technologies and a strong new Pall product pipeline. 
We have good reason to believe fiscal '12 will be another sound year for BioPharmaceuticals, with growth in the high single-digit range. That said, economic uncertainty may hamper customers' capital investment plans, which would likely impact system sales, while consumables are tied more closely to drug production. 
Medical grew almost 5% in the quarter, and this growth reflects the impact of adoption of new products. Approximately 1/4 of Medical sales for the year came from products introduced within the last 5 years, such as the RC2D blood filters, Acrodose and our Aquasafe water filters. We expect Medical fiscal '12 performance to be in the low single-digits. 
Food & Beverage grew 10% in the quarter with all regions up. Pall is now pacing market growth by helping producers economically realize their quality and yield targets. New products and applications for emerging regions have been driving growth. Q4 orders grew 10%, driven by systems, and the backlog here is up 37% over fiscal '11. A strong order rate is carried over into the early days of fiscal '12.  August, in fact, was over 30%. The fact that system sales remained strong is encouraging to us. So based on what we see today, Food & Beverage sales could be up mid-single-digits in 2012. 
Now to switch gears for a review of Pall Industrial. Energy & Water accounts for about 20% of Pall's 2011 sales and is composed of 3 submarkets: Fuels & Chemicals, the largest; the sister market, Power Generation; and Municipal Water. These markets combined grew 7% in the quarter and almost 9% for the year. They share common imperatives for high yield, protecting customer infrastructure and leading increasingly stringent environmental rigs. They're also the most capital-intensive parts of Pall's business. 
Fuels & Chemicals serves as a backbone industries of oil and gas production refining, alternative energy and chemical production. And customers in these industries are investing aggressively to increase output. This is particularly the case in the oil and gas industry in the Middle East and in other developing regions. 
In the context of this CapEx boom, Fuels & Chemicals had a record fourth quarter, outpacing expectations, largely in system sales and capital goods. Sales were $105 million, 1/3 of the year's revenues on broad market and geographic strength. Sales were up 27% for the quarter, and full year sales increased 8%. In addition to the $105 million of shipments in the quarter that I mentioned, systems orders were strong in the quarter. Capital equipment is sold at lower margins.  We saw the effect that this can have in the fourth quarter, when gross margins were pulled down by higher-than-forecast demand for capital goods later in the fiscal year. 
When we talk about capital goods in this context, we're not just referring to systems. In general, capital goods are also metal housings and a pertinent hardware that hold or support filters. Gross margins for this product typically range from 20% to 30%. And we shipped a great deal of housing from the fourth quarter, with enough of them in the 20%-or-lower gross margin range to hurt performance. Housings generally do bring with them a long-term consumables stream, and we see capital equipment margins as an opportunity for operational improvement. Lisa will, again, discuss this in more detail in a minute. 
So depending upon the application, housings can be several feet in diameter, more than 15 feet tall and weigh more than a ton. A good news is that they are packed with filters.  Some can hold more than 100 filter elements that ultimately all need to be replaced. Like systems, they do create long-term annuity potential. Large housings can generate $1 million to $2 million in annuity sales at Pall's average gross margins once the equipment is operational. This is the silver lining to the high volume of capital goods shipped in the quarter. 
Switching briefly to Power Generation, sales were down 2% in the quarter, up 10% for the year. This is generally among the most resilient of the Industrial markets. There are 2 caveats that we factored into our outlook of low single-digit growth for 2012. If Industrial production worldwide contracts, so will demand for power. We've also factored in lost sales due to the fact that Japan, which derives 30% of its power from nuclear reactors, has taken many of those offline. This has an immediate and potentially longer-term effect as new nuclear projects, understandably, will receive closer scrutiny. 
Now overall, the Energy backlog exceeds $200 million.  Not all of this is shippable this year. This is more, though, than a 23% increase over fiscal '11's order backlog. Our forecast for the year for Energy overall is for mid-single-digit growth. This assumes strong demand in emerging markets, such as MENA and Brazil. 
Now let's focus on the $120 million Municipal Water business, a market with high longer-term growth potential. Fourth quarter sales were down 20%, largely on shipment timing, but increased 8% for the year. This is almost an entirely systems business, and the volume is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. The backlog now exceeds $100 million, which is almost last year's sales. 60% of this business is in the U.S., where a large portion of sales are driven by regulations and funded through cash flows from taxpayers -- from rate-payers rather than taxpayers. And in our experience, U.S. orders usually come through, even when the economy is flagging. Muni Water sells have been softer in Europe throughout the year, and I think we can attribute much of this to sovereign debt and general financial concerns. Project activity is accelerating in Asia. We received almost $20 million in orders in Asia in the second half of the year that came too late to ship in fiscal year '11. So as things now stand, we're expecting mid-single-digit sales growth from Municipal Water in fiscal '12. 
Now going on to Aeropower, which accounts for 17% of total Pall sales and is composed of Machinery & Equipment and Aerospace markets. These combined grew slightly in the quarter and 11% in the year. This is another area where we saw a growth in low-margin capital goods. Machinery & Equipment, which represents more than half of Aeropower, grew up 17% for the year. Sales were flat in the quarter after 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Q4 orders for consumables were strong.  They increased about 11%, making 7 straight quarters of solid orders growth. Mining, steel and automotive production have been driving sales growth. And the mining industry is expected to remain strong in calendar '12 while some of the other submarkets may cool off. We have decided to exit the market for filtration for onboard passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks. Now this will represent about $8 million in low-margin business in 2012. 
We estimate a growth of mid-single-digits for the Machinery & Equipment markets in '12. Aerospace, a combination of commercial and military, grew slightly in the quarter and 5% for the year. Commercial Aerospace represents half of the business that drove -- and that drove the growth. We're expecting a strong 2012 from Aerospace, driven by military sales and high-single-digit growth. And despite concerns surrounding severe military budget cuts, particularly in the United States, we enter 2012 with a $100 million military backlog. This is the equivalent of our total military sales in '11, and the backlog is up 36% over last year. This includes $14 million in orders for the U.S. Army CH-47 helicopter fleet that is scheduled to ship starting in December. We are not expecting any of the potential major program cancellations in 2012 out of the U.S. budget to affect Pall significantly. The total backlog for Aeropower now is over $200 million. 
And finally, Microelectronics. MicroE grew almost 5%, and full year sales increased, as I said before, 14%. Orders contracted in the quarter for the first time in 6. Despite the ubiquity of semiconductor chips and consumer electronics, this market is extremely sensitive to changes in the economy. Some in this market remain bullish, while others, including Pall, have a more cautious outlook. The most recent external data on fab utilization shows a declining rate, and we are expecting volatility in this market this year. Our outlook for Microelectronics sales is that they will be flat to down middle single-digits. Regardless of what happens in the short term, the electronics industry remains the engine of modern society, and it runs on high-tech sophisticated filters. 
Now so with that, Lisa will provide her financial report, including more granularity on the current outlook for fiscal '12."
185333,139987561,167944,"Pall Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 15, 2011",2011-09-15,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results and will then move on to a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and year and conclude with our current expectations for fiscal year 20",2273,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results and will then move on to a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and year and conclude with our current expectations for fiscal year 2012. 
So let's start with the profit issues in Pall Industrial. While sales growth of 5% in the quarter came in at about our expectations, mix was different than forecast. Why? Fuels & Chemicals and Aeropower sales contained lower-margin capital goods, including both systems and housings, which outperformed in volume but underperformed in profit. Looking year-over-year, systems and capital goods sales in Pall Industrial grew by over 20%, or about $25 million. Taken together, these comprised over 40% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to about 35% in last year's fourth quarter. Moreover, as Eric mentioned earlier, the gross margins of these incremental sales were 20% or less. The combination of negative mix and suboptimal gross margins were a headwind of about $10 million, or 270 basis points compared to last year. 
Now Pall Industrial's profitability profile can be lumpy with the timing of systems and capital goods. This is the nature of much of that business. That said, we won't sugarcoat it, this was sloppy execution on several fronts, including contract execution, pricing and forecast of capital timing. We are taking measures to improve margins on capital goods and the annuity pull-through. This includes improving our contract risk assessment, pricing and costing review and approval processes to enhance governance and transparency. It also includes exiting from certain low-margin product lines, such as the example that Eric cited earlier. 
Unfavorable absorption from lower production levels were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency, driven mainly from Asia but also in the eurozone. Margin degradation was also related to 3 key operational performance challenges: first, inflation eroding continuous improvement cost savings; second, excess cost for the closure of our plant in Ireland and transfer of manufacturing lines to a sister plant; and lastly, suboptimal processes at several plants, resulting in write-off to such things as scrap and obsolescence. 
Now the excess plant closure costs and write-offs are not expected to be recurring items. Inflation of oil-based commodities we use in our manufacturing processes such as resins, plastics and steel is a reality. Our continuous improvement initiatives are geared up to offset inflationary pressure, just as we did in the full year of fiscal 2011. 
Industrial SG&A grew by $10.6 million, or 12% in local currency, in the quarter, and this exceeded spend expectations by about 4%. Sales and marketing-related expenses were up 18.5%, reflecting second half additions of sales-related personnel of approximately 8%, principally in emerging markets, as we've seen in the third quarter. Increases in the variable compensation and selling-related activities also contributed to the dollar increase year-over-year and exceeded forecasts. These items are expected to remunerate in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations for a different sales mix and activity level as well as measures we are taking to rein them in. G&A was up about 3.5%, including some additional spends for the ramp-up of Pall Industrial's European and Asian supply chain consolidation into our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 27.4% compared with 25.3% last year. For the full year, SG&A increased 8% in local currency and as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a 90-basis-point improvement over last year. To improve Pall Industrial's profit leverage, we are implementing several restructuring initiatives in fiscal year 2012. While these initiatives are expected to be dilutive to fiscal 2012 net earnings, the ROI estimates are compelling. We will discuss them in more detail as we move through the year. One I will mention now is the restructure of the sales and marketing management of Aeropower and Energy & Water. This will result in cost savings by rationalizing the structure globally and enhance contract administration in these capital-intensive sectors. 
To wrap up, Pall Industrial's operating margins were 13.4% in the quarter compared to about 20.4% a year ago. This reflects a decline in operating profit of $18 million, or 26%. We are disappointed with this result and are taking the measures I described to bring about timely improvement. 
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew 8% in the quarter. Consumable sales increased almost 8%, with BioPharmaceuticals leading with 11% growth. Systems grew over 11%. Food and Beverage system sales were up over 32%, while Pharmaceutical system sales declined almost 10%. And system sales represented 11.1% of sales compared to 10.8% of sales last year. Life Sciences gross margins increased 150 basis points to 53.4%. And this primarily reflects the benefit of exchange rates from foreign-currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the eurozone, and improved pricing. This was offset by lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output as inventory levels continued to be adjusted as well as the inflationary pressure I mentioned a moment ago in my remarks about Pall Industrial. SG&A increased $7.5 million, or 8.5% in local currency, in the fourth quarter. And consistent with Pall Industrial, investments in sales and marketing underlie the increase, with a 6% increase in customer-facing employees in the quarter, primarily in emerging markets, as well as marketing expenses and inflation. G&A was up 3.5%. And SG&A as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 26.2% compared with 26% last year. And for the full year, SG&A was up 6% excluding FX and as a percentage of sales was 26.2%, down from 27.5% last year. Operating profit came in at $92 million for a 24% increase. And operating margin came in at 23.3%, a 130-basis-point improvement. 
Now looking at total Pall Corporation for both the quarter and year, sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the year compared to the same periods in fiscal 2010. In local currency, sales were up 6% in the quarter and 11% for the year. The dollar impact of FX [ph] was a benefit of about $60 million and $76 million in the quarter and the year, respectively. Overall pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and $14 million in the year, namely in Life Sciences. Gross margins for the year came in at 50.1%, down 10 basis points year-over-year as the slight improvement in Life Sciences was offset by the decline in Industrial. Excluding FX, overall SG&A expenses increased about 10% in the quarter and 7% for the year. And as I've mentioned earlier, almost all of the increase in SG&A was driven by the business segment selling-related spending I discussed a moment ago. This year also reflects increased costs related to investments in our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore as well as our IT infrastructure. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the year declined to 29.7% compared to 30.8% in 2010. 
Now excluding foreign exchange, R&D spending rose 20% in the quarter and 15% in the year, reflecting increased spending in both Life Sciences and Industrial as we allocate more capital to investment in core technology innovation. R&D was 3.2% of sales in both the quarter and the year, on par with the same period last year. Excluding the benefits of FX, the company's operating profits were down by 11% in the quarter but up approximately 15% for the year. 
Turning now to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or as-reported rate, was 10.3% for the quarter and 24.8% for the year. This reflects the benefit of the resolution of the U.S. tax audit mentioned in our release last night, partly offset by tax costs related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. This year also includes tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying rate of 26.7% for fiscal year 2011 reflects the achievement of a sustainable reduction of about 4% year-over-year. The reduction in the rate has contributed almost $19 million, or about $0.16, to the bottom line last year. This is attributable to the supply chain reorganization in Europe within Life Sciences. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $97.4 million, or $0.82 per share, compared to $55 million, or $0.46 per share, last year. And pro forma EPS as defined in the appendix to the slides were $0.76 compared to $0.72 per share, an increase of about 6%. And this was propelled by the benefit from foreign currency translation of about $0.08 and the reduction in tax cost. Net earnings in the year were $315.5 million, or $2.67 per share, compared to $241.2 million, or $2.03 per share, last year. Pro forma EPS was $2.77 compared to $2.12 a year ago, an increase of almost 31%. Foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.13 in the year. 
Now looking for a moment at our performance in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, sales in the fourth quarter increased by almost $71 million, or 10% sequentially. And local currency sales grew about 8%, 3% in base and 48% in systems. Life Sciences grew 7%, 5% in local currency. This was driven by 20% sequential growth in Food & Beverage and 6% in Medical. Q4 sales in BioPharmaceuticals were flat compared to a strong third quarter. Industrial sales grew over 13% sequentially, 12% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 25% in Energy & Water, 4% in Microelectronics and 3% in Aeropower. Compared to quarter 3, overall gross margins were down, and this reflects a decline in the Industrial segment of 290 basis points relating to the items I covered earlier. And SG&A sequentially increased 5%, or about $10 million, and this is -- the 5% is in local currency. This largely reflects increases in variable-based compensation and sales-related activities in both businesses. G&A sequentially remains flat. Overall, company operating profit was about 4%, reflecting a sequential decline in corporate expenses, while both businesses were up about 2.5% to 3%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year was $430 million, an increase of $52 million, or 14%, compared to fiscal year 2010. This was driven by increased earnings and continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory. Significant uses of cash during the year included $161 million in capital spending, $89 million in net repayments of debt and $228 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $78 million and stock repurchases of $150 million, and this leaves approximately $200 million of our current authorization. 
Now wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position for the $558 million at July 31 and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9.1%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
Now looking at 2012, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-single digits in both businesses. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% positive to revenue. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single-digit growth for Medical, high-single-digit growth in BioPharmaceutical and mid-single-digit growth in Food and Beverage. In Industrial, we expect Energy, Water and Machinery & Equipment to grow by mid-single-digits and Aerospace to deliver high-single-digit growth, driven by military spending, largely, as Eric mentioned, already in backlog. Finally, our current thinking on Microelectronics is flat to down 5%. 
Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51.25%, and EBIT margins in the range of 17% to 18.5%. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2012 is approximately 24.5%, reflecting incremental benefit of the headquarters in Switzerland as well as the impact of going live in our Singapore headquarters last month. Our current organizational changes are likely to generate restructuring and other charges of between $30 million to $40 million, most of which will be cash items. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.32. And this contemplates a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, a stock buyback of approximately $150 million accretive to earnings by about $0.03 to $0.04 and finally, the benefit of our reduction in tax rate of approximately $0.10. 
Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $490 million to $540 million. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and laboratory. 
That concludes my report. Before handing this back to Eric, I want to make it clear that the company remains strong, and we already begun addressing the events that impacted our fourth quarter earnings. The main issues in the quarter related to Industrial and had to do with mix, profitability of capital goods and SG&A spending levels.  Pall Life Sciences again performed well. To reiterate some key points from our action plans, we're enhancing internal transparency around the timing of capital goods. We're taking measures to improve margins on capital goods as well as the attendant annuity pull-through. And finally, we're preparing to take significant costs out of the organization. Looking forward, we are well positioned to navigate a turbulent economy, as we've done before, and are focused on achieving our 24 goals. 
As I turn the call over to Eric for one final time, I would like to take a moment to express on behalf of all Pall Corporation's employees our appreciation for everything he has done for the company and over a long and distinguished career. It has been a rewarding experience to work alongside of him these past 5 years for me. Eric, we'll miss you, and we wish you well."

Fortunately, I leave with everything. Thank you. And we've covered a lot of ground this morning and appreciate your patience. In closing, I want to say that it has been an honor and a privilege to nurture Pall from a $700 million enterprise to its current size and stature. I've also enjoyed meeting with so many of you as CEO and sharing our plans and progress over 17 years. Larry Kingsley takes over as CEO and President on October 3. The transition is going to plan, and our Board of Directors deserves a great deal of credit for what will be a very smooth management succession process.

Unlike our large systems, capital goods ship fairly quickly, and so you don't necessarily get on top of it. We are enhancing our systems both to -- as we did with the systems business, if you recall, as we got better at it, we developed ways to improve margins. We had to create 500- or 600-basis point improvements on our systems business over a 2-year period of time, and, in fact, we're going to apply that same rigor into capital goods now that it’s become a more significant mover and certainly one that surprised us with its volatility and its ability to affect this fiscal year."

I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer, and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. Now 2001 overall was a decent year. Life",2464,"Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer, and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. Now 2001 overall was a decent year. Life Sciences turned in another excellent performance. Pall Industrial faced challenges in the fourth quarter of the year. This morning, we'll provide an exposition of the factors that, despite achieving targeted top line growth, combined to place Pall Industrial profit below our expectation. Along with that, we will outline actions that were taken to address those issues. We'll also talk about what we saw as we exited the year and the current outlook for fiscal 2012.  And, of course, there will be ample time for your questions. 
We're not going to make excuses for the disappointing finish to the year. We will keep some perspective. To paraphrase an English aphorism, one swallow does not a summer make, and for Pall, one quarter does not a trend make. The hard work we have done has produced solid results over time, and the company is well positioned to capitalize on tomorrow's opportunities and continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth.   
Now let's start with overall fiscal 2011. Sales grew by double digits in both Life Sciences and Pall Industrial, as all of our markets grew. While the earnings per share we achieved were not what we wanted, they are 32% better than a year ago. This quarter's results show there are still some bumps in the road, but they are basically either discrete, onetime issues or correctable. Now this is my 68th earnings call, earnings cycle. As you know, it is also my last call. I'll be retiring shortly as CEO. Our management transition is well under way, and I'm confident that our next CEO, Larry Kingsley, will build on our solid foundation and strong culture to take Pall Corporation to ever-greater heights. 
So now, let's turn to the business. Life Sciences, which represents just over half of sales and 63% of segment operating profit, had a good year. Sales increased 11%, and operating margin rose to 24%, achieving a 34% incremental margin year-over-year. BioPharmaceuticals, the largest and most profitable piece of Life Sciences, grew about 16%. Medical sales increased 5%, and Food & Beverage was up 10%. Industrial also had strong top line growth of 11% on good performance from all markets. Microelectronic sales increased over 14%. Aerospace sales grew 11%. And Energy & Water, the largest of the Industrial markets, was up almost 9%. Pall Industrial's operating profit, while less than we expected, increased 19% over fiscal '10. It's clear we still have work to do, and Lisa will discuss this in more detail later. 
Now going to the fourth quarter, sales came in at $780 million, and this is up 15% over last year on an as-reported basis and 6% in local currency. Life Science sales grew by 8%, and Industrial moderated to turn at 5% growth. Sales in the Western Hemisphere increased 2% after 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, and Europe posted its third consecutive quarter of 10%-plus growth. Asia grew about 6%.  A better measure for that is to exclude Japan, and then we see Asian sales increasing 14%. Q4 orders were up 1% compared to 19% a year ago. Orders in Life Sciences increased about 1.5%, and Industrial orders were flat, reflecting 29% growth in systems, offset by a 5% decline in consumables. Almost all submarkets showed a decline in consumable orders, with the exception of M&A within Industrial. 
So what's happening with orders? On the full Industrial side of the business, we are seeing signs of contraction in Microelectronics. In the Western Hemisphere, OEM activity, a leading indicator for this industry, slowed. We also saw a slowing in Asia. Microelectronics orders in August continued to be down. We believe some of the slowing in orders, particularly in the more lumpy Energy & Water markets, is due to timing.  Some is the comparison to the prior period. This is the case with Aerospace, where orders were flat in Military compared to last year's 41% increase. In August, we saw Military orders almost double compared to August of last year. 
Now looking at Life Sciences. Pharmaceutical consumables orders grew by mid-single-digits after double-digit growth all year. Systems were down in the quarter, and this is the lumpy part of BioPharmaceuticals' business. Lab orders were also down high single-digits. In August, BioPharmaceuticals orders rebounded to double-digit growth, actually 45%, and order growth at Food & Beverage was driven by systems in the quarter, and this continued into August. Both consumables and systems orders were up in August. 
Clearly, we are in a period of economic uncertainty that is unlikely -- is likely to drive some cautious customer behavior. We have all seen this movie before, and I believe that this has impacted our Q4 orders, but by how much, it's hard to say. Many of our customers across markets are now carrying less inventory, perhaps a lesson from the last financial crisis. Assuming customer production levels keep up, full consumable orders should continue to flow. We started fiscal '12 with a backlog of over $800 million, which is up almost 15% from the prior year end. Not all of this will shift in fiscal '12, but it is a very good place to start the year. 
Now let's look at the markets with an eye toward specific trends or issues that we factored into our fiscal year '12 performance, starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, representing a quarter of total Pall Corporation sales, grew over 9% in the quarter. Sales, which are derived from both classic Pharmaceuticals and the biologicals markets, outpaced annual growth rates in the biotech market. 3/4 of BioPharm sales are now derived from the filtration-intensive biologicals markets, that is biotech drugs, vaccines and plasma derivatives. Consumable sales grew almost 12% in the fourth quarter. Biofilters and single-use technology did particularly well, and all regions grew, led by Europe. These results reflect our broadening presence on a growing number of biotech drugs and vaccines that are now in full production. They also reflect increasing adoption of single-use technologies and a strong new Pall product pipeline. 
We have good reason to believe fiscal '12 will be another sound year for BioPharmaceuticals, with growth in the high single-digit range. That said, economic uncertainty may hamper customers' capital investment plans, which would likely impact system sales, while consumables are tied more closely to drug production. 
Medical grew almost 5% in the quarter, and this growth reflects the impact of adoption of new products. Approximately 1/4 of Medical sales for the year came from products introduced within the last 5 years, such as the RC2D blood filters, Acrodose and our Aquasafe water filters. We expect Medical fiscal '12 performance to be in the low single-digits. 
Food & Beverage grew 10% in the quarter with all regions up. Pall is now pacing market growth by helping producers economically realize their quality and yield targets. New products and applications for emerging regions have been driving growth. Q4 orders grew 10%, driven by systems, and the backlog here is up 37% over fiscal '11. A strong order rate is carried over into the early days of fiscal '12.  August, in fact, was over 30%. The fact that system sales remained strong is encouraging to us. So based on what we see today, Food & Beverage sales could be up mid-single-digits in 2012. 
Now to switch gears for a review of Pall Industrial. Energy & Water accounts for about 20% of Pall's 2011 sales and is composed of 3 submarkets: Fuels & Chemicals, the largest; the sister market, Power Generation; and Municipal Water. These markets combined grew 7% in the quarter and almost 9% for the year. They share common imperatives for high yield, protecting customer infrastructure and leading increasingly stringent environmental rigs. They're also the most capital-intensive parts of Pall's business. 
Fuels & Chemicals serves as a backbone industries of oil and gas production refining, alternative energy and chemical production. And customers in these industries are investing aggressively to increase output. This is particularly the case in the oil and gas industry in the Middle East and in other developing regions. 
In the context of this CapEx boom, Fuels & Chemicals had a record fourth quarter, outpacing expectations, largely in system sales and capital goods. Sales were $105 million, 1/3 of the year's revenues on broad market and geographic strength. Sales were up 27% for the quarter, and full year sales increased 8%. In addition to the $105 million of shipments in the quarter that I mentioned, systems orders were strong in the quarter. Capital equipment is sold at lower margins.  We saw the effect that this can have in the fourth quarter, when gross margins were pulled down by higher-than-forecast demand for capital goods later in the fiscal year. 
When we talk about capital goods in this context, we're not just referring to systems. In general, capital goods are also metal housings and a pertinent hardware that hold or support filters. Gross margins for this product typically range from 20% to 30%. And we shipped a great deal of housing from the fourth quarter, with enough of them in the 20%-or-lower gross margin range to hurt performance. Housings generally do bring with them a long-term consumables stream, and we see capital equipment margins as an opportunity for operational improvement. Lisa will, again, discuss this in more detail in a minute. 
So depending upon the application, housings can be several feet in diameter, more than 15 feet tall and weigh more than a ton. A good news is that they are packed with filters.  Some can hold more than 100 filter elements that ultimately all need to be replaced. Like systems, they do create long-term annuity potential. Large housings can generate $1 million to $2 million in annuity sales at Pall's average gross margins once the equipment is operational. This is the silver lining to the high volume of capital goods shipped in the quarter. 
Switching briefly to Power Generation, sales were down 2% in the quarter, up 10% for the year. This is generally among the most resilient of the Industrial markets. There are 2 caveats that we factored into our outlook of low single-digit growth for 2012. If Industrial production worldwide contracts, so will demand for power. We've also factored in lost sales due to the fact that Japan, which derives 30% of its power from nuclear reactors, has taken many of those offline. This has an immediate and potentially longer-term effect as new nuclear projects, understandably, will receive closer scrutiny. 
Now overall, the Energy backlog exceeds $200 million.  Not all of this is shippable this year. This is more, though, than a 23% increase over fiscal '11's order backlog. Our forecast for the year for Energy overall is for mid-single-digit growth. This assumes strong demand in emerging markets, such as MENA and Brazil. 
Now let's focus on the $120 million Municipal Water business, a market with high longer-term growth potential. Fourth quarter sales were down 20%, largely on shipment timing, but increased 8% for the year. This is almost an entirely systems business, and the volume is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. The backlog now exceeds $100 million, which is almost last year's sales. 60% of this business is in the U.S., where a large portion of sales are driven by regulations and funded through cash flows from taxpayers -- from rate-payers rather than taxpayers. And in our experience, U.S. orders usually come through, even when the economy is flagging. Muni Water sells have been softer in Europe throughout the year, and I think we can attribute much of this to sovereign debt and general financial concerns. Project activity is accelerating in Asia. We received almost $20 million in orders in Asia in the second half of the year that came too late to ship in fiscal year '11. So as things now stand, we're expecting mid-single-digit sales growth from Municipal Water in fiscal '12. 
Now going on to Aeropower, which accounts for 17% of total Pall sales and is composed of Machinery & Equipment and Aerospace markets. These combined grew slightly in the quarter and 11% in the year. This is another area where we saw a growth in low-margin capital goods. Machinery & Equipment, which represents more than half of Aeropower, grew up 17% for the year. Sales were flat in the quarter after 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Q4 orders for consumables were strong.  They increased about 11%, making 7 straight quarters of solid orders growth. Mining, steel and automotive production have been driving sales growth. And the mining industry is expected to remain strong in calendar '12 while some of the other submarkets may cool off. We have decided to exit the market for filtration for onboard passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks. Now this will represent about $8 million in low-margin business in 2012. 
We estimate a growth of mid-single-digits for the Machinery & Equipment markets in '12. Aerospace, a combination of commercial and military, grew slightly in the quarter and 5% for the year. Commercial Aerospace represents half of the business that drove -- and that drove the growth. We're expecting a strong 2012 from Aerospace, driven by military sales and high-single-digit growth. And despite concerns surrounding severe military budget cuts, particularly in the United States, we enter 2012 with a $100 million military backlog. This is the equivalent of our total military sales in '11, and the backlog is up 36% over last year. This includes $14 million in orders for the U.S. Army CH-47 helicopter fleet that is scheduled to ship starting in December. We are not expecting any of the potential major program cancellations in 2012 out of the U.S. budget to affect Pall significantly. The total backlog for Aeropower now is over $200 million. 
And finally, Microelectronics. MicroE grew almost 5%, and full year sales increased, as I said before, 14%. Orders contracted in the quarter for the first time in 6. Despite the ubiquity of semiconductor chips and consumer electronics, this market is extremely sensitive to changes in the economy. Some in this market remain bullish, while others, including Pall, have a more cautious outlook. The most recent external data on fab utilization shows a declining rate, and we are expecting volatility in this market this year. Our outlook for Microelectronics sales is that they will be flat to down middle single-digits. Regardless of what happens in the short term, the electronics industry remains the engine of modern society, and it runs on high-tech sophisticated filters. 
Now so with that, Lisa will provide her financial report, including more granularity on the current outlook for fiscal '12."
185333,139987561,168077,"Pall Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 15, 2011",2011-09-15,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results and will then move on to a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and year and conclude with our current expectations for fiscal year 20",2274,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results and will then move on to a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and year and conclude with our current expectations for fiscal year 2012. 
So let's start with the profit issues in Pall Industrial. While sales growth of 5% in the quarter came in at about our expectations, mix was different than forecast. Why? Fuels & Chemicals and Aeropower sales contained lower-margin capital goods, including both systems and housings, which outperformed in volume but underperformed in profit. Looking year-over-year, systems and capital goods sales in Pall Industrial grew by over 20%, or about $25 million. Taken together, these comprised over 40% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to about 35% in last year's fourth quarter. Moreover, as Eric mentioned earlier, the gross margins of these incremental sales were 20% or less. The combination of negative mix and suboptimal gross margins were a headwind of about $10 million, or 270 basis points compared to last year. 
Now Pall Industrial's profitability profile can be lumpy with the timing of systems and capital goods. This is the nature of much of that business. That said, we won't sugarcoat it, this was sloppy execution on several fronts, including contract execution, pricing and forecast of capital timing. We are taking measures to improve margins on capital goods and the annuity pull-through. This includes improving our contract risk assessment, pricing and costing review and approval processes to enhance governance and transparency. It also includes exiting from certain low-margin product lines, such as the example that Eric cited earlier. 
Unfavorable absorption from lower production levels were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency, driven mainly from Asia but also in the eurozone. Margin degradation was also related to 3 key operational performance challenges: first, inflation eroding continuous improvement cost savings; second, excess cost for the closure of our plant in Ireland and transfer of manufacturing lines to a sister plant; and lastly, suboptimal processes at several plants, resulting in write-off to such things as scrap and obsolescence. 
Now the excess plant closure costs and write-offs are not expected to be recurring items. Inflation of oil-based commodities we use in our manufacturing processes such as resins, plastics and steel is a reality. Our continuous improvement initiatives are geared up to offset inflationary pressure, just as we did in the full year of fiscal 2011. 
Industrial SG&A grew by $10.6 million, or 12% in local currency, in the quarter, and this exceeded spend expectations by about 4%. Sales and marketing-related expenses were up 18.5%, reflecting second half additions of sales-related personnel of approximately 8%, principally in emerging markets, as we've seen in the third quarter. Increases in the variable compensation and selling-related activities also contributed to the dollar increase year-over-year and exceeded forecasts. These items are expected to remunerate in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations for a different sales mix and activity level as well as measures we are taking to rein them in. G&A was up about 3.5%, including some additional spends for the ramp-up of Pall Industrial's European and Asian supply chain consolidation into our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 27.4% compared with 25.3% last year. For the full year, SG&A increased 8% in local currency and as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a 90-basis-point improvement over last year. To improve Pall Industrial's profit leverage, we are implementing several restructuring initiatives in fiscal year 2012. While these initiatives are expected to be dilutive to fiscal 2012 net earnings, the ROI estimates are compelling. We will discuss them in more detail as we move through the year. One I will mention now is the restructure of the sales and marketing management of Aeropower and Energy & Water. This will result in cost savings by rationalizing the structure globally and enhance contract administration in these capital-intensive sectors. 
To wrap up, Pall Industrial's operating margins were 13.4% in the quarter compared to about 20.4% a year ago. This reflects a decline in operating profit of $18 million, or 26%. We are disappointed with this result and are taking the measures I described to bring about timely improvement. 
Switching now to Life Sciences. Local currency sales grew 8% in the quarter. Consumable sales increased almost 8%, with BioPharmaceuticals leading with 11% growth. Systems grew over 11%. Food and Beverage system sales were up over 32%, while Pharmaceutical system sales declined almost 10%. And system sales represented 11.1% of sales compared to 10.8% of sales last year. Life Sciences gross margins increased 150 basis points to 53.4%. And this primarily reflects the benefit of exchange rates from foreign-currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the eurozone, and improved pricing. This was offset by lower overhead absorption from reduced manufacturing output as inventory levels continued to be adjusted as well as the inflationary pressure I mentioned a moment ago in my remarks about Pall Industrial. SG&A increased $7.5 million, or 8.5% in local currency, in the fourth quarter. And consistent with Pall Industrial, investments in sales and marketing underlie the increase, with a 6% increase in customer-facing employees in the quarter, primarily in emerging markets, as well as marketing expenses and inflation. G&A was up 3.5%. And SG&A as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 26.2% compared with 26% last year. And for the full year, SG&A was up 6% excluding FX and as a percentage of sales was 26.2%, down from 27.5% last year. Operating profit came in at $92 million for a 24% increase. And operating margin came in at 23.3%, a 130-basis-point improvement. 
Now looking at total Pall Corporation for both the quarter and year, sales increased 15% in the quarter and 14% in the year compared to the same periods in fiscal 2010. In local currency, sales were up 6% in the quarter and 11% for the year. The dollar impact of FX [ph] was a benefit of about $60 million and $76 million in the quarter and the year, respectively. Overall pricing gains contributed approximately $4 million to the top line in the quarter and $14 million in the year, namely in Life Sciences. Gross margins for the year came in at 50.1%, down 10 basis points year-over-year as the slight improvement in Life Sciences was offset by the decline in Industrial. Excluding FX, overall SG&A expenses increased about 10% in the quarter and 7% for the year. And as I've mentioned earlier, almost all of the increase in SG&A was driven by the business segment selling-related spending I discussed a moment ago. This year also reflects increased costs related to investments in our regional headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore as well as our IT infrastructure. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the year declined to 29.7% compared to 30.8% in 2010. 
Now excluding foreign exchange, R&D spending rose 20% in the quarter and 15% in the year, reflecting increased spending in both Life Sciences and Industrial as we allocate more capital to investment in core technology innovation. R&D was 3.2% of sales in both the quarter and the year, on par with the same period last year. Excluding the benefits of FX, the company's operating profits were down by 11% in the quarter but up approximately 15% for the year. 
Turning now to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or as-reported rate, was 10.3% for the quarter and 24.8% for the year. This reflects the benefit of the resolution of the U.S. tax audit mentioned in our release last night, partly offset by tax costs related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. This year also includes tax costs associated with the establishment of the company's Asian headquarters. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying rate of 26.7% for fiscal year 2011 reflects the achievement of a sustainable reduction of about 4% year-over-year. The reduction in the rate has contributed almost $19 million, or about $0.16, to the bottom line last year. This is attributable to the supply chain reorganization in Europe within Life Sciences. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $97.4 million, or $0.82 per share, compared to $55 million, or $0.46 per share, last year. And pro forma EPS as defined in the appendix to the slides were $0.76 compared to $0.72 per share, an increase of about 6%. And this was propelled by the benefit from foreign currency translation of about $0.08 and the reduction in tax cost. Net earnings in the year were $315.5 million, or $2.67 per share, compared to $241.2 million, or $2.03 per share, last year. Pro forma EPS was $2.77 compared to $2.12 a year ago, an increase of almost 31%. Foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.13 in the year. 
Now looking for a moment at our performance in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, sales in the fourth quarter increased by almost $71 million, or 10% sequentially. And local currency sales grew about 8%, 3% in base and 48% in systems. Life Sciences grew 7%, 5% in local currency. This was driven by 20% sequential growth in Food & Beverage and 6% in Medical. Q4 sales in BioPharmaceuticals were flat compared to a strong third quarter. Industrial sales grew over 13% sequentially, 12% in local currency. This was driven by growth of approximately 25% in Energy & Water, 4% in Microelectronics and 3% in Aeropower. Compared to quarter 3, overall gross margins were down, and this reflects a decline in the Industrial segment of 290 basis points relating to the items I covered earlier. And SG&A sequentially increased 5%, or about $10 million, and this is -- the 5% is in local currency. This largely reflects increases in variable-based compensation and sales-related activities in both businesses. G&A sequentially remains flat. Overall, company operating profit was about 4%, reflecting a sequential decline in corporate expenses, while both businesses were up about 2.5% to 3%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year was $430 million, an increase of $52 million, or 14%, compared to fiscal year 2010. This was driven by increased earnings and continued improvement in working capital management, particularly days in inventory. Significant uses of cash during the year included $161 million in capital spending, $89 million in net repayments of debt and $228 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $78 million and stock repurchases of $150 million, and this leaves approximately $200 million of our current authorization. 
Now wrapping up the discussion of our liquidity, our cash position for the $558 million at July 31 and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9.1%, down from 19.4% at July 31, 2010. 
Now looking at 2012, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-single digits in both businesses. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% positive to revenue. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single-digit growth for Medical, high-single-digit growth in BioPharmaceutical and mid-single digit growth in Food and Beverage. In Industrial, we expect Energy, Water and Machinery & Equipment to grow by mid-single-digits and Aerospace to deliver high-single-digit growth, driven by military spending, largely, as Eric mentioned, already in backlog. Finally, our current thinking on Microelectronics is flat to down 5%. 
Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51.25%, and EBIT margins in the range of 17% to 18.5%. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2012 is approximately 24.5%, reflecting incremental benefit of the headquarters in Switzerland as well as the impact of going live in our Singapore headquarters last month. Our current organizational changes are likely to generate restructuring and other charges of between $30 million to $40 million, most of which will be cash items. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.32. And this contemplates a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, a stock buyback of approximately $150 million accretive to earnings by about $0.03 to $0.04 and finally, the benefit of our reduction in tax rate of approximately $0.10. 
Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $490 million to $540 million. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and laboratory. 
That concludes my report. Before handing this back to Eric, I want to make it clear that the company remains strong, and we already begun addressing the events that impacted our fourth quarter earnings. The main issues in the quarter related to Industrial and had to do with mix, profitability of capital goods and SG&A spending levels.  Pall Life Sciences again performed well. To reiterate some key points from our action plans, we're enhancing internal transparency around the timing of capital goods. We're taking measures to improve margins on capital goods as well as the attendant annuity pull-through. And finally, we're preparing to take significant costs out of the organization. Looking forward, we are well positioned to navigate a turbulent economy, as we've done before, and are focused on achieving our 24 goals. 
As I turn the call over to Eric for one final time, I would like to take a moment to express on behalf of all Pall Corporation's employees our appreciation for everything he has done for the company and over a long and distinguished career. It has been a rewarding experience to work alongside of him these past 5 years for me. Eric, we'll miss you, and we wish you well."

No, I appreciate that very much, and, certainly, what you accomplish in your career is very important, but if you leave that career without having sound personal relationships and a deep affection for those that really did most of the work, then you've left with nothing. Fortunately, I leave with everything. Thank you. And we've covered a lot of ground this morning and appreciate your patience. In closing, I want to say that it has been an honor and a privilege to nurture Pall from a $700 million enterprise to its current size and stature. I've also enjoyed meeting with so many of you as CEO and sharing our plans and progress over 17 years. Larry Kingsley takes over as CEO and President on October 3. The transition is going to plan, and our Board of Directors deserves a great deal of credit for what will be a very smooth management succession process. 
So at next quarter's earnings call, I look forward to joining you in the audience and sharing on Pall's progress. And now with the help of the conference operator, we are ready for your questions."

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, corporate Controller. We'll review the quarter and our outlook in a moment. Before that, I want to answer some questions that I've received in recurring from since I joined the company in October.
First, why did I come to Pall. Second, what should you expect from me or us in the short and long term? And where do I stand in our externally stated goals for 2013. So first, with Pall. The answer is simple. It's a unique prospect. I left IDEX, a great company in really good shape for the opportunity to build Pall into a company that I believe it could be. I see Pall as a huge long-term value creation opportunity, and I'd like you to think about it that way as well. Clearly, we have work to do. Some of it's foundational in nature, and it's going to take some time. But Pall is already a good company with the potential to be one of the best global technology enterprises.
Opportunities to lead a company that serve great markets with differentiated technology with strong global reach and a dedicated team, those don't come along everyday. As shown on our Slide 5, our business model includes high barriers to entry. More than 2/3 of our sales are consumable purchases that are largely nondiscretionary decisions.
Beyond the business model, our technology, brand leadership, strong customer relationships and applications expertise and a global sales channel that's arguably the best of any company in our space. These characteristics combined deliver a great profile. And the company has the girth and that's the presence and the fixed cost structure to grow.
We're going to be working to develop our Pall enterprise system to drive improved process and operational execution. We should be able to drive significantly more volumes through our manufacturing plants, more products through our sales organization and new technology to our consumers.
And last but not least, we have a terrific balance sheet that provides tremendous flexibility and can be deployed for growth. We also have a substantial amount of cash tied up in working capital. We will move to a more aggressive capital allocation strategy in the future. But the operative word is strategy. It's not a desire to just become highly acquisitive. Our investments will be thoughtful and disciplined to enhance our offering and to accelerate growth.
So that's why I'm here, and now what are we going to do? And I'm on to Slide 6 on your deck. Focus is one of the other very key and operative words for us. We have some fundamental issues that we need to either address or drive to completion. They all center around people, process and technology. All of our efforts are designed to drive improvement in consistency and operating performance.
First, we're evaluating our organization structure, have already reworked our executive incentive plans. Executive compensation with the recent change is now based on multiple metrics to better align our leadership with growing the company, executing our focused agenda and driving shareholder return.
Second, we're building our corporate business development team to establish core acquisition capability, but also to augment Pall's organic strategies in the most attractive end markets. We'll be investing in the skills necessary to integrate these new acquisitions as well. In the short term, you can expect that we'll only acquire opportunistically where we intend to operate the new business with pre-existing leadership. And given that, we'll continue to accumulate cash and execute our share repurchase program as previously announced.
We'll also be enhancing our capabilities to tap into the faster growing regions. We're currently shifting resources from mature to expanding economies. So those are the key initiatives around people. Now in terms of process, we've spoken externality about our global ERP system project. Europe and Asia are up and running now. We'll be bringing the Americas online by the end of the fiscal year. However, we need to develop the architecture of a business system that the ERP system is the enabler for. Our business system or what we again will now refer to as the Pall enterprise system will be the means for how we drive process improvement, customer relationship improvement and shareholder return. 
We're shifting from a country based operations in terms of structure to 3 regional fulfillment centers. Once complete, we'll be able to provide better and faster commercial and technical support. At the same time, it will allow us to better leverage our fixed cost structure.
And finally, technology. I believe that we can tremendously improve our product vitality. Our R&D investment appears to be adequate as a matter of better choices, organizational effectiveness and new product development based on good cross-functional process, which we're addressing in our marketing and design groups.
So we have a few very critical companywide priorities that will solidify our foundation and allow us to further develop this gem of a company. I can't stress enough it's going to take time to see recognizable differences how the company performs, but I'm highly confident we will get there.
Now before getting into the first quarter review, I want to tell you where I stand on the previously committed 2013 goals that were first presented in 2009. I don't believe that executives or CEO, in my case, should arrive and provide excuses or hit the reset buttons. So the goals are the goals. The current microeconomic environment certainly make some of them more challenging, but our team has executed well, and we're in the range for most of the stated goals. 
If the global economy continues to slow, we may have to adjust our fixed cost structure to achieve our stated profitability targets. That said, I will always balance the short versus the long-term needs of the company with a bias towards growth. We are currently evaluating how we will characterize our aspirational goals for the longer-term, given the economic outlook, and our ability to improve our performance, we'll discuss this further in our earnings but Lisa's got a couple of comments in her prepared remarks shortly.
So now what happened in the quarter? And we're on to Slide 7. First, we achieved very good top line growth. Sales crossed the $700 million mark for the first quarter for the first time. Total sales grew almost 70% on an as-reported basis and 12%, excluding FX. Business was split about 50-50 between Life Sciences and Industrial. We saw good growth across the major markets with the exception of Microelectronics. Sales in the Americas increased almost 11% with Latin America, a key contributor. Europe was up 11% marking 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Some of this is coming from large Pharmaceutical consumers in Western Europe, while the aggressive investment in the Middle East is another driving force. And remember that we account for the Middle East and Europe. Sales in Asia increased 14%. This growth came from throughout the region. Emerging regions were just under 20% of sales for the quarter and grew about 35%. Pall is already in good position to seize these global sales opportunities. We're counting on these markets to fuel our growth, and we'll be aggressively waiting our investments to extend our reach.
On to Slide 8. We also experienced healthy orders in the quarter. Orders increased 11% overall and grew by double digits in all 3 regions. Most markets were up. Consumables demand increased 9%, and orders for systems grew 28%. Backlog is up 14% year-over-year. Customers in the energy markets continue to invest aggressively and capital equipment to increase output and lower operating costs. We saw systems orders increase almost 200% in these markets, reflecting significant growth in Latin America and MENA, systems orders in Food and Bev and BioPharm grew over 25%. So while there are clearly economic uncertainties across the global stage, continued willingness to invest is a great sign.
Before I comment on the segment performance, I want to make it clear that while I'm pleased with our sales and our orders performance, we should and will demonstrate much better operating flow-through or incremental profit on the incremental organic sales. We have a number of issues to address, and they're all within our control.
So now, I'm going to move to Slide 9 and talk about Life Sciences first. Sales in Life Sciences increased 9.5%, excluding FX. Just under half of this business is in Europe and is dominated by BioPharm. Although BioPharm is not immune to the economic cycle, it is resilient, and BioPharm grew 22% in the first quarter in Europe, and orders were up double-digit digits. BioPharm at 28% first quarter sales is the engine of our Life Sciences business. 
On a global basis, sales grew 16%, excluding FX. Consumables represented over 90% of the total while systems sales, which fit future annuities, increased over 25%. First quarter orders increased 9%. And the BioPharm market, as you know, is driven by biotech. This market is global, fast-growing, filtration-intensive, has high barriers to entry and is bound by stringent regulation.
On to Slide 11. Sales in the medical area increased almost 3%, excluding FX. A key growth driver was again the increasing use of IV filters with drug infusion pumps. Regulators are recommending precautionary measures to prevent air in the tubing from reaching patients. This trend began to take shape over a year ago and continues to our benefit. Blood also grew almost 4% driven by increased adoption of new products in the Americas. We saw good growth in medical in total in the Americas and Asia while Europe was down mid-single digits. Despite these, orders in a global basis are up 6%.
Slide 12, Food and Bev. Food and Beverage sales increased 4%, excluding FX. This was driven by systems. Customers are investing to adhere to global standards for Food and Bev production in the emerging markets. Producers are also highly motivated to reduce unit costs.
Sales are down in the large European wine and beer market as producers cut production in response to softer consumer demand. This particularly affects the quality conscious premium brands, which use more filters. Here we also sold the noncore assets group in Europe that didn't meet our growth or margin profile.
A bit of accomplished on the top line throughout the year but will be offset by slightly higher gross margins.
Q1 orders grew a solid 10% within the Food and Bev market.
Now we'll shift to Pall industrial where sales increased 14% excluding FX, and we're on Slide 13. The largest the region for this segment is in Asia. The business in Asia is largely Microelectronics followed by Energy. We're expecting Microelectronics to have a tough year. And Energy and Water on Slide 14 shows sales in Energy and Water increase over 29%. We saw a comparable growth in both markets. The growth in Energy reflects increases in consumables and capital goods in all regions. The oil and gas and alternative energy end markets were very strong. We continue to see a lot of investment in capital equipment coming out of the emerging regions. 
For Pall, this means higher housing and system sales. And we've made progress since the fourth quarter, but we still have much more to do to improve our systems business profile.
Muni Waters strong sales were driven by large shippable backlog in the Americas and large wastewater project in Australia. The lion's share of our Muni Water business is also driven by regulations. We've been in a cycle of reduced capital spending in Europe for water infrastructure project the last 2 years and expect this to continue until conditions improve there.
But overall, orders in Energy and Water increased almost 22% in the quarter. And this growth is driven principally by the Energy markets.
So now on to Microelectronics. We were expecting volatility in Microelectronics for the year, and that's what we're getting. First quarter sales decreased almost 2% about what we had anticipated. Q1 orders are down almost 6%, and this filtration-intensive, largely consumables market is cyclical. However, it's technically demanding, which obviously through the cycle is good for us. First quarter sales reflect the decline in semiconductor chip production, a corresponding reduction in OEM sales and weakness in the display market. 
There's an additional complicating factor to our outlook while our sales in Thailand are not material, it accounts for about 25% of the global hard drive output. As a result many involved in the electronic industry, including us, are bracing for shortages and short supply chain interruptions. The impact is difficult to estimate at this time, but we do anticipate that the market will start to improve around the beginning of our fiscal year 2013.
So now on to Slide 16, Aeropower. Aeropower, the combination again of aerospace and machinery and equipment was up 11%, excluding FX. Sales in aerospace increased 10% driven by the commercial aerospace markets, which grew over 14%. This result reflects our strong position on new commercial aircraft, which are now rolling over in the assembly lines, as well as an increased aftermarket sales content to the airlines.
We're expecting military aerospace to have a good year based on better than $100 million backlog. First quarter sales grew almost 6%. We're not expecting any major program cancellations this year. In fact, aerospace orders increased 25% in the quarter with that growth almost entirely in military.
And finally, in machinery and equipment, which along with microelectronics, has the highest gross margins in the industrial segment grew over 12%. This market has grown at least at this rate for 6 of the last 7 quarters. Sales continue to be driven by strength in manufacturing and mining applications. We have a decent backlog here, and we saw orders grow 13% in the quarter.
So that concludes my remarks for now. I'm going to turn it over to Lisa."
185333,143293742,200360,"Pall Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2011",2011-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results in the quarter. Starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial where excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achieving wh",1030,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses results in the quarter. Starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial where excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achieving what we believe is entitlements and price, we did realize about 20 basis points improvement. Consumable sales increased over 10%. This includes hardware or in other words, the housing filters. This growth was propelled by strong growth in energy and water and Aeropower. The energy and machinery and equipment components of these markets drove 46% emerging market growth. Likewise, systems grew about 40% driven by energy and water. System sales represented 16% of total Industrial segment sales compared to 13% in the first quarter of last year. And the growth in these markets were partly offset by a decline that Larry mentioned in microelectronics. 
Given mix impact and top line I just discussed, the end result was that revenues exceeded expectations while gross profit was nominally above expectations. The 220 basis point decrease in industrial gross margin year-over-year reflects more systems coupled with the decline in MicroE. Importantly, gross margins in the quarter improved sequentially by 180 basis points to 45% due to better mix and execution. SG&A decreased about $11 million or 13%, excluding FX, in the quarter. Selling expenses was about 18% of sales, increased by about 12%. This increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging countries. 
G&A, which represents about 11% of sales, was up about 14%. And this reflects related infrastructure build for emerging countries, including our Brazilian acquisition, cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian headquarter structure and our IT investments. The segment profit came in at $48 million, and this was about the same excluding FX last year even with the sales growth in the quarter. Accordingly, segment margins decreased to 13.8% from 15.4% last year.
As we started to discuss last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve Pall Industrial leverage. We expect to see the benefit of this in the second half of this fiscal year, and I'll address this in further detail when I get to the financial recap in a moment.
So I'm switching now to Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 19. Excluding FX, sales grew 9.5% in the quarter. Pricing was about 1%. Emerging markets growth was 22%, and developed regions growth was 8%. Systems grew approximately 50%. And Food and Beverage system sales almost doubled, and in pharmaceutical they were up 25%. So systems represented close to 7% of Life Sciences sales compared to 5% last year. Life Sciences gross margins increased 130 bps to 55.8%. This primarily reflects manufacturing cost saves and the benefit of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated source goods, primarily in the Eurozone. 
Here our segment profit came in at almost $89 million, a 14% increase excluding FX. Segment margin improved 150 basis points to 25% yielding 35% incremental margin on top line growth of 9.5%. We believe we're missing 10 points in incremental margin, the result of investment in selling resources reflected in SG&A, IT cost, as well as yield issues in our facility in Puerto Rico.
Turning now to Slide 20. The end result was that we grew sales by 12% and operating profit by just over 7%, both excluding FX. Not the opening leverage you should nor do we expect from our performance. In our current state, we should be achieving at least 25% incremental margins. Thus, we would expect to grow operating profit by between 15% and 20% with this kind of sales growth and achieve operating margin of at least 18%. Longer term, we should be targeting incremental margins in the high 30s to low 40s. This is the beginning of characterizing our aspirational goals for the long term that Larry referred to earlier. 
To that end, last quarter, we announced that we would be implementing several restructuring initiatives early in the year, and that these would likely generate $30 million to $40 million in charges. We reported $25 million of these charges in the first quarter, mostly for cash severance for Pall Industrial. The most significant restructuring activities include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy and Water, reorganizing global management structure that supports the company's systems product lines and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. 
Turning now to income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.9% for the quarter compared to 26.8% last year. Excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges, Pall's underlying tax rate was 24.5%, in line with our full year outlook.
This is the low end of the tax rate we targeted to achieve for fiscal year 2013 and reflects early benefits of our Asian headquarters. Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings were $69.5 million or $0.59 per share. This compares to $71.4 million or $0.61 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined in the appendix slides were $0.74 compared to $0.62, an increase of 19%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.05. The tax rate contributed about $0.03, supported by costs we're taking above the line and included in underlying growth, which added about $0.04.
Turning now to Slide 21 and cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $78 million. This 34% increase or $21 million was driven by increased earnings exclusive of the restructuring and other items, which had a minimal impact on cash outflows and continued improvement in working capital management, most significantly in inventories. Significant uses of cash included $70 million in net repayments of debt, $57 million in capital spending, which include significant investment in a new facility in the United Kingdom including customer support laboratories, $28 million for acquisition in Brazil and $20 million in dividends to shareholders. 
So wrapping up the discussion on liquidity, our cash position is $475 million at quarter end, and our net debt to net debt equity was 9.7%, essentially on par with July 31, 2011. 
That concludes my report. I will now turn this to Larry to talk about our expectations for the full year."
185333,143293742,200360,"Pall Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2011",2011-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect single-digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low single-digit growth for",502,"Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect single-digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low single-digit growth for Medical and high single-digit growth for BioPharm. In Food and Bev, we now expect low single-digit growth. In Industrial, we now expect the energy markets to deliver high single-digit growth, with high systems content. We expect to water and machinery and equipment to grow by mid-single digits and aerospace to deliver high single-digit growth, driven by our current backlog. And our current thinking is that microelectronics could be down mid-single to as much as low double digits. 
Let me just go through those again. So I'll repeat. Low single-digit organic growth for both Medical and Food and Bev; high single-digit growth for BioPharm; and then over the Industrial side, energy, high single digits, as well as aerospace high single digits, while water, machinery and equipment will be mid-single-digit and microelectronics again down as much as double digits depending on how the supply chain recovers and how the U.S. consumer behaves here in the short term.
So that said, we continue to expect gross margins to be in a range of 50% to 51.25%, EBIT margins to be the range of 17% to 18.5% with the benefit of the restructuring that Lisa just walked through. We're holding our original guidance with pro forma EPS expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.32. This includes a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates but also assumes opportunistic stock buybacks of about $150 million, which will, depending on the timing, be accretive to earnings by about $0.03. And finally, $0.10 benefit from our lower tax rate. Operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of $490 million to $540 million, and we're estimating about $185 million in CapEx as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, the manufacturing plants and the labs. 
And along those lines, we spent $57 million in the first quarter, which was mainly already committed capital and not great in terms of CapEx run rate in terms of start of the year. That said, we have made significant investments that will support future growth, and we will change our spending habits. 
So we entered the year with good order and sales momentum. Growth was stronger in the first quarter and yielded a better outcome than our expectation. However, as I said earlier, Lisa said as well from a leverage perspective, we're not pleased with the quarter. Operating performance given the strong top line was anemic, and we need to correct this, and we will. We also need to stress that our first half assumptions remain consistent with our original outlook. And again, our view of full year EPS expectations remain within the range provided in September. 
So with that and the help of our operator here, we'll take your questions."

As you know, we've got a very differentiated technology, we've got great applications expertise, we've got great support lab capability in the field. We're able to essentially gain the spec, the technical spec for most of those applications, and I think there's frankly better opportunity to achieve price as part of that process.

The good news piece of that is that there's a much better lab capability to serve our BioPharm customers, particularly in the U.K. associated with that, but there's also plenty of space to buildout for a long period of time. The other portion you heard us talk up about for a few quarters now, which is our ERP system deployment.

There may be some customer profiles of current system sales that really do cost us more than we properly think about and how we think about return on investment for some of those systems opportunities. And those are fairly small as a percentage of total revenue. So a little bit and not much really to move the needle in terms of total sales. Really the issue is we need to get a little better frankly at how we sell systems and deal with the longer-term nature of the sale. What becomes typically incremental cost as a function of change orders as systems are spec and built and installed and make sure that we're bringing something very valuable to the customer that we're getting all that value for it, all that price associated with that value. So it's really I'd say it's going to take some time frankly, but it's an ability that we need to build into our organization on both sides of the house, but particularly on the Industrial side for how we achieve the appropriate price for our system sales. And I'd get to mu earlier comments those are applicable to consumables as well on how we achieve price more generally. In terms of how we get to high 30s incremental margins, beyond just what the price portion of that needs to look like. Good news is we can leverage our current operating footprint. We don't need to expand that, and we can do a better job frankly in terms of operating performance within our existing facilities. And Lisa talked a little bit about in the quarter how one of them our largest facility in particular in Puerto Rico do cost us a fair amount just in terms of basic operating manufacturing performance. So the how quickly we get there? Not this year. But I do think we have that opportunity in 2013."

Now I'm proud of the team. I think we have a great team who's working very hard and doing some very, very good things. But structurally, we need to get our hands around how that kind of organic top line growth generates a lot more incremental profitability, and that model needs to be not so short-term focused but certainly the operating leverage that we both harped on is an important element of how we need to modify the thinking of how our team operates. At the same time, we're going to aggressively reinvest in the business, and that's both organically as well as acquisitively. And we've got a long list of organic initiatives that we're honing down to the things that we think really move the needle, things that need to get down in terms of new products and other initiatives to expand our global reach and things that we want to do to improve our profile more generally. From an acquisitive perspective in terms of difference going forward, I think that we definitely need to prepare ourselves first and then be very thoughtful and very disciplined, but ultimately execute a much more aggressive capital deployment strategy. And we need to allocate primarily toward how we grow the business and then what we can do otherwise in terms of balancing the shareholder return, short and long term. In terms of how I think about the allocation of that capital across the business in terms of simple Life Sciences versus Industrial, clearly, the profile of Life Sciences is very attractive. How we build out Life Sciences is got to be artful frankly. I won't get into too much detail because competition listens to these calls too. But we've I think at the beginning line of sight towards how we can do that with strong presence in the lab continuing the instrument leads and the consumables are leveraged by way of it and how we can in combination with good acquisitive pieces that we already have our sights on plus organic buildout continue to expand the capability first at BioPharm to support some of that core biotech, but also in the other Life Science applications. On the Industrial side, it's a little bit of a different M&A opportunity set. And there, frankly it's about going after the higher growth niches and making sure that we have the best possible presence and the most attractive subsets today, which obviously includes microelectronics and some of the other segments that we're well penetrated but we certainly stand to grow share. On top of all of that, I think there's both acquisitive opportunities and organic initiatives again that can improve our global reach, particularly in the emerging markets and allow us better local operational support for fast customer turn time in those areas. And if you think about them, so what does if you look a few years out, if you had the benefit of that point in time in hindsight looking at what we did, we will comprise a balance of certainly Life Science investments to drive the growth profile of the company, continued I would call it more of a bolt-on approach or niche approach in the Industrial side to drive the highest growth and most attractive strategic acquisitions within Industrial and then supplementing that with what we can do again organically and acquisitively to get that global reach."

We talked about concerns on Life Sciences side, Food and Bev in medical in Europe and then on the Industrial side about half of that total segment that does have a direct and immediate impact as a function of overall macroeconomic performance. So that's point number one. And point number two is the wildcard around what happens within MicroE, and I'd tell you right now that I think it's not dire by any means. If the U.S. consumer buys a lot of electronics over the Christmas season or the holiday season here then that will help.

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. 
We'll review the quarter and our outlook in a moment, but before that, I want to answer some questions that I've received in recurring form since I joined the company in October.
First, why did I come to Pall? Second, what should you expect from me or us in the short and long term? And where do I stand in our externally stated goals for 2013? 
So first,  what drew me to Pall? The answer is simple: It's a unique prospect. I left IDEX, a great company in really good shape for the opportunity to build Pall into the company that I believe it can be. I see Pall as a huge long-term value creation opportunity, and I'd like you to think about it that way as well. Clearly, we have work to do. Some of it's foundational in nature, and it's going to take some time. But Pall is already a good company with the potential to be one of the best global technology enterprises.
Opportunities to lead a company that serve great markets with differentiated technology with strong global reach and a dedicated team, but those just don't come along everyday. As shown on our Slide 5, our business model includes high barriers to entry. More than 2/3 of our sales are consumable purchases that are largely nondiscretionary decisions.
Beyond the business model, add our technology, brand leadership, strong customer relationships and applications expertise and a global sales channel that's arguably the best of any company in our space, these characteristics combined deliver a great profile. And the company has the girth, and that's the presence and the fixed cost structure to grow.
We're going to be working to develop our Pall Enterprise System to drive improved process and operational execution. We should be able to drive significantly more volume through our manufacturing plants, more products through our sales organization and new technology to our customers. And last but not least, we have a terrific balance sheet that provides tremendous flexibility and can be deployed for growth. We also have a substantial amount of cash tied up in working capital. 
We will move to a more aggressive capital allocation strategy in the future. But the operative word is strategy. It's not a desire to just become highly acquisitive. Our investments will be thoughtful and disciplined to enhance our offering and to accelerate growth.
So that's why I'm here, and now what are we going to do? And I'm on to Slide 6 on your deck. Focus is one of the other very key and operative word for us. We have some fundamental issues that we need to either address or drive to completion. They all center around people, process and technology. All of our efforts are designed to drive improvements in consistency and operating performance.
First, we're evaluating our organization structure, have already reworked our executive incentive plans. Executive compensation with the recent change is now based on multiple metrics to better align our leadership with growing the company, executing our focused agenda and driving shareholder return.
Second, we're building our corporate business development team to establish core acquisition capability, but also to augment Pall's organic strategies in the most attractive end markets. We'll be investing in the skills necessary to integrate these new acquisitions as well. In the short term, you can expect that we'll only acquire opportunistically where we intend to operate the new business with pre-existing leadership. And given that, we'll continue to accumulate cash and execute our repurchase program as previously announced. We'll also be enhancing our capabilities to tap into the faster growing regions. We're currently shifting resources from mature to expanding economies. 
So those are the key initiatives around people. Now in terms of process, we've spoken externally about our global ERP system project. Europe and Asia are up and running now. We'll be bringing the Americas online by the end of the fiscal year. However, we need to develop the architecture of a business system that the ERP system is the enabler for. Our business system, or what we again will now refer to as the Pall Enterprise System, will be the means for how we drive process improvement, customer relationship improvement and shareholder return. 
We're shifting from a country-based operations in terms of structure to 3 regional fulfillment centers. Once complete, we'll be able to provide better and faster commercial and technical support. At the same time, it will allow us to better leverage our fixed cost structure.
And finally, technology. I believe that we can tremendously improve our product vitality. Our R&D investment appears to be adequate as a matter of better choices, organizational effectiveness and new product development based on good cross-functional process, which we're addressing in our marketing and design groups.
So we have a few very critical company-wide priorities that will solidify our foundation and allow us to further develop this gem of a company. I can't stress enough, it's going to take time to see recognizable differences on how the company performs, but I'm highly confident we'll get there.
Now before getting into the first quarter review, I want to tell you where I stand on the previously committed 2013 goals that were first presented in 2009. I don't believe that executives or CEO, in my case, should arrive and provide excuses or hit the reset button. So the goals are the goals. The current macroeconomic environment certainly make some of them more challenging, but our team has executed well and we're in range for most of the stated goals. 
If the global economy continues to slow, we may have to adjust our fixed cost structure to achieve our stated profitability targets. That said, I will always balance the short versus the long-term needs of the company with a bias toward growth. We are currently evaluating how we will characterize our aspirational goals for the longer term, given the economic outlook, and our ability to improve our performance. And we'll discuss this further in our earnings calls to come, but also Lisa's also -- she's got a couple of comments in her prepared remarks here shortly.
So now what happened in the quarter? And we're on to Slide 7. First, we achieved very good top line growth. Sales crossed the $700 million mark in the first quarter for the first time. Total sales grew almost 70% on an as-reported basis and 12% excluding FX. Business was split about 50-50 between Life Sciences and Industrial. We saw a good growth across the major markets, with the exception of Microelectronics. 
Sales in the Americas increased almost 11%, with Latin America, key contributor. Europe was up 11%, marking 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Some of this is coming from large Pharmaceutical customers in Western Europe, while the aggressive investment in the Middle East is another driving force, and remember that we account for the Middle East and Europe. 
Sales in Asia increased 14%. This growth came from throughout the region. Emerging regions were just under 20% of sales for the quarter and grew about 35%. Pall is already in good position to seize these global sales opportunities. We're counting on these markets to fuel our growth, and we'll be aggressively weighting our investments to extend our reach.
On to Slide 8. We also experienced healthy orders in the quarter. Orders increased 11% overall and grew by double digits in all 3 regions. Most markets were up. Consumables demand increased 9% and orders for systems grew 28%. Backlog is up 14% year-over-year. Customers in the Energy markets continue to invest aggressively in capital equipment to increase output and lower operating costs. We saw systems orders increase almost 200% in these markets, reflecting significant growth in Latin America and MENA. Systems orders in Food and Bev and BioPharm grew over 25%. So while there are clearly economic uncertainties across the global stage, this continued willingness to invest is a great sign.
Before I comment on the segment performance, I want to make it clear that while I'm pleased with our sales and our orders performance, we should and will demonstrate much better operating flowthrough or incremental profit on the incremental organic sales. We have a number of issues to address, and they're all within our control.
So now, I'm going to move to Slide 9. And we will talk about Life Sciences first. Sales in Life Sciences increased 9.5% excluding FX. Just under half of this business is in Europe and is dominated by BioPharm. Although BioPharm is not immune to the economic cycle, it is resilient, and BioPharm grew 22% in the first quarter in Europe and orders were up double digits. BioPharm at 28% of first quarter sales is the engine of our Life Sciences business. 
On a global basis, sales grew 16% excluding FX. Consumables represented over 90% of the total, while systems sales, which feed future annuities, increased over 25%. First quarter orders increased 9%. And the BioPharm market, as you know, is driven by biotech. This market is global, fast-growing, filtration-intensive, has high barriers to entry and is bound by stringent regulation.
On to Slide 11. Sales in the medical area increased almost 3% excluding FX. A key growth driver was again the increasing use of IV filters with drug infusion pumps. Regulators are recommending precautionary measures to prevent air in the tubing from reaching patients. This trend began to take shape over a year ago and continues to our benefit. Blood also grew almost 4%, driven by increased adoption of new product in the Americas. We saw a good growth in medical in total in the Americas and Asia, while Europe was down mid-single digits. Despite this, orders on a global basis are up 6%.
Slide 12, Food and Bev. Food and Beverage sales increased 4% excluding FX. This was driven by systems. Customers are investing to adhere to global standards for Food and Bev production in the emerging markets. Producers are also highly motivated to reduce unit costs. Sales are down in the large European wine and beer market as producers cut production in response to softer consumer demand. This particularly affects the quality-conscious premium brands, which use more filters. And here, we also sold a non-core asset group in Europe that didn't meet our growth or margin profile. A bit of a comp-ish on the top line throughout the year but it will be offset by slightly higher gross margins. Q1 orders grew a solid 10% within the Food and Bev market.
And now we'll shift to Pall Industrial, where sales increased 14% excluding FX, and we're on Slide 13. The largest region for this segment is in Asia. The business in Asia is largely Microelectronics followed by Energy. We're expecting Microelectronics to have a tough year. And Energy and Water on Slide 14 shows sales in Energy and Water increased over 29%. We saw a comparable growth in both markets. The growth in Energy reflects increases in consumables and capital goods in all regions. The oil and gas and alternative energy end markets were very strong. And we continue to see a lot of investment in capital equipment coming out of the emerging regions. For Pall, this means higher housings and system sales. And we've made progress since the fourth quarter, but we still have much more to do to improve our systems business profile.
Muni Water's strong sales were driven by a large shippable backlog in the Americas and large wastewater project in Australia. The lion's share of our Muni Water business is also driven by regulations. We've been in a cycle of reduced capital spending in Europe for water infrastructure projects the last 2 years and expect this to continue until conditions improve there. But overall, orders in Energy and Water increased almost 22% in the quarter, and this growth is driven principally by the Energy markets.
So now on to Microelectronics. We were expecting volatility in Microelectronics for the year, and that's what we're getting. First quarter sales decreased almost 2%, about what we had anticipated. Q1 orders are down almost 6%, and this filtration-intensive, largely consumables market is cyclical. However, it's technically demanding, which, obviously through the cycle, is good for us. First quarter sales reflect a decline in semiconductor chip production, a corresponding reduction in OEM sales and weakness in the display market. 
There's an additional complicating factor to our outlook. While our sales in Thailand are not material, it accounts for about 25% of the global hard drive output. As a result, many involved in the electronics industry, including us, are bracing for shortages and supply chain interruptions. The impact is difficult to estimate at this time, but we do anticipate that the market may start to improve around the beginning of our fiscal year 2013.
So now on to Slide 16, Aeropower. Aeropower, the combination again of Aerospace and Machinery and Equipment was up 11% excluding FX. Sales in Aerospace increased 10%, driven by the Commercial Aerospace markets, which grew over 14%. This result reflects our strong position on new commercial aircraft, which are now rolling off the assembly lines, as well as an increased aftermarket sales content to the airlines. We're expecting Military Aerospace to have a good year based on a better than $100 million backlog. First quarter sales grew almost 6%. We're not expecting any major program cancellations this year. In fact, Aerospace orders increased 25% in the quarter, with that growth almost entirely in Military.
And finally, in Machinery and Equipment, which along with Microelectronics, has the highest gross margins in the Industrial segment and grew over 12%. This market has grown, at least at this rate, for 6 of the last 7 quarters. Sales continue to be driven by strength in manufacturing and mining applications. We have a decent backlog here, and we saw orders grow 13% in the quarter.
So that concludes my remarks for now. I'm going to turn it over to Lisa."

I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses' results in the quarter. So starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial, where, excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achi",1040,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses' results in the quarter. 
So starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial, where, excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achieving what we believe is our entitlement and price, we did realize about a 20-basis point improvement. Consumables sales increased over 10%. This includes pertinent hardware, or in other words, the housings that hold filters. This growth was propelled by strong growth in Energy and Water and Aeropower. The Energy and Machinery and Equipment components of these markets drove 46% emerging market growth. Likewise, systems grew about 40%, driven by Energy and Water. System sales represented 16% of total Industrial segment sales compared to 13% in the first quarter of last year. And the growth in these markets was partly offset by the decline that Larry mentioned in Microelectronics. 
Now given the mix impact of the top line I just discussed, the end result was that revenues exceeded expectation while gross profit was nominally above expectations. The 220-basis point decrease in Industrial gross margin year-over-year reflects more systems coupled with the decline in MicroE. Importantly, gross margins in the quarter improved sequentially by 180 basis points to 45%, due to better mix and execution. SG&A increased about $11 million, or 13%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were about 18% of sales, increased by about 12%. This increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging countries. 
G&A, which represents about 11% of sales, was up about 14%. And this reflects related infrastructure build for emerging countries, including our Brazilian acquisition, cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian headquarter structure and our IT investments. So segment profit came in at $48 million, and this was about the same, excluding FX, as last year even with the sales growth in the quarter. Accordingly, segment margins decreased to 13.8% from 15.4% last year.
As we started to discuss last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiative to improve Pall Industrial's leverage. We expect to see the benefit of these in the second half of this fiscal year, and I'll address these in further detail when I get to the financial recap in a moment.
So I'm switching now to Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 19. Excluding FX, sales grew 9.5% in the quarter. Pricing was about 1%. Emerging markets growth was 22% and developed regions growth was 8%. Systems grew approximately 50%. And Food and Beverage system sales almost doubled, and in Pharmaceutical, they were up 25%. So systems represented close to 7% of Life Sciences sales compared to 5% last year. Life Sciences' gross margins increased 130 bps to 55.8%. This primarily reflects manufacturing cost-saves and the benefit of exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the Eurozone. Here, segment profit came in at almost $89 million, a 14% increase, excluding FX. Segment margin improved 150 basis points to 25%, yielding 35% incremental margin on top line growth of 9.5%. We believe we're missing 10 points of incremental margin, the result of investments in selling resources reflected in SG&A, IT cost, as well as some yield issues in our facility in Puerto Rico.
Turning now to Slide 20. The end result was that we grew sales by 12% and operating profit by just over 7%, both excluding FX. Not the opening leverage you should, nor do we, expect from our performance. In our current state, we should be achieving at least 25% incremental margins. Thus, we would expect to grow operating profit by between 15% and 20% with this kind of sales growth and achieve operating margin of at least 18%. Longer term, we should be targeting incremental margins in the high 30s to low 40s. This is the beginning of characterizing our aspirational goals for the long term that Larry referred to earlier. 
To that end, last quarter, we announced that we would be implementing several restructuring initiatives early in the year, and that these would likely generate $30 million to $40 million in charges. We reported $25 million of these charges in the first quarter, mostly for cash severance for Pall Industrial. The most significant restructuring activities include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy and Water, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. 
Turning now to income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.9% for the quarter compared to 26.8% last year. Excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges, Pall's underlying tax rate was 24.5%, in line with our full-year outlook. This is the low end of the tax rate we targeted to achieve for fiscal year 2013, and reflects early benefits of our Asian headquarters. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings were $69.5 million or $0.59 per share. This compares to $71.4 million or $0.61 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the appendix slides, were $0.74 compared to $0.62, an increase of 19%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.05. The tax rate contributed about $0.03, supported by costs we're taking above the line, and included in underlying growth, which added about $0.04.
Turning now to Slide 21 and cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $78 million. This 34% increase, or $20 million, was driven by increased earnings exclusive of the restructuring and other items, which had a minimal impact on cash outflows, and continued improvement in working capital management, most significantly in inventories. Significant uses of cash included $70 million in net repayments of debt, $57 million in capital spending, which include significant investment in a new facility in the United Kingdom, including customer support laboratories, $28 million for our acquisition in Brazil and $20 million in dividends to shareholders. 
So wrapping up the discussion on liquidity, our cash position sit at $475 million at quarter end, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9.7%, essentially on par with July 31, 2011. 
That concludes my report. I will now turn this to Larry to talk about our expectations for the full year."
185333,143293742,200465,"Pall Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2011",2011-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low single-digit growth",507,"Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low single-digit growth for Medical and high single-digit growth for BioPharm. In Food and Bev, we now expect low single-digit growth. In Industrial, we now expect the Energy market to deliver high single-digit growth, but the -- with high systems content. We expect Water and Machinery and Equipment to grow by mid-single digits, and Aerospace to deliver high single-digit growth, driven by our current backlog. And our current thinking is that Microelectronics could be down mid-single to as much as low double-digits. 
Let me just go through those again. So I'll repeat. Low single-digit organic growth for both Medical and Food and Bev; high single-digit growth for BioPharm; and then over -- on the Industrial side, Energy, high single-digit; as well as Aerospace is high single-digits; while Water, Machinery and Equipment will be mid single-digit; and Microelectronics, again, down as much as double digit, depending on how the supply chain recovers and how the U.S. consumer behaves here in the short term.
So that said, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 51.25%, EBIT margins to be the range of 17% to 18.5%, with the benefit of the restructuring that Lisa just walked through. We're holding our original guidance, with pro forma EPS expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.32. This includes a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, but also assumes opportunistic stock buybacks of about $150 million, which will, depending on the timing, be accretive to earnings by about $0.03. And finally, a $0.10 benefit from our lower tax rate. Our operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of $490 million to $540 million, and we're estimating about $185 million in CapEx as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, the manufacturing plants and the labs. 
And along those lines, we've spent $57 million in the first quarter, which was mainly already committed capital and not great in terms of CapEx run rate in terms of start to the year. That said, we have made significant investments that will support future growth, and we will change our spending habits. 
So we entered the year with good order and sales momentum. Growth was stronger in the first quarter and yielded a better outcome than our expectation. However, as I said earlier, Lisa said as well, from a leverage perspective, we're not pleased with the quarter. Operating performance, given the strong top line, was anemic. And we need to correct this, and we will. We also need to stress that our first half assumptions remain consistent with our original outlook. And again, our view of full-year EPS expectations remain within the range provided in September. 
So with that and the help of our operator here, we'll take your questions."

There maybe some customer profiles of current system sales that really do cost us more than we properly think about and how we think about return on investment for some of those systems opportunities. And those are fairly small as a percentage of total revenue. So a little bit and not much really to move the needle in terms of total sales. Really, the issue is we need to get a little better frankly at how we sell systems and deal with the longer-term nature of the sale. What becomes typically incremental cost as a function of change orders as systems are spec-ed and built and installed, and make sure that we're bringing something very valuable to the customer that we're getting all that value for it, all that price associated with that value. So it's really, I'd say, it's going to take some time frankly, but it's an ability that we need to build into our organization on both sides of the house, but particularly on the Industrial side, for how we achieve the appropriate price for our system sales. And I'd get back to my earlier comments and that -- those were applicable to consumables as well on how we achieve price more generally. In terms of how we get to high 30s incremental margins, beyond just what the price portion of that needs to look like, good news is we can leverage our current operating footprint. We don't need to expand that. And we can do a better job, frankly, in terms of operating performance within our existing facilities. And Lisa talked a little bit about in the quarter how one of them, our largest facility, in particular, in Puerto Rico, did cost us a fair amount in terms of just basic operating and manufacturing performance.

I would say that neither Lisa nor I think it was a great quarter, and maybe that frames up one element of how we want to think about our company a little differently going forward. Now I'm proud of the team. I think we've got a great team who's working very hard and doing some very, very good things. But structurally, we need to get our hands around how that kind of organic top line growth generates a lot more incremental profitability, and that model needs to be not so short-term focused, but certainly the operating leverage that we both harped on is an important element of how we need to modify the thinking of how our team operates. At the same time, we're going to aggressively reinvest in the business, and that's both organically as well as acquisitively. And we've got a long list of organic initiatives that we're honing down to the things that we think really move the needle, things that need to get done in terms of new product and other initiatives to expand our global reach and things that we want to do to improve our profile more generally. From an acquisitive perspective, in terms of difference going forward, I think that we definitely need to prepare ourselves first, and then be very thoughtful and very disciplined. But ultimately, execute a much more aggressive capital deployment strategy. And we need to allocate primarily toward how we grow the business, and then what we can do otherwise in terms of balancing the shareholder return, short and long term. In terms of how I think about the allocation of that capital across the business in terms of simple Life Sciences versus Industrial, clearly, the profile of Life Sciences is very attractive. How we build out Life Sciences is got to be a bit artful, frankly. I won't get into too much detail because competition listens to these calls too. But we've -- I think at the beginning of line of sight toward how we can do that, with strong presence in the lab continuing, the instrument leads and the consumables are leveraged by way of it and how we can, in combination with good acquisitive pieces that we already have our sights on plus organic buildout, continue to extend the capability first in BioPharm to support some of that core biotech, but also in the other Life Science applications. On the Industrial side, it's a little bit of a different M&A opportunity set. And there, frankly, it's about going after the higher growth niches and making sure that we have the best possible presence and the most attractive subsets today, which obviously includes Microelectronics and some of the other segments that were well penetrated but we certainly could stand to grow share. On top of all of that, I think there's both acquisitive opportunities and organic initiatives again that can improve our global reach, particularly in the emerging markets, and allow us better local operational support for fast customer turn time in those areas. And if you think about then, so what does the -- if you look a few years out, if you were -- if you had the benefit of that point in time in hindsight looking at what we did, we'll comprise a balance of certainly Life Science investments to drive the growth profile of the company, continued I would call it more of a bolt on-like approach or niche approach in the Industrial side to drive the highest growth and most attractive strategic positions within Industrial. And then supplementing that with what we can do, again, organically and acquisitively, to get that -- to get a global reach."

So given the pretty strong order growth in this quarter, can you maybe just talk about your more -- obviously, a bit more tempered view for the rest of the year, given the annual rates that you kept at in terms of your outlook? Can you maybe just talk a little bit about that?"

But we won't and we don't expect that to continue at the same rate for the full year. And I think that's current view, if you will, also. We're a month into the next quarter. The issue is obviously we're taking a kind of watchful approach toward what happens in Europe, while we think again that BioPharm in particular but some of the rest of our business is somewhat insulated from the more macroeconomic issues in Europe, still there's going to be an impact. And we talked about concerns on the Life Science side, Food and Bev and Medical in Europe, and on the Industrial side about half of that total segment that does have a direct and immediate impact as a function of overall macroeconomic performance. So that's point number one. And point number two is the wildcard around what happens within MicroE. And I'd tell you right now that I think it's not dire by any means. If the U.S. consumer buys a lot of electronics over the Christmas season or the holiday season here then that will help. And if the supply chain that finds its way through Thailand doesn't fall apart for a long period of time, it doesn't look like it will, that'll help. But we're certainly going to see a couple of quarters of pretty slow performance. And again, not just the top line, but it's a pretty profitable segment, the most profitable segment within Industrial."

I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. 
We'll review the quarter and our outlook in a moment, but before that, I want to answer some questions that I've received in recurring form since I joined the company in October.
First, why did I come to Pall? Second, what should you expect from me or us in the short and long term? And where do I stand in our externally stated goals for 2013? 
So first, what drew me to Pall? The answer is simple: It's a unique prospect. I left IDEX, a great company in really good shape, for the opportunity to build Pall into the company that I believe it can be. I see Pall as a huge long-term value creation opportunity, and I'd like you to think about it that way as well. Clearly, we have work to do. Some of it's foundational in nature, and it's going to take some time. But Pall is already a good company with the potential to be one of the best global technology enterprises.
Opportunities to lead a company that serve great markets with differentiated technology, with strong global reach and a dedicated team, well, those just don't come along every day. As shown on our Slide 5, our business model includes high barriers to entry. More than 2/3 of our sales are consumable purchases that are largely nondiscretionary decisions.
Beyond the business model, add our technology, brand leadership, strong customer relationships and applications expertise and a global sales channel that's arguably the best of any company in our space, these characteristics combined deliver a great profile. And the company has the girth, and that's the presence and the fixed cost structure to grow.
We're going to be working to develop our Pall Enterprise System to drive improved process and operational execution. We should be able to drive significantly more volume through our manufacturing plants, more products through our sales organization and new technology to our customers. And last but not least, we have a terrific balance sheet that provides tremendous flexibility and can be deployed for growth. We also have a substantial amount of cash tied up in working capital. 
We will move to a more aggressive capital allocation strategy in the future. But the operative word is strategy. It's not a desire to just become highly acquisitive. Our investments will be thoughtful and disciplined to enhance our offering and to accelerate growth.
So that's why I'm here, and now what are we going to do? And I'm on to Slide 6 on your deck. Focus is one of the other very key and operative words for us. We have some fundamental issues that we need to either address or drive to completion. They all center around people, process and technology. All of our efforts are designed to drive improvements in consistency and operating performance.
First, we're evaluating our organization’s structure, have already reworked our executive incentive plans. Executive compensation with the recent change is now based on multiple metrics to better align our leadership with growing the company, executing our focused agenda and driving shareholder return.
Second, we're building our corporate business development team to establish core acquisition capability, but also to augment Pall's organic strategies in the most attractive end markets. We'll be investing in the skills necessary to integrate these new acquisitions as well. In the short term, you can expect that we'll only acquire opportunistically where we intend to operate the new business with pre-existing leadership. And given that, we'll continue to accumulate cash and execute our repurchase program as previously announced. We'll also be enhancing our capabilities to tap into the faster growing regions. We're currently shifting resources from mature to expanding economies. 
So those are the key initiatives around people. Now in terms of process, we've spoken externally about our global ERP system project. Europe and Asia are up and running now. We'll be bringing the Americas online by the end of the fiscal year. However, we need to develop the architecture of a business system that the ERP system is the enabler for. Our business system, or what we again will now refer to as the Pall Enterprise System, will be the means for how we drive process improvement, customer relationship improvement and shareholder return. 
We're shifting from a country-based operations in terms of structure to 3 regional fulfillment centers. Once complete, we'll be able to provide better and faster commercial and technical support. At the same time, it will allow us to better leverage our fixed cost structure.
And finally, technology. I believe that we can tremendously improve our product vitality. Our R&D investment appears to be adequate. It’s a matter of better choices, organizational effectiveness and new product development based on good cross-functional process, which we're addressing in our marketing and design groups.
So we have a few very critical company-wide priorities that will solidify our foundation and allow us to further develop this gem of a company. I can't stress enough, it's going to take time to see recognizable differences on how the company performs, but I'm highly confident we'll get there.
Now before getting into the first quarter review, I want to tell you where I stand on the previously committed 2013 goals that were first presented in 2009. I don't believe that executives or a CEO, in my case, should arrive and provide excuses or hit the reset button. So the goals are the goals. The current macroeconomic environment certainly makes some of them more challenging, but our team has executed well and we're in range for most of the stated goals. 
If the global economy continues to slow, we may have to adjust our fixed cost structure to achieve our stated profitability targets. That said, I will always balance the short- versus the long-term needs of the company with a bias toward growth. We are currently evaluating how we will characterize our aspirational goals for the longer term, given the economic outlook, and our ability to improve our performance. And we'll discuss this further in our earnings calls to come, but also Lisa's also -- she's got a couple of comments in her prepared remarks here shortly.
So now what happened in the quarter? Now we're on to Slide 7. First, we achieved very good top line growth. Sales crossed the $700 million mark in the first quarter for the first time. Total sales grew almost 17% on an as-reported basis and 12% excluding FX. Business was split about 50-50 between Life Sciences and Industrial. We saw a good growth across the major markets, with the exception of Microelectronics. 
Sales in the Americas increased almost 11%, with Latin America a key contributor. Europe was up 11%, marking 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Some of this is coming from large Pharmaceutical customers in Western Europe, while the aggressive investment in the Middle East is another driving force, and remember that we account for the Middle East and Europe. 
Sales in Asia increased 14%. This growth came from throughout the region. Emerging regions were just under 20% of sales for the quarter and grew about 35%. Pall is already in good position to seize these global sales opportunities. We're counting on these markets to fuel our growth, and we'll be aggressively weighting our investments to extend our reach.
On to Slide 8. We also experienced healthy orders in the quarter. Orders increased 11% overall and grew by double digits in all 3 regions. Most markets were up. Consumables demand increased 9% and orders for systems grew 28%. Backlog is up 14% year-over-year. Customers in the Energy markets continued to invest aggressively in capital equipment to increase output and lower operating costs. We saw systems orders increase almost 200% in these markets, reflecting significant growth in Latin America and MENA. Systems orders in Food and Bev and BioPharm grew over 25%. So while there are clearly economic uncertainties across the global stage, this continued willingness to invest is a great sign.
Before I comment on the segment performance, I want to make it clear that while I'm pleased with our sales and our orders performance, we should and will demonstrate much better operating flowthrough or incremental profit on the incremental organic sales. We have a number of issues to address, and they're all within our control.
So now, I'm going to move to Slide 9. And talk about Life Sciences first. Sales in Life Sciences increased 9.5% excluding FX. Just under half of this business is in Europe and is dominated by BioPharm. Although BioPharm is not immune to the economic cycle, it is resilient, and BioPharm grew 22% in the first quarter in Europe and orders were up double digits. BioPharm at 28% of first quarter sales is the engine of our Life Sciences business. 
On a global basis, sales grew 16% excluding FX. Consumables represented over 90% of the total, while systems sales, which feed future annuities, increased over 25%. First quarter orders increased 9%. And the BioPharm market, as you know, is driven by biotech. This market is global, fast-growing, filtration-intensive, has high barriers to entry and is bound by stringent regulation.
On to Slide 11. Sales in the medical area increased almost 3% excluding FX. A key growth driver was again the increasing use of IV filters with drug infusion pumps. Regulators are recommending precautionary measures to prevent air in the tubing from reaching patients. This trend began to take shape over a year ago and continues to our benefit. Blood also grew almost 4%, driven by increased adoption of new product in the Americas. We saw a good growth in medical in total in the Americas and Asia, while Europe was down mid-single digits. Despite this, orders on a global basis are up 6%.
Slide 12, Food and Bev. Food and Beverage sales increased 4% excluding FX. This was driven by systems. Customers are investing to adhere to global standards for Food and Bev production in the emerging markets. Producers are also highly motivated to reduce unit costs. Sales are down in the large European wine and beer market as producers cut production in response to softer consumer demand. This particularly affects the quality-conscious premium brands, which use more filters. And here, we also sold a non-core asset group in Europe that didn't meet our growth or margin profile. A bit of a comp issue on the top line throughout the year but it will be offset by slightly higher gross margins. Q1 orders grew a solid 10% within the Food and Bev market.
And now we'll shift to Pall Industrial, where sales increased 14% excluding FX, and we're on Slide 13. The largest region for this segment is in Asia. The business in Asia is largely Microelectronics followed by Energy. We're expecting Microelectronics to have a tough year. And Energy and Water on Slide 14 shows sales in Energy and Water increased over 29%. We saw a comparable growth in both markets. The growth in Energy reflects increases in consumables and capital goods in all regions. The oil and gas and alternative energy end markets were very strong. And we continue to see a lot of investment in capital equipment coming out of the emerging regions. For Pall, this means higher housings and system sales. And we've made progress since the fourth quarter, but we still have much more to do to improve our systems business profile.
Muni Water's strong sales were driven by a large shippable backlog in the Americas and large wastewater project in Australia. The lion's share of our Muni Water business is also driven by regulations. We've been in a cycle of reduced capital spending in Europe for water infrastructure projects the last 2 years and expect this to continue until conditions improve there. But overall, orders in Energy and Water increased almost 22% in the quarter, and this growth is driven principally by the Energy markets.
So now on to Microelectronics. We were expecting volatility in Microelectronics for the year, and that's what we're getting. First quarter sales decreased almost 2%, about what we had anticipated. Q1 orders are down almost 6%, and this filtration-intensive, largely consumables market is cyclical. However, it's technically demanding, which, obviously through the cycle, is good for us. First quarter sales reflect a decline in semiconductor chip production, a corresponding reduction in OEM sales and weakness in the display market. 
There's an additional complicating factor to our outlook. While our sales in Thailand are not material, it accounts for about 25% of the global hard drive output. As a result, many involved in the electronics industry, including us, are bracing for shortages and supply chain interruptions. The impact is difficult to estimate at this time, but we do anticipate that the market may start to improve around the beginning of our fiscal year 2013.
So now on to Slide 16, Aeropower. Aeropower, the combination again of Aerospace and Machinery and Equipment was up 11% excluding FX. Sales in Aerospace increased 10%, driven by the Commercial Aerospace markets, which grew over 14%. This result reflects our strong position on new commercial aircraft, which are now rolling off the assembly lines, as well as an increased aftermarket sales content to the airlines. We're expecting Military Aerospace to have a good year based on a better than $100 million backlog. First quarter sales grew almost 6%. We're not expecting any major program cancellations this year. In fact, Aerospace orders increased 25% in the quarter, with that growth almost entirely in Military.
And finally, in Machinery and Equipment, which along with Microelectronics, has the highest gross margins in the Industrial segment and grew over 12%. This market has grown, at least at this rate, for 6 of the last 7 quarters. Sales continue to be driven by strength in manufacturing and mining applications. We have a decent backlog here, and we saw orders grow 13% in the quarter.
So that concludes my remarks for now. I'm going to turn it over to Lisa."
185333,143293742,200539,"Pall Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2011",2011-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses' results in the quarter. So starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial, where, excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achi",1041,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses' results in the quarter. 
So starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial, where, excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achieving what we believe is our entitlement on price, we did realize about a 20-basis point improvement. Consumables sales increased over 10%. This includes the pertinent hardware, or in other words, the housings that hold filters. This growth was propelled by strong growth in Energy and Water and Aeropower. The Energy and Machinery and Equipment components of these markets drove 46% emerging market growth. Likewise, systems grew about 40%, driven by Energy and Water. System sales represented 16% of total Industrial segment sales compared to 13% in the first quarter of last year. And the growth in these markets was partly offset by the decline that Larry mentioned in Microelectronics. 
Now given the mix impact of the top line I just discussed, the end result was that revenues exceeded expectation while gross profit was nominally above expectations. The 220-basis point decrease in Industrial gross margin year-over-year reflects more systems coupled with the decline in MicroE. Importantly, gross margins in the quarter improved sequentially by 180 basis points to 45%, due to better mix and execution. SG&A increased about $11 million, or 13%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were about 18% of sales, increased by about 12%. This increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging countries. 
G&A, which represents about 11% of sales, was up about 14%. And this reflects related infrastructure build for emerging countries, including our Brazilian acquisition, cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian headquarter structure and our IT investments. So segment profit came in at $48 million, and this was about the same, excluding FX, as last year even with the sales growth in the quarter. Accordingly, segment margins decreased to 13.8% from 15.4% last year.
As we started to discuss last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve Pall Industrial's leverage. We expect to see the benefit of these in the second half of this fiscal year, and I'll address these in further detail when I get to the financial recap in a moment.
So I'm switching now to Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 19. Excluding FX, sales grew 9.5% in the quarter. Pricing was about 1%. Emerging markets growth was 22% and developed regions growth was 8%. Systems grew approximately 50%. And Food and Beverage system sales almost doubled, and in Pharmaceutical, they were up 25%. So systems represented close to 7% of Life Sciences sales compared to 5% last year. Life Sciences' gross margins increased 130 bps to 55.8%. This primarily reflects manufacturing cost-saves and the benefit of exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the Eurozone. Here, segment profit came in at almost $89 million, a 14% increase, excluding FX. Segment margin improved 150 basis points to 25%, yielding 35% incremental margin on top line growth of 9.5%. We believe we're missing 10 points of incremental margin, the result of investments in selling resources reflected in SG&A, IT cost, as well as some yield issues in our facility in Puerto Rico.
Turning now to Slide 20. The end result was that we grew sales by 12% and operating profit by just over 7%, both excluding FX. Not the operating leverage you should, nor do we, expect from our performance. In our current state, we should be achieving at least 25% incremental margins. Thus, we would expect to grow operating profit by between 15% and 20% with this kind of sales growth and achieve operating margin of at least 18%. Longer term, we should be targeting incremental margins in the high 30s to low 40s. This is the beginning of characterizing our aspirational goals for the long term that Larry referred to earlier. 
To that end, last quarter, we announced that we would be implementing several restructuring initiatives early in the year, and that these would likely generate $30 million to $40 million in charges. We reported $25 million of these charges in the first quarter, mostly for cash severance for Pall Industrial. The most significant restructuring activities include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy and Water, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. 
Turning now to income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.9% for the quarter compared to 26.8% last year. Excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges, Pall's underlying tax rate was 24.5%, in line with our full-year outlook. This is the low end of the tax rate we targeted to achieve for fiscal year 2013, and reflects early benefits of our Asian headquarters. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings were $69.5 million or $0.59 per share. This compares to $71.4 million or $0.61 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the appendix slides, were $0.74 compared to $0.62, an increase of 19%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.05. The tax rate contributed about $0.03, supported by costs we're taking above the line, and included in underlying growth, which added about $0.04.
Turning now to Slide 21 and cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $78 million. This 34% increase, or $20 million, was driven by increased earnings exclusive of the restructuring and other items, which had a minimal impact on cash outflows, and continued improvement in working capital management, most significantly in inventories. Significant uses of cash included $70 million in net repayments of debt, $57 million in capital spending, which include significant investment in a new facility in the United Kingdom, including customer support laboratories, $28 million for our acquisition in Brazil and $20 million in dividends to shareholders. 
So wrapping up the discussion on liquidity, our cash position sit at $475 million at quarter end, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9.7%, essentially on par with July 31, 2011. 
That concludes my report. I will now turn this to Larry to talk about our expectations for the full year."
185333,143293742,200539,"Pall Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2011",2011-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single digit growth",509,"Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single digit growth for Medical and high-single digit growth for BioPharm. In Food and Bev, we now expect low-single digit growth. In Industrial, we now expect the Energy market to deliver high-single digit growth, but the -- with high systems content. We expect Water and Machinery and Equipment to grow by mid-single digits, and Aerospace to deliver high-single digit growth, driven by our current backlog. And our current thinking is that Microelectronics could be down mid-single to as much as low-double digits. 
Let me just go through those again. So I'll repeat. Low-single digit organic growth for both Medical and Food and Bev; high-single digit growth for BioPharm; and then over -- on the Industrial side, Energy, high-single digit; as well as Aerospace is high-single digits; while Water, Machinery and Equipment will be mid-single digit; and Microelectronics, again, down as much as double digit, depending on how the supply chain recovers and how the U.S. consumer behaves here in the short term.
So that said, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 51.25%, EBIT margins to be in the range of 17% to 18.5%, with the benefit of the restructuring that Lisa just walked through. We're holding our original guidance, with pro forma EPS expected to be in a range of $3.07 to $3.32. This includes a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, but also assumes opportunistic stock buybacks of about $150 million, which will, depending on the timing, be accretive to earnings by about $0.03. And finally, a $0.10 benefit from our lower tax rate. Our operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $490 million to $540 million, and we're estimating about $185 million in CapEx as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, the manufacturing plants and the labs. 
And along those lines, we've spent $57 million in the first quarter, which was mainly already committed capital and not great in terms of CapEx run rate in terms of start to the year. That said, we have made significant investments that will support future growth, and we will change our spending habits. 
So we entered the year with good order and sales momentum. Growth was stronger in the first quarter and yielded a better outcome than our expectation. However, as I said earlier, Lisa said as well, from a leverage perspective, we're not pleased with the quarter. Operating performance, given the strong top line, was anemic. And we need to correct this, and we will. We also need to stress that our first half assumptions remain consistent with our original outlook. And again, our view of full year EPS expectations remain within the range provided in September. 
So with that and the help of our operator here, we'll take your questions."

I think the biggest overarching comment I would make is that we as an organization can and need to do a better job in how we value-sell the great capability that we've got, because we've got -- as you know, we've got a very differentiated technology, we've got great applications expertise, we've got great support lab capability in the field. We're able to essentially gain the spec, the technical spec for most of those applications, and I think there's frankly a better opportunity to achieve price as part of that process. How do I quantify that to get back to the third portion of your question? I think it's a bit early, frankly. I could set you some aspirational goals at this point, but I think it'd be better just to say that there's plenty of opportunity as we continue to grow."

There may be some customer profiles of current system sales that really do cost us more than we properly think about and how we think about return on investment for some of those systems opportunities. And those are fairly small as a percentage of total revenue. So a little bit and not much to really move the needle in terms of total sales. Really, the issue is we need to get a little better frankly at how we sell systems and deal with the longer-term nature of the sale. What becomes typically incremental cost as a function of change orders as systems are spec-ed and built and installed, and make sure that where we're bringing something very valuable to the customer that we're getting all that value for it, all that price associated with that value. So it's really, I'd say, it's going to take some time frankly, but it's an ability that we need to build into our organization on both sides of the house, but particularly on the Industrial side, for how we achieve the appropriate price for our system sales. And again, back to my earlier comments and those were applicable to consumables as well on how we achieve price more generally. In terms of how we get to high 30s incremental margins, beyond just what the price portion of that needs to look like, the good news is we can leverage our current operating footprint. We don't need to expand that. And we can do a better job, frankly, in terms of operating performance within our existing facilities. And Lisa talked a little bit about in the quarter how one of them, our largest facility, in particular, in Puerto Rico, did cost us a fair amount in terms of just basic operating and manufacturing performance. So how quickly we get there? Not this year. But I do think that we have that opportunity in 2013."

I would say that neither Lisa nor I think it was a great quarter, and maybe that frames up one element of how we want to think about our company a little differently going forward. Now I'm proud of the team. I think that we've got a great team who's working very hard and doing some very, very good things. But structurally, we need to get our hands around how that kind of organic top line growth generates a lot more incremental profitability, and that model needs to be not so short-term focused, but certainly the operating leverage that we both harped on is an important element of how we need to modify the thinking of how our team operates. At the same time, we're going to aggressively reinvest in the business, and that's both organically as well as acquisitively. And we've got a long list of organic initiatives that we're honing down to the things that we think really move the needle, things that need to get done in terms of new product and other initiatives to expand our global reach and things that we want to do to improve our profile more generally. From an acquisitive perspective, in terms of difference going forward, I think that we definitely need to prepare ourselves first, and then be very thoughtful and very disciplined. But ultimately, execute a much more aggressive capital deployment strategy. And we need to allocate primarily toward how we grow the business, and then what we can do otherwise in terms of balancing the shareholder return, short and long term. In terms of how I think about the allocation of that capital across the business in terms of simple Life Sciences versus Industrial, clearly, the profile of Life Sciences is very attractive. How we build out Life Sciences has got to be a bit artful, frankly. I won't get into too much detail because competition listens to these calls too. But we've, I think, got the beginning of a line of sight toward how we can do that, with strong presence in the lab continuing, the instrument leads and the consumables are leveraged by way of it and how we can, in combination with good acquisitive pieces that we already have our sights on plus organic buildout, continue to extend the capability first in BioPharm to support some of that core biotech, but also in the other Life Science applications. On the Industrial side, it's a little bit of a different M&A opportunity set. And there, frankly, it's about going after the higher growth niches and making sure that we have the best possible presence and the most attractive subsets today, which obviously includes Microelectronics and some of the other segments that we’re well penetrated but we certainly could stand to grow share. On top of all that, I think there's both acquisitive opportunities and organic initiatives again that can improve our global reach, particularly in the emerging markets, and allow us better local operational support for fast customer turn time in those areas. And if you think about then, so what does the -- if you look a few years out, if you were -- if you had the benefit of that point in time in hindsight looking at what we did, it'll comprise a balance of certainly Life Science investments to drive the growth profile of the company, continued I would call it more of a bolt on-like approach or niche approach in the Industrial side to drive the highest growth and most attractive strategic positions within Industrial. And then supplementing that with what we can do, again, organically and acquisitively, to get that global reach."

The issue is obviously we're taking a kind of watchful approach toward what happens in Europe, while we think again that BioPharm in particular but some of the rest of our business is somewhat insulated from the more macroeconomic issues in Europe, still there's going to be an impact. And we talked about concerns on the Life Science side, Food and Bev and Medical in Europe, and on the Industrial side about half of that total segment that does have a direct and immediate impact as a function of overall macroeconomic performance. So that's point number one. And point number two is the wildcard around what happens within MicroE. And I'd tell you right now that I think it's not dire by any means. If the U.S. consumer buys a lot of electronics over the Christmas season or the holiday season here then that will help. And if the supply chain that finds its way through Thailand doesn't fall apart for a long period of time, it doesn't look like it will, that'll help.

We'll review the quarter and",2368,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. So this is my first conference call as Pall's CEO, and I'm delighted to be with the company. I'm here today with Lisa McDermott, our CFO; and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. 
We'll review the quarter and our outlook in a moment, but before that, I want to answer some questions that I've received in recurring form since I joined the company in October.
First, why did I come to Pall? Second, what should you expect from me or us in the short and long term? And where do I stand in our externally stated goals for 2013? 
So first, what drew me to Pall? The answer is simple: It's a unique prospect. I left IDEX, a great company in really good shape, for the opportunity to build Pall into the company that I believe it can be. I see Pall as a huge long-term value creation opportunity, and I'd like you to think about it that way as well. Clearly, we have work to do. Some of it's foundational in nature, and it's going to take some time. But Pall is already a good company with the potential to be one of the best global technology enterprises.
Opportunities to lead a company that serve great markets with differentiated technology, with strong global reach and a dedicated team, well, those just don't come along every day. As shown on our Slide 5, our business model includes high barriers to entry. More than 2/3 of our sales are consumable purchases that are largely nondiscretionary decisions.
Beyond the business model, add our technology, brand leadership, strong customer relationships and applications expertise and a global sales channel that's arguably the best of any company in our space, these characteristics combined deliver a great profile. And the company has the girth, and that's the presence and the fixed cost structure to grow.
We're going to be working to develop our Pall Enterprise System to drive improved process and operational execution. We should be able to drive significantly more volume through our manufacturing plants, more products through our sales organization and new technology to our customers. And last but not least, we have a terrific balance sheet that provides tremendous flexibility and can be deployed for growth. We also have a substantial amount of cash tied up in working capital. 
We will move to a more aggressive capital allocation strategy in the future. But the operative word is strategy. It's not a desire to just become highly acquisitive. Our investments will be thoughtful and disciplined to enhance our offering and to accelerate growth.
So that's why I'm here, and now what are we going to do? And I'm on to Slide 6 on your deck. Focus is one of the other very key and operative words for us. We have some fundamental issues that we need to either address or drive to completion. They all center around people, process and technology. All of our efforts are designed to drive improvements in consistency and operating performance.
First, we're evaluating our organization’s structure, have already reworked our executive incentive plans. Executive compensation with the recent change is now based on multiple metrics to better align our leadership with growing the company, executing our focused agenda and driving shareholder return.
Second, we're building our corporate business development team to establish core acquisition capability, but also to augment Pall's organic strategies in the most attractive end markets. We'll be investing in the skills necessary to integrate these new acquisitions as well. In the short term, you can expect that we'll only acquire opportunistically where we intend to operate the new business with pre-existing leadership. And given that, we'll continue to accumulate cash and execute our repurchase program as previously announced. We'll also be enhancing our capabilities to tap into the faster growing regions. We're currently shifting resources from mature to expanding economies. 
So those are the key initiatives around people. Now in terms of process, we've spoken externally about our global ERP system project. Europe and Asia are up and running now. We'll be bringing the Americas online by the end of the fiscal year. However, we need to develop the architecture of a business system that the ERP system is the enabler for. Our business system, or what we again will now refer to as the Pall Enterprise System, will be the means for how we drive process improvement, customer relationship improvement and shareholder return. 
We're shifting from a country-based operations in terms of structure to 3 regional fulfillment centers. Once complete, we'll be able to provide better and faster commercial and technical support. At the same time, it will allow us to better leverage our fixed cost structure.
And finally, technology. I believe that we can tremendously improve our product vitality. Our R&D investment appears to be adequate. It’s a matter of better choices, organizational effectiveness and new product development based on good cross-functional process, which we're addressing in our marketing and design groups.
So we have a few very critical company-wide priorities that will solidify our foundation and allow us to further develop this gem of a company. I can't stress enough, it's going to take time to see recognizable differences on how the company performs, but I'm highly confident we'll get there.
Now before getting into the first quarter review, I want to tell you where I stand on the previously committed 2013 goals that were first presented in 2009. I don't believe that executives or a CEO, in my case, should arrive and provide excuses or hit the reset button. So the goals are the goals. The current macroeconomic environment certainly makes some of them more challenging, but our team has executed well and we're in range for most of the stated goals. 
If the global economy continues to slow, we may have to adjust our fixed cost structure to achieve our stated profitability targets. That said, I will always balance the short- versus the long-term needs of the company with a bias toward growth. We are currently evaluating how we will characterize our aspirational goals for the longer term, given the economic outlook, and our ability to improve our performance. And we'll discuss this further in our earnings calls to come, but also Lisa's also -- she's got a couple of comments in her prepared remarks here shortly.
So now what happened in the quarter? Now we're on to Slide 7. First, we achieved very good top line growth. Sales crossed the $700 million mark in the first quarter for the first time. Total sales grew almost 17% on an as-reported basis and 12% excluding FX. Business was split about 50-50 between Life Sciences and Industrial. We saw a good growth across the major markets, with the exception of Microelectronics. 
Sales in the Americas increased almost 11%, with Latin America a key contributor. Europe was up 11%, marking 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Some of this is coming from large Pharmaceutical customers in Western Europe, while the aggressive investment in the Middle East is another driving force, and remember that we account for the Middle East and Europe. 
Sales in Asia increased 14%. This growth came from throughout the region. Emerging regions were just under 20% of sales for the quarter and grew about 35%. Pall is already in good position to seize these global sales opportunities. We're counting on these markets to fuel our growth, and we'll be aggressively weighting our investments to extend our reach.
On to Slide 8. We also experienced healthy orders in the quarter. Orders increased 11% overall and grew by double digits in all 3 regions. Most markets were up. Consumables demand increased 9% and orders for systems grew 28%. Backlog is up 14% year-over-year. Customers in the Energy markets continued to invest aggressively in capital equipment to increase output and lower operating costs. We saw systems orders increase almost 200% in these markets, reflecting significant growth in Latin America and MENA. Systems orders in Food and Bev and BioPharm grew over 25%. So while there are clearly economic uncertainties across the global stage, this continued willingness to invest is a great sign.
Before I comment on the segment performance, I want to make it clear that while I'm pleased with our sales and our orders performance, we should and will demonstrate much better operating flow-through or incremental profit on the incremental organic sales. We have a number of issues to address, and they're all within our control.
So now, I'm going to move to Slide 9. And talk about Life Sciences first. Sales in Life Sciences increased 9.5% excluding FX. Just under half of this business is in Europe and is dominated by BioPharm. Although BioPharm is not immune to the economic cycle, it is resilient, and BioPharm grew 22% in the first quarter in Europe and orders were up double digits. BioPharm at 28% of first quarter sales is the engine of our Life Sciences business. 
On a global basis, sales grew 16% excluding FX. Consumables represented over 90% of the total, while systems sales, which feed future annuities, increased over 25%. First quarter orders increased 9%. And the BioPharm market, as you know, is driven by biotech. This market is global, fast-growing, filtration-intensive, has high barriers to entry and is bound by stringent regulation.
On to Slide 11. Sales in the medical area increased almost 3% excluding FX. A key growth driver was again the increasing use of IV filters with drug infusion pumps. Regulators are recommending precautionary measures to prevent air in the tubing from reaching patients. This trend began to take shape over a year ago and continues to our benefit. Blood also grew almost 4%, driven by increased adoption of new product in the Americas. We saw a good growth in medical in total in the Americas and Asia, while Europe was down mid-single digits. Despite this, orders on a global basis are up 6%.
Slide 12, Food and Bev. Food and Beverage sales increased 4% excluding FX. This was driven by systems. Customers are investing to adhere to global standards for Food and Bev production in the emerging markets. Producers are also highly motivated to reduce unit costs. Sales are down in the large European wine and beer market as producers cut production in response to softer consumer demand. This particularly affects the quality-conscious premium brands, which use more filters. And here, we also sold a non-core asset group in Europe that didn't meet our growth or margin profile. A bit of a comp issue on the top line throughout the year but it will be offset by slightly higher gross margins. Q1 orders grew a solid 10% within the Food and Bev market.
And now we'll shift to Pall Industrial, where sales increased 14% excluding FX, and we're on Slide 13. The largest region for this segment is in Asia. The business in Asia is largely Microelectronics followed by Energy. We're expecting Microelectronics to have a tough year. And Energy and Water on Slide 14 shows sales in Energy and Water increased over 29%. We saw a comparable growth in both markets. The growth in Energy reflects increases in consumables and capital goods in all regions. The oil and gas and alternative energy end markets were very strong. And we continue to see a lot of investment in capital equipment coming out of the emerging regions. For Pall, this means higher housings and system sales. And we've made progress since the fourth quarter, but we still have much more to do to improve our systems business profile.
Muni Water's strong sales were driven by a large shippable backlog in the Americas and large wastewater project in Australia. The lion's share of our Muni Water business is also driven by regulations. We've been in a cycle of reduced capital spending in Europe for water infrastructure projects the last 2 years and expect this to continue until conditions improve there. But overall, orders in Energy and Water increased almost 22% in the quarter, and this growth is driven principally by the Energy markets.
So now on to Microelectronics. We were expecting volatility in Microelectronics for the year, and that's what we're getting. First quarter sales decreased almost 2%, about what we had anticipated. Q1 orders are down almost 6%, and this filtration-intensive, largely consumables market is cyclical. However, it's technically demanding, which, obviously through the cycle, is good for us. First quarter sales reflect a decline in semiconductor chip production, a corresponding reduction in OEM sales and weakness in the display market. 
There's an additional complicating factor to our outlook. While our sales in Thailand are not material, it accounts for about 25% of the global hard drive output. As a result, many involved in the electronics industry, including us, are bracing for shortages and supply chain interruptions. The impact is difficult to estimate at this time, but we do anticipate that the market may start to improve around the beginning of our fiscal year 2013.
So now on to Slide 16, Aeropower. Aeropower, the combination again of Aerospace and Machinery and Equipment was up 11% excluding FX. Sales in Aerospace increased 10%, driven by the Commercial Aerospace markets, which grew over 14%. This result reflects our strong position on new commercial aircraft, which are now rolling off the assembly lines, as well as an increased aftermarket sales content to the airlines. We're expecting Military Aerospace to have a good year based on a better than $100 million backlog. First quarter sales grew almost 6%. We're not expecting any major program cancellations this year. In fact, Aerospace orders increased 25% in the quarter, with that growth almost entirely in Military.
And finally, in Machinery and Equipment, which along with Microelectronics, has the highest gross margins in the Industrial segment and grew over 12%. This market has grown, at least at this rate, for 6 of the last 7 quarters. Sales continue to be driven by strength in manufacturing and mining applications. We have a decent backlog here, and we saw orders grow 13% in the quarter.
So that concludes my remarks for now. I'm going to turn it over to Lisa."

I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses' results in the quarter. So starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial, where, excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achi",1041,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of each of the businesses' results in the quarter. 
So starting on Slide 18 with Pall Industrial, where, excluding foreign exchange, sales grew 14%. And while we're still not achieving what we believe is our entitlement on price, we did realize about a 20-basis point improvement. Consumables sales increased over 10%. This includes the pertinent hardware, or in other words, the housings that hold filters. This growth was propelled by strong growth in Energy and Water and Aeropower. The Energy and Machinery and Equipment components of these markets drove 46% emerging market growth. Likewise, systems grew about 40%, driven by Energy and Water. System sales represented 16% of total Industrial segment sales compared to 13% in the first quarter of last year. And the growth in these markets was partly offset by the decline that Larry mentioned in Microelectronics. 
Now given the mix impact of the top line I just discussed, the end result was that revenues exceeded expectation while gross profit was nominally above expectations. The 220-basis point decrease in Industrial gross margin year-over-year reflects more systems coupled with the decline in MicroE. Importantly, gross margins in the quarter improved sequentially by 180 basis points to 45%, due to better mix and execution. SG&A increased about $11 million, or 13%, excluding FX in the quarter. Selling expenses, which were about 18% of sales, increased by about 12%. This increase was driven by resource deployment into emerging countries. 
G&A, which represents about 11% of sales, was up about 14%. And this reflects related infrastructure build for emerging countries, including our Brazilian acquisition, cost to bring Pall Industrial into our European and Asian headquarter structure and our IT investments. So segment profit came in at $48 million, and this was about the same, excluding FX, as last year even with the sales growth in the quarter. Accordingly, segment margins decreased to 13.8% from 15.4% last year.
As we started to discuss last quarter, we are executing several restructuring initiatives to improve Pall Industrial's leverage. We expect to see the benefit of these in the second half of this fiscal year, and I'll address these in further detail when I get to the financial recap in a moment.
So I'm switching now to Life Sciences, and I'm on Slide 19. Excluding FX, sales grew 9.5% in the quarter. Pricing was about 1%. Emerging markets growth was 22% and developed regions growth was 8%. Systems grew approximately 50%. And Food and Beverage system sales almost doubled, and in Pharmaceutical, they were up 25%. So systems represented close to 7% of Life Sciences sales compared to 5% last year. Life Sciences' gross margins increased 130 bps to 55.8%. This primarily reflects manufacturing cost-saves and the benefit of exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated source goods, primarily in the Eurozone. Here, segment profit came in at almost $89 million, a 14% increase, excluding FX. Segment margin improved 150 basis points to 25%, yielding 35% incremental margin on top line growth of 9.5%. We believe we're missing 10 points of incremental margin, the result of investments in selling resources reflected in SG&A, IT cost, as well as some yield issues in our facility in Puerto Rico.
Turning now to Slide 20. The end result was that we grew sales by 12% and operating profit by just over 7%, both excluding FX. Not the operating leverage you should, nor do we, expect from our performance. In our current state, we should be achieving at least 25% incremental margins. Thus, we would expect to grow operating profit by between 15% and 20% with this kind of sales growth and achieve operating margin of at least 18%. Longer term, we should be targeting incremental margins in the high 30s to low 40s. This is the beginning of characterizing our aspirational goals for the long term that Larry referred to earlier. 
To that end, last quarter, we announced that we would be implementing several restructuring initiatives early in the year, and that these would likely generate $30 million to $40 million in charges. We reported $25 million of these charges in the first quarter, mostly for cash severance for Pall Industrial. The most significant restructuring activities include realigning sales and marketing management in Aeropower and Energy and Water, reorganizing the global management structure that supports the company's systems product line and shifting resources from mature to emerging regions. 
Turning now to income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.9% for the quarter compared to 26.8% last year. Excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges, Pall's underlying tax rate was 24.5%, in line with our full-year outlook. This is the low end of the tax rate we targeted to achieve for fiscal year 2013, and reflects early benefits of our Asian headquarters. 
Wrapping up the discussion about the P&L, net earnings were $69.5 million or $0.59 per share. This compares to $71.4 million or $0.61 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined in the appendix slides, were $0.74 compared to $0.62, an increase of 19%. Now bridging this increase, foreign currency translation increased EPS by about $0.05. The tax rate contributed about $0.03, supported by costs we're taking above the line, and included in underlying growth, which added about $0.04.
Turning now to Slide 21 and cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $78 million. This 34% increase, or $20 million, was driven by increased earnings exclusive of the restructuring and other items, which had a minimal impact on cash outflows, and continued improvement in working capital management, most significantly in inventories. Significant uses of cash included $70 million in net repayments of debt, $57 million in capital spending, which include significant investment in a new facility in the United Kingdom, including customer support laboratories, $28 million for our acquisition in Brazil and $20 million in dividends to shareholders. 
So wrapping up the discussion on liquidity, our cash position sit at $475 million at quarter end, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 9.7%, essentially on par with July 31, 2011. 
That concludes my report. I will now turn this to Larry to talk about our expectations for the full year."
185333,143293742,201430,"Pall Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2011",2011-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single digit growth",509,"Great. So before we get to questions, let me just recap 2012 guidance. This is on Slide 22. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit organic growth in both Life Sciences and Industrial. In Life Sciences, we expect low-single digit growth for Medical and high-single digit growth for BioPharm. In Food and Bev, we now expect low-single digit growth. In Industrial, we now expect the Energy market to deliver high-single digit growth, but the -- with high systems content. We expect Water and Machinery and Equipment to grow by mid-single digits, and Aerospace to deliver high-single digit growth, driven by our current backlog. And our current thinking is that Microelectronics could be down mid-single to as much as low-double digits. 
Let me just go through those again. So I'll repeat. Low-single digit organic growth for both Medical and Food and Bev; high-single digit growth for BioPharm; and then over -- on the Industrial side, Energy, high-single digit; as well as Aerospace is high-single digits; while Water, Machinery and Equipment will be mid-single digit; and Microelectronics, again, down as much as double digit, depending on how the supply chain recovers and how the U.S. consumer behaves here in the short term.
So that said, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 51.25%, EBIT margins to be in the range of 17% to 18.5%, with the benefit of the restructuring that Lisa just walked through. We're holding our original guidance, with pro forma EPS expected to be in a range of $3.07 to $3.32. This includes a slight benefit from foreign currency translation at current rates, but also assumes opportunistic stock buybacks of about $150 million, which will, depending on the timing, be accretive to earnings by about $0.03. And finally, a $0.10 benefit from our lower tax rate. Our operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $490 million to $540 million, and we're estimating about $185 million in CapEx as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, the manufacturing plants and the labs. 
And along those lines, we've spent $57 million in the first quarter, which was mainly already committed capital and not great in terms of CapEx run rate in terms of start to the year. That said, we have made significant investments that will support future growth, and we will change our spending habits. 
So we entered the year with good order and sales momentum. Growth was stronger in the first quarter and yielded a better outcome than our expectation. However, as I said earlier, Lisa said as well, from a leverage perspective, we're not pleased with the quarter. Operating performance, given the strong top line, was anemic. And we need to correct this, and we will. We also need to stress that our first half assumptions remain consistent with our original outlook. And again, our view of full year EPS expectations remain within the range provided in September.

Now I'm sure you've been pretty familiar with that. So if you refer to that, I think that our sales expense, as a percentage of sales, obviously, is probably where it needs to be. Maybe a tad high.

There may be some customer profiles of current system sales that really do cost us more than we properly think about and how we think about return on investment for some of those systems opportunities. And those are fairly small as a percentage of total revenue. So a little bit and not much to really move the needle in terms of total sales. Really, the issue is we need to get a little better frankly at how we sell systems and deal with the longer-term nature of the sale. What becomes typically incremental cost as a function of change orders as systems are spec-ed and built and installed, and make sure that where we're bringing something very valuable to the customer that we're getting all that value for it, all that price associated with that value. So it's really, I'd say, it's going to take some time frankly, but it's an ability that we need to build into our organization on both sides of the house, but particularly on the Industrial side, for how we achieve the appropriate price for our system sales. And again, back to my earlier comments and those were applicable to consumables as well on how we achieve price more generally. In terms of how we get to high 30s incremental margins, beyond just what the price portion of that needs to look like, the good news is we can leverage our current operating footprint. We don't need to expand that. And we can do a better job, frankly, in terms of operating performance within our existing facilities. And Lisa talked a little bit about in the quarter how one of them, our largest facility, in particular, in Puerto Rico, did cost us a fair amount in terms of just basic operating and manufacturing performance. So how quickly we get there? Not this year. But I do think that we have that opportunity in 2013."

I would say that neither Lisa nor I think it was a great quarter, and maybe that frames up one element of how we want to think about our company a little differently going forward. Now I'm proud of the team. I think that we've got a great team who's working very hard and doing some very, very good things. But structurally, we need to get our hands around how that kind of organic top line growth generates a lot more incremental profitability, and that model needs to be not so short-term focused, but certainly the operating leverage that we both harped on is an important element of how we need to modify the thinking of how our team operates. At the same time, we're going to aggressively reinvest in the business, and that's both organically as well as acquisitively. And we've got a long list of organic initiatives that we're honing down to the things that we think really move the needle, things that need to get done in terms of new product and other initiatives to expand our global reach and things that we want to do to improve our profile more generally. From an acquisitive perspective, in terms of difference going forward, I think that we definitely need to prepare ourselves first, and then be very thoughtful and very disciplined. But ultimately, execute a much more aggressive capital deployment strategy. And we need to allocate primarily toward how we grow the business, and then what we can do otherwise in terms of balancing the shareholder return, short and long term. In terms of how I think about the allocation of that capital across the business in terms of simple Life Sciences versus Industrial, clearly, the profile of Life Sciences is very attractive. How we build out Life Sciences has got to be a bit artful, frankly. I won't get into too much detail because competition listens to these calls too. But we've, I think, got the beginning of a line of sight toward how we can do that, with strong presence in the lab continuing, the instrument leads and the consumables are leveraged by way of it and how we can, in combination with good acquisitive pieces that we already have our sights on plus organic buildout, continue to extend the capability first in BioPharm to support some of that core biotech, but also in the other Life Science applications. On the Industrial side, it's a little bit of a different M&A opportunity set. And there, frankly, it's about going after the higher growth niches and making sure that we have the best possible presence and the most attractive subsets today, which obviously includes Microelectronics and some of the other segments that we’re well penetrated but we certainly could stand to grow share. On top of all that, I think there's both acquisitive opportunities and organic initiatives again that can improve our global reach, particularly in the emerging markets, and allow us better local operational support for fast customer turn time in those areas. And if you think about then, so what does the -- if you look a few years out, if you were -- if you had the benefit of that point in time in hindsight looking at what we did, it'll comprise a balance of certainly Life Science investments to drive the growth profile of the company, continued I would call it more of a bolt on-like approach or niche approach in the Industrial side to drive the highest growth and most attractive strategic positions within Industrial. And then supplementing that with what we can do, again, organically and acquisitively, to get that global reach."

The issue is obviously we're taking a kind of watchful approach toward what happens in Europe, while we think again that BioPharm in particular but some of the rest of our business is somewhat insulated from the more macroeconomic issues in Europe, still there's going to be an impact. And we talked about concerns on the Life Science side, Food and Bev and Medical in Europe, and on the Industrial side about half of that total segment that does have a direct and immediate impact as a function of overall macroeconomic performance. So that's point number one. And point number two is the wildcard around what happens within MicroE. And I'd tell you right now that I think it's not dire by any means. If the U.S. consumer buys a lot of electronics over the Christmas season or the holiday season here then that will help. And if the supply chain that finds its way through Thailand doesn't fall apart for a long period of time, it doesn't look like it will, that'll help.

And so what we need to do, is figure out how to shift some of our capabilities so it's closer to the customer and it's closer to the customers in the fastest-growing parts of the world. I'd be absolutely pleased if that net-net was a net headcount growth opportunity because that would be evidence of the fact that we've executed that extremely well. We definitely have the fixed cost structure, as I mentioned in my remarks upfront, to support growth. It's a matter of where. So restructuring activities obviously need to take that kind of broader view into account.
