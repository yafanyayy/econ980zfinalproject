Please note we will only be addressing our 2010 results today. We plan to host an extended conference call on February 24 to provide additional details surrounding our 2011 capital plan, guidance and how that plays into attaining our five-year strategic plan, as well as some additional property-level details. We'll be sending out more information for that call in the coming days.
I want to take a few seconds to thank Chris Campbell for his contributions during the last four years as a valuable member of our Investor Relations team. Chris is continuing to play an important role at Anadarko and has joined our Corporate Planning Group. Dean Hennings and I look forward to continuing to work with you guys.
I will remind you that today's presentation will contain our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our latest presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases and for the risk factors associated with our business. 
In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our website. We encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call. And as we do each quarter, we've included additional information in our quarterly operations report that's available on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, who will discuss our 2010 results, and Jim is joined by other executives who will be available to answer questions later in the call. Jim?"
251349,118237049,97610,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Anadarko Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year, we",2464,"Thanks, John, good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year, we projected that we would grow about 4% over 2009 levels, and that we would spend about $5.5 billion in capital. We were able to outperform these objectives with almost 7% sales volumes growth in 2010 while spending almost $200 million less in capital. 
Also in March, we forecasted an organic reserve replacement ratio of at least 130%, and we achieved 140%, adding 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Costs incurred amounted to just over $5 billion, resulting in better-than-anticipated reserve replacement costs as well. We've talked previously about our ongoing efforts to reduce our lease operating expense per unit, and the 2010 results in this area continued to improve. Results were favorable to guidance by more than $0.80 per barrel of oil equivalent, representing the savings of more than $170 million. 
Coming off one of Anadarko's best exploration years in its history in 2009, we again reached a high mark in 2010. Our offshore exploration and appraisal drilling program has achieved a combined 75% success rate. Another one of our goals as we discussed in March was attaining 10% production growth per debt adjusted share. We met this target as we delivered record production levels in 2010. 
The 2010 results reflect the depth and quality of Anadarko's portfolio. The record sales volumes were about 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance, and 100% of this incremental growth was driven by increases in our liquids production as we allocated and redirected capital to liquids-rich areas of the portfolio. These areas included the Eagleford Shale, Bone Spring, Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes, among others. 
Also partly as a result of our focus on liquids-rich assets within the portfolio, adjusted EBITDAX improved almost 40% versus 2009 to about $30.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding items affecting comparability. 
The 13% year-over-year growth in our higher-margin liquid volumes, coupled with our efforts to manage cost more efficiently, contributed significantly to the improved EBITDAX for the year. We also continued to achieve reduced drilling cycle times, with notable improvements throughout the onshore portfolio. One of the most dramatic examples was in the Eagleford Shale, where our spud-to-release times are now less than 12 days compared to more than 22 days in mid-2009. 
From a broader perspective, seven of 10 major assets in the southern region had record cycle times during the quarter, and the Rockies industry study recognized four of Anadarko's contracted rigs as being among the top 10 rigs in the U.S. onshore for total footage drilled. All major areas of the portfolio provided year-over-year growth, led by the Rockies and the accelerated development activities in the shale plays. 
In the Rockies, we delivered an 11% increase in sales volumes, and several areas continued to achieve record production levels, including Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, our operated Wamsutter and Salt Creek EUR. In the Southern Appalachian region, the advancement of our shale and other unconventional resource plays contributed significant increases in sales volumes during the year as well. With the additions of the Grugan Gathering System and other infrastructure expansions in Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, by the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly doubled gross sales volumes versus the end of the third quarter. The Marcellus continues to be the only major area where we are drilling for dry natural gas due to the proximity to premium gas markets, which further enhance the already robust economics of the play. We exited the year with approximate gross sales volumes in the Marcellus of 330 million cubic feet per day from about 70 wells.
Turning to the Eagleford Shale in South Texas, we recently established ourselves as the largest producer in this play. With the existing infrastructure and service agreements in place, about 94% of all completed wells have been flowing to sales. We ended the quarter with gross sales volumes of about 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 75% is liquids. This represents a six-fold increase in volumes versus the prior year fourth quarter. 
At current market prices, the Eagleford is generating excellent economics. And with 450 million barrels of oil equivalent and net risk resource potential on our acreage and more than 2,000 identified well sites, we plan to ramp up to 10 rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2011 from two rigs at the beginning of 2010. We continue to evaluate the joint venture structure for our Eagleford program similar to what we have done in the Marcellus. 
Beyond the phenomenal growth in our shale assets in the southern region, five of our seven major operating areas achieved their lowest base decline rate during the quarter, as we continued to focus on maintaining our existing base production. Additionally, we're actively pursuing other emerging growth plays in the Bone Spring, Avalon Shale and horizontal Niobrara Place, each with encouraging results, high liquids yields and substantial running room.
Moving to our mega project, as you all know, the Jubilee field Offshore Ghana reached its first oil milestone in a record three and a half years following discovery, which is twice as fast as the industry average. We're proud of the integrated project team to safely deliver upon the time and cost schedules for this deepwater development. Jubilee is currently producing around 50,000 barrels of oil per day from four wells, and we expect to ramp up the capacity of around 120,000 barrels per day by midyear. Jubilee also gives us an excellent foundation in Ghana from which we can grow in future years, given our additional exploration and development opportunities in these blocks. 
In Algeria, development drilling and construction work are progressing at the El Merk mega-project. Initial production is anticipated around the beginning of 2012 and will be increased as the full facility is commissioned. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were making good progress on the Caesar/Tonga project and had received the necessary permits to begin completion activities in the first two wells. However, as we announced yesterday, we're disappointed that the project will not begin first production by the first half of this year, as a result of the production riser system failing our recent hydro-testing procedures. We have a team in place that is actively working toward a safe and reliable alternative. In the meantime, we want to assure you that we fully expect to be well within our 2011 production guidance of 240 million to 250 million of barrels of oil equivalent that we provided last March. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are fully utilizing our two contracted rigs. We recently brought the well in line of Independence hub and completed work-over activities on two wells in the K2 area, returning them to production. 
During 2010, as you recall, we announced several successful appraisal wells in both the Lucius and Vito fields. During the moratorium, these future megaprojects continued to advance with feasibility and preliminary front end engineering studies, as well as permit applications for additional drilling. We filed for permits with the BOEMRE to resume appraisal during our Heidelberg discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as well. 
Our worldwide exploration program continued to create differentiating value for our stockholders in 2010. We believe we were again one of the most active deepwater drillers in the world, announcing eight offshore discoveries with a 60% success rate. We also were nine-for-nine in our offshore appraisal program. In addition, we continued the successful evaluation and development of the Eagleford and Marcellus shales, which enabled us to establish a net risk resource potential of about 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in these two major growth areas. These successful activities and discoveries continue to expand the resource potential, confirm our geological understanding and derisk our positions in the U.S. onshore and in our offshore acreage positions in Brazil, Ghana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. 
Beyond the overall high success rate in Africa, according to IHS Energy, four of our exploration wells were among the five largest offshore discoveries in 2010. Three of those were in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique where we hold a 36.5% working interest in the 2.6 million acre Offshore Area 1. These natural gas discoveries were made at the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta prospects. Based on the results of those wells, our partnership is designing an accelerated appraisal program in analyzing various development options. We plan to keep at least one rig in the basin throughout 2011 to carry out an active appraisal and exploration program, as well as to conduct at least one drill stem test. 
Currently in Mozambique, we are drilling the Deepwater Tuburão's prospect, which is located approximately 19 miles south southwest of the Lagosta discovery. Tuburão is a 15,000-foot test of an ESC in system and we hope to have results from this well within the next week. 
In West Africa, we made our second discovery offshore at Sierra Leone at the Mercury prospect, which we operate with a 65% working interest. The well encountered approximately 135 net speed of oil pay in two Cretaceous-age fan systems. The discovery also demonstrated the stratigraphic tracking systems we've identified are working, and that the petroleum system is generating high-quality oil. We expect to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore at Sierra Leone Liberia and potentially Cote d'Ivoire, with three to five wells planned this year. 
Our partnership's 2010 activities in Ghana continues to expand the potential of this world-class petroleum province with the discovery and continuing appraisal of the Enyenra field, formerly known as Owo. Enyenra is adjacent to our Tweneboa discovery in the Deepwater Tano license, where we hold an 18% working interest. 
The partnership drilled four successful appraisal wells in this block during the year, three in the Tweneboa field and one side track in the Enyenra field. We plan to continue an active appraisal program in 2011 and expect to submit a plan of development for the area by the end of this year. 
In the adjacent West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% working interest, we drilled another successful appraisal at the Mahogany East area to the southeast of the Jubilee Field. The M5 well follow three other successful wells in the area that have enabled the partnership to submit a Declaration of Commerciality to the Ghanaian government. 
We are currently drilling the Teak prospect on the same block, about 2.5 miles northeast of the Jubilee Unit boundary. Teak is testing multiple Campanian and Teroni objectives, and we are encouraged that what we have seen so far in this well with results expected soon. The partnership plans to the drill these and other four exploration wells this year on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna Discovery on block BM-C-29, where we hold a 50% working interest. Back in November, we announced Itauna's discovery after the well encountered more than 275 net feet of oil pay in the post-salt section. We've begun drilling a bypass to the original wellbore that should enable us to obtain core data and additional reservoir and fluid information to better define the discovery. We plan to drill additional wells in the block in the latter half of 2011 contingent upon rig availability. 
I'll summarize just some of the highlights of our exploration and appraisal drilling programs and encourage you to look through the quarterly operations report on our website for more information. 
Turning to the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010, we reported earnings of about $0.22 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release to certain items affecting comparability, without which, fourth quarter net income would've been about $0.07 higher or $0.29 per share. 
Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter and almost $5.4 billion for the full year. We generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in 2010. As for the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly-stated position. Consistent with the past two quarters, we've continued to apply accounting guidelines to the facts that they are known to us today, and accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We will, of course, include expanded disclosures in our 10-K when it is filed with the SEC later this month. 
As mentioned in last night's earnings release, we ended the quarter with about $3.7 billion of cash on hand, after returning more than $400 million of additional debt during the fourth quarter. Also in 2010, we took a number of steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and enhance liquidity, such as extending and upsizing our revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $5 billion. This facility remains undrawn. Our capital expenditures, including expense G&G, were approximately $5.3 billion for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this is nearly $200 million lower than the midpoint of original guidance.
Turning to reserves, we added 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of organic proved reserves during 2010 before the effective price revisions. This equates to a reserve appraisal ratio of approximately 140%, which exceeded our target as I mentioned earlier. We accomplished this one incurring cost of just over $5 billion associated with our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.
As our year end 2010, about 69% of our proved reserves were developed and only 31% undeveloped. An estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids. Consistent with the previous year, put up meaningly from 2008 levels, when liquids only comprised about 40% of our product mix. In March of last year, we detailed our five-year goals and with the results in 2010, we are firmly on track to deliver upon those metrics. 
As I stated in last night's release, we are very proud of the dedication and focus of our employees who delivered very strong results in the face of significant challenges that we experienced last summer. The reference resulted in record production, better net tax, high liquids volumes, improved LOE, important fractionation agreements and infrastructure expansions and significant exploration success. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term plans and providing our 2011 guidance and capital program later this month. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we anticipate full year production to be well within the guidance we provided last March. We also expect our total capital spending program to be in line with cash flows. With that, Michael, if you would, we'd like to open it up for questions."

We are continuing to drill out there, and we have said, we'll keep the rig there, base rig 2011, and we may even be bringing a second rig in towards the end of the year. We're in the process of looking at that right now. We're presently on Tuburão, that's almost done and we're getting all our data out of it. Like what we're seeing there, it's just a further extension of the call them, the jammer complex to the south, that was 19 miles and we should have results on that here very shortly. The rig then is going to go and really focus on defining the jammer complex better. And that what we're hoping to do this year is to find the resource where we're going to get enough data from the wellbores, from DFTs, from interference testing, to look at overall volumes, deliverability, wellbore efficiencies, to what's the drainage area, what's the ultimate recoverability per well so that we can start designing the development with real detail and also give the data to an outside reserve group to certify the reserves, which we're going to move forward with an LNG project. We do think that the jammer complex has already exceeded the minimum threshold for LNG. We've said that, which we though was about 40 CF. What we're really trying to do is get those numbers pinned down to where they can be certified outside. As we move to the liquid side of it, we did find liquids down to the south block in our Ironclad prospect in tight reservoir. We're shooting 3D down to the South. It should start first week of February. We'll extend the existing 3D all the way in the block down. Then we're going to move to the north and extend the 3D all the way to the northern boundary. The South will be focused on the well potential. The north will be more of the gas up in that same complex. The second rig that we would bring in would be for the further exploration work because most of the year is going to be tied up with all the work to get to the reserve certification for jammer. And then going over into Sierra Leone, we do like what we're seeing over there. Mercury was a nice discovery. We thing that we have a good appraisal location. We said that we're going to drill three to five wells in the margin outside of Ghana. If it's three, they'll all be up in the Sierra Leone, Liberia area. The five would be, if we can clarify the situation at Cote d'Ivoire and get down there and drill the prospects that we like there. So one of those wells will be a Mercury appraisal well. We've got a good location that we think will help really prove out the volumes down there. But from a petroleum system standpoint, everything we've seen on our two wells in Sierra Leone tells us that, that basin has the same sort of potential as what we're seeing in Ghana and hopefully Côte d'Ivoire."

Obviously, this helps lower the cost structure for the industry, but I still think, you've got to be in the right places until we see a little more structural change in the gas demand side. The good news is I think that's going to happen even without federal legislation, which is something I didn't believe a year and a half ago, and I think we're four to five years away from that starting to happen in a much bigger way, particularly in the power generation sector, and we try to help make some of that come true up in places like Colorado. But from our perspective, we do have in the place, the one place where we're drilling for dry gas actively in Marcellus has a notable advantages from a cost and market standpoint. So I think everybody still needs to be cautious about what they do here even with lowering costs. And obviously, you have to be in the right places in the country. But I think gas continues to surprise us even in the short term. I mean, we had a bearish view on gas for a couple of years, and frankly, it continues to stay a little higher than we thought due to a variety of factors we couldn't have anticipated.

If we look across our portfolio and I'll focus on the Marcellus because it's probably the example with the largest non-producing inventory. It's now approaching 200 wells. There's really three reasons why they're in that condition. The first is those that are actually in completion progress is being made on it. We have roughly 50 wells that are now under some stage of completion. And that is just associated with the complexity of the process of completing a horizontal well. There's several different steps in that process. There's many stages of fracturing and because we're on pads, by and large today, it takes longer to actually take a well from start to completion, first production just because other wells on the same pad are being completed in all of the activity going on. We did have about 75 wells that are waiting on the completions, waiting for them to get in line on the completions, and finally, we have several wells in the order of 70 wells that have actually been completed that are waiting on the pipeline connections. And that's a matter again of the process of laying lines and getting to hook up some permits, et cetera, in that area. So it's just a steady progression of wells going through the process. And I guess I would say that we are -- that's more than I would've anticipated at this stage in the process. But after you really look into it, it's not surprising, given the terrain and the challenges associated with the completions and just the durations of the completions."

251349,118237049,97736,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Anadarko Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year,",2475,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year, we projected that we would grow about 4% over 2009 levels, and that we would spend about $5.5 billion in capital. We were able to outperform these objectives with almost 7% sales volumes growth in 2010 while spending almost $200 million less in capital. 
Also in March, we forecasted an organic reserve replacement ratio of at least 130%, and we achieved 140%, adding 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Costs incurred amounted to just over $5 billion, resulting in better-than-anticipated reserve replacement costs as well. We've talked previously about our ongoing efforts to reduce our lease operating expense per unit, and the 2010 results in this area continued to improve. Results were favorable to guidance by more than $0.80 per barrel of oil equivalent, representing the savings of more than $170 million. 
Coming off one of Anadarko's best exploration years in its history in 2009, we again reached a high mark in 2010. Our offshore exploration and appraisal drilling program has achieved a combined 75% success rate. Another one of our goals, as we discussed in March, was attaining 10% production growth per debt adjusted share. We met this target as we delivered record production levels in 2010. 
The 2010 results reflect the depth and quality of Anadarko's portfolio. The record sales volumes were about 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance, and 100% of this incremental growth was driven by increases in our liquids production as we allocated and redirected capital to liquids-rich areas of the portfolio. These areas included the Eagleford Shale, Bone Spring, Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes, among others. 
Also partly as a result of our focus on liquids-rich assets within the portfolio, adjusted EBITDAX improved almost 40% versus 2009 to about $30.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding items affecting comparability. 
The 13% year-over-year growth in our higher-margin liquid volumes, coupled with our efforts to manage cost more efficiently, contributed significantly to the improved EBITDAX for the year. We also continued to achieve reduced drilling cycle times, with notable improvements throughout the onshore portfolio. One of the most dramatic examples was in the Eagleford Shale, where our spud-to-release times are now less than 12 days compared to more than 22 days in mid-2009. 
From a broader perspective, seven of 10 major assets in the southern region had record cycle times during the quarter, and the Rockies industry study recognized four of Anadarko's contracted rigs as being among the top 10 rigs in the U.S. onshore for total footage drilled. All major areas of the portfolio provided year-over-year growth, led by the Rockies and the accelerated development activities in the shale plays. 
In the Rockies, we delivered an 11% increase in sales volumes, and several areas continued to achieve record production levels, including Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, our operated Wamsutter and Salt Creek EOR. In the Southern Appalachian region, the advancement of our shale and other unconventional resource plays contributed significant increases in sales volumes during the year as well. With the additions of the Grugan Gathering System and other infrastructure expansions in Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. By the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly doubled gross sales volumes versus the end of the third quarter. The Marcellus continues to be the only major area where we are drilling for dry natural gas due to the proximity to premium gas markets, which further enhance the already robust economics of the play. We exited the year with approximate gross sales volumes in the Marcellus of 330 million cubic feet per day from about 70 wells.
Turning to the Eagleford Shale in South Texas, we recently established ourselves as the largest producer in this play. With the existing infrastructure and service agreements in place, about 94% of all completed wells have been flowing to sales. We ended the quarter with gross sales volumes of about 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 75% is liquids. This represents a six-fold increase in volumes versus the prior year fourth quarter. 
At current market prices, the Eagleford is generating excellent economics. And with 450 million barrels of oil equivalent and net risk resource potential on our acreage and more than 2,000 identified well sites, we plan to ramp up to 10 rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2011 from two rigs at the beginning of 2010. We continue to evaluate the joint venture structure for our Eagleford program similar to what we have done in the Marcellus. 
Beyond the phenomenal growth in our shale assets in the southern region, five of our seven major operating areas achieved their lowest base decline rate during the quarter, as we continued to focus on maintaining our existing base production. Additionally, we're actively pursuing other emerging growth plays in the Bone Spring, Avalon Shale and horizontal Niobrara plays, each with encouraging results, high liquids yields and substantial running room.
Moving to our sanctioned mega projects, as you all know, the Jubilee field offshore Ghana reached its first oil milestone in a record three and a half years following discovery, which is twice as fast as the industry average. We're proud of the integrated project team to safely deliver upon the time and cost schedules for this deepwater development. Jubilee is currently producing around 50,000 barrels of oil per day from four wells, and we expect to ramp up the capacity of around 120,000 barrels per day by midyear. Jubilee also gives us an excellent foundation in Ghana from which we can grow in future years, given our additional exploration and development opportunities in these blocks. 
In Algeria, development drilling and construction work are progressing at the El Merk mega project. Initial production is anticipated around the beginning of 2012 and will be increased as the full facility is commissioned. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were making good progress on the Caesar/Tonga project and had received the necessary permits to begin completion activities in the first two wells. However, as we announced yesterday, we're disappointed that the project will not begin first production by the first half of this year, as a result of the production riser system failing our recent hydro-testing procedures. We have a team in place that is actively working toward a safe and reliable alternative. In the meantime, we want to assure you that we fully expect to be well within our 2011 production guidance of 240 million to 250 million of barrels of oil equivalent that we provided last March. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are fully utilizing our two contracted rigs. We recently brought the Callisto well in line of Independence Hub and completed work-over activities on two wells in the K2 area, returning them to production. 
During 2010, as you recall, we announced several successful appraisal wells in both the Lucius and Vito fields. During the moratorium, these future mega projects continued to advance with feasibility and preliminary front-end engineering studies, as well as permit applications for additional drilling. We filed for permits with the BOEMRE to resume appraisal drilling around our Heidelberg discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as well. 
Our worldwide exploration program continued to create differentiating value for our stockholders in 2010. We believe we were again one of the most active deepwater drillers in the world, announcing eight offshore discoveries with a 60% success rate. We also were nine-for-nine in our offshore appraisal program. In addition, we continued to be successful at evaluation and development of the Eagleford and Marcellus Shales, which enabled us to establish a net risk resource potential of about 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in these two major growth areas. These successful activities and discoveries continue to expand the resource potential, confirm our geological understanding and de-risk our positions in the U.S. onshore and in our offshore acreage positions in Brazil, Ghana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. 
Beyond the overall high success rate in Africa, according to IHS Energy, four of our exploration wells were among the five largest offshore discoveries in 2010. Three of those were in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique where we hold a 36.5% working interest in the 2.6 million acre Offshore Area 1. These natural gas discoveries were made at the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta prospects. Based on the results of those wells, our partnership is designing an accelerated appraisal program in analyzing various development options. We plan to keep at least one rig in the basin throughout 2011 to carry out an active appraisal and exploration program, as well as to conduct at least one drill stem test. 
Currently in Mozambique, we are drilling the Deepwater Tuburão's prospect, which is located approximately 19 miles southwest of the Lagosta discovery. Tuburão is a 15,000-foot test of an Eocene fan system and we hope to have results from this well within the next week. 
In West Africa, we made our second discovery offshore at Sierra Leone at the Mercury prospect, which we operate with a 65% working interest. The well encountered approximately 135 net feet of oil pay in two Cretaceous-age fan systems. The discovery also demonstrated the stratigraphic trapping systems we've identified are working, and that the petroleum system is generating high-quality oil. We expect to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore at Sierra Leone, Liberia and potentially Cote d'Ivoire, with three to five wells planned this year. 
Our partnership's 2010 activities in Ghana continues to expand the potential of this world-class petroleum province with the discovery and continuing appraisal of the Enyenra field, formerly known as Owo. Enyenra is adjacent to our Tweneboa discovery in the Deepwater Tano license, where we hold an 18% working interest. 
The partnership drilled four successful appraisal wells in this block during the year, three in the Tweneboa field and one side track in the Enyenra field. We plan to continue an active appraisal program in 2011 and expect to submit a plan of development for the area by the end of this year. 
In the adjacent West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% working interest, we drilled another successful appraisal at the Mahogany East area to the southeast of the Jubilee Field. The M5 well follow three other successful wells in the area that have enabled the partnership to submit a Declaration of Commerciality to the Ghanaian government. 
We are currently drilling the Teak prospect on the same block, about 2.5 miles northeast of the Jubilee Unit boundary. Teak is testing multiple Campanian and Tweneboa objectives, and we are encouraged by what we have seen so far in this well with results expected soon. The partnership plans to drill these another four exploration wells this year on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna discovery on block BM-C-29, where we hold a 50% working interest. Back in November, we announced Itauna's discovery after the well encountered more than 275 net feet of oil pay in the post-salt section. We've begun drilling a bypass to the original wellbore that should enable us to obtain core data and additional reservoir and fluid information to better define the discovery. We plan to drill additional wells in the block in the latter half of 2011 contingent upon rig availability. 
I'll summarize just some of the highlights of our exploration and appraisal drilling programs and encourage you to look through the quarterly operations report on our website for more information. 
Turning to the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010, we reported earnings of about $0.22 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release with certain items affecting comparability, without which, fourth quarter net income would have been about $0.07 higher or $0.29 per share. 
Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter and almost $5.4 billion for the full year. We generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in 2010. As for the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly-stated position. Consistent with the past two quarters, we've continued to apply accounting for guidelines to the facts that they are known to us today, and accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We will, of course, include expanded disclosures in our 10-K when it is filed with the SEC later this month. 
As mentioned in last night's earnings release, we ended the quarter with about $3.7 billion of cash on hand, after returning more than $400 million of additional debt during the fourth quarter. Also in 2010, we took a number of steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and enhance liquidity, such as extending and upsizing our revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $5 billion. This facility remains undrawn. Our capital expenditures, including expense G&G [geology and geophysics], were approximately $5.3 billion for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this is nearly $200 million lower than the midpoint of original guidance.
Turning to reserves. We added 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of organic proved reserves during 2010 before the effective price revisions. This equates to a reserve replacement ratio of approximately 140%, which exceeded our target as I mentioned earlier. We accomplished this while incurring cost of just over $5 billion associated with our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.
As of our year end 2010, about 69% of our proved reserves were developed and only 31% undeveloped. An estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids. Consistent with the previous year, put up meaningly from 2008 levels, when liquids only comprised about 40% of our of product mix. In March of last year, we detailed our five-year goals and with the results in 2010, we are firmly on track to deliver upon those metrics. 
As I stated in last night's release, we are very proud of the dedication and focus of our employees who delivered very strong results in the face of significant challenges that we experienced last summer. The reference resulted in record production, better net tax, high liquids volumes, improved LOE, important fractionation agreements and infrastructure expansions and significant exploration success. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term plans and providing our 2011 guidance and capital program later this month. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we anticipate full year production to be well within the guidance we provided last March. We also expect our total capital spending program to be in line with cash flows. With that, Michael, if you would, we'd like to open it up for questions."

We are continuing to drill out there, and we have said, we'll keep the rig there, base rig 2011, and we may even be bringing a second rig in towards the end of the year. We're in the process of looking at that right now. We're presently on Tuburão, that's almost done and we're getting all our data out of it. Like what we're seeing there, it's just a further extension of the -- on the lobarkin jammer complex to the south, about 19 miles and we should have results on that here very shortly. The rig then is going to go and really focus on defining the lobarkin jammer complex better. And what we're hoping to do this year is to find the resource where we're going to get enough data from the wellbores, from DFTs, from interference testing, to look at overall volumes, deliverability, wellbore efficiencies, so what's the drainage area, what's the ultimate recovery per well so that we can start designing the development with real detail and also give the data to an outside reserve group to certify the reserves, which we're going to move forward with an LNG project. We do think that the lobarkin jammer complex has already exceeded the minimum threshold for LNG. We've said that, which we thought was about 40 CF. What we're really trying to do is get those numbers pinned down to where they can be certified outside. As we move to the liquid side of it, we did find liquids down to the south block in our Ironclad prospect in tight reservoir. We're shooting 3D down to the south. It should start first week of February. We'll extend the existing 3D all the way in the block boundary. Then we're going to move to the north and extend the 3D all the way to the northern boundary. The South will be focused on the oil potential. The north will be more of the gas up in that same complex. The second rig that we would bring in would be for the further exploration work because most of the year is going to be tied up with all the work to get to the reserve certification for lobarkin jammer. And then going over into Sierra Leone, we do like what we're seeing over there. Mercury was a nice discovery. We think that we have a good appraisal location. We said that we're going to drill three to five wells in the margin outside of Ghana. If it's three, they'll all be up in the Sierra Leone, Liberia area. The five would be, if we can clarify the situation at Cote d'Ivoire and get down there and drill the prospects that we like there. So one of those wells will be a Mercury appraisal well. We've got a good location that we think will help really prove out the volumes down there. But from a petroleum system standpoint, everything we've seen on our two wells in Sierra Leone tells us that, that basin has the same sort of potential as what we're seeing in Ghana and hopefully our Côte d'Ivoire."

I mean, we had a bearish view on gas for a couple of years, and frankly, it continues to stay a little higher than we thought due to a variety of factors we couldn't have anticipated. So we're generally consensus on gas directionally on the short term but we're continually mindful that we might get surprised in the upside. I'll have Chuck answer the second part."

It's now approaching 200 wells. There's really three reasons why they're in that condition. The first is those that are actually in completion progress or progress is being made on the completion. We have roughly 50 wells that are now under some stage of completion. And that is just associated with the complexity of the process of completing a horizontal well. There's several different steps in that process. There's many stages of fracturing and because we're on pads, by and large today, it takes longer to actually take a well from, to start a completion, first production just because other wells on the same pad are being completed in all of the activity going on. We did have about 75 wells that are waiting on the completions, waiting for them to get in line on the completions. And finally, though we have several wells in the order of 70 wells that have actually been completed that are waiting on the pipeline connections. And that's a matter again of the process of laying lines and getting to hook ups and permits, et cetera, in that area. So it's just a steady progression of wells going through the process. And I guess I would say that we are -- that's more than I would have anticipated at this stage in the process. But after you really look into it, it's not surprising, given the terrain and the challenges associated with the completions and just the durations of the completions."

In fact, our most recent wells have, we've put in two pads recently and both those pads has averaged over 7 million cubic feet per well on the initial completions. The decline rates are in line with our expectations on our tight curves that we've provided in the past. That drove after a period where the pressure drops and the rates were flat with the pressure drops, and then to go into the decline. And what you're seeing is at least in our early times, we're still early in this play, the expected recoveries in these wells are well north of four BCF and some in the six Bcf-plus range."

251349,118237049,97839,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Anadarko Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year,",2474,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year, we projected that we would grow about 4% over 2009 levels, and that we would spend about $5.5 billion in capital. We were able to outperform these objectives with almost 7% sales volumes growth in 2010 while spending almost $200 million less in capital. 
Also in March, we forecasted an organic reserve replacement ratio of at least 130%, and we achieved 140%, adding 330 million barrels of oil equivalent approved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Costs incurred amounted to just over $5 billion, resulting in better-than-anticipated reserve replacement costs as well. We've talked previously about our ongoing efforts to reduce our lease operating expense per unit, and the 2010 results in this area continued to improve. Results were favorable to guidance by more than $0.80 per barrel of oil equivalent, representing the savings of more than $170 million. 
Coming off one of Anadarko's best exploration years in its history in 2009, we again reached a high mark in 2010. Our offshore exploration and appraisal drilling program has achieved a combined 75% success rate. Another one of our goals, as we discussed in March, was attaining 10% production growth per debt adjusted share. We met this target as we delivered record production levels in 2010. 
The 2010 results reflect the depth and quality of Anadarko's portfolio. The record sales volumes were about 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance, and 100% of this incremental growth was driven by increases in our liquids production as we allocated and redirected capital to liquids-rich areas of the portfolio. These areas included the Eagleford Shale, Bone Spring, Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes, among others. 
Also partly as a result of our focus on liquids-rich assets within the portfolio, adjusted EBITDAX improved almost 40% versus 2009 to about $30.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding items affecting comparability. 
The 13% year-over-year growth in our higher-margin liquid volumes, coupled with our efforts to manage cost more efficiently, contributed significantly to the improved EBITDAX for the year. We also continued to achieve reduced drilling cycle times, with notable improvements throughout the onshore portfolio. One of the most dramatic examples was in the Eagleford Shale, where our spud-to-release times are now less than 12 days compared to more than 22 days in mid-2009. 
From a broader perspective, seven of 10 major assets in the southern region had record cycle times during the quarter, and the Rockies industry study recognized four of Anadarko's contracted rigs as being among the top 10 rigs in the U.S. onshore for total footage drilled. All major areas of the portfolio provided year-over-year growth, led by the Rockies and the accelerated development activities in the shale plays. 
In the Rockies, we delivered an 11% increase in sales volumes, and several areas continued to achieve record production levels, including Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, our operated Wamsutter and Salt Creek EOR. In the Southern Appalachian region, the advancement of our shale and other unconventional resource plays contributed significant increases in sales volumes during the year as well. With the additions of the Grugan Gathering System and other infrastructure expansions in Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, by the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly doubled gross sales volumes versus the end of the third quarter. The Marcellus continues to be the only major area where we are drilling for dry natural gas due to the proximity to premium gas markets, which further enhance the already robust economics of the play. We exited the year with approximate gross sales volumes in the Marcellus of 330 million cubic feet per day from about 70 wells.
Turning to the Eagleford Shale in South Texas, we recently established ourselves as the largest producer in this play. With the existing infrastructure and service agreements in place, about 94% of all completed wells have been flowing to sales. We ended the quarter with gross sales volumes of about 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 75% is liquids. This represents a six-fold increase in volumes versus the prior year fourth quarter. 
At current market prices, the Eagleford is generating excellent economics. And with 450 million barrels of oil equivalent and net risk resource potential on our acreage and more than 2,000 identified well sites, we plan to ramp up to 10 rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2011 from two rigs at the beginning of 2010. We continue to evaluate a joint venture structure for our Eagleford program similar to what we have done in the Marcellus. 
Beyond the phenomenal growth in our shale assets in the southern region, five of our seven major operating areas achieved their lowest base decline rate during the quarter, as we continued to focus on maintaining our existing base production. Additionally, we're actively pursuing other emerging growth plays in the Bone Spring, Avalon Shale and horizontal Niobrara plays, each with encouraging results, high liquids yields and substantial running room.
Moving to our sanctioned mega projects, as you all know, the Jubilee field offshore Ghana reached its first oil milestone in a record three and a half years following discovery, which is twice as fast as the industry average. We're proud of the integrated project team to safely deliver upon the time and cost schedules for this deepwater development. Jubilee is currently producing around 50,000 barrels of oil per day from four wells, and we expect to ramp up to capacity of around 120,000 barrels per day by midyear. Jubilee also gives us an excellent foundation in Ghana from which we can grow in future years, given our additional exploration and development opportunities in these blocks. 
In Algeria, development drilling and construction work are progressing at the El Merk mega project. Initial production is anticipated around the beginning of 2012 and will be increased as the full facility is commissioned. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were making good progress on the Caesar/Tonga project and had received the necessary permits to begin completion activities in the first two wells. However, as we announced yesterday, we're disappointed that the project will not begin first production by the first half of this year, as a result of the production riser system failing our recent hydro-testing procedures. We have a team in place that is actively working toward a safe and reliable alternative. In the meantime, we want to assure you that we fully expect to be well within our 2011 production guidance of 240 million to 250 million barrels of oil equivalent that we provided last March. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are fully utilizing our two contracted rigs. We recently brought the Callisto well in line of Independence Hub and completed work-over activities on two wells in the K2 area, returning them to production. 
During 2010, as you recall, we announced several successful appraisal wells in both the Lucius and Vito fields. During the moratorium, these future mega projects continued to advance with feasibility and preliminary front-end engineering studies, as well as permit applications for additional drilling. We filed for permits with the BOEMRE to resume appraisal drilling around our Heidelberg discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as well. 
Our worldwide exploration program continued to create differentiating value for our stockholders in 2010. We believe we were again one of the most active deepwater drillers in the world, announcing eight offshore discoveries with a 60% success rate. We also were nine-for-nine in our offshore appraisal program. In addition, we continued to be successful at evaluation and development of the Eagleford and Marcellus Shales, which enabled us to establish a net risk resource potential of about 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in these two major growth areas. These successful activities and discoveries continue to expand the resource potential, confirm our geologic understanding and de-risk our positions in the U.S. onshore and in our offshore acreage positions in Brazil, Ghana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. 
Beyond the overall high success rate in Africa, according to IHS Energy, four of our exploration wells were among the five largest offshore discoveries in 2010. Three of those were in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique where we hold a 36.5% working interest in the 2.6 million acre Offshore Area 1. These natural gas discoveries were made at the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta prospects. Based on the results of those wells, our partnership is designing an accelerated appraisal program in analyzing various development options. We plan to keep at least one rig in the basin throughout 2011 to carry out an active appraisal and exploration program, as well as to conduct at least one drill stem test. 
Currently in Mozambique, we are drilling the Deepwater Tuburão's prospect, which is located approximately 19 miles southwest of the Lagosta discovery. Tuburão is a 15,000-foot test of an Eocene fan system and we hope to have results from this well within the next week. 
In West Africa, we made our second discovery offshore at Sierra Leone at the Mercury prospect, which we operate with a 65% working interest. The well encountered approximately 135 net feet of oil pay in two Cretaceous-age fan systems. The discovery also demonstrated the stratigraphic trapping systems we've identified are working, and that the petroleum system is generating high-quality oil. We expect to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore at Sierra Leone, Liberia and potentially Cote d'Ivoire, with three to five wells planned this year. 
Our partnership's 2010 activities in Ghana continues to expand the potential of this world-class petroleum province with the discovery and continuing appraisal of the Enyenra field, formerly known as Owo. Enyenra is adjacent to our Tweneboa discovery in the Deepwater Tano license, where we hold an 18% working interest. 
The partnership drilled four successful appraisal wells in this block during the year, three in the Tweneboa field and one side track in the Enyenra field. We plan to continue an active appraisal program in 2011 and expect to submit a plan of development for the area by the end of this year. 
In the adjacent West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% working interest, we drilled another successful appraisal at the Mahogany East area to the southeast of the Jubilee Field. The M5 well follow three other successful wells in the area that have enabled the partnership to submit a Declaration of Commerciality to the Ghanaian government. 
We are currently drilling the Teak prospect on the same block, about 2.5 miles northeast of the Jubilee Unit boundary. Teak is testing multiple Campanian and Tweneboa objectives, and we are encouraged by what we have seen so far in this well with results expected soon. The partnership plans to drill at least another four exploration wells this year on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna discovery on block BM-C-29, where we hold a 50% working interest. Back in November, we announced Itauna's discovery after the well encountered more than 275 net feet of oil pay in the post-salt section. We've begun drilling a bypass to the original wellbore that should enable us to obtain core data and additional reservoir and fluid information to better define the discovery. We plan to drill additional wells in the block in the latter half of 2011 contingent upon rig availability. 
I've summarized just some of the highlights of our exploration and appraisal drilling programs and encourage you to look through the quarterly operations report on our website for more information. 
Turning to the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010, we reported earnings of about $0.22 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release with certain items affecting comparability, without which, fourth quarter net income would have been about $0.07 higher or $0.29 per share. 
Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter and almost $5.4 billion for the full year. We generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in 2010. As for the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly-stated position. Consistent with the past two quarters, we've continued to apply accounting for guidelines to the facts as they are known to us today, and accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We will, of course, include expanded disclosures in our 10-K when it is filed with the SEC later this month. 
As mentioned in last night's earnings release, we ended the quarter with about $3.7 billion of cash on hand, after retiring more than $400 million of additional debt during the fourth quarter. Also in 2010, we took a number of steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and enhance liquidity, such as extending and upsizing our revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $5 billion. This facility remains undrawn. Our capital expenditures, including expense G&G [geology and geophysics], were approximately $5.3 billion for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this is nearly $200 million lower than the midpoint of original guidance.
Turning to reserves. We added 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of organic proved reserves during 2010 before the effective price revisions. This equates to a reserve replacement ratio of approximately 140%, which exceeded our target as I mentioned earlier. We accomplished this while incurring cost of just over $5 billion associated with our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.
As of our year end 2010, about 69% of our proved reserves were developed and only 31% undeveloped. An estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids. Consistent with the previous year, put up meaningly from 2008 levels, when liquids only comprised about 40% of our of product mix. In March of last year, we detailed our five-year goals and with the results in 2010, we are firmly on track to deliver upon those metrics. 
As I stated in last night's release, we are very proud of the dedication and focus of our employees who delivered very strong results in the face of significant challenges that we experienced last summer. The reference resulted in record production, better net tax, high liquids volumes, improved LOE, important fractionation agreements and infrastructure expansions and significant exploration success. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term plans and providing our 2011 guidance and capital program later this month. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we anticipate full year production to be well within the guidance we provided last March. We also expect our total capital spending program to be in line with cash flows. With that, Michael, if you would, we'd like to open it up for questions."

We are continuing to drill out there, and we have said, we'll keep the rig there at least through 2011, and we may even be bringing a second rig in towards the end of the year. We're in the process of looking at that right now. We're presently on Tuburão, that's almost done and we're getting all our data out of it. Like what we're seeing there, it's just a further extension of the -- called LaBarquen [ph] Jammer Complex to the south, about 19 miles and we should have results on that here very shortly. The rig then is going to go and really focus on defining the LaBarquen Jammer Complex better. And what we're hoping to do this year is to find the resource where we're going to get enough data from the wellbores, from DFTs, from interference testing, to look at overall volumes, deliverability, wellbore efficiencies, so what's the drainage area, what's the ultimate recovery per well so that we can start designing the development with real detail and also give the data to an outside reserve group to certify the reserves, which we're going to move forward with an LNG project. We do think that the LaBarquen Jammer Complex has already exceeded the minimum threshold for LNG, we've said that, which we thought was about 40 CF. What we're really trying to do is get those numbers pinned down to where they can be certified outside. As we move to the liquid side of it, we did find liquids down to the south of the block in our Ironclad prospect in tight reservoir. We're shooting 3D down to the south. It should start first week of February. We'll extend the existing 3D all the way in the block boundary. Then we're going to move to the north and extend the 3D all the way to the northern boundary. The south will be focused on the oil potential. The north will be more of the gas up in that same complex. The second rig that we would bring in would be for the further exploration work because most of the year is going to be tied up with all the work to get to the reserve certification for LaBarquen Jammer. And then going over into Sierra Leone, we do like what we're seeing over there. Mercury was a nice discovery. We think that we have a good appraisal location. We said that we're going to drill three to five wells in the margin outside of Ghana. If it's three, they'll all be up in the Sierra Leone, Liberia area. The five would be, if we can clarify the situation at Cote d'Ivoire and get down there and drill the prospects that we like there. So one of those wells will be a Mercury appraisal well. We've got a good location that we think will help really prove out the volumes down there. But from a petroleum system standpoint, everything we've seen on our two wells in Sierra Leone tells us that, that basin has the same sort of potential as what we're seeing in Ghana and hopefully our Côte d'Ivoire."

Obviously, this helps lower the cost structure for the industry, but I still think that you've got to be in the right places until we see a little more structural change in the gas demand side. The good news is I think that's going to happen even without federal legislation, which is something I didn't believe a year and a half ago, and I think we're four to five years away from that starting to happen in a much bigger way, particularly in the power generation sector, and we try to help make some of that come true up in places like Colorado. But from our perspective, we do have in the place, the one place where we're drilling for dry gas actively in Marcellus has some notable advantages from a cost and market standpoint. So I think everybody still needs to be cautious about what they do here even with lowering costs. And obviously, you have to be in the right places in the country. But I think gas continues to surprise us even in the short term. I mean, we had a bearish view on gas for a couple of years, and frankly, it continues to stay a little higher than we thought due to a variety of factors we couldn't have anticipated. So we're generally consensus on gas directionally in the short term but we're continually mindful that we might get surprised in the upside. I'll have Chuck answer the second part."

It's now approaching 200 wells. There's really three reasons why they're in that condition. The first is those that are actually in completion progress or progress is being made on the completion. We have roughly 50 wells that are now under some stage of completion. And that is just associated with the complexity of the process of completing a horizontal well. There's several different steps in that process. There's many stages of fracturing and because we're on pads, by and large today, it takes longer to actually take a well from the start of completion to first production just because other wells on the same pad are being completed and all of the activity going on. We did have about 75 wells that are waiting on the completions, waiting for them to get in line on the completions. And finally, though we have several wells in the order of 70 wells that have actually been completed that are waiting on the pipeline connections. And that's a matter again of the process of laying lines and getting the hook ups and permits, et cetera, in that area. So it's just a steady progression of wells going through the process. And I guess I would say that we are -- that's more than I would have anticipated at this stage in the process. But after you really look into it, it's not surprising, given the terrain and the challenges associated with the completions and just the durations of the completions."

251349,118237049,98032,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Anadarko Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year,",2475,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category. Starting with sales volumes at our Investor Conference in March of last year, we projected that we would grow about 4% over 2009 levels, and that we would spend about $5.5 billion in capital. We were able to outperform these objectives with almost 7% sales volumes growth in 2010 while spending almost $200 million less in capital. 
Also in March, we forecasted an organic reserve replacement ratio of at least 130%, and we achieved 140%, adding 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Costs incurred amounted to just over $5 billion, resulting in better-than-anticipated reserve replacement costs as well. We've talked previously about our ongoing efforts to reduce our lease operating expense per unit, and the 2010 results in this area continued to improve. Results were favorable to guidance by more than $0.80 per barrel of oil equivalent, representing the savings of more than $170 million. 
Coming off one of Anadarko's best exploration years in its history in 2009, we again reached a high mark in 2010. Our offshore exploration and appraisal drilling program has achieved a combined 75% success rate. Another one of our goals, as we discussed in March, was attaining 10% production growth per debt adjusted share. We met this target as we delivered record production levels in 2010. 
The 2010 results reflect the depth and quality of Anadarko's portfolio. The record sales volumes were about 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance, and 100% of this incremental growth was driven by increases in our liquids production as we allocated and redirected capital to liquids-rich areas of the portfolio. These areas included the Eagleford Shale, Bone Spring, Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes, among others. 
Also partly as a result of our focus on liquids-rich assets within the portfolio, adjusted EBITDAX improved almost 40% versus 2009 to about $30.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding items affecting comparability. 
The 13% year-over-year growth in our higher-margin liquid volumes, coupled with our efforts to manage cost more efficiently, contributed significantly to the improved EBITDAX for the year. We also continued to achieve reduced drilling cycle times, with notable improvements throughout the onshore portfolio. One of the most dramatic examples was in the Eagleford Shale, where our spud-to-release times are now less than 12 days compared to more than 22 days in mid-2009. 
From a broader perspective, seven of 10 major assets in the southern region had record cycle times during the quarter, and the Rockies industry study recognized four of Anadarko's contracted rigs as being among the top 10 rigs in the U.S. onshore for total footage drilled. All major areas of the portfolio provided year-over-year growth, led by the Rockies and the accelerated development activities in the shale plays. 
In the Rockies, we delivered an 11% increase in sales volumes, and several areas continued to achieve record production levels, including Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, our operated Wamsutter and Salt Creek EOR. In the Southern Appalachian region, the advancement of our shale and other unconventional resource plays contributed significant increases in sales volumes during the year as well. With the additions of the Grugan Gathering System and other infrastructure expansions in Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, by the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly doubled gross sales volumes versus the end of the third quarter. The Marcellus continues to be the only major area where we are drilling for dry natural gas due to the proximity to premium gas markets, which further enhance the already robust economics of the play. We exited the year with approximate gross sales volumes in the Marcellus of 330 million cubic feet per day from about 70 wells.
Turning to the Eagleford Shale in South Texas, we recently established ourselves as the largest producer in this play. With the existing infrastructure and service agreements in place, about 94% of all completed wells have been flowing to sales. We ended the quarter with gross sales volumes of about 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 75% is liquids. This represents a six-fold increase in volumes versus the prior year fourth quarter. 
At current market prices, the Eagleford is generating excellent economics. And with 450 million barrels of oil equivalent and net risk resource potential on our acreage and more than 2,000 identified well sites, we plan to ramp up to 10 rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2011 from two rigs at the beginning of 2010. We continue to evaluate a joint venture structure for our Eagleford program similar to what we have done in the Marcellus. 
Beyond the phenomenal growth in our shale assets in the southern region, five of our seven major operating areas achieved their lowest base decline rate during the quarter, as we continued to focus on maintaining our existing base production. Additionally, we're actively pursuing other emerging growth plays in the Bone Spring, Avalon Shale and horizontal Niobrara plays, each with encouraging results, high liquids yields and substantial running room.
Moving to our sanctioned mega projects, as you all know, the Jubilee field offshore Ghana reached its first oil milestone in a record three and a half years following discovery, which is twice as fast as the industry average. We're proud of the integrated project team to safely deliver upon the time and cost schedules for this deepwater development. Jubilee is currently producing around 50,000 barrels of oil per day from four wells, and we expect to ramp up to capacity of around 120,000 barrels per day by midyear. Jubilee also gives us an excellent foundation in Ghana from which we can grow in future years, given our additional exploration and development opportunities in these blocks. 
In Algeria, development drilling and construction work are progressing at the El Merk mega project. Initial production is anticipated around the beginning of 2012 and will be increased as the full facility is commissioned. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were making good progress on the Caesar/Tonga project and had received the necessary permits to begin completion activities in the first two wells. However, as we announced yesterday, we're disappointed that the project will not begin first production by the first half of this year, as a result of the production riser system failing our recent hydro-testing procedures. We have a team in place that is actively working toward a safe and reliable alternative. In the meantime, we want to assure you that we fully expect to be well within our 2011 production guidance of 240 million to 250 million barrels of oil equivalent that we provided last March. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are fully utilizing our two contracted rigs. We recently brought the Callisto well in line of Independence Hub and completed work-over activities on two wells in the K2 area, returning them to production. 
During 2010, as you recall, we announced several successful appraisal wells in both the Lucius and Vito fields. During the moratorium, these future mega projects continued to advance with feasibility and preliminary front-end engineering studies, as well as permit applications for additional drilling. We filed for permits with the BOEMRE to resume appraisal drilling around our Heidelberg discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as well. 
Our worldwide exploration program continued to create differentiating value for our stockholders in 2010. We believe we were again one of the most active deepwater drillers in the world, announcing eight offshore discoveries with a 60% success rate. We also were nine-for-nine in our offshore appraisal program. In addition, we continued to be successful at evaluation and development of the Eagleford and Marcellus Shales, which enabled us to establish a net risk resource potential of about 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in these two major growth areas. These successful activities and discoveries continue to expand the resource potential, confirm our geologic understanding and de-risk our positions in the U.S. onshore and in our offshore acreage positions in Brazil, Ghana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. 
Beyond the overall high success rate in Africa, according to IHS Energy, four of our exploration wells were among the five largest offshore discoveries in 2010. Three of those were in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique where we hold a 36.5% working interest in the 2.6 million acre Offshore Area 1. These natural gas discoveries were made at the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta prospects. Based on the results of those wells, our partnership is designing an accelerated appraisal program in analyzing various development options. We plan to keep at least one rig in the basin throughout 2011 to carry out an active appraisal and exploration program, as well as to conduct at least one drill stem test. 
Currently in Mozambique, we are drilling the Deepwater Tuburão's prospect, which is located approximately 19 miles southwest of the Lagosta discovery. Tuburão is a 15,000-foot test of an Eocene fan system and we hope to have results from this well within the next week. 
In West Africa, we made our second discovery offshore at Sierra Leone at the Mercury prospect, which we operate with a 65% working interest. The well encountered approximately 135 net feet of oil pay in two Cretaceous-age fan systems. The discovery also demonstrated the stratigraphic trapping systems we've identified are working, and that the petroleum system is generating high-quality oil. We expect to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore at Sierra Leone, Liberia and potentially Cote d'Ivoire, with three to five wells planned this year. 
Our partnership's 2010 activities in Ghana continues to expand the potential of this world-class petroleum province with the discovery and continuing appraisal of the Enyenra field, formerly known as Owo. Enyenra is adjacent to our Tweneboa discovery in the Deepwater Tano license, where we hold an 18% working interest. 
The partnership drilled four successful appraisal wells in this block during the year, three in the Tweneboa field and one side track in the Enyenra field. We plan to continue an active appraisal program in 2011 and expect to submit a plan of development for the area by the end of this year. 
In the adjacent West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% working interest, we drilled another successful appraisal at the Mahogany East area to the southeast of the Jubilee Field. The M5 well follow three other successful wells in the area that have enabled the partnership to submit a Declaration of Commerciality to the Ghanaian government. 
We are currently drilling the Teak prospect on the same block, about 2.5 miles northeast of the Jubilee Unit boundary. Teak is testing multiple Campanian and Tweneboa objectives, and we are encouraged by what we have seen so far in this well with results expected soon. The partnership plans to drill at least another four exploration wells this year on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna discovery on block BM-C-29, where we hold a 50% working interest. Back in November, we announced Itauna's discovery after the well encountered more than 275 net feet of oil pay in the post-salt section. We've begun drilling a bypass to the original wellbore that should enable us to obtain core data and additional reservoir and fluid information to better define the discovery. We plan to drill additional wells in the block in the latter half of 2011 contingent upon rig availability. 
I've summarized just some of the highlights of our exploration and appraisal drilling programs and encourage you to look through the quarterly operations report on our website for more information. 
Turning to the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010, we reported earnings of about $0.22 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release with certain items affecting comparability, without which, fourth quarter net income would have been about $0.07 higher or $0.29 per share. 
Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter and almost $5.4 billion for the full year. We generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in 2010. As for the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly-stated position. Consistent with the past two quarters, we've continued to apply accounting for guidelines to the facts as they are known to us today, and accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We will, of course, include expanded disclosures in our 10-K when it is filed with the SEC later this month. 
As mentioned in last night's earnings release, we ended the quarter with about $3.7 billion of cash on hand, after retiring more than $400 million of additional debt during the fourth quarter. Also in 2010, we took a number of steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and enhance liquidity, such as extending and upsizing our revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $5 billion. This facility remains undrawn. Our capital expenditures, including expense G&G [geology and geophysics], were approximately $5.3 billion for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this is nearly $200 million lower than the midpoint of original guidance.
Turning to reserves. We added 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of organic proved reserves during 2010 before the effective price revisions. This equates to a reserve replacement ratio of approximately 140%, which exceeded our target as I mentioned earlier. We accomplished this while incurring cost of just over $5 billion associated with our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.
As of our year end 2010, about 69% of our proved reserves were developed and only 31% undeveloped. An estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids. Consistent with the previous year, put up meaningly from 2008 levels, when liquids only comprised about 40% of our of product mix. In March of last year, we detailed our five-year goals and with the results in 2010, we are firmly on track to deliver upon those metrics. 
As I stated in last night's release, we are very proud of the dedication and focus of our employees who delivered very strong results in the face of significant challenges that we experienced last summer. The reference resulted in record production, better net tax, high liquids volumes, improved LOE, important fractionation agreements and infrastructure expansions and significant exploration success. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term plans and providing our 2011 guidance and capital program later this month. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we anticipate full year production to be well within the guidance we provided last March. We also expect our total capital spending program to be in line with cash flows. With that, Michael, if you would, we'd like to open it up for questions."

We are continuing to drill out there, and we have said, we'll keep the rig there at least through 2011, and we may even be bringing a second rig in towards the end of the year. We're in the process of looking at that right now. We're presently on Tuburão, that's almost done and we're getting all our data out of it. Like what we're seeing there, it's just a further extension of the -- called LaBarquen Jammer Complex [ph] to the south, about 19 miles and we should have results on that here very shortly. The rig then is going to go and really focus on defining the LaBarquen Jammer Complex [ph] better. And what we're hoping to do this year is to find the resource where we're going to get enough data from the wellbores, from DFTs, from interference testing, to look at overall volumes, deliverability, wellbore efficiencies, so what's the drainage area, what's the ultimate recovery per well so that we can start designing the development with real detail and also give the data to an outside reserve group to certify the reserves, which we're going to move forward with an LNG project. We do think that the LaBarquen Jammer Complex [ph] has already exceeded the minimum threshold for LNG, we've said that, which we thought was about 40 CF. What we're really trying to do is get those numbers pinned down to where they can be certified outside. As we move to the liquid side of it, we did find liquids down to the south of the block in our Ironclad prospect in tight reservoir. We're shooting 3D down to the south. It should start first week of February. We'll extend the existing 3D all the way in the block boundary. Then we're going to move to the north and extend the 3D all the way to the northern boundary. The south will be focused on the oil potential. The north will be more of the gas up in that same complex. The second rig that we would bring in would be for the further exploration work because most of the year is going to be tied up with all the work to get to the reserve certification for LaBarquen Jammer [ph].
 And then going over into Sierra Leone, we do like what we're seeing over there. Mercury was a nice discovery. We think that we have a good appraisal location. We said that we're going to drill three to five wells in the margin outside of Ghana. If it's three, they'll all be up in the Sierra Leone, Liberia area. The five would be, if we can clarify the situation at Cote d'Ivoire and get down there and drill the prospects that we like there. So one of those wells will be a Mercury appraisal well. We've got a good location that we think will help really prove out the volumes down there. But from a petroleum system standpoint, everything we've seen on our two wells in Sierra Leone tells us that, that basin has the same sort of potential as what we're seeing in Ghana and hopefully our Côte d'Ivoire."

We are extremely proud of our drilling group and the many accomplishments they have made. The efficiency gains have frankly stunned me. They've just done a spectacular job, working every element of the drilling process. I would hesitate to call what inning we're in because these guys continue to surprise each and every one of us. What we do feel like is once we get into a manufacturing process, that we will drain even more cost out of the system. If you take a look at the Maverick, we're getting near that. We're probably in the order of 70% or 80% into the manufacturing process. You take a look at the Marcellus, it's further behind, it's maybe 50%. Those are just rough estimates. We're starting to do more and more pad drilling in the Marcellus. You've seen the improvements. I think another thing in both of these areas, as we learn more about these reservoirs and how to drill them and how to make the curves and that type of thing, we continue to find those efficiency opportunities and I will never proclaim we're in the ninth inning."

Obviously, this helps lower the cost structure for the industry, but I still think that you've got to be in the right places until we see a little more structural change in the gas demand side. The good news is I think that's going to happen even without federal legislation, which is something I didn't believe a year and a half ago, and I think we're four to five years away from that starting to happen in a much bigger way, particularly in the power generation sector, and we try to help make some of that come true up in places like Colorado. But from our perspective, we do have in the place, the one place where we're drilling for dry gas actively in Marcellus has some notable advantages from a cost and market standpoint. So I think everybody still needs to be cautious about what they do here even with lowering costs. And obviously, you have to be in the right places in the country. But I think gas continues to surprise us even in the short term. I mean, we had a bearish view on gas for a couple of years, and frankly, it continues to stay a little higher than we thought due to a variety of factors we couldn't have anticipated. So we're generally consensus on gas directionally in the short term but we're continually mindful that we might get surprised in the upside. I'll have Chuck answer the second part."

It's now approaching 200 wells. There's really three reasons why they're in that condition. The first is those that are actually in completion progress or progress is being made on the completion. We have roughly 50 wells that are now under some stage of completion. And that is just associated with the complexity of the process of completing a horizontal well. There's several different steps in that process. There's many stages of fracturing and because we're on pads, by and large today, it takes longer to actually take a well from the start of completion to first production just because other wells on the same pad are being completed and all of the activity going on. We did have about 75 wells that are waiting on the completions, waiting for them to get in line on the completions. And finally, though we have several wells in the order of 70 wells that have actually been completed that are waiting on the pipeline connections. And that's a matter again of the process of laying lines and getting the hook ups and permits, et cetera, in that area. So it's just a steady progression of wells going through the process. And I guess I would say that we are -- that's more than I would have anticipated at this stage in the process. But after you really look into it, it's not surprising, given the terrain and the challenges associated with the completions and just the durations of the completions."

And I think we're real proud of the fact that today, we've been very conservative with regard to our shale, and bookings in about 2% to 3% of our company is shale reserves while we have tremendous upside in those as we drill out our program."

The operational performance of our assets and teams in the first quarter of 2011 was excellent. They continue to demonstrate the quality and depth of the portfolio that's been assembled. The first quarter set yet",2263,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The operational performance of our assets and teams in the first quarter of 2011 was excellent. They continue to demonstrate the quality and depth of the portfolio that's been assembled. The first quarter set yet another record for sales volume with the average sales of 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We also announced a $1.6 billion joint venture with the Korea National Oil Company in the Eagleford, highlighting the tremendous embedded value of our precision in this shale play. 
The deepwater exploration progress continued with 3 discoveries and 3 successful appraisal wells announced during the quarter. We also achieved meaningful improvement in quarter-over-quarter lease operating expenses when we announced acquisition of the Wattenberg Processing Plant, the significant benefits of which will be discussed in more detail in a few moments. 
I'll focus efforts upon operational performance in the quarter, there at the sales volume of 62 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the high end of guidance and, it's made up and of the sales volume at about 42% for the quarter. Lease Operating Expense also improved by about 13% for BOE compared to the fourth quarter 2010. These achievements contributed to a 12% sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE. The record sales volumes included significant increases in production from our shales, specifically the Marcellus and liquids-rich Eagleford plays and from our First Oil at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana. 
Regarding the Eagleford Shale where sales volumes increased by 30% quarter-over-quarter, we secured additional takeaway capacity for both crude oil and natural gas for multiple long-term pipeline and handling agreements. Capitalizing the greater than 100% current rates of return in this play, we ramped up activity to 10 operated rigs, have expanded our infrastructure and service agreements and are well positioned to continue delivering strong growth. 
We're also very pleased to welcome KNOC as a partner in the Eagleford Shale, after recently closing our joint venture. Through the partnership, KNOC will fund up to 100% of capital costs for the remainder of this year and up to 90% thereafter until the carrier's exhausted, which will likely be year end 2013. As they do this, they want 1/3 of Anadarko's interest in the play. 
Included in last night's earnings release was news that KNOC also exercised its option to acquire an approximate 25% interest in the associated Midstream assets in the Eagleford. We are eager to work alongside our new partner and our hope to expand this relationship in the future. 
Turning to Marcellus Shale, we've currently operated 8 rigs and continue to expand infrastructure and pace of our development activities. Sales volumes increased by about 82% over the previous quarter, and we recently established record grow sales volume of almost 450 million cubic feet per day from approximately 95 producing wells. 
Our emerging growth plays in the Permian Basin of West Texas also demonstrated significant sales volume to increase during the quarter. In the Bone Spring, gross sales volumes nearly doubled over the fourth quarter 2010 to almost 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day comprised of more than 75% liquids. In the shale or Avalon Shale, some of our recent wells have tested rates of between 800 and 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, also with a high liquid cut. Evaluation of the Avalon Shale in the Wolf Camp opportunity is ongoing. 
Moving to the Rockies, the Wattenberg field and greater Denver Julesburg Basin area continues to expand. The Wattenberg team achieved another new sales volume record during the quarter as they continued to maximize the robust economics of the field and capitalize on its important liquids yield, which represents about 75% of the value stream. Also in the region, we continue to test the vast potential of the horizontal Niobrara opportunity, where we hold about 1.3 million net acres, much of it economically advantaged by our land-grant ownership. 
We're seeing strong results in our operated program in the play, and we added an additional horizontal rig during the period in order to accelerate these activities. Given our premium position in the emerging Niobrara opportunity and the continued growth in the Wattenberg field, we recently acquired full ownership of the Wattenberg Processing Plant by purchasing BP's 93% stake. This purchase further aligns our midstream and upstream assets in this core area. We expect to extract additional value from the plant through modifications and future expansions that will improve run times and significantly increase capacity and liquid recoveries. We also plan to optimize our fields in order to improve margins, increase estimated ultimate recoveries and enhance efficiencies. 
The plant, combined with our facility at Fort Lofton and Western Gas Partners, recently purchased value plant, provides us with a significant portion of the processing capacity in the greater DJ Basin. The Wattenberg Plant should also be an excellent candidate for a future acquisition by Western Gas Partners. 
Further west in the Greater Natural Buttes area, sales volumes increased by about 7% over the fourth quarter. The field set a new single-day gross production record of 456 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with an approximate 30% liquids content. During the quarter, the Greater Natural Buttes team drilled 11 wells that also were deepened to the Blackhawk interval. The early results from this program are encouraging, as the Blackhawk program provides additional running room and incremental recoveries of more than 700 million cubic feet equivalent per well at an estimated development cost of less than $0.42 per Mcfe. 
Also worth noting in Wyoming's Wild Cedar Field is that we set a weekly gross production record of approximately 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. We provided additional detail on these and other assets in our first operations report that is available on our website. 
In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have continued to keep both of our contracted rigs active as we move projects forward, while working to acquire joint permits that will allow us to resume exploration and appraisal activities. At Caesar/Tonga, the project team continues to pursue parallel past riser solution, advancing the development toward First Oil in 2012. During the quarter, we successfully float tested 2 wells and each demonstrated very strong rates of more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day, with completion activities underway in the third well. As we previously announced, once the completion is finished, we plan to move the rig to West Africa late in the second quarter, begin our 2011 exploration and appraisal program in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
At the Lucius field in the Gulf of Mexico, we have a rig-on location that conducted an extended well tester in the second quarter. We expect the test to provide us with valuable insight into the reservoir's permeability, lateral extent, communication and acquifer support that will assist in the design of the facility and top size. In the meantime, our project teams continue to advance development planning and front end engineering studies at Lucius. 
Tuning to our international mega projects, as you know, we achieved a major milestone at quarter one with our first lifting with the Jubilee Field Offshore Ghana.  Oil production from this world-class field is more than 70,000 barrels of oil per day, and the partnership continues to ramp up production towards 120,000 barrels per day of capacity by the third quarter of this year. 
Additionally, we have experienced no disruptions in Algeria, and construction is progressing well at the Olmert project. The overall project is about 75% complete, and we anticipate major facilities completion and significant reduction rates around the end of 2012. 
As you've seen in our press releases, our exploration team's delivered another strong quarter, with 3 significant deepwater discoveries and 3 successful offshore appraisal wells. 
Turning to Ghana and the West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% interest, we announced both the Teak-1 and Teak-2 discoveries during the quarter. Teak-1 encountered more than 240 net feet of oil condensate natural gas pay in Cretaceous-age reservoirs. The Teak-2 discovery well was drilled between the Teak-1 well location and the Jubilee Unit boundary and encountered 90 feet of oil condensate natural gas pay. The partnership is evaluating plans to appraise both discoveries later this year. 
Also in the West Cape Three Points Block, the partnership is currently drilling the Banda prospect to the east of the previously announced Odum discovery. Once Banda is complete, the partnership plans to mobilize the rig to drill the nearby Macquarie prospects southeast of the Jubilee Unit. 
On the adjacent Deepwater Tano Block, where we hold an 18% working interest, we participated in 3 successful appraisal wells during the quarter in the Tweneboa and complex and a 4 successful Tweneboa-4 was announced by the operator subsequent to quarter's end. The rig is now in location at the Tweneboa-2 well to conduct a drill sub test. The Tweneboa and complex has the potential to be as large as Jubilee, and the partnership is continuing an active appraisal program to advance the complex toward an expected Declaration of Commerciality later this year. 
In February, we announced another major discovery in Mozambique in the Rovuma Basin. Tuburao is the fourth significant natural gas accumulation discovered in this frontier deepwater basin where we hold approximately 2.6 million acres. Tuburao encountered more than 110 net feet of natural gas pay and opened a new pay style, which further strengthened our confidence in our geological and geophysical models of the basin. Anadarko operates Tuburao with a 36.5% working interest. 
Further in the north, in the Windjammer Barquentine and Lagosta complex, we are continuing to evaluate commercial solutions and advance this future mega project. We are currently conducting operations, and in coming months, we expect to begin appraisal activities, that include multiple drillstem test in the complex. 
We're also acquiring new 3D seismic data in the basin and plan to bring in another rig to drill additional exploration wells beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier in this call, we plan to mobilize a rig from the Gulf of Mexico to West Africa later this quarter to begin our exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore Sierra Leone and Liberia. Plans include drilling the Montserrado prospect in Block 15 Offshore Liberia, where we are the operator with a 57.5% working interest. 
We also plan to utilize the rig to drill the Jupiter prospect to offshore Sierra Leone and an appraisal well in our Mercury discovery. Both of these wells are located in Block 07B-10, which we operate with a 65% working interest. 
In the Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we have been encouraged by some of the movement we've seen in recent weeks regarding well permits. We are one of the few companies that has joined both the Well Containment Group and the Marine Well Containment Company, and we are optimistic that we will be able to receive the necessary permits to resume our exploration and appraisal drilling programs in the Gulf during the second half of this year as we budgeted. 
With regard to the BP oil spill of last year, we stand by our stated position which continues to be supported by the findings of various independent investigations. Consistent with past quarters, we've begun included disclosures about regarding this event in our first quarter 10-Q filing with the SEC. 
Turning to financial results for the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which first quarter net income would've been about $0.29 per share higher, resulting in adjusted net income of $0.72 per diluted share. 
As I mentioned previously, we generated strong discretionary cash flow of nearly $1.7 billion during the first quarter. This was about $90 million more than our total capital expenditures of $1.6 billion, which included consolidation of approximately $370 million in spending at Western Gas Partners, our publicly traded Midstream MLP. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on hand and maintained significant additional liquidity to our undrawn 5-year $5 billion credit facility. Our full year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, not including the expenditures of Western Gas Partners. The $600 million increase in this number from February's estimate was discussed at the March Howard Weil Investor Conference and simply reflects the purchase of the Wattenberg Processing Plant that we discussed earlier in the call. 
With the strong first quarter results, the company continues its positive momentum as we move closer to achieving the 5-year objectives that we presented in March of 2010. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are expecting sales volumes to be in the range of $60 million to $62 million barrels of oil equivalent. This will keep us on target to meet our full year goal of 244 million to 248 barrels of oil equivalent. 
In summary, our shales and emerging liquids-rich growth plays are generating excellent results, returns and value. We have ample running room and continue to attract substantial value from the core operating areas throughout our phased assets. Jubilee is performing well and our others sanctioned mega projects continue to advance toward first production. We expect to continue a very active offshore exploration and appraisal program, providing significant value upside for our shareholders. And we are continuing to work to safely resume exploration and appraisal activities in the Gulf of Mexico during the second half of this year. With that, Tom, we'll open up the line for questions."

And when I say big, it's like 90,000 acres of full way closure so it's very significant.

I think we just finished the 2D actually acquisition side of it to help to find that follow-on potential. So that's the Canterbury Basin. And then, we have the block in the Deepwater. Of course, the Basin is an established petroleum system. Nobody's really tested the Deepwater in very methodical way. And again, our acreage position is very significant up there so we acquired 2D last year. We defined, we've mapped that now.

They continue to demonstrate the quality and depth of the portfolio that's been assembled. The first quarter set yet another record for sales volumes with the average sales of 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We also announced a $1.6 billion joint venture with Korea National Oil company in the Eagleford, highlighting the tremendous embedded value of our position in this shale play. 
The deepwater exploration progress continue, with 3 discoveries and 3 successful appraisal wells announced during the quarter. We also achieved meaningful improvement in quarter-over-quarter lease operating expenses. And we announce the acquisition of the Wattenberg Processing Plant, the significant benefits of which will be discussed in more detail in a few moments. 
I'll focus efforts upon operational performance in the quarter, there at the sales volume of 62 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the high end of guidance and, it's made up and of the sales volume at about 42% for the quarter. Lease Operating Expense also improved by about 13% per BOE compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These achievements contributed to a 12% sequential improvement and adjusted EBITDAX per BOE. The record sales volumes include a significant increases in production from our shales, specifically the Marcellus and liquids-rich Eagleford plays and from our First Oil lifting at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana. 
Regarding the Eagleford Shale, where sales volumes increased by 30% quarter-over-quarter, we secured additional takeaway capacity for both crude oil and natural gas from multiple long-term pipeline and handling agreements. Capitalizing the greater than 100% current rates of return in this play, we ramped up activity to 10 operated rigs, have expanded our infrastructure and service agreements and are well positioned to continue delivering strong growth. 
We are also very pleased to welcome KNOC as a partner in the Eagleford Shale after recently closing our joint venture. Through the partnership, KNOC will fund up to 100% of capital costs for the remainder of this year and up to 90% thereafter until the carrier is exhausted, which will likely be year end 2013. As they do this, they want 1/3 of Anadarko's interest in the play. 
Included in last night's earnings release was news that KNOC also exercised its option to acquire an approximate 25% interest in the associated midstream assets in the Eagleford. We are eager to work alongside our new partner and our hope to expand this relationship in the future. 
Turning to Marcellus Shale. We've currently operated 8 rigs and continue to expand infrastructure and pace with our development activities. Sales volumes increased by about 82% over the previous quarter, and we recently established record grow sales volumes of almost 450 million cubic feet per day from approximately 95 producing wells. 
Our emerging growth plays in the Permian Basin of West Texas also demonstrated significant sales volume to increase during the quarter. In the Bone Spring, gross sales volumes nearly doubled over the fourth quarter 2010 to almost 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day comprised of more than 75% liquids. In the shale or Avalon Shale, some of our recent wells have tested a rates of between 800 and 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, also with a high liquid cut. Evaluation of the Avalon Shale and the Wolf Camp opportunity is ongoing. 
Moving to the Rockies. The Wattenberg field and greater Denver Julesburg Basin quarter area continues to expand. The Wattenberg team achieved another new sales volume record during the quarter as they continue to maximize the robust economics of the field and capitalize on its important liquids yield, which represents about 75% of the value stream. Also in the region, we continue to test the vast potential of the horizontal Niobrara opportunity, where we hold about 1.3 million net acres, much of it an economically advantaged by our land-grant ownership. 
We're seeing strong results in our operated program in the play, and we added an additional horizontal rig during the quarter in order to accelerate these activities. Given our premium position in the emerging Niobrara opportunity and the continued growth in the Wattenberg field, we recently acquired full ownership of the Wattenberg Processing Plant by purchasing BP's 93% at stake. This purchase further aligns our midstream and upstream assets in this core area. We expect to extract additional value from the plant through modifications and future expansions that will improve run times and significantly increase capacity and liquid recoveries. We also plan to optimize our fields in order to improve margins, increase estimated ultimate recoveries and enhance efficiencies. 
The plant combined with our facility at Fort Lupton and Western Gas Partners recently purchased Platte Valley plant, provides us with a significant portion of the processing capacity in the greater DJ Basin. The Wattenberg plant should also be an excellent candidate for a future acquisition by Western Gas Partners. 
Further west in the Greater Natural Buttes area, sales volumes increased by about 7% over the fourth quarter. The field set a new single-day gross production record of 456 million cubic feet equivalent per day with an approximate 30% liquids content. During the quarter, the Greater Natural Buttes team drilled 11 Mesa Verde wells that also were deepened to the Blackhawk interval. The early results from this program are encouraging as the Blackhawk program provides additional running room, and incremental recoveries of more than 700 million cubic feet equivalent per well at an estimated development cost of less than $0.42 per Mcfe. 
Also worth noting in Wyoming's Wamsutter field is that we set a weekly gross production record of approximately 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. We provided additional detail on these and other assets in our first quarter operations report that is available on our website. 
In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have continued to keep both of our contracted rigs active as we move projects forward, while working to acquire joint permits that will allow us to resume exploration and appraisal activities. At Caesar/Tonga, the project team continues to pursue parallel paths toward a riser solution, advancing the development towards First Oil in 2012. During the quarter, we successfully float tested 2 wells and each demonstrated very strong rates of more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day, with completion activities underway in the third well. As we previously announced, once the completion is finished, we plan to move the rig to West Africa late in the second quarter, begin our 2011 exploration and appraisal program in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
At the Lucius field in the Gulf of Mexico, we have a rig-on location to conduct an extended well tester in the second quarter. We expect the test to provide us with valuable insight into the reservoir's permeability, lateral extent, communication and acquifer support that will assist in the design of the facility and top size. In the meantime, our project teams continue to advance development planning and front-end engineering studies at Lucius. 
Tuning to our international mega projects, as you know, we achieved a major milestone at quarter one with our first lifting from the Jubilee Field offshore Ghana. Current production from this world-class field is more than 70,000 barrels of oil per day, and the partnership continues to ramp up production towards 120,000 barrels per day of capacity by the third quarter of this year. 
Additionally, we have experienced no disruptions in Algeria and construction is progressing well at the El Merk project. The overall project is about 75% complete, and we anticipate major facilities completion and significant production rates around the end of 2012. 
As you've seen in our press releases, our exploration team's delivered another strong quarter, with 3 significant deepwater discoveries and 3 successful offshore appraisal wells. 
Turning in Ghana and the West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% interest, we announced both the Teak-1 and Teak-2 discoveries during the quarter. Teak-1 encountered more than 240 net feet of oil condensate natural gas pay in Cretaceous-age reservoirs. The Teak-2 discovery well was drilled between the Teak-1 well location and the Jubilee Unit boundary and encountered 90 feet of oil condensate natural gas pay. The partnership is evaluating plans to appraise both discoveries later this year. 
Also in the West Cape Three Points Block, the partnership is currently drilling the Banda prospect to the east of the previously announced Odum discovery. Once Banda is complete, the partnership plans to mobilize the rig to drill the nearby Macquarie prospect, southeast of the Jubilee Unit. 
On the adjacent Deepwater Tano Block, where we hold an 18% working interest, we participated in 3 successful appraisal wells during the quarter in the Tweneboa/Enyenra complex and a 4 successful Tweneboa-4 was announced by the operator subsequent to quarter's end. The rig is now in location at the Tweneboa-2 well to conduct a drill-stem test. The Tweneboa/Enyenra complex has the potential to be as large as Jubilee, and the partnership is continuing an active appraisal program to advance the complex toward an expected declaration of commerciality later this year. 
In February, we announced another major discovery in Mozambique in the Rovuma Basin. Tubarao is the fourth significant natural gas accumulation discovered in this frontier deepwater basin where we hold approximately 2.6 million acres. Tubarao encountered more than 110 net feet of natural gas pay and opened a new play style, which further strengthened our confidence in our geological and geophysical models of the basin. Anadarko operates Tubarao with a 36.5% working interest. 
Further in the north, in the Windjammer Barquentine and Lagosta complex, we are continuing to evaluate commercial solutions and advance this future mega project. We are currently conducting quarrying operations. And in coming months, we expect to begin appraisal activities that include multiple drill-stem test in the complex. 
We are also acquiring new 3D seismic data in the basin and plan to bring in another rig to drill additional exploration wells beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier in this call, we plan to mobilize a rig from the Gulf of Mexico to West Africa later this quarter to begin our exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore Sierra Leone and Liberia. Plans include drilling the Montserrado prospect in Block 15 Offshore Liberia, where we owe the operator with a 57.5% working interest. 
We also plan to utilize the rig to drill the Jupiter prospect to offshore Sierra Leone and an appraisal well in our Mercury discovery. Both of these wells are located in Block 07B-10, which we operate with a 65% working interest. 
In the Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we have been encouraged by some of the movement we've seen in recent weeks regarding well permits. We are one of the few companies that has joined both the Helix Well Containment Group and the Marine Well Containment Company, and we are optimistic that we will be able to receive the necessary permits to resume our exploration and appraisal drilling programs in the Gulf during the second half of this year as we budgeted. 
With regard to BP oil spill of last year, we stand by our stated position which continues to be supported by the findings of various independent investigations. Consistent with past quarters, we begun included disclosures about regarding this event in our first quarter 10-Q filing with the SEC. 
Turning to financial results for the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which first quarter net income would have been about $0.29 per share higher, resulting an adjusted net income of $0.72 per diluted share. 
As I mentioned previously, we generated strong discretionary cash flow of nearly $1.7 billion during the first quarter. This was about $90 million more than our total capital expenditures of $1.6 billion, which included consolidation of approximately $370 million in spending at Western Gas Partners, our publicly traded Midstream MLP. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on hand and maintained significant additional liquidity to our undrawn 5-year $5 billion credit facility. Our full year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, not including the expenditures of Western Gas Partners. The $600 million increase in this number from February's estimate was discussed at the March Howard Weil investor conference and simply reflects the purchase of the Wattenberg Processing Plant that we discussed earlier in the call. 
With the strong first quarter results, the company continues its positive momentum as we move closer to achieving the 5-year objectives that we presented in March of 2010. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are expecting sales volumes to be in the range of 60 to 62 million barrels of oil equivalent. This will keep us on target to meet our full year goal of 244  to 248 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
In summary, our shales and emerging liquids-rich growth plays are generating excellent results, returns and value. We have ample running room and continue to extract substantial value from the core operating areas throughout our phased assets. Jubilee is performing well and our other sanctioned mega projects continue to advance toward first production. We expect to continue a very active offshore exploration and appraisal program providing significant value upside for our shareholders. And we are continuing to work to safely resume exploration and appraisal activities in the Gulf of Mexico during the second half of this year. With that, Tom, we'll open up the line for questions."

And that is important in that 2D line also ties into a well that was drilled, tested about 10 million a day of gas and 2,300 barrels of condensate. And when you come and look at these prospects, we're looking for the same reservoir intervals that were encountered on those shelf wall, come through a syncline in the backup on a big 4-way structure. And when I say big, it's like 90,000 acres of full way closure. So it's very significant. And then because it's about 7 million, 8 million acres out there, we think we've got tremendous amount of follow-on potential, so we shot some 2D. We're out there shooting now. I think we just finished the 2D actually acquisition side of it to help to find that follow-on potential. So that's the Canterbury Basin. And then, we have the block in the Deepwater Taranaki. Of course, the Taranaki Basin is an established petroleum system. Nobody's really tested the Deepwater in a very methodical way. And again, our acreage position is very significant up there. So we acquired 2D last year. We defined, we've mapped that now. We've defined some prospects up there. And so our plans moving forward are to drill 2 wells, one in the Canterbury, one in the Taranaki Basin. We're out talking about getting rigs and discussing the availability. It does look like there are rigs available. The MOG [ph], of course, is going to be a big issue. And what we're trying to do is line up other operators in New Zealand to help share that mobilization. So we've got a lot of work to do before we actually sign the rig and get to drilling. But right now, we're targeting towards the end of the year, early 2012. If all that comes together, if not, that to be a year later. And as to how they compete in our portfolio, they compete very well. The physical terms in New Zealand are extremely attractive. And then, as I described, the potential, we see very good potential there."

They continued to demonstrate the quality and depth of the portfolio that's been assembled. The first quarter set yet another record for sales volumes with the average sales of 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We also announced a $1.6 billion joint venture with Korea National Oil company in the Eagleford, highlighting the tremendous embedded value of our position in this shale play. 
The deepwater exploration progress continued, with 3 discoveries and 3 successful appraisal wells announced during the quarter. We also achieved meaningful improvement in quarter-over-quarter lease operating expenses. And we announced the acquisition of the Wattenberg Processing Plant, the significant benefits of which will be discussed in more detail in a few moments. 
Focusing first upon the operational performance for the quarter, the record sales volume of 62 million barrels of oil equivalent were at the high end of guidance, and liquids made up an increasing portion of these sales volumes at about 42% for the quarter. Lease Operating Expense also improved by about 13% per BOE compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These achievements contributed to a 12% sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE. The record sales volumes included significant increases in production from our shales, specifically the Marcellus and liquids-rich Eagleford plays, and from our First Oil lifting at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana. 
Regarding the Eagleford Shale, where sales volumes increased by 30% quarter-over-quarter, we secured additional takeaway capacity for both crude oil and natural gas through multiple long-term pipeline and handling agreements. Capitalizing on the greater than 100% current rates of return in this play, we ramped up activity to 10 operated rigs, have expanded our infrastructure and service agreements and are well positioned to continue delivering strong growth. 
We are also very pleased to welcome KNOC as a partner in the Eagleford Shale after recently closing our joint venture. Through the partnership, KNOC will fund up to 100% of capital costs for the remainder of this year and up to 90% thereafter until the carrier is exhausted, which will likely be year-end 2013. As they do this, they warrant 1/3 of Anadarko's interest in the play. 
Included in last night's earnings release was news that KNOC also exercised its option to acquire an approximate 25% interest in the associated midstream assets in the Eagleford. We are eager to work alongside our new partner in our hope to expand this relationship in the future. 
Turning to Marcellus Shale. We've currently operated 8 rigs and continue to expand infrastructure on pace with our development activities. Sales volumes increased by about 82% over the previous quarter, and we recently established record growth sales volumes of almost 450 million cubic feet per day from approximately 95 producing wells. 
Our emerging growth plays in the Permian Basin of West Texas also demonstrated significant sales volume due to increases during the quarter. In the Bone Spring, gross sales volumes nearly doubled over the fourth quarter 2010 to almost 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day comprised of more than 75% liquids. In the shallower Avalon Shale, some of our recent wells have tested at rates of between 800 and 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, also with a high liquid cut. Evaluation of the Avalon Shale and the Wolf Camp opportunity is ongoing. 
Moving to the Rockies. The Wattenberg field and greater Denver Julesburg Basin quarter area continues to expand. The Wattenberg team achieved another new sales volume record during the quarter as it continued to maximize the robust economics of the field and capitalize on its important liquids yield, which represents about 75% of the value stream. Also in the region, we continue to test the vast potential of the horizontal Niobrara opportunity, where we hold about 1.3 million net acres, much of it in economically advantaged by our land-grant ownership. 
We're seeing strong results in our operated program in the play, and we added an additional horizontal rig during the quarter in order to accelerate these activities. Given our premier position in the emerging Niobrara opportunity and the continued growth in the Wattenberg field, we recently acquired full ownership of the Wattenberg Processing Plant by purchasing BP's 93% stake. This purchase further aligns our midstream and upstream assets in this core area. We expect to extract additional value from the plant through modifications and future expansions that will improve run times and significantly increase capacity and liquid recoveries. We also plan to optimize our fields in order to improve margins, increase estimated ultimate recoveries and enhance efficiencies. 
The plant, combined with our facility at Fort Lupton and Western Gas Partners' recently purchased Platte Valley plant, provides us with a significant portion of the processing capacity in the greater DJ Basin. The Wattenberg plant should also be an excellent candidate for a future acquisition by Western Gas Partners. 
Further west in the Greater Natural Buttes area, sales volumes increased by about 7% over the fourth quarter. The field set a new single-day gross production record of 456 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with an approximate 30% liquids content. During the quarter, the Greater Natural Buttes team drilled 11 Mesa Verde wells that also were deepened to the Blackhawk interval. The early results from this program are encouraging as the Blackhawk program provides additional running room and incremental recoveries of more than 700 million cubic feet equivalent per well at an estimated development cost of less than $0.42 per Mcfe. 
Also worth noting in Wyoming's Wamsutter field is that we set a weekly gross production record of approximately 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. We provided additional detail on these and other assets in our first quarter operations report that is available on our website. 
In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have continued to keep both of our contracted rigs active as we move projects forward, while working to acquire drilling permits that will allow us to resume exploration and appraisal activities. At Caesar/Tonga, the project team continues to pursue parallel paths toward a riser solution, advancing the development towards First Oil in 2012. During the quarter, we successfully float tested 2 wells, and each demonstrated very strong rates of more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day, with completion activities underway on the third well. As we previously announced, once the completion is finished, we plan to move the rig to West Africa late in the second quarter, begin our 2011 exploration and appraisal program in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
At the Lucius field in the Gulf of Mexico, we have a rig on location to conduct an extended well tester in the second quarter. We expect the test to provide us with valuable insight into the reservoir's permeability, lateral extent, communication and acquifer support that will assist in the design of the facility and top size. In the meantime, our project teams continue to advance development planning and front-end engineering studies at Lucius. 
Tuning to our international mega projects.  As you know, we achieved a major milestone at quarter one with our first lifting from the Jubilee Field offshore Ghana. Current production from this world-class field is more than 70,000 barrels of oil per day, and the partnership continues to ramp up production towards 120,000 barrels per day of capacity by the third quarter of this year. 
Additionally, we have experienced no disruptions in Algeria, and construction is progressing well at the El Merk project. The overall project is about 75% complete, and we anticipate major facilities completion and significant production rates around the end of 2012. 
As you've seen in our press releases, our exploration teams delivered another strong quarter, with 3 significant deepwater discoveries and 3 successful offshore appraisal wells. 
Turning in Ghana and the West Cape Three Points Block, where we hold a 31% interest, we announced both the Teak-1 and Teak-2 discoveries during the quarter. Teak-1 encountered more than 240 net feet of oil condensate natural gas pay in Cretaceous-age reservoirs. The Teak-2 discovery well was drilled between the Teak-1 well location and the Jubilee Unit boundary and encountered 90 feet of oil condensate natural gas pay. The partnership is evaluating plans to appraise both discoveries later this year. 
Also in the West Cape Three Points Block, the partnership is currently drilling the Banda prospect to the east of the previously announced Odum discovery. Once Banda is complete, the partnership plans to mobilize the rig to drill to the nearby Macquarie prospect, southeast of the Jubilee Unit. 
On the adjacent Deepwater Tano Block, where we hold an 18% working interest, we participated in 3 successful appraisal wells during the quarter in the Tweneboa/Enyenra complex, and a 4 successful Tweneboa-4 was announced by the operator subsequent to quarter's end. The rig is now on location at the Tweneboa-2 well to conduct a drill-stem test. The Tweneboa/Enyenra complex has the potential to be as large as Jubilee, and the partnership is continuing an active appraisal program to advance the complex toward an expected declaration of commerciality later this year. 
In February, we announced another major discovery in Mozambique in the Rovuma Basin. Tubarao is the fourth significant natural gas accumulation discovered in this frontier deepwater basin where we hold approximately 2.6 million acres. Tubarao encountered more than 110 net feet of natural gas pay and opened a new play style, which further strengthened our confidence in our geological and geophysical models of the basin. Anadarko operates Tubarao with a 36.5% working interest. 
Further north, in the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta complex, we are continuing to evaluate commercial solutions and advance this future mega project. We are currently conducting quarrying operations. And in coming months, we expect to begin appraisal activities that include multiple drill-stem tests in the complex. 
We are also acquiring new 3D seismic data in the basin and plan to bring in another rig to drill additional exploration wells beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier in this call, we plan to mobilize a rig from the Gulf of Mexico to West Africa later this quarter to begin our exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore Sierra Leone and Liberia. Plans include drilling the Montserrado prospect in Block 15 Offshore Liberia, where we are the operator with a 57.5% working interest. 
We also plan to utilize the rig to drill the Jupiter prospect offshore Sierra Leone and an appraisal well in our Mercury discovery. Both of these wells are located in Block 07B-10, which we operate with a 65% working interest. 
In the Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we have been encouraged by some of the movement we've seen in recent weeks regarding well permits. We are one of the few companies that has joined both the Helix Well Containment Group and the Marine Well Containment Company, and we are optimistic that we will be able to receive the necessary permits to resume our exploration and appraisal drilling programs in the Gulf during the second half of this year as we budgeted. 
With regard to BP oil spill of last year, we stand by our stated position, which continues to be supported by the findings of various independent investigations. Consistent with past quarters, we have again included disclosures regarding this event in our first quarter 10-Q filing with the SEC. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which first quarter net income would have been about $0.29 per share higher, resulting in adjusted net income of $0.72 per diluted share. 
As I mentioned previously, we generated strong discretionary cash flow of nearly $1.7 billion during the first quarter. This was about $90 million more than our total capital expenditures of $1.6 billion, which included consolidation of approximately $317 million in spending at Western Gas Partners, our publicly traded Midstream MLP. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on hand and maintained significant additional liquidity through our undrawn 5-year $5 billion credit facility. Our full year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, not including the expenditures of Western Gas Partners. The $600 million increase in this number from February's estimate was discussed at the March Howard Weil investor conference and simply reflects the purchase of the Wattenberg Processing Plant that we discussed earlier in the call. 
With the strong first quarter results, the company continues its positive momentum as we move closer to achieving the 5-year objectives that we presented in March of 2010. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are expecting sales volumes to be in a range of 60 to 62 million barrels of oil equivalent. This will keep us on target to meet our full year goal of 244 to 248 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
In summary, our shales and emerging liquid-rich growth plays are generating excellent results, returns and value. We have ample running room and continue to extract substantial value from the core operating areas throughout our phased assets. Jubilee is performing well, and our other sanctioned mega projects continue to advance toward first production. We expect to continue a very active offshore exploration and appraisal program providing significant value upside for our shareholders. And we are continuing to work to safely resume exploration and appraisal activities in the Gulf of Mexico during the second half of this year. With that, Tom, we'll open up the line for questions."

And we're actively developing the Niobrara in both the horizontal and vertical sense in and around Wattenberg and expanding out to the north with the industry. And the industry's, along with us, are taking a lot of effort to evaluate and delineate the potential in Niobrara, and we're in the midst of that. 1 or 2 of the 3 rigs we currently have -- or is doing work north of the Wattenberg Field proper. And what we expect to see happening is based upon results, we could see that expanded quite considerably. But it's going to take great results before we make those decisions, and we're doing a lot of evaluation work.  We have a very extensive land position. I think it's around 1.3 million acres combined. And so it's going to take us a while to really evaluate what we have.  And it even can move up into the southern Powder River Basin area, which we have a nice land position as well. So it's going to be a while before we can really answer that question directly, but we certainly see the potential to grow extensively in the area."

We've got a 3D in the Canterbury Basin over what we call our Carrack and Caravel prospects. That is have the 2D line that ties up onto the shelf. And that is important in that, that 2D line also ties into a well that was drilled, tested about 10 million a day of gas and 2,300 barrels of condensate. And when you come and look at these prospects, we're looking for the same reservoir intervals that were encountered on that shelf wall, come through a syncline and then back up on a big 4-way structure. And when I said big, it's like 90,000 acres of 4-way closure. So it's very significant. And then because it's about 7 million, 8 million acres out there, we think we've got tremendous amount of follow-on potential, so we shot some 2D. We're out there shooting now. I think we just finished the 2D, actually acquisition side of it, to help define that follow-on potential. So that's the Canterbury Basin. And then we have the block in the Deepwater Taranaki. Of course, the Taranaki Basin is an established petroleum system. Nobody's really tested the Deepwater in very methodical way. And again, our acreage position's very significant up there. So we acquired 2D last year. We defined, we've mapped that now. We've defined some prospects up there. And so our plans moving forward are to drill 2 wells, one in the Canterbury, one in the Taranaki Basin. We're out talking about getting rigs and discussing the availability. It does look like there are rigs available. The mob, of course, is going to be a big issue. And what we're trying to do is line up other operators in New Zealand to help share that mobilization. So we've got a lot of work to do before we actually sign the rig and get to drilling. But right now, we're targeting towards the end of the year, early 2012, if all that comes together. If not, it'd be a year later. And as to how they compete in our portfolio, they compete very well. The fiscal terms in New Zealand are extremely attractive.

We're pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, and we'll now share the significant achievements and upcoming catalysts with you. 
First the highlights. We achieved record crude oil NGL sales volumes of almost 300,000 barrels of oil per day -- excuse me 300,000 barrels per day, which resulted in significantly improved corporate margins and cash flow. We finalized the Lucius agreement, which further enhances the economic efficiency of this future megaproject. We successfully tested 3 wells at the Caesar/Tonga development, with each fill in rate of about 15,000 barrels of oil per day. we closed of the purchase of the Wattenberg plant in Colorado, which will improve recoveries and enable future expansion in the DJ Basin, including growth in the horizontal Niobrara play. 
The depth of the portfolio allowed us to direct capital investments toward areas that offer higher liquid yields. As a result of this focus, total liquids sales volumes for the quarter were 13% higher than the second quarter 2010, amounting to an increase of 3.1 million barrels. The increase in liquid volumes contributed to a 29% increase in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE over the same period last year. This margin expansion was enhanced by the widening differential between WTI and Brent, as more than 70% of our crude production is based on Brent equivalent pricing rather than WTI. 
Our record sales liquids volumes also contributed more than $1.8 billion in discretionary cash flow for the quarter. This cash flow covered our capital expenditures in the quarter, including a onetime investment of $518 million associated with the Wattenberg plant acquisition, while still generating more than $100 million of free cash flow.  Liquids growth was particularly strong in the Rockies. The Wattenberg field in Colorado delivered a 41% increase in liquids volumes versus the second quarter of 2010 and continues to set production records for the field. 
In the DJ Basin, we are encouraged by what we are seeing from our horizontal Niobrara program. We have significant running room of about 900,000 net perspective acres in the Denver Jewelsburg area, the majority of which is economically advantaged by our ownership via a land grant. The are focused on horizontal Niobrara opportunities in the DJ Basin, and we expect to add another rig to test multiple locations further north in the Powder River basin, where we hold an additional 360,000 net perspective acres. 
In the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, we set another fuel production record during the quarter, with average sales volumes representing a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2010. We're currently operating 6 rigs in the area and recently initiated construction out of a major pipeline and plant expansion that will increase our liquids processing capacity by about 250 million cubic feet per day. 
Additionally last month, the U.S. Department of Interior recognized and supported our collaborative efforts to address the Greater Natural Buttes expansion project. This is a significant step forward in the infill development of this area that offers tremendous resource potential with more than 6,000 identified drill sites that will provide sustained production and economic growth for the region. 
Moving to our Southern Appalachian region, liquids volumes increased by 24% with well volumes up 47% relative to the second quarter of 2010. In the Eagleford Shale, we increased gross sales volumes to approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the second quarter compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the first quarter 2011. We continue to be very active in the Eagleford with 11 rigs running. We achieved first production from 33 wells during the quarter and continued to improve drilling efficiencies and recently drilled a total of 20 wells, each in less than 10 days. 
In our West Texas Permian oil projects, liquids sales volumes for the quarter more than doubled over the same quarter in 2010. We've also continued to improve drilling efficiency by reducing our average drilling cycle times by about 20% or 7 days versus 2010. 
Turning to the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we're currently producing more than 500 million gross cubic feet per day from about 125 wells. Anadarko operates 7 rigs here, and we have safely reduced average rate cycle times by about 20% relative to last year. 
Now as an update on our megaprojects, we'll start to offshore Ghana at Jubilee. The partnership continues to ramp production toward capacity, which contributed significantly to our increase in our volumes during the second quarter. Current gross production is averaging about 80,000 barrels of oil per day. 
In Algeria, the project is nearly 80% complete. Construction of the central processing facility and its associated infrastructure is progressing, and the project remains on track for full facility completion in late 2012. 
At Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico, we recently completed flow tests on 3 wells. Each demonstrated robust flow rates of approximately 15,000 barrels per day of high quality 27-degree API gravity oil. We're progressing 2 parallel riser solutions and expect to achieve first production in 2012. 
With unitization and expected of Lucius in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're eager to add it to our future list of megaprojects. As announced last week, we'll operate the unit with 35% working interest. Subsequent to the unitization, we also signed a production handling agreement, whereby natural gas produced from Exxon's Hadrian South deal will be processed with Lucius facility, in return for a throughput fee and reimbursement of all capital associated with the expanded gas capacity. This agreement will also result in higher natural gas price utilizations for the Lucius partnership to reduce transportation costs. 
During the quarter, we also completed a successful well test at Lucius. As designed, the well more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day of high-quality 29-degree API gravity oil. The test reinforced our previous resource estimates and indicated that Lucius can be developed with a minimal number of wells. The economics of Lucius were already very compelling, and the results of the flow test unitization agreement and the production handling agreement have elevated those economics to a higher level, making Lucius one of the most economically efficient projects in our portfolio. 
We've already begun ordering long-lead-time items including the floating trust facility that we designed with a capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. We expect to sanction this project later this year and are targeting 2014 for first production. 
Our offshore exploration appraisal program is accelerating significantly. We're embarking on one of the most active drilling campaigns in the company's history. Let me highlight the activities off the coast of West Africa. The drillship has just arrived offshore Liberia to drill the Montserrado prospect. Following completion of activities in Montserrado, we plan to move the drillship to Sierra Leone to test the Jupiter prospect and drill the first Mercury appraisal well.  We also plan to remain very active in Ghana and Mozambique, with additional drilling activities in Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and China.  In addition, we expect to receive a permit to drill the Heidelberg appraisal wells soon and look forward to resuming an active program in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter. We recorded earnings of $1.08 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which second quarter net income would have been about $0.06 per share higher. Although we mentioned this earlier, it's worth repeating that adjusted EBITDAX per BOE increased by about 29% versus the prior year quarter and discretionary cash flow is very strong at $1.8 billion, generating more than $100 million

We ended the second quarter with approximately $.4 billion of cash on hand in addition to the undrawn $5 billion credit facility, which has a term through 2015. We also entered in new hedges for a portion of our 2013 natural gas production to 3-way collars and this appears in the earnings release. 
As an update to the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly stated position that we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We'll provide updated information on this subject in our forthcoming 10-Q. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales line to be in the range of 58 to 61 million barrels of oil equivalent. This reflects a risk operational profile that includes assumptions for downtime related to weather and facilities. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the performance of the portfolio in our quarterly results, and we're excited about the numerous significant catalysts in the months ahead. We look forward to updating you to on progress in the coming quarters. And with that, Jeff, I might ask you to open it up for questions."

We're pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, and we'll now share the significant achievements and upcoming catalyst with you. First, the highlights. We achieved record crude oil NGL sales volumes of almost",1303,"Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, and we'll now share the significant achievements and upcoming catalyst with you. 
First, the highlights. We achieved record crude oil NGL sales volumes of almost 300,000 barrels of oil per day -- excuse me, 300,000 barrels per day, which resulted in significantly improved corporate margins and cash flow. We finalized the Lucius unitization agreement, which further enhances the economic efficiency of this future megaproject. We successfully tested 3 wells at the Caesar/Tonga development, with each filling in at rates of about 15,000 barrels of oil per day. And we closed the purchase of the Wattenberg plant in Colorado, which will improve recoveries and enable future expansion in the DJ Basin, including growth in the horizontal Niobrara play. 
The depth of the portfolio allowed us to direct capital investments toward areas that offer higher liquid yields. As a result of this focus, total liquids sales volumes for the quarter were 13% higher than the second quarter 2010, amounting to an increase of 3.1 million barrels. The increase in liquid volumes contributed to a 29% increase in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE over the same period last year. This margin expansion was enhanced by the widening differential between WTI and Brent, as more than 70% of our crude production is based on Brent equivalent pricing rather than WTI. 
Our record sales -- liquids volumes also contributed more than $1.8 billion in discretionary cash flow for the quarter. This cash flow covered our capital expenditures in the quarter, including a one-time investment of $518 million associated with the Wattenberg plant acquisition, while still generating more than $100 million of free cash flow. Liquids growth was particularly strong in the Rockies. The Wattenberg field in Colorado delivered a 41% increase in liquids volumes versus the second quarter of 2010 and continues to set production records for the field. 
In the DJ Basin, we are encouraged by what we are seeing from our horizontal Niobrara program. We have significant running room with about 900,000 net perspective acres in the Denver-Julesburg area, the majority of which is economically advantaged by our fee mineral ownership via the land grant. Running 3 rigs that are focused on horizontal Niobrara opportunities in the DJ Basin, and we expect to add another rig to test multiple locations further north in the Powder River Basin, where we hold an additional 360,000 net perspective acres. 
In the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, we set another fuel production record during the quarter, with average sales volumes representing a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2010. We're currently operating 6 rigs in the area and recently, initiate a construction on a major pipeline and plant expansion that will increase our liquids processing capacity by about 250 million cubic feet per day. 
Additionally, last month, the U.S. Department of Interior recognized and supported our collaborative efforts to address the Greater Natural Buttes expansion project. This is a significant step forward in the infield development of this area that offers tremendous resource potential with more than 6,000 identified drill sites that will provide sustained production and economic growth for the region. 
Moving to our Southern and Appalachian region, liquids volumes increased by 24% with oil volumes up 47% relative to the second quarter of 2010. In the Eagleford Shale, we increased gross sales volumes to approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the second quarter compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the first quarter 2011. We continue to be very active in the Eagleford with 11 rigs running. We achieved first production from 33 wells during the quarter and continued to improve drilling efficiencies and recently, drilled a total of 20 wells, each in less than 10 days. 
In our West Texas Permian oil projects, liquids sales volumes for the quarter more than doubled over the same quarter in 2010. We've also continued to improve drilling efficiency by reducing our average drilling cycle times by about 20% or 7 days versus 2010. 
Turning to the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we're currently producing more than 500 million gross cubic feet per day from about 125 wells. Anadarko operates 7 rigs here, and we've safely reduced average drilling cycle times by about 20% relative to last year. 
Now as an update on our megaprojects, we'll start Offshore, Ghana at Jubilee. The partnership continues to ramp production toward capacity, which contributed significantly to our increase in oil volumes during the second quarter. Current gross production is averaging about 80,000 barrels of oil per day. 
In Algeria, the El Merk project is nearly 80% complete. Construction of the central processing facility as an associated infrastructure is progressing, and the project remains on track for full facility completion in late 2012. 
At Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico, we recently completed flow tests on 3 wells. Each demonstrated robust flow rates of approximately 15,000 barrels per day of high-quality 27-degree API gravity oil. We're progressing 2 parallel riser solutions and expect to achieve first production in 2012. 
With unitization and expected sanctioning of Lucius in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're eager to add it to our future list of megaprojects. As announced last week, we'll operate the unit with 35% working interest. Subsequent to the unitization, we also signed a production handling agreement, whereby natural gas produced from Exxon's Hadrian South deal will be processed with Lucius facility, in return for a throughput fee and reimbursement of all capital associated with the expanded gas capacity. This agreement will also result in higher natural gas price utilizations for the Lucius partnership to reduce transportation costs. 
During the quarter, we also completed a successful well test at Lucius. As designed, the well flowed more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day of high-quality 29-degree API gravity oil. The test reinforced our previous resource estimates and indicated that Lucius can be developed with a minimal number of wells. The economics of Lucius were already very compelling, and the results of the flow test unitization agreement and the production handling agreement have elevated those economics to a higher level, making Lucius one of the most economically efficient projects in our portfolio. 
We've already begun ordering long-lead-time items including the floating truss spar production facility that will be designed with a capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. We expect to sanction this project later this year and are targeting 2014 for first production. 
Our Offshore exploration appraisal program is accelerating significantly. We're embarking on one of the most active drilling campaigns in the company's history. Let me highlight the activities off the coast of West Africa. The drillship has just arrived Offshore Liberia to drill the Montserrado prospect. Following completion of activities in Montserrado, we plan to move the drillship to Sierra Leone to test the Jupiter prospect and drill the first Mercury appraisal well. We also plan to remain very active in Ghana and Mozambique, with additional drilling activities in Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and China. In addition, we expect to receive a permit to drill the Heidelberg appraisal wells soon and look forward to resuming an active program in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter. We reported earnings of $1.08 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which second quarter net income would have been about $0.06 per share higher. Although we mentioned this earlier, it's worth repeating that adjusted EBITDAX per BOE increased by about 29% versus the prior year quarter and discretionary cash flow is very strong at $1.8 billion, generating more than $100 million

Just to repeat, we reported earnings of $1.08 per diluted share. And as with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which second quarter net income would have been about $0.06 per share higher. 
And although we mentioned this earlier, it's worth repeating that adjusted EBITDAX per BOE increased by about 29% versus the prior year quarter and discretionary cash flow was very strong at $1.8 billion, generating more than $100 million of free cash flow after a one-time $0.5 billion investment in the Wattenberg plant. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on hand in addition to the undrawn $5 billion credit facility, which has a term through 2015. We also entered in new hedges for a portion of our 2013 natural gas production through 3-way collars and this appears in the earnings release. 
As an update to the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly-stated position that we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We'll provide updated information on this subject in our forthcoming 10-Q. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales volumes to be in the range of 58 to 61 million barrels of oil equivalent. This reflects a risk operational profile that includes assumptions for downtime related to weather and facilities. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the performance of the portfolio in our quarterly results, and we're excited about the numerous significant catalysts in the months ahead. We look forward to updating you to on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, Jeff, I might ask you to open it up for questions."

So we want to get that up front. And so because we got a very big project here, we want to make sure we got all the data that we need up front. As to the Camarão, it's not an oil project or prospect.

What we're seeing in Wattenberg, just a big picture, if you step back far enough, the early returns on our horizontal drilling campaign had been outstanding. And what we've decided to do is make strategic moves together, all the value chain we possibly can within Wattenberg inclusive of the plants, the gathering system, and land. And through that, we are going to put a very comprehensive development plan together, which includes the full utilization of all the plant assets we have out there, which now include the Wattenberg plant we just acquired from BP, the Platte Valley plant we acquired from EnCana and the facilities that we had, legacy facilities that we had at Fort Lupton. So the combination of all of those, we think we can use to reduce our land pressures, increase our run time and increase our recoveries both on our base production, which has historically been in Niobrara and Codell and adjacent wells and take full advantage of our horizontal program in the Niobrara, both inside Wattenberg and the greater DJ."

After a particular time period, then either party can move forward with arbitration. We have not reached that time yet. And then that would invoke the time line for arbitration, which at the earliest, would be sometime next year. With respect to settlement, we feel good still about our position that we've talked about for over a year now, but at the same time, remain open to discussions."

And then we're presently involved with the Kakuna well, which is drilling. We have a carried working interest in that well, so they have successfully obtained a permit on that.

We're pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, and we'll now share the significant achievements and upcoming catalyst with you. 
First, the highlights. We achieved record crude oil NGL sales volumes of almost 300,000 barrels of oil per day -- excuse me, 300,000 barrels per day, which resulted in significantly improved corporate margins and cash flow. We finalized the Lucius unitization agreement, which further enhances the economic efficiency of this future megaproject. We successfully tested 3 wells at the Caesar/Tonga development, with each filling in at rates of about 15,000 barrels of oil per day. And we closed the purchase of the Wattenberg plant in Colorado, which will improve recoveries and enable future expansion in the DJ Basin, including growth in the horizontal Niobrara play. 
The depth of the portfolio allowed us to direct capital investments toward areas that offer higher liquid yields. As a result of this focus, total liquids sales volumes for the quarter were 13% higher than the second quarter 2010, amounting to an increase of 3.1 million barrels. The increase in liquids volumes contributed to a 29% increase in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE over the same period last year. This margin expansion was enhanced by the widening differential between WTI and Brent, as more than 70% of our crude production is based on Brent equivalent pricing rather than WTI. 
Our record sales -- liquids volumes also contributed more than $1.8 billion in discretionary cash flow for the quarter. This cash flow covered our capital expenditures in the quarter, including a one-time investment of $518 million associated with the Wattenberg plant acquisition, while still generating more than $100 million of free cash flow. Liquids growth was particularly strong in the Rockies. The Wattenberg field in Colorado delivered a 41% increase in liquids volumes versus the second quarter of 2010 and continues to set production records for the field. 
In the DJ Basin, we are encouraged by what we are seeing from our horizontal Niobrara program. We have significant running room with about 900,000 net perspective acres in the Denver-Julesburg area, the majority of which is economically advantaged by our fee mineral ownership via the land grant. We're running 3 rigs that are focused on horizontal Niobrara opportunities in the DJ Basin, and we expect to add another rig to test multiple locations further north in the Powder River Basin, where we hold an additional 360,000 net perspective acres. 
In the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, we set another fuel production record during the quarter, with average sales volumes representing a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2010. We're currently operating 6 rigs in the area and recently, initiated construction on a major pipeline and plant expansion that will increase our liquids processing capacity by about 250 million cubic feet per day. 
Additionally, last month, the U.S. Department of the Interior recognized and supported our collaborative efforts to address the Greater Natural Buttes expansion project. This is a significant step forward in the infield development of this area that offers tremendous resource potential with more than 6,000 identified drill sites that will provide sustained production and economic growth for the region. 
Moving to our Southern and Appalachian region, liquids volumes increased by 24% with oil volumes up 47% relative to the second quarter of 2010. In the Eagleford Shale, we increased gross sales volumes to approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the second quarter compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the first quarter of 2011. We continue to be very active in the Eagleford with 11 rigs running. We achieved first production from 33 wells during the quarter and continued to improve drilling efficiencies and recently drilled a total of 20 wells, each in less than 10 days. 
In our West Texas Permian oil projects, liquids sales volumes for the quarter more than doubled over the same quarter in 2010. We've also continued to improve drilling efficiency by reducing our average drilling cycle times by about 20% or 7 days versus 2010. 
Turning to the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we're currently producing more than 500 million gross cubic feet per day from about 125 wells. Anadarko operates 7 rigs here, and we've safely reduced average drilling cycle times by about 20% relative to last year. 
Now as an update on our megaprojects, we'll start Offshore, Ghana at Jubilee. The partnership continues to ramp production toward capacity, which contributed significantly to our increase in oil volumes during the second quarter. Current gross production is averaging about 80,000 barrels of oil per day. 
In Algeria, the El Merk project is nearly 80% complete. Construction of the central processing facility as an associated infrastructure is progressing, and the project remains on track for full facility completion in late 2012. 
At Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico, we recently completed flow tests on 3 wells. Each demonstrated robust flow rates of approximately 15,000 barrels per day of high-quality 27-degree API gravity oil. We're progressing 2 parallel riser solutions and expect to achieve first production in 2012. 
With unitization and expected sanctioning of Lucius in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're eager to add it to our future list of megaprojects. As announced last week, we'll operate the unit with a 35% working interest. Subsequent to the unitization, we also signed a production handling agreement, whereby natural gas produced from Exxon's Hadrian South deal will be processed through the Lucius facility, in return for a throughput fee and reimbursement of all capital associated with the expanded gas capacity. This agreement will also result in higher natural gas price utilizations for the Lucius partnership to reduce transportation costs. 
During the quarter, we also completed a successful well test at Lucius. As designed, the well flowed more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day of high-quality 29-degree API gravity oil. The test reinforced our previous resource estimates and indicated that Lucius can be developed with a minimal number of wells. The economics of Lucius were already very compelling, and the results of the flow test unitization agreement and the production handling agreement have elevated those economics to a higher level, making Lucius one of the most economically efficient projects in our portfolio. 
We've already begun ordering long-lead-time items including the floating truss spar production facility that will be designed with a capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. We expect to sanction this project later this year and are targeting 2014 for first production. 
Our Offshore exploration appraisal program is accelerating significantly. We're embarking on one of the most active drilling campaigns in the company's history. Let me highlight the activities off the coast of West Africa. The drillship has just arrived Offshore Liberia to drill the Montserrado prospect. Following completion of activities in Montserrado, we plan to move the drillship to Sierra Leone to test the Jupiter prospect and drill the first Mercury appraisal well. We also plan to remain very active in Ghana and Mozambique, with additional drilling activities in Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and China. In addition, we expect to receive a permit to drill the Heidelberg appraisal wells soon and look forward to resuming an active program in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter. We reported earnings of $1.08 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which second quarter net income would have been about $0.06 per share higher. Although we mentioned this earlier, it's worth repeating that adjusted EBITDAX per BOE increased by about 29% versus the prior year quarter and discretionary cash flow is very strong at $1.8 billion, generating more than $100 million

We ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on hand in addition to the undrawn $5 billion credit facility, which has a term through 2015. We also entered in new hedges for a portion of our 2013 natural gas production through 3-way collars and this appears in the earnings release. 
As an update to the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly stated position that we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We'll provide updated information on this subject in our forthcoming 10-Q. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales volumes to be in the range of 58 to 61 million barrels of oil equivalent. This reflects a risk operational profile that includes assumptions for downtime related to weather and facilities. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the performance of the portfolio in our quarterly results, and we're excited about the numerous significant catalysts in the months ahead. We look forward to updating you to on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, Jeff, I might ask you to open it up for questions."

Good morning, everyone. Cost of operating results for the third quarter, in addition to recent news including the expanded recoverable resource base in Mozambique, continue to reinforce our confidence in the strength of the company's portfolio. We recently replaced the significant financial risks associated with the Macondo event behind us, while stakeholders to focus upon the tremendous value embedded in Anadarko's assets, some of which we will discuss in today's call. 
We continue to achieve strong operating results during the quarter. Total sales volumes were at the high end of guidance of 61 million barrels of oil equivalent and included a 10% increase in liquid sales volumes over the third quarter of 2010. This increase in higher-margin liquids contributed to free cash flow of $576 million. 
The Deepwater exploration and appraisal programs delivered a 75% success rate during the quarter, with significant discoveries in appraisals in Ghana and Mozambique. 
The U.S. onshore shale plays delivered extraordinary growth of more than 160% relative to where we were at this time last year. We're looking forward to further expand this opportunity set in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica Shale play in Ohio, where we recently began joint activity on our 300,000 gross acres. 
We continue in directing much of our near-term capital spending toward liquids-rich areas of our asset base. We achieved a 10% increase in liquid sales volumes relative to the third quarter 2010. These results were highlighted by a 30% year-over-year increase in oil sales volumes from the U.S. onshore properties. 
We also benefited from excellent price realizations as approximately 70% of our crude volumes are based on Brent equivalent indices. This generated a $10 per barrel premium to TWI on our oil volumes. 
With regard to NGLs, the price picture is similarly positive as we realize an increase from 50% of equivalent index crude to 62% of WTI oil pricing on our NGL volumes. The Rockies region contributed meaningfully to the company's third quarter growth and surpassed the production milestone of more than 300 thousands barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is an 11% increase over last year's third quarter. This growth was highlighted by the Wattenberg Field in Colorado which delivered record sales volumes, including a 36% increase in liquids volumes over the third quarter of 2010, largely driven by the success of our expanded horizontal drilling program. 
In the quarter, we drilled 12 horizontal well targeting the Niobrara with excellent results. As one example to well, we've achieved a 24-hour daily flow rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil plus almost 2.5 million cubic feet of gas. Based on the positive results of this program and its projected growth, we've been aggressively expanding our midstream processing and gathering infrastructure throughout the basin. 
The horizontal Niobrara program holds tremendous potential and is primarily located in acreage that is economically advantaged due to our ownership of the mineral rights throughout the land grant. In a couple of weeks, we plan to share a more detailed look at this program in the value proposition it offers for our investors. 
Moving to the Greater Natural Buttes Area of Utah, we continue to set
daily and monthly production records during the quarter. Net sales volumes in this period were 36% higher than the third quarter of 2010. Construction's advancing on schedule for a major plant expansion that will increase our cryogenic processing capacity in this area for about 500 million cubic feet per day, resulting in an incremental gross recovery of about 15,000 barrels per day of NGLs. 
In the Southern and Appalachian region, we continue to rapidly increase production to drive efficiencies in our drilling and completion cycle times. In the Eagleford Shale, we're running 10 rigs and production is growing by more than 120% over the third quarter of 2010. Our exit rate  at the end of the third quarter was approximately 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of gross production, which is a 47% increase over the exit rate in the prior quarter. We remain focused on continuing to improve price realizations with enhanced access to Gulf coast markets for our liquids and expanded transportation options for produced natural gas. These exploits have bolstered our rates of return in the field which already exceeded 100%. 
In Pennsylvania, we achieved sales volume growth year-over-year of approximately 300% from the Marcellus Shale. We continue to expand gathering and processing capacity, and our exit rate in the third quarter surpassed 600 million cubic feet per day of gross sales volumes, which is up more than 30% sequentially from the prior quarter. 
Our West Texas Permian oil price nearly tripled in liquids volumes relative to the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, Anadarko participated in 15 total Bone Spring and Avalon Shale wells, as we continued to test our position in these emerging growth plays. 
Transitioning to our mega projects, our teams have continued to make good progress during the quarter. The Jubilee field offshore Ghana was a significant contributor to the company's 27% growth in international oil volumes over the prior year. All Phase 1 wells have been drilled, and current oil production from Jubilee is an excess of 85,000 barrels per day. The operator's resource estimate for Jubilee remains unchanged although some mechanical issues related to completion techniques will require a sidetrack of one of the producing wells and downhole remediation of certain other wells. Once these completion issues have been resolved, production is expected to ramp toward facility capacity.  Additionally, 8 production and injection wells are expected to commence drilling in 2012 as part of the plan to Phase 1A program. 
Now, a construction of the project is 883% complete and remains on target to begin production of significant oil volumes near the end of 2012. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to our Tonga mega project. During the quarter, a riser solution was selected, and we expect to deliver first production by maybe midyear 2012. 
During the quarter, we also announced a unitization agreement for our operating development in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction is underway in the truss spar production facility which will have a capacity of more than 80,000 barrels of oil and 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. We remain on track to sanction Lucius prior to year end with production expected in 2014. Thus, we expect to continue our exploitation program near Lucius, and we anticipate as part of the Spartacus exploration prospect around the first of the year. 
In Mozambique, we continue to expand one of the company's largest ever hydrocarbon discoveries. We announced that our first appraisal well of the Windjammer Barquentine and Lagosta Complex was successful, with the Barquentine-2 well encountered 230 feet of net natural gas pay. Also subsequent to quarter end, we also announced the Camarão well and discovered new zones and included a successful appraisal that confirmed connectivity with the Windjammer and Lagosta discoveries while spanning that a distance of more than 15 miles. 
Based upon our 5 successful penetrations in the complex to date, the static pressure connectivity and the numerous cores that have been collected and analyzed, we have a high level of confidence that our acreage offshore Mozambique holds an excess of 10 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. And we fully expect our current recoverable resource base to increase as we continue a significant exploration and appraisal work ahead of us, including the evaluation of 2 newly acquired 3D seismic data sets and expanded prospect opportunities. 
We accelerate our program which includes reservoir testing and up to 7 exploration and appraisal wells over the next 12 months, mobilizing the Deepwater Millennium to become our second drillship working in Mozambique. Enormous scale of this resource already validated by 5 penetrations covering an area spanning more than 115 square miles led us to increase our initial LNG development plans to include a minimum of 2 5-million-ton-per-annum trains that, with an ability to expand even further. Once this initial infrastructure is constructed, it is expected to provide economies of scale that can generate significant cost savings for each incremental train. It's an exciting project for the government and people of Mozambique and our partnership. Our integrated project team is continuing to work with the government to certify reserves and reach a final investment decision in 2013. 
In West Africa, our exploration and appraisal programs also continue to deliver a differentiating success. In Ghana, our partnership announced a late oil discovery one prospect in the West Cape Three Points Block. We're also currently drilling the Teak-3 Well in the same block, and continued success in this area has the potential another development in the block. 
In the adjacent Deepwater Tano Block, a successful appraisal well of Enyenra-3A confirmed a continuous light oil column of almost 1,200 feet and indicated static pressure communication with the old discovery well located 4 miles updip and the Enyenra-2 appraisal well to the south. 
Also on the block, the partnership successfully quote tested 2 wells in the Tweneboa board field. Both tests confirmed expectations and we are now moving towards sanctioning of the Tweneboa/Enyenra complex in 2012. 
Anadarko also spudded its first Deepwater well in Liberian waters during the quarter as part of a 5-well program in the Liberian and basins. Once this well in Montserrado is complete, the company plans to mobilize the rig to Sierra Leone and drill the Jupiter exploration prospect, followed by an appraisal of our previous Mercury discovery. 
Another rig is also expected to arrive in Cote d'Ivoire during the fourth quarter to drill the Kosrou and Bonn prospects. 
Turning to Brazil and the Campus basin, we are drilling the Itaupu-2 pre-salt appraisal well now and expect results soon. We also recently spud the Itauna-2 well, which is an appraisal to our previous Itauna post-salt discovery. 
Now going to the Gulf of Mexico, progress continues with Permian and drilling plans and we plan to participate in 6 wells through the end of the year. This includes appraisals of Heidelberg and Vito, 3 exploration wells: Coronado, Shea East and Kakuna and a development well at Nansen. 
Looking forward into 2012, we anticipate an active Gulf of Mexico program is well that plans to participate in 6 to 8 exploration and appraisal wells. We're also securing the necessary rigs to deliver upon this program as evidenced by the recently announced agreement on the ESCO 8505. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported a net loss of $6.12 per diluted share, including the expenses associated with the Macondo settlement. Absent this expense and certain items that are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been positive $0.66 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. 
Discretionary cash flow including a special $321 million tax benefit totaled almost $1.9 billion for the quarter, which is $576 million higher than our capital expenditures. For reference, last year's strength in the balance sheet and to secure ample liquidity positioned us well to reach the settlement agreement with BP. As we've stated in our post-settlement news release, we plan to initially fund the payment with a combination of cash on hand, which amounted to about $3.5 billion at quarter's end and by drawing down funds from our available $5 billion credit facility. 
We also expect to receive net proceeds in excess of $163 million from our insurance providers. We then plan to repay the borrowings under the credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from the possible monetization of our Brazilian subsidiary. 
Growing interest has been expressed in our Brazilian properties, and we have opened a data room. We will anticipate closing a potential sale in 2012, provided we receive pricing and terms that meet our objectives. 
As we approach the end of the calendar year, we feel very good about the company's strong operational record. As a result achieved to date, we are raising the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 500,000 barrels. The new range is 245 million to 248 million barrels of oil equivalent. The efficiencies we've driven into our programs, we expect to deliver these volumes for less capital than originally projected. 
We've reduced the midpoint of our full-year capital expectations by approximately $150 million. The new range excluding expenditures related to Western Gas Partners is $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. 
In summary, we've reduced the significant uncertainty for our stakeholders by putting the Macondo dispute with BP behind us. We're advancing several mega projects that are expected to come onstream in the next year or 2, and We're aggressively capturing value in what might be the largest development in our company's history with the Mozambique LNG project. We're in the midst of our most active ever offshore exploration and appraisal campaign that includes high potential prospects in West Africa, Mozambique, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. 
We're also continuing to ramp up sales volumes throughout our U.S. onshore liquids-rich resource base and have expanded our opportunities with a significant position in Ohio's Utica Shale.

So I think that as we understand better, the size of the opportunity there, we hope early next year to be in a little better position than we are today to describe exactly what that looks like once we get a few more appraisal wells drilled, as well as some testing done with some drill STIM test. That will give us as a much better idea than I can describe for you today, some of what the potential value might be. I'm sure you've seen the Bloomberg article or Reuters that quoted the Cove CEO saying that we've got 40 Bcf on the block related to what we and Cove and others are in. I don't want to comment on that. I think that's an aggressive comment that he made, I believe, at an African conference. But I think between ourselves and ENI, we certainly feel like there's an awful lot of gas there, and I think probably early next year, we'll have a better idea of how to give you some sense for how that works back. But if you think about just exactly what we're looking at, with today, we're seeing we've got an excess of 10 Tcf.

And what we've seen, as I mentioned earlier, is some greater-than-anticipated drawdown on several of the wells so we've been restricted so as not to damage the completions. As we've looked at this, the operator and the partnership has concluded that it's in the best interest of our development is to go and see if we can remediate some of these drawdowns. There's a lot of theories on what the actual cost of it is, but it's nonetheless restricting our completions. And the we go back to original pressures, it's not depletion, it's not anything to do with the reservoir performance. It's all associated with the completion practices. And so that can't be remediated and it's a matter of finding the right recipe to get it remediated, and that's what we after and that's what we're attempting to do. In addition, as has always been the plan, we're in the Phase 1A which is additional 8 wells to add additional producers and injectors to optimize the field development and make sure that we have full support for each and every producer with both water injection and gas injection. The plan is being executed just as it was anticipated. The initial rates are a little below our expectations but are still averaging almost 10,000 barrels a day per well.

Good morning, everyone. The positive operating results of the third quarter, in addition to recent news including the expanded recoverable resource base in Mozambique, continue to reinforce our confidence in the strength of the company's portfolio. We recently replaced the significant financial risks associated with the Macondo event behind us, allowing our stakeholders to focus upon the tremendous value embedded in Anadarko's assets, some of which we will discuss in today's call. 
We continue to achieve strong operating results during the quarter. Total sales volumes were at the high end of guidance of 61 million barrels of oil equivalent and included a 10% increase in liquid sales volumes over the third quarter of 2010. This increase in higher-margin liquids contributed to free cash flow of $576 million. 
The deepwater exploration and appraisal programs delivered a 75% success rate during the quarter, with significant discoveries in appraisals in Ghana and Mozambique. 
The U.S. onshore shale plays delivered extraordinary growth of more than 160% relative to where we were at this time last year. We're looking forward to further expand this opportunity set in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica Shale play in Ohio, where we recently began joint activity on our 300,000 gross acres. 
We continue in directing much of our near-term capital spending toward liquids-rich areas of our asset base. We achieved a 10% increase in liquid sales volumes relative to the third quarter of 2010. These results were highlighted by a 30% year-over-year increase in oil sales volumes from the U.S. onshore properties. 
We also benefited from excellent price realizations as approximately 70% of our crude volumes are based on Brent-equivalent indices. This generated a $10 per barrel premium to WTI on our oil volumes. With regard to NGLs, the price picture is similarly positive as we realize an increase from 50% of equivalent index crude to 62% of WTI oil pricing on our NGL volumes. 
The Rockies region contributed meaningfully to the company's third quarter growth and surpassed the production milestone of more than 300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is an 11% increase over last year's third quarter. This growth was highlighted by the Wattenberg field in Colorado, which delivered record sales volumes, including a 36% increase in liquids volumes over the third quarter of 2010, largely driven by the success of our expanded horizontal drilling program. 
In the quarter, we drilled 12 horizontal well targeting the Niobrara with excellent results. As one example to that well, we achieved a 24-hour daily flow rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil plus almost 2.5 million cubic feet of gas. Based on the positive results of this program and its projected growth, we've been aggressively expanding our midstream processing and gathering infrastructure throughout the basin. The horizontal Niobrara program holds tremendous potential and is primarily located in an acreage that is economically advantaged due to our ownership of the mineral rights throughout the land grant. In a couple of weeks, we plan to share a more detailed look at this program and the value proposition it offers for our investors. 
Moving to the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, we continue to set daily and monthly production records during the quarter. Net sales volumes in this period were 36% higher than the third quarter of 2010. Construction is advancing on schedule for a major plant expansion that will increase our cryogenic processing capacity in this area to about 500 million cubic feet per day, resulting in an incremental gross recovery of about 15,000 barrels per day of NGLs. 
In the Southern and Appalachian region, we continue to rapidly increase production to drive efficiencies in our drilling and completion cycle times. In the Eagleford Shale, we're running 10 rigs and production is growing by more than 120% over the third quarter of 2010. Our exit rate at the end of the third quarter was approximately 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of gross production, which is a 47% increase over the exit rate in the prior quarter. We remain focused on continuing to improve price realizations with enhanced access to Gulf coast markets for our liquids and expanded transportation options for produced natural gas. These efforts have bolstered our rates of return in the field, which already exceeded 100%. 
In Pennsylvania, we achieved sales volume growth year-over-year of approximately 300% from the Marcellus Shale. We continue to expand gathering and processing capacity, and our exit rate in the third quarter surpassed 600 million cubic feet per day of gross sales volumes, which is up more than 30% sequentially from the prior quarter. 
Our West Texas Permian oil price nearly tripled in liquids volumes relative to the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, Anadarko participated in 15 total Bone Spring and Avalon Shale wells as we continued to test our position in these emerging growth plays. 
Transitioning to our mega projects, our teams have continued to make good progress during the quarter. The Jubilee field offshore Ghana was a significant contributor to the company's 27% growth in international oil volumes over the prior year. All Phase 1 wells have been drilled, and current oil production from Jubilee is in excess of 85,000 barrels per day. The operator's resource estimate of Jubilee remains unchanged although some mechanical issues related to completion techniques will require a sidetrack of one of the producing wells and downhole remediation of certain other wells. Once these completion issues have been resolved, production is expected to ramp toward facility capacity. Additionally, 8 production and injection wells are expected to commence drilling in 2012 as part of the plan to Phase 1a program. 
In Algeria, a construction of the El Merk project is 83% complete and remains on target to begin production of significant oil volumes near the end of 2012. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to advance our Caesar/Tonga mega project. During the quarter, a riser solution was selected, and we expect to deliver first production by midyear 2012. 
During the quarter, we also announced a unitization agreement for our operated Lucius development in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction is underway in the truss spar production facility, which will have a capacity of more than 80,000 barrels of oil and 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. We remain on track to sanction Lucius prior to year end with production expected in 2014. Thus, we expect to continue our exploitation program near Lucius, and we anticipate the start of the Spartacus exploration prospect around the first of the year. 
In Mozambique, we continue to expand one of the company's largest ever hydrocarbon discoveries. We announced that our first appraisal well of the Windjammer Barquentine and Lagosta complex was successful, with the Barquentine-2 well encountered 230 feet of net natural gas pay. Also subsequent to quarter end, we also announced the Camarão well and discovered new zones and included a successful appraisal that confirmed connectivity with the Windjammer and Lagosta discoveries while spanning a distance of more than 15 miles. Based upon our 5 successful penetrations in the complex to date, the static pressure connectivity and the numerous cores that have been collected and analyzed, we have a high level of confidence that our acreage offshore Mozambique holds in excess of 10 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. And we fully expect our current recoverable resource base to increase as we continue a significant exploration and appraisal work ahead of us, including the evaluation of 2 newly acquired 3D seismic data sets and expanded prospect opportunities. To accelerate our program, which includes reservoir testing and up to 7 exploration and appraisal wells over the next 12 months, we're mobilizing the Deepwater Millennium to become our second drillship working in Mozambique. The enormous scale of this resource already validated by 5 penetrations covering an area spanning more than 115 square miles led us to increase our initial LNG development plans to include a minimum of 2 ""5 million ton per annum"" trains with a flexibility to expand even further. Once this initial infrastructure is constructed, it is expected to provide economies of scale that can generate significant cost savings for each incremental train. It's an exciting project for the government and people of Mozambique and our partnership. Our integrated project team is continuing to work with the government to certify reserves and reach a final investment decision in 2013. 
In West Africa, our exploration and appraisal programs also continue to deliver a differentiating success. In Ghana, our partnership announced a light oil discovery at the Akasa-1 prospect in the West Cape Three Points Block. We're also currently drilling the Teak-3 well in the same block and with continued success this area had the potential to anchor another development on the block. 
In the adjacent Deepwater Tano Block, a successful appraisal well of Enyenra-3A confirmed a continuous light oil column of almost 1,200 feet. It indicated static pressure communication with the old discovery well located 4 miles updip and the Enyenra-2A appraisal well to the south. 
Also on the block, the partnership successfully flow tested 2 wells in the Tweneboa field. Both tests confirmed expectations, and we are now moving towards sanctioning of the Tweneboa/Enyenra complex in 2012. 
Anadarko also spudded its first deepwater well in Liberian waters during the quarter as part of a 5-well program in the Liberian and Ivorian Basins. Once this well in Montserrado is complete, the company plans to mobilize the rig to Sierra Leone and drill the Jupiter exploration prospect, followed by an appraisal of our previous Mercury discovery. 
Another rig is also expected to arrive in Cote d'Ivoire during the fourth quarter to drill the Kosrou and Paon prospects. 
Turning to Brazil and the Campos Basin, we are drilling the Itaipu-2 pre-salt appraisal well now and expect results soon. We also recently spud the Itauna-2 well, which is an appraisal to our previous Itauna post-salt discovery. 
Now going to the Gulf of Mexico, progress continues with Permian and drilling plans and we plan to participate in 6 wells through the end of the year. These include appraisals of Heidelberg and Vito; 3 exploration wells, Coronado, Cheyenne East and Kakuna; and a development  well at Nansen. 
Looking forward to 2012, we anticipate an active Gulf of Mexico program as well that plans to participate in 6 to 8 exploration and appraisal wells. We're also securing the necessary rigs to deliver upon this program as evidenced by the recently announced agreement on the ENSCO 8505. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported a net loss of $6.12 per diluted share, including the expenses associated with the Macondo settlement. Absent this expense, and certain items that are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been a positive $0.66 per diluted share. It's reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. 
Discretionary cash flow, including a special $321 million tax benefit totaled almost $1.9 billion for the quarter, which is $576 million higher than our capital expenditures. For reference, last year's strength in the balance sheet and to secure ample liquidity positioned us well to reach the settlement agreement with BP. As we've stated in our post-settlement news release, we plan to initially fund the payment with a combination of cash on hand, which amounted to about $3.5 billion at quarter's end and by drawing down funds from our available $5 billion credit facility. 
We also expect to receive net proceeds in excess of $163 million from our insurance providers. We then plan to repay the borrowings under the credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from a possible monetization of our Brazilian subsidiary. 
Growing interest has been expressed in our Brazilian properties, and we have opened a data room. We would anticipate closing a potential sale in 2012, provided we receive pricing in terms that meet our objectives. 
As we approach the end of the calendar year, we feel very good about the company's strong operational record. As a result, achieved to date, we are raising the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 500,000 barrels. The new range is 245 to 248 million barrels of oil equivalent. With the efficiencies we've driven into our programs, we expect to deliver these volumes for less capital than originally projected. We've reduced the midpoint of our full year capital expectations by approximately $150 million. The new range, excluding expenditures related to Western Gas Partners, is $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. 
In summary, we've reduced the significant uncertainty for our stakeholders by putting the Macondo dispute with BP behind us. We're advancing several mega projects that are expected to become onstream in the next year or 2, and we're aggressively capturing value in what might be the largest development in our company's history with the Mozambique LNG project. We're in the midst of our most active ever offshore exploration and appraisal campaign that includes high potential prospects in West Africa, Mozambique, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. We're also continuing to ramp up sales volumes throughout our U.S. onshore liquids-rich resource base and have expanded our opportunities with a significant position in Ohio's Utica Shale.

I'm not sure if that's an easy question by any means for anyone to answer and probably one that's going to be somewhat subject to some of the commercial terms that we're going to enter into between here and FID. I think we're pretty optimistic that we'll get the production tied to a very strong oil correlation, most LNG projects moving into particularly the Asian market at somewhere between 80% and 90% of the benchmark crude for the gas price. So I think as we understand better the size of the opportunity there, we hope early next year to be in a little better position than we are today to describe exactly what that looks like once we get a few more appraisal wells drilled, as well as some testing done with some drill stem test. That will give us a much better idea than I can describe for you today, some of what the potential value might be. I'm sure you've seen the Bloomberg article or Reuters that quoted the Cove CEO saying that we've got 40 Tcf on the block related to what we and Cove and others are in. I don't want to comment on that. I think that's an aggressive comment that he made, I believe, at an African conference. But I think between ourselves and Eni, we certainly feel like there's an awful lot of gas there. And I think probably early next year, we'll have a better idea of how to give you some sense for how that works back. But if you think about just exactly what we're looking at, with today, we're seeing we've got in excess of 10 Tcf. We have about a 35% working interest being kind of net debt back a little bit and convert that to an oil and a price per barrel, and I'll let you do the arithmetic to the price per share."

There's a lot of theories on what the actual cost of it is, but nonetheless, it's restricting our completions. And when shutting the wells, they go back to original pressures. So it's not depletion. It's not anything to do with the reservoir performance. It's all associated with the completion practices. And so that can't be remediated and it's a matter of finding the right recipe to get it remediated. And that's what we're after and that's what we're attempting to do. In addition, as has always been the plan, we're in the Phase 1a, which is additional 8 wells to add additional producers and injectors to optimize the field development and make sure that we have full support for each and every producer with both water injection and gas injection.

Good morning, everyone. The positive operating results of the third quarter, in addition to recent news including the expanded recoverable resource base in Mozambique, continue to reinforce our confidence in the strength of the company's portfolio. We recently replaced the significant financial risks associated with the Macondo event behind us, allowing our stakeholders to focus upon the tremendous value embedded in Anadarko's assets, some of which we will discuss in today's call. 
We continued to achieve strong operating results during the quarter. Total sales volumes were at the high end of guidance of 61 million barrels of oil equivalent and included a 10% increase in liquid sales volumes over the third quarter of 2010. This increase in higher-margin liquids contributed to free cash flow of $576 million. 
Our deepwater exploration and appraisal programs delivered a 75% success rate during the quarter, with significant discoveries in appraisals in Ghana and Mozambique. Our U.S. onshore shale plays delivered extraordinary growth of more than 160% relative to where we were at this time last year. And We're looking forward to further expand this opportunity set in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica Shale play in Ohio, where we recently began joint activity on our 300,000 gross acres. 
We continue to direct much of our near-term capital spending toward liquids-rich areas of our asset base. We achieved a 10% increase in liquid sales volumes relative to the third quarter of 2010. These results were highlighted by a 30% year-over-year increase in oil sales volumes from the U.S. onshore properties. 
We also benefited from excellent price realizations as approximately 70% of our crude volumes are based on Brent-equivalent indices. This generated a $10 per barrel premium to WTI on our oil volumes. With regard to NGLs, the price picture is similarly positive as we realize an increase from 50% of equivalent-index crude to 62% of WTI oil pricing on our NGL volumes. 
The Rockies region contributed meaningfully to the company's third quarter growth and surpassed the production milestone of more than 300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is an 11% increase over last year's third quarter. This growth was highlighted by the Wattenberg field in Colorado, which delivered record sales volumes, including a 36% increase in liquids volumes over the third quarter of 2010, largely driven by the success of our expanded horizontal drilling program. 
During the quarter, we drilled 12 horizontal wells targeting the Niobrara/Codell with excellent results. As one example, the Dolph well achieved a 24-hour daily flow rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil plus almost 2.5 million cubic feet of gas. Based on the positive results of this program and its projected growth, we've been aggressively expanding our midstream processing and gathering infrastructure throughout the basin. The horizontal Niobrara program holds tremendous potential and is primarily located in an acreage that is economically advantaged due to our ownership of the mineral rights throughout the land grant. In a couple of weeks, we plan to share a more detailed look at this program and the value proposition it offers for our investors. 
Moving to the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, we continued to set daily and monthly production records during the quarter. Net sales volumes in this period were 36% higher than the third quarter of 2010. Construction is advancing on schedule for a major plant expansion that will increase our cryogenic processing capacity in this area to about 500 million cubic feet per day, resulting in an incremental gross recovery of about 15,000 barrels per day of NGLs. 
In the Southern and Appalachian region, we continued to rapidly increase production to drive efficiencies in our drilling and completion cycle times. In the Eagleford Shale, we're running 10 rigs and production has grown by more than 120% over the third quarter of 2010. Our exit rate at the end of the third quarter was approximately 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of gross production, which is a 47% increase over the exit rate in the prior quarter. We remain focused on continuing to improve price realizations with enhanced access to Gulf coast markets for our liquids and expanded transportation options for produced natural gas. These efforts have bolstered our rates of return in the field, which already exceeded 100%. 
In Pennsylvania, we achieved sales volume growth year-over-year of approximately 300% from the Marcellus Shale. We continued to expand gathering and processing capacity, and our exit rate in the third quarter surpassed 600 million cubic feet per day of gross sales volumes, which is up more than 30% sequentially from the prior quarter. 
Our West Texas Permian oil price nearly tripled in liquids volumes relative to the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, Anadarko participated in 15 total Bone Spring and Avalon Shale wells as we continued to test our position in these emerging growth plays. 
Transitioning to our mega projects, our teams have continued to make good progress during the quarter. The Jubilee Field offshore Ghana was a significant contributor to the company's 27% growth in international oil volumes over the prior year. All Phase 1 wells have been drilled, and current oil production from Jubilee is in excess of 85,000 barrels per day. The operator's resource estimate of Jubilee remains unchanged, although some mechanical issues related to completion techniques will require a sidetrack of one of the producing wells and downhole remediation in certain other wells. Once these completion issues have been resolved, production is expected to ramp toward facility capacity. Additionally, 8 production and injection wells are expected to commence drilling in 2012 as part of the planned Phase 1a program. 
In Algeria, a construction of the El Merk project is 83% complete and remains on target to begin production of significant oil volumes near the end of 2012. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to advance the Caesar/Tonga mega project. During the quarter, a riser solution was selected, and we expect to deliver first production by midyear 2012. 
During the quarter, we also announced a unitization agreement for our operated Lucius development in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction is underway in the truss spar production facility, which will have a capacity of more than 80,000 barrels of oil and 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. We remain on track to sanction Lucius prior to year end with production expected in 2014. Plus, we expect to continue our exploitation program near Lucius with the anticipated spud of the Spartacus exploration prospect around the first of the year. 
In Mozambique, we continued to expand one of the company's largest ever hydrocarbon discoveries. We announced that our first appraisal well of the Windjammer Barquentine and Lagosta complex was successful, as the Barquentine-2 well encountered 230 feet of net natural gas pay. Subsequent to quarter end, we also announced the Camarão well that discovered new zones and included a successful appraisal that confirmed connectivity with the Windjammer and Lagosta discoveries while spanning a distance of more than 15 miles.
Based upon our 5 successful penetrations in the complex to date, the static pressure connectivity and the numerous cores that have been collected and analyzed, we have a high level of confidence that our acreage offshore Mozambique holds in excess of 10 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. And we fully expect our current recoverable resource base to increase as we continue the significant exploration and appraisal work ahead of us, including the evaluation of 2 newly acquired 3D seismic data sets and expanded prospect opportunities.
To accelerate our program, which includes reservoir testing and up to 7 exploration and appraisal wells over the next 12 months, we're mobilizing the Deepwater Millennium to become our second drillship working in Mozambique. The enormous scale of this resource, already validated by 5 penetrations covering an area spanning more than 115 square miles, led us to increase our initial LNG development plans to include a minimum of 2 ""5 million tonne per annum"" trains with the flexibility to expand even further. Once this initial infrastructure is constructed, it is expected to provide economies of scale that can generate significant cost savings for each incremental train. It's an exciting project for the government and people of Mozambique and our partnership. Our integrated project team is continuing to work with the government to certify reserves and reach a final investment decision in 2013. 
In West Africa, our exploration and appraisal programs also continue to deliver differentiating success. In Ghana, our partnership announced a light oil discovery at the Akasa-1 prospect in the West Cape Three Points Block. We're also currently drilling the Teak-3 well in the same block and with continued success, this area has the potential to anchor another development on the block. 
In the adjacent Deepwater Tano Block, a successful appraisal well of Enyenra-3A confirmed a continuous light oil column of almost 1,200 feet. It indicated static pressure communication with the old discovery well located 4 miles updip and the Enyenra-2A appraisal well to the south. Also on the block, the partnership successfully flow tested 2 wells in the Tweneboa field. Both tests confirmed expectations, and we are now moving towards sanctioning of the Tweneboa/Enyenra complex in 2012. 
Anadarko also spudded its first deepwater well in Liberian waters during the quarter as part of a 5-well program in the Liberian and Ivorian Basins. Once this well, Montserrado, is complete, the company plans to mobilize the rig to Sierra Leone and drill the Jupiter exploration prospect, followed by an appraisal of our previous Mercury discovery. 
Another rig is also expected to arrive in Cote d'Ivoire during the fourth quarter to drill the Kosrou and Paon prospects. 
Turning to Brazil and the Campos Basin, we are drilling the Itaipu-2 pre-salt appraisal well now and expect results soon. We also recently spud the Itauna-2 well, which is an appraisal to our previous Itauna post-salt discovery. 
Now going to the Gulf of Mexico, progress continues with permitting and drilling plans, and we plan to participate in 6 wells through the end of the year. These include appraisals of Heidelberg and Vito; 3 exploration wells, Coronado, Cheyenne East and Kakuna; and a development well at Nansen. 
Looking forward to 2012, we anticipate an active Gulf of Mexico program as well with plans to participate in 6 to 8 exploration and appraisal wells. We're also securing the necessary rigs to deliver upon this program as evidenced by the recently announced agreement on the ENSCO 8505. 
Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported a net loss of $6.12 per diluted share, including the expenses associated with the Macondo settlement. Absent this expense and certain items that are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been a positive $0.66 per diluted share. It's reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. 
Discretionary cash flow, including a special $321 million tax benefit, totaled almost $1.9 billion for the quarter, which is $576 million higher than our capital expenditures. Our efforts last year to strengthen the balance sheet and to secure ample liquidity positioned us well to reach the settlement agreement with BP. As we've stated in our post-settlement news release, we plan to initially fund the payment with a combination of cash on hand, which amounted to about $3.5 billion at quarter's end, and by drawing down funds from our available $5 billion credit facility. 
We also expect to receive net proceeds in excess of $163 million from our insurance providers. We then plan to repay the borrowings under the credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from a possible monetization of our Brazilian subsidiary. 
Growing interest has been expressed in our Brazilian properties, and we have opened a data room. We would anticipate closing a potential sale in 2012, provided we receive pricing in terms that meet our objectives. 
As we approach the end of the calendar year, we feel very good about the company's strong operational record. With the results achieved to date, we are raising the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 500,000 barrels. The new range is 245 to 248 million barrels of oil equivalent. With the efficiencies we've driven into our programs, we expect to deliver these volumes for less capital than originally projected. We've reduced the midpoint of our full year capital expectations by approximately $150 million. The new range, excluding expenditures related to Western Gas Partners, is $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. 
In summary, we've reduced the significant uncertainty for our stakeholders by putting the Macondo dispute with BP behind us. We're advancing several mega projects that are expected to come onstream in the next year or 2, and we're aggressively capturing value in what might be the largest development in our company's history with the Mozambique LNG project. We're in the midst of our most active ever offshore exploration and appraisal campaign that includes high potential prospects in West Africa, Mozambique, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. We're also continuing to ramp up sales volumes throughout our U.S. onshore liquids-rich resource base and have expanded our opportunities with a significant position in Ohio's Utica Shale.

It gives us a lot more confidence on all of the resources out there and our seismic interpretations. Every well that we've drilled out there, we've had very good seismic indications of sand and gas, and we've had 100% success with that model. And that means that not only the Lagosta-Barquentine-Windjammer complex, where we're actively appraising, but also in the future exploration work to the north, where we shot the new 3D.

So I think as we understand better the size of the opportunity there, we hope early next year to be in a little better position than we are today to describe exactly what that looks like once we get a few more appraisal wells drilled, as well as some testing done with some drillstem tests. That will give us a much better idea than I can describe for you today, some of what the potential value might be. I'm sure you've seen the Bloomberg article or Reuters that quoted the Cove CEO saying that we've got 40 Tcf on the block related to what we and Cove and others are in. I don't want to comment on that. I think that's an aggressive comment that he made, I believe, at an African conference. But I think between ourselves and Eni, we certainly feel like there's an awful lot of gas there. And I think probably early next year, we'll have a better idea of how to give you some sense for how that works back. But if you think about just exactly what we're looking at, today we're seeing we've got in excess of 10 Tcf. We have about a 35% working interest.

And what we've seen, as I mentioned earlier, is some greater-than-anticipated drawdown on several of the wells. So they've been rate restricted so as not to damage the completions. As we've looked at this, the operator and the partnership has concluded that it's in the best interest of our development, is to go and see if we can remediate some of this drawdown. There's a lot of theories on what the actual cause of it is, but nonetheless, it's restricting our completions. And when shutting the wells, they go back to original pressures, so it's not depletion. It's not anything to do with the reservoir performance. It's all associated with the completion practices. And so that can be remediated and it's a matter of finding the right recipe to get it remediated. And that's what we're after and that's what we're attempting to do. In addition, as has always been the plan, we're into Phase 1a, which is additional 8 wells, to add additional producers and injectors to optimize the field development and make sure that we have full support for each and every producer with both water injection and gas injection. The plan is being executed just as it was anticipated. The initial rates are a little below our expectations but they're still averaging almost 10,000 barrels a day per well. So we have some extremely good wells, and we're just going through the growing pains of the first development in the new basin."
