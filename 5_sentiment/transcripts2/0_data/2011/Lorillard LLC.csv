I am pleased to report to you that our fourth quarter finished strong.

I am pleased to report to you that our fourth quarter finished strong. Based on a consistently strong performance all year long, Lorillard finished the year with record high levels of net sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and market share. The company earned over $1 billion in net income for the first time in its 250-year history. Needless to say, my comments regarding the strength of our brands, people and business model during our last conference call remain intact, and provide the basis for the strategic planning process we are engaged in.  I will touch on the status of that process in just a few minutes, but first, let me give you a few highlights from the quarter and the year.
Lorillard continued to bout industry trends growing domestic wholesale shipments plus 4.6% in the fourth quarter in the backdrop of industry domestic wholesale shipments, which declined 4.7%. That's over a nine percentage point out-performance against the industry. Within that plus 4.6% increase, our flagship brand, Newport, grew 2.2%, benefiting from the launch of Newport Non-Menthol, partially offset by a fourth quarter 2010 versus 2009 comparative reduction in inventory position.
Newport Non-Menthol is gaining trial in the marketplace, and volume continues to grow week to week. It's too early to assess this long-term potential, but we are encouraged with what we've seen so far. 
As you would expect, when our volume trend exceeds that of the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard market share in the fourth quarter increased 120 basis points to 13.2%. About half of a share point of that was associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch.
Total volume growth, along with higher prices and lower promotion spending, translated to a 7.8% increase in net sales versus a year ago. Coupled with an increase in gross margin, and the accretive impact of the companies share repurchase program, diluted earnings per share increased 14.5% versus a year ago to $1.74 for the quarter. 
For the year, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased 5.3% versus a year ago, while the industry declined 3.8%. Net sales increased to a record $5.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 17.7% to a record high $6.78 and our market share increased 1.1 share points to a record high 12.9%. 
Our key financial officer, David Keller, will provide more details on these numbers in just a few minutes. But first, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to underscore the strength of these numbers by putting them into the context of our strategic planning process and also make a few comments regarding TPSAC.
In regards to the strategic plans, we are well into the process. It is my goal to complete it shortly, communicated internally and then share it externally, that will take place over the next few months. While we are not ready to share the full plan right now, let me give you a couple of thoughts. 
First, our analysis clearly shows that our core business has running room. The two leading cigarette companies in the U.S. saw declines in sticks sold of approximately $45 billion and $30 billion respectively during the last five years. While our volumes over the same period time increased over $2.6 billion We believe the fundamentals remain in place for our strong brands, led by Newport to continue to out pace the industry. So as I said in our last conference call, Lorillard is not in need of a course correction.
Second, we do see and we announced the support that there is an opportunity for organic portfolio expansion at geographic expansion beyond our core markets for further upside, albeit these must be pursued carefully and with discipline.
Third, there is a need for some capability improvements to navigate through the rapidly changing external environment and to be able to pursue those adjacencies. Examples of this would be strengthening in the areas of regulatory affairs and new product development. 
And finally, fourth, we will continue to be a strong cash flow generator and clearly understand the need for our investors to share in that strong cash flow. In the roughly two and a half years since our staff really returned over $3.5 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to the potential for the increased regulation of menthol cigarettes, our position hasn't changed since we spoke last. Congress mandated that the FDA evaluated the impact of menthol in cigarettes on the public health. Lorillard continues to believe that the best available scientific evidence does not support an absorption that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impact the public's health.  Second, we acknowledge smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risk.  Third, a move like banning menthol would dramatically expand the cigarette black market, making it easier for underage kids to gain access. Such a black market would likely increase crime, cost jobs and reduce tax and MSA revenue. These counter-veiling effects are also mandated to be take into account by the FDA.  In summary, a menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totally or for any demographic group.
As it relates to TPSAC, we remain concerned that this committee is being more driven by politics than by science, and therefore don't rule anything out for their March 23 non-binding recommendation. To help understand what Lorillard believes are the realities versus some of the miss surrounding the menthol debate, a new presentation has been added this morning to the ""Understanding Menthol"" website. This website, sponsored by Lorillard, is designed to educate interested parties on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes.
We do believe that when the issue is evaluated by the FDA itself, hard science will prevail and as a result, menthol will not ultimately be banned. It's just difficult to assess the duration of the evaluation, but it's likely to take years. So while we continue to be actively involved in the menthol review process, rest assured, we will not take our eye off of responsibly building our business for both today and the future.  We remain committed to consistently delivering a double-digit total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth and the dividend yield over the long-term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"
4180255,118540471,99902,"Lorillard, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2011",2011-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Murray. And good morning, everyone. After I briefly go to the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Lorillard's 2010 fourth quarter results were very strong, capping an outstanding 2010. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 201",861,"Thank you, Murray. And good morning, everyone. After I briefly go to the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Lorillard's 2010 fourth quarter results were very strong, capping an outstanding 2010. 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 7.8% to $1.486 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. It was driven by a 4.5% increase in total shipment volume, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs which are accounted for as a reduction in sales. 
The increase in unit shipped when compared to last year's fourth quarter in light of the industry's decline reflects the underlying strength of our brands, which continued to gain share. Unit volumes for Newport were up 2.2%, and Maverick were up 25.2%. The stability of Newport Menthol and the growth of Maverick have been common themes, and you've heard them before, and this year's fourth quarter also reflect the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol on November 1.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend. In fact, as we look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in or database, which is a better indicator of consumer take away, Newport Menthol's volume was flat to slightly up for the quarter. 
We have the increase in wholesale prices uncertain of or cigarette  brands, including Newport on November 30, which amounted to approximately 1.5% on our brand portfolio. As a typical for quarters where it anticipates price increase, such as the fourth quarters of both this year and last year, changes in wholesale inventory patterns skewed the volume comparisons a bit for the quarter. 
Wholesale inventories increased modestly during the fourth quarter of last year, making the year-over-year comparison a little tougher. We estimate that in inventory dynamic dragged the unit volume comparison by about 1.5 percentage points. So adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, we estimate total Lorillard volume to be up about 6%. Needless to say, this makes the quarter's performance much more fresh.
This outstanding volume performance for the quarter brings the annual numbers for 2010 for record levels. Total domestic unit volume for the year grew by 5.3% from 2009, in the face of an industry decline of about 3.8%. The increase in volume in the fourth quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drives the increase in net sales before excise taxes of 9% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the year.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased by $57 million to $538 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA fees. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the Tobacco Growers Assessment increased to $24 million compared to last year quarter. 
Selling, general administered of costs increased $22 million from last year's fourth quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter. But also some higher compensation expenses this year due to the CEO transition and incentive compensation accrual.
Fourth quarter operating income increased 8.8% to $433 million or 29.1% of sales from $398 million or 28.9% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year increased about 6.6% compared with 2009.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 14.5% from last year's fourth quarter to $1.74 per share. It increased 17.7% for the year to $6.78. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS for the fourth quarter about $0.11 a share.
So 2010 was an outstanding year for Lorillard, and it's finished on a strong note: Outperforming the rest of the industry, and frankly most reasonable expectations on almost every measure. We saw unit volume increase in the face of industry-wide increase market share increases to record levels and net sales increased to record levels. We saw gross margins increase, operating margin increase and operating income per unit increase. We saw net income exceed $1 billion for the first time, and we saw a double-digit increase in EPS.  Obviously, a great way to end 2010. 
Also, during 2010, we substantially increased our dividend and continued to repurchase shares in the market. Through December 31, we had repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a cost of $376 million under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization as we announced last fall. I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, and I will not be able to comment about the level or our timing of future dividend declarations by the board or capital structure activity such as further debt issuances and the like. I will tell you that we have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1.5x EBITDA, nor have we change our long-term target of paying dividend approximating 70% to 75%. 
Once again, we are very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for the year.  And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions."

But process wide again, be clear the FDA never has to come back if they don't want to. The FDA, the only requirement I progress was that within the year or by March 23, that a non-binding advisory committee have to submit a recommendation. We will see down the line where FDA prioritizes, and when they get to it and if they get to it. Having said that, there is a lot more to the Newport brand, a lot more to the Newport brand than menthol. Our product are preferred in taste testing and as I dig into it and dug on to the strategic plan as the core of that everything from tobacco plants to the designing of the cigarettes to huge brand equity. And in that respect to the extent that cigarette smokers or menthol cigarette smokers choose to continue smoking, Newport smokers most likely, are going to want to stay with that brand and will be able to formulate a new product, better in my opinion than anybody else might be able to do so to retain those. So if someone's going to continue smoking, that is a Newport smoker, I believe we will obtain the bulk of those. The second part of it is will a percentage quit and people, their behavior versus what they say today they're going to do tends to differ and history says that very few quit in this type of situation. So that's probably less of a factor. And then the final issue, which is concerning is that whenever we get to a draconian move would be the a black market and all the debit taking about affect that would come out of because remember Congress passes bill in order to create regulation and ordering control not to create chaos."

I am pleased to report to you that our fourth quarter finished strong.

I am pleased to report to you that our fourth quarter finished strong. Based on a consistently strong performance all year long, Lorillard finished the year with record high levels of net sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and market share. The company earned over $1 billion in net income for the first time in its 250-year history. Needless to say, my comments regarding the strength of our brands, people and business model during our last conference call remain intact and provide the basis for the strategic planning process we are engaged in. I will touch on the status of that process in just a few minutes, but first, let me give you a few highlights from the quarter and the year.
Lorillard continued to buck industry trends growing domestic wholesale shipments plus-4.6% in the fourth quarter in the backdrop of industry domestic wholesale shipments, which declined 4.7%. That's over a nine percentage point outperformance against the industry. Within that plus-4.6% increase, our flagship brand, Newport, grew 2.2%, benefiting from the launch of Newport Non-Menthol, partially offset by a fourth quarter 2010 versus 2009 comparative reduction in inventory position.
Newport Non-Menthol is gaining trial in the marketplace, and volume continues to grow week to week. It's too early to assess its long-term potential, but we are encouraged with what we see so far. 
As you would expect, when our volume trend exceeds that of the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard market share in the fourth quarter increased 120 basis points to 13.2%. About half of a share point of that was associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch.
Total volume growth, along with higher prices and lower promotion spending, translated to a 7.8% increase in net sales versus year ago. Coupled with an increase in gross margin and the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase program, diluted earnings per share increased 14.5% versus year ago to $1.74 for the quarter. 
For the year, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased 5.3% versus year ago, while the industry declined 3.8%. Net sales increased to a record $5.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 17.7% to a record high $6.78, and our market share increased 1.1 share points to a record high 12.9%. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, David Keller, will provide more details on these numbers in just a few minutes. But first, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to underscore the strength of these numbers by putting them into the context of our strategic planning process and also make a few comments regarding TPSAC.
In regards to the strategic plans, we are well into the process. It is my goal to complete it shortly, communicate it internally and then share it externally. That'll take place over the next few months. While we are not ready to share the full plan right now, let me give you a couple of thoughts. 
First, our analysis clearly shows that our core business has running room. The two leading cigarette companies in the U.S. saw declines in sticks sold of approximately 45 billion and 30 billion respectively during the last five years, while our volumes over the same period of time increased over 2.6 billion. We believe the fundamentals remain in place for our strong brands, led by Newport, to continue to outpace the industry. So as I said on our last conference call, Lorillard is not in need of a course correction.
Second, we do see and we announced the support that there is an opportunity for organic portfolio expansion and geographic expansion beyond our core markets for further upside, albeit these must be pursued carefully and with discipline.
Third, there is a need for some capability improvements to navigate through the rapidly changing external environment and to be able to pursue those adjacencies. Examples of this would be strengthening in the areas of regulatory affairs and new product development. 
And finally, fourth, we will continue to be a strong cash flow generator and clearly understand the need for our investors to share in that strong cash flow. In the roughly two and a half years since our step up, we've already returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to the potential for an increased regulation of menthol cigarettes. Our position hasn't changed since we spoke last. Congress mandated that the FDA evaluate the impact of menthol in cigarettes on the public's health. Lorillard continues to believe that the best available scientific evidence does not support an assertion that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impacts the public's health. 
Second, we acknowledge smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risks.  Third, a draconian move like banning menthol would dramatically expand the cigarette black market, making it easier for underage kids to gain access. Such a black market would likely increase crime, cost jobs and reduce tax and MSA revenue. These countervailing effects are also mandated to be take into account by the FDA. In summary, a menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totality or for any demographic group.
As it relates to TPSAC, we remain concerned that this committee is being more driven by politics than by science and therefore, don't rule anything out for their March 23 non-binding recommendation. To help understand what Lorillard believes are the realities versus some of the mists surrounding the menthol debate, a new presentation has been added this morning to the ""Understanding Menthol"" website. This website, sponsored by Lorillard, is designed to educate interested parties on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes.
We do believe that when the issue is evaluated by the FDA itself, hard science will prevail, and as a result, menthol will not ultimately be banned. It's just difficult to assess the duration of the evaluation, but it's likely to take years. So while we continue to be actively involved in the menthol review process, rest assured, we will not take our eye off of responsibly building our business for both today and the future. We remain committed to consistently delivering a double-digit total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth and the dividend yield over the long-term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"
4180255,118540471,99992,"Lorillard, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2011",2011-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Lorillard's 2010 fourth quarter results were very strong, capping an outstanding 2010. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2",868,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Lorillard's 2010 fourth quarter results were very strong, capping an outstanding 2010. 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 7.8% to $1.486 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. It was driven by a 4.5% increase in total shipment volume, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs, which are accounted for as a reduction in sales. 
The increase in unit shipped when compared to last year's fourth quarter in light of the industry's decline reflects the underlying strength of our brands, which continue to gain share. Unit volumes for Newport were up 2.2%, and Maverick volumes were up 25.2%. The stability of Newport Menthol and the growth of Maverick have been common themes, and you've heard them before. And this year's fourth quarter also reflect the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol on November 1.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend. In fact, as I look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in our database, which is a better indicator of consumer take away, Newport Menthol's volume was flat to slightly up for the quarter. 
We announced an increase in wholesale list prices on certain of our cigarette  brands, including Newport, on November 30, which amounted to approximately 1.5% on our brand portfolio. As is typical for quarters in which the trade anticipates price increase, such as the fourth quarters of both this year and last year, changes in wholesale inventory patterns skewed the volume comparisons a bit for the quarter. 
Total wholesale inventories increased modestly during the fourth quarter of last year, making the year-over-year comparison a little tougher. We estimate that this inventory dynamic dragged the unit volume comparison by about 1.5 percentage points. So adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, we estimate total Lorillard volume to be up about 6%. Needless to say, this makes the quarter's performance that much more impressive.
This outstanding volume performance for the quarter brings the annual numbers for 2010 to record levels. Total domestic unit volume for the year grew by 5.3% from 2009, in the face of an industry decline of about 3.8%. The increase in volume in the fourth quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drives the increase in net sales before excise taxes of 9% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the year.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased by $57 million to $538 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the Tobacco Growers Assessment increased $24 million compared to last year's quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $22 million from last year's fourth quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter but also some higher compensation expenses this year due to the CEO transition and incentive compensation accrual.
Fourth quarter operating income increased 8.8% to $433 million or 29.1% of sales from $398 million or 28.9% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year increased about 6.6% compared with 2009.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 14.5% from last year's fourth quarter to $1.74 per share. It increased 17.7% for the year to $6.78. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS for the fourth quarter about $0.11 a share.
So 2010 was an outstanding year for Lorillard, and it's finished on a strong note, outperforming the rest of the industry and frankly most reasonable expectations on almost every measure. We saw unit volumes increase in the face of industry-wide decrease. Market share increases to record levels and net sales increased to record level. we saw gross margins increase. Operating margins increase and operating income per unit increase. We saw net income exceed $1 billion for the first time, and we saw a double-digit increase in EPS.  Obviously, a great way to end 2010. 
Also, during 2010, we substantially increased our dividend and continued to repurchase shares in the market. Through December 31, we had repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a cost of $376 million under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization that we announced last fall. I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, and I will not be able to comment about the level or our timing of future dividend declarations by the board or capital structure activity such as further debt issuances and the like. I will tell you that we have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1.5x EBITDA, nor have we changed our long-term target of paying dividend approximating 70% to 75% of earnings. 
Once again, we're very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for the year.  And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions."

But process-wide again, be clear the FDA never has to come back if they don't want to. The FDA, the only requirement by progress was that if within a year or by March 23, that a non-binding advisory committee have to submit a recommendation. We will see down the line where FDA prioritizes and when they get to it and if they get to it. Having said that, there is a lot more to the Newport brand, a lot more to the Newport brand than menthol flavoring. Our products are preferred in taste testing and as I dig into it and I've dug into on the strategic plan, at the core of that is everything from tobacco plants to the design of the cigarette to huge brand equity. And in that respect, to the extent that cigarette smokers or menthol cigarette smokers choose to continue with smoking, Newport smokers most likely, are going to want to stay with that brand and will be able to formulate a product, better in my opinion than anybody else might be able to do so to retain them. 
So if someone's going to continue smoking, that is a Newport smoker, I believe we will retain the bulk of them. The second part of it is, will a percentage quit and people, their behavior versus what they say they're going to do tends to differ and history says that very few quit in this type of situation. So that's probably less of a factor. And then the final issue, which is concerning, is that whenever we get to a draconian move would be the black market and all the devastating effects that could come out. Because remember Congress passes bill in order to create regulation and ordering control not to create chaos."

I went down and I met with Director Deyton at the Center for Tobacco Products in Washington. I met with him and his whole staff and had a very lengthy discussion about the process and sort of my background and involvement. And they made it very clear that they intended to follow a scientific process and that they also made it very clear that TPSAC's recommendation was a non-binding recommendation. We also had a stakeholder meeting, an industry stakeholder meeting in Raleigh, more recently, and in that meeting, Director Deyton stood in front of the room and some of the smaller manufacturers started to get more vocal. And he stood in front of that room and said, you have never heard the word ""banned"" come out of the FDA. And he sort of silenced the room. To point to the one example where you heard the word banned come from the FDA, I thought that was kind of poignant. And then as our continuing dialogues come along, I'll end the third quote, which was when he kicked off all the TPSAC committee meetings, he looked TPSAC in the eye and he said you have a very important job to do. And we're going to be looking at your recommendation, and I expect it to be a science-based recommendation and remember that the FDA will only consider science-based recommendations as part of this process."

I am pleased to report to you that our fourth quarter finished strong.

I am pleased to report to you that our fourth quarter finished strong. Based on a consistently strong performance all year long, Lorillard finished the year with record high levels of net sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and market share. The company earned over $1 billion in net income for the first time in its 250-year history. Needless to say, my comments regarding the strength of our brands, people and business model during our last conference call remain intact and provide the basis for the strategic planning process we are engaged in. I will touch on the status of that process in just a few minutes, but first, let me give you a few highlights from the quarter and the year.
Lorillard continued to buck industry trends growing domestic wholesale shipments plus-4.6% in the fourth quarter in the backdrop of industry domestic wholesale shipments, which declined 4.7%. That's over a nine percentage point outperformance against the industry. Within that plus-4.6% increase, our flagship brand, Newport, grew 2.2%, benefiting from the launch of Newport Non-Menthol, partially offset by a fourth quarter 2010 versus 2009 comparative reduction in inventory position.
Newport Non-Menthol is gaining trial in the marketplace, and volume continues to grow week to week. It's too early to assess its long-term potential, but we are encouraged with what we see so far. 
As you would expect, when our volume trend exceeds that of the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard market share in the fourth quarter increased 120 basis points to 13.2%. About half of a share point of that was associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch.
Total volume growth, along with higher prices and lower promotion spending, translated to a 7.8% increase in net sales versus year ago. Coupled with an increase in gross margin and the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase program, diluted earnings per share increased 14½% versus year ago to $1.74 for the quarter. 
For the year, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased 5.3% versus year ago, while the industry declined 3.8%. Net sales increased to a record $5.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 17.7% to a record high $6.78, and our market share increased 1.1 share point to a record high 12.9%. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, David Taylor, will provide more details on these numbers in just a few minutes. But first, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to underscore the strength of these numbers by putting them into the context of our strategic planning process and also make a few comments regarding TPSAC.
In regards to the strategic plan, we are well into the process. It is my goal to complete it shortly, communicate it internally and then share it externally. That'll take place over the next few months. While we are not ready to share the full plan right now, let me give you a couple of thoughts. 
First, our analysis clearly shows that our core business has running room. The two leading cigarette companies in the U.S. saw declines in sticks sold of approximately 45 billion and 30 billion respectively during the last five years, while our volume over the same period of time increased over 2 billion sticks. We believe the fundamentals remain in place for our strong brands, led by Newport, to continue to outpace the industry. So as I said on our last conference call, Lorillard is not in need of a course correction.
Second, we do see and the analysis supports that there is an opportunity for organic portfolio expansion and geographic expansion beyond our core markets for further upside, albeit these must be pursued carefully and with discipline.
Third, there is a need for some capability improvements to navigate through the rapidly changing external environment and to be able to pursue those adjacencies. Examples of this would be strengthening in the areas of regulatory affairs and new product development. 
And finally, fourth, we will continue to be a strong cash flow generator and clearly understand the need for our investors to share in that strong cash flow. In the roughly two and a half years since our step-up, we've already returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to the potential for an increased regulation of menthol cigarettes. Our position hasn't changed since we spoke last. Congress mandated that the FDA evaluate the impact of menthol in cigarettes on the public's health. Lorillard continues to believe that the best available scientific evidence does not support an assertion that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impacts the public's health. 
Second, we acknowledge smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risks. Third, a draconian move like banning menthol would dramatically expand the cigarette black market, making it easier for underage kids to gain access. Such a black market would likely increase crime, cost jobs and reduce tax and MSA revenue. These countervailing effects are also mandated to be taken into account by the FDA. In summary, a menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totality or for any demographic group.
As it relates to TPSAC, we remain concerned that this committee is being more driven by politics than by science, and therefore, don't rule anything out for their March 23 non-binding recommendation. To help understand what Lorillard believes are the realities versus some of the mists surrounding the menthol debate, a new presentation has been added this morning to the ""Understanding Menthol"" website. This website, sponsored by Lorillard, is designed to educate interested parties on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes.
We do believe that when the issue is evaluated by the FDA itself, hard science will prevail, and as a result, menthol will not ultimately be banned. It's just difficult to assess the duration of the evaluation, but it's likely to take years. So while we continue to be actively involved in the menthol review process, rest assured, we will not take our eye off of responsibly building our business for both today and the future. We remain committed to consistently delivering a double-digit total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth and the dividend yield over the long-term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"
4180255,118540471,100058,"Lorillard, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2011",2011-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Lorillard's 2010 fourth quarter results were very strong and cap an outstanding 2010. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 20",868,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Lorillard's 2010 fourth quarter results were very strong and cap an outstanding 2010. 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 7.8% to $1.486 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. It was driven by a 4.5% increase in total shipment volume, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs, which are accounted for as a reduction in sales. 
The increase in units shipped when compared to last year's fourth quarter in light of the industry's decline reflects the underlying strength of our brands, which continue to gain share. Unit volumes for Newport were up 2.2%, and Maverick volumes were up 25.2%. The stability of Newport Menthol and the growth of Maverick have been common themes, and you've heard them before. And this year's fourth quarter also reflect the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol on November 1.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend. In fact, as I look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in our database, which is a better indicator of consumer take away, Newport Menthol's volume was flat to slightly up for the quarter. 
We announced an increase in wholesale list prices on certain of our cigarette brands, including Newport, on November 30, which amounted to approximately 1½% on our brand portfolio. As is typical for quarters in which the trade anticipates price increases, such as the fourth quarters of both this year and last year, changes in wholesale inventory patterns skewed the volume comparisons a bit for the quarter.
Total wholesale inventories increased modestly during the fourth quarter of last year, making the year-over-year comparison a little tougher. We estimate that this inventory dynamic dragged the unit volume comparison by about 1½ percentage points. So adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, we estimate total Lorillard volume to be up about 6%. Needless to say, this makes the quarter's performance that much more impressive.
This outstanding volume performance for the quarter brings the annual numbers for 2010 to record levels. Total domestic unit volume for the year grew by 5.3% from 2009, in the face of an industry decline of about 3.8%. The increase in volume in the fourth quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drives the increase in net sales before excise taxes of 9% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the year.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased by $57 million to $538 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the Tobacco Growers Assessment increased $24 million compared to last year's quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $22 million from last year's fourth quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter but also some higher compensation expenses this year due to the CEO transition and incentive compensation accrual.
Fourth quarter operating income increased 8.8% to $433 million or 29.1% of sales from $398 million or 28.9% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year increased about 6.6% compared with 2009.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 14.5% from last year's fourth quarter to $1.74 per share. It increased 17.7% for the year to $6.78. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS for the fourth quarter about $0.11 a share.
So 2010 was an outstanding year for Lorillard, and it's finished on a strong note, outperforming the rest of the industry and frankly most reasonable expectations on almost every measure. We saw unit volumes increase in the face of industry-wide decrease, market share increases to record levels and net sales increased to record level. We saw gross margins increase, operating margins increase and operating income per unit increase. We saw net income exceed $1 billion for the first time, and we saw a double-digit increase in EPS. Obviously, a great way to end 2010. 
Also, during 2010, we substantially increased our dividend and continued to repurchase shares in the market. Through December 31, we had repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a cost of $376 million under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization that we announced last fall. I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, and I will not be able to comment about the level or timing of future dividend declarations by the board or capital structure activity such as further debt issuances and the like. I will tell you that we have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1.5x EBITDA, nor have we changed our long-term target of paying dividends approximating 70% to 75% of earnings. 
Once again, we're very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for the year. And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions."

But process-wise again, be clear the FDA never has to come back if they don't want to. The FDA, the only requirement by Congress was that if within a year or by March 23, that a non-binding advisory committee had to submit a recommendation. We will see down the line where FDA prioritizes this and when they get to it and if they get to it. Having said that, there’s a lot more to the Newport brand, a lot more to the Newport brand than menthol flavoring. Our products are preferred in taste testing and as I dig into it and I've dug into it on the strategic plan, at the core of that is everything from tobacco plants to the design of the cigarette to huge brand equity. And in that respect, to the extent that cigarette smokers or menthol cigarette smokers choose to continue smoking, Newport smokers most likely, are going to want to stay with that brand and we’ll be able to formulate a product, better in my opinion than anybody else might be able to do so to retain them. 
So if someone's going to continue smoking, that is a Newport smoker, I believe we will retain the bulk of them. The second part of it is, will a percentage quit and people, their behavior versus what they say that they're going to do tends to differ and history says that very few would quit in this type of situation. So that's probably less of a factor. And then the final issue, which is concerning, if this was ever to get to a draconian move would be a black market and all the devastating effects that could come out of this. Because remember Congress passed this bill in order to create regulation and order and control not to create chaos."

These are not massive changes and certainly within the context of our ongoing businesses, are less than any adjustments we get on user fees and things like that. So they're manageable. I wouldn't be building into your model some significant step change though on SG&A."

Basically, sort of the share moves around it but it has its own sort of solid core. And the trend on that solid core, and I'm going to detail this at great length when we have our Investor Day in the next few months, but what you're going to find is that our core business is basically stable in a market that is declining at a faster rate around it. That didn't change in the fourth quarter. The trends, the growth trends of Newport Menthol, at the core, didn't change at all. That resulted in significant increase in market share in the first quarter that held all year and for the finish of the year, marked the eighth consecutive year of share growth for Newport Menthol. But as long as that core business trend and again in the fourth quarter Newport Menthol if you adjust for inventories, if you adjust for Newport Non-Menthol, take that out, Newport Menthol's volume was flat in an industry that's down 4% or 4½%. As long as we keep outperforming the industry by three or four percentage points, we're going to keep growing share."

And they made it very clear that they intended to follow a scientific process and that they also made it very clear that TPSAC's recommendation was a non-binding recommendation. We also had a stakeholder meeting, an industry stakeholder meeting in Raleigh, more recently, and in that meeting, Director Deyton stood in front of the room and some of the smaller manufacturers started to get more vocal. And he stood in front of that room and said, you have never heard the word ""banned"" come out of the FDA. And he sort of silenced the room. And he said, “You point to me one example where you heard the word banned come from the FDA.” I thought that was kind of poignant. And then as our continuing dialogues come along, I'll end with the third quote, which was when he kicked off all the TPSAC committee meetings, he looked TPSAC in the eye and he said, “You have a very important job to do. And we're going to be looking at your recommendation.

I'm pleased to show the results of another very strong quarter for Lorillard both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the tobacco industry. Our comments will be brief this morning, as we will be sharing our results and strategies going forward in great detail at the company's investor day next week. The  meeting will be held Wednesday, May 4, from 9 A.M. to 12 P.M. at the Mandarin Hotel in New York City. We hope you can join us in person or by webcast.
Starting with volume, for the first quarter Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments increased 9.4%, versus a year ago, while industry in total, declined 3.4%. That's a pretty remarkable difference in trend totaling 12.8 points.
Even after adjusting for the industry-wide benefit of 1 extra shipping day in the quarter and slightly offset by the year-to-year inventory fluctuations, we estimate that Lorillard's domestic volume was up 8.3% versus a year ago.
Lorillard's domestic volume growth was driven by an 8% increase in total in Newport, a 22.7% increase in Maverick, and a 26% increase in Old Gold.
Encouraging, Newport Non-Menthol, was a solid contributor to the quarter, as weekly volume and share in this new brand continue to grow.
As Lorillard volume trends continue to outperform the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard retail market share as measured by our proprietary retail database, Excel, in the first quarter increased 150 basis points versus a year ago to 14.1%.
Newport Non-Menthol achieved about 3 quarters of a share point by the end of the quarter. Our core  Newport Menthol business also gained share versus a year ago, up 38 basis points, and sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 63 basis points.
Our discount brands, Maverick and Old Gold, also continued to gain share.
Total volume growth along with higher prices net of promotion, translated to a 12.9% increase in net sales. Strong net sales growth coupled with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan resulted in a 14% year-over-year gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at a $1.71 for the quarter. 
A quick word on potential menthol regulation. The issue is now with the FDA and out of the hands of TPSAC. We believe that the evidence presented in both the industry reports and even in the TPSAC report itself supports the company's position that disproportionate menthol regulation is warranted.
We believe that this is further supported by the [ph] from Vanderbilt University, funded by the National Cancer Institute, which was surprisingly published only moments after the March 23 deadline for reports on this topic.
Beyond the scientific evidence, we believe that when the countervailing effects are seriously studied, such as the black market importations of additional menthol restrictions, that the case of there should be no disproportionate menthol regulation becomes obvious.
So in conclusion, the Lorillard story for quarter 1 remains the same:  Strong volume, good cost control and a focus on returning cash to shareholders. 
Remember, we recently increased the dividend on February 17, and we continue to repurchase company's stock. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the company's strong first quarter results in more detail. After David completes his review, we will answer your questions. David?"

As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results.

As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We saw a continuation of the positive, volume market share and profitability trends that experienced all last year.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2011 increased to 12.9%, to $1.535 billion as compared to the first quarter of 2010. Driven by the 9 1/2% increase in total shipment volume and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs associated with the launch of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Unit volumes for Newport were up 8.2%, and Maverick volumes were up 22.7%. Shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the first quarter of last year, was a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison.
Fluctuations in wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had some dampening effect on our volume comparison, but was not significant factor. It was about 1/2 of 1%. So after adjusting for the 1 additional shipping day in the first quarter this year and the modest effect of different trade inventory patterns, we estimate that our total volume was up 8.3%.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend.
In fact as I look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in our database, which is a better indicator of consumer takeaway, Newport Menthol's volume was slightly up for the quarter. 
In addition, net pricing was up for the quarter compared to last year, as the significant price realization on Newport Menthol overshadowed the impact of the mix change, both from the Newport Non-Menthol and from higher Maverick volume.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2011 increased by $65 million to $543 million from $478 million in last year's first quarter.
Cost of goods sold in 2011 first quarter reflects increases over last year uncertain cost, including FDA user fees.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and Tobacco Growers' Assessment, increased $36 million compared to last year's first quarter.
Selling, general and administrative cost increased $26 million from last year's first quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activities during the quarter.
This increase in litigation costs actually comprised most of the increase in SG&A, and is primarily due to an unusually high number of active trials this year as compared to last year, many of which are in Engle progeny cases underway in Florida. 
For example, this year we had 3 [ph] trials in the first quarter: A filter case trial, the City of Saint Louise trial and various post trial motions in the Evan's case. Now that may not sound high for some, but it's high for Lorillard so it impacts the comparison. Some other items included in SG&A were also higher this year than last. This includes various costs and expenses of all the activities surrounding company's position and industry report to the FDA regarding menthol and some additional advertising and brand-building cost in support of 
Newport Non-Menthol. 
So first quarter operating income increased 10.2% to $421 million, or 27.4% of sales from $382 million or 28.1% of sales in last year's first quarter.
Net sales per unit and operating income per unit were both up compared to last year's first quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 14% from last year's first quarter to $1.71 per share. Those results reflects the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of the lower average share count this year. The lower share count as compared to the year ago quarter added $0.11 per share to EPS for this year's first quarter.
During the first quarter of 2011, we substantially increased our dividend, by 16% to an annualized dividend of $5.20 per share, and we continue to repurchase shares in the market.
For the quarter, through March 31, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a cost of $289 million under the $1 billion share repurchase authorization that we announced last fall. That's an average cost of $76.76 per share. 
As of March 31, we still had to do $325 million remaining on that program.
So, we're off to good start in 2011, and we're pleased with the company's performance thus far. 
Of course, challenges remain for us  on a number of fronts: Macro economic, competitive, and regulatory. We believe that we had the ability to meet these challenges and continue to build value for our shareholders over the long-term. And with that, we'd like to open the lines for questions. Operator, can you help us with that?[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley."

And if you get some of the averaged price market, you get as high as 20% to 25% discount during this trial period.

And as we look forward to the trial calendar for the rest of the year, it's pretty difficult to forecast. I don't believe that our trial calendar over the next few quarters is as heavy as what we experienced in the first quarter of this year. But we really just have to take this as it comes. We're going to defend ourselves in every case to the maximum extent, and it's really just sort of activity driven. Unfortunately, we are reactive in this matter. Although, the Engle progeny cases are a big deal, not just a number of trials. I think we had something like 50% more active cases whether they were in trial or not. 50% more active Engle progeny cases in the first quarter this year than the first quarter last year.

We're watching it very carefully. There's a number of scenarios. In general, I think the most important thing you need to know is that this is a push by the industry leaders that feels like margins have been expanding at the retail level at the expense of sort of the competitive position relative to the amount of money that they spent on buy downs and industry spent on buy downs and whether it's getting passed through and increasing their productivity. So we have in our contract a fair and equitable clause, so if margins come down for them, they come down for us. So presumably that would be a favorable impact. The other important thing to know if we sell a lot of volume which are not markets where they are even under contract. So presumably it's not effect there. There are some modest areas where they may get a little more competitive, and if we need to wheel adjust but there's a whole lot of other areas where you would think we would benefit, especially depending on the participation level.

Starting with volume. For the first quarter, Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments increased 9.4% versus a year ago, while the industry in total declined 3.4%. That's a pretty remarkable difference in trend totaling 12.8 points.
Even after adjusting for the industry-wide benefit of 1 extra shipping day in the quarter and slightly offset by year-to-year inventory fluctuations, we estimate that Lorillard's domestic volume was up 8.3% versus a year ago.
Lorillard's domestic volume growth was driven by an 8% increase in total in Newport, a 22.7% increase in Maverick and a 26% increase in Old Gold.
Encouragingly, Newport Non-Menthol was a solid contributor to the quarter as weekly volume and share on this new brand continue to grow.
As Lorillard volume trends continue to outperform the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard retail market share as measured by our proprietary retail database, EXCEL, in the first quarter increased 150 basis points versus a year ago to 14.1%.
Newport Non-Menthol achieved about 3 quarters of a share point by the end of the quarter. Our core  Newport Menthol business also gained share vote versus the year ago, up 38 basis points, and sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 63 basis points.
Our discount brands, Maverick and Old Gold, also continued to gain share.
Total volume growth, along with higher prices net of promotion, translated to a 12.9% increase in net sales. Strong net sales growth coupled with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan resulted in a 14% year-over-year gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at $1.71 for the quarter. 
A quick word on potential menthol regulation. The issue is now with the FDA and out of the hands of TPSAC. We believe that the evidence presented in both the industry reports and even in the TPSAC report itself supports the company's position that no disproportionate menthol regulation is warranted.
We believe that this is further supported by the [indiscernible] study from Vanderbilt University, funded by the National Cancer Institute, which was surprisingly published only moments after the March 23rd deadline for reports on this topic.
Beyond the scientific evidence, we believe that when the countervailing effects are seriously studied, such as the black market implications of an additional menthol restrictions, that the case that there should be no disproportionate menthol regulation becomes obvious.
So in conclusion, the Lorillard story for quarter 1 remains the same: strong volume, good cost control and a focus on returning cash to shareholders. 
Remember, we recently increased the dividend on February 17, and we continue to repurchase company's stock. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the company's strong first quarter results in more detail. After David completes his review, we will answer your questions. David?"

As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We saw a continuation of the positive, volume market share and profitability trends that we experienced all last year.Net sale",767,"Thanks, Murray. And good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We saw a continuation of the positive, volume market share and profitability trends that we experienced all last year.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2011 increased to 12.9%, to $1.535 billion as compared to the first quarter of 2010. Driven by the 9.5% increase in total shipment volume and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs associated with the launch of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Unit volumes for Newport were up 8.2%, and Maverick volumes were up 22.7%. Shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the fourth quarter of last year, was a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison.
Fluctuations in wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had some dampening effect on our volume comparison, but was not a significant factor. It was about 1/2 of 1%. So after adjusting for the 1 additional shipping day in the first quarter this year and the modest effect of different trade inventory patterns, we estimate that our total volume was up 8.3%.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend.
In fact, as I look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in our database, which is a better indicator of consumer takeaway, Newport Menthol's volume was slightly up for the quarter. 
In addition, net pricing was up for the quarter compared to last year, as the significant price realization on Newport Menthol overshadowed the impact of the mix change, both from the Newport Non-Menthol and from higher Maverick volume.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2011 increased by $65 million to $543 million from $478 million in last year's first quarter.
Cost of goods sold in 2011 first quarter reflects increases over last year uncertain cost, including increase FDA user fees.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and in Tobacco Growers' Assessment, increased $46 million compared to last year's first quarter.
Selling, general and administrative cost increased $26 million from last year's first quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter.
This increase in litigation costs actually comprised most of the increase in SG&A, and is primarily due to an unusually high number of active trials of this year as compared to last year, many of which are Engle progeny cases underway in Florida. 
For example, this year we had 3 Engle trials in the first quarter: A filter case trial, the City of St. Louis trial and various post trial motions in the Evans case. Now that may not sound high for some, but it's high for Lorillard, so it impacts the comparison. Some other items included in SG&A were also higher this year than last. This includes various costs and expenses of all the activities surrounding the company's position and industry report to the FDA regarding menthol and some additional advertising and brand-building cost in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
So first quarter operating income increased 10.2% to $421 million, or 27.4% of sales from $382 million or 28.1% of sales in last year's first quarter. Net sales per unit and operating income per unit were both up compared to last year's first quarter. 
Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 14% from last year's first quarter to $1.71 per share. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count, as compared to the year ago quarter, added $0.11 per share to EPS for this year's first quarter.
During the first quarter 2011, we substantially increased our dividend by 16% to an annualized dividend of $5.20 per share, and we continue to repurchase shares in the market. For the quarter, through March 31, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a cost of $289 million under the $1 billion share repurchase authorization that we announced last fall. That's an average cost of $76.76 per share. As of March 31, we still had $335 million remaining on that program.
So, we're off to good start in 2011, and we're pleased with the company's performance thus far. Of course, challenges remain for us on a number of fronts, macro economic, competitive, and regulatory. We believe that we have the ability to meet these challenges and continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Operator, can you help us with that?"

And if you get to some of the average-priced markets, you get as high as 20% to 25% discount during this trial period.

We're going to defend ourselves in every case to our -- to the maximum extent, and it's really just sort of activity driven. And unfortunately, we are reactive in this matter. So although the Engle progeny cases are a big deal, not just the number of trials, I think we had something like 50% more active cases, whether they were in trial or not, 50% more active Engle-chased cases in the first quarter this year than the first quarter last year.

We’re watching it very carefully. There is a number of scenarios. In general, I think the most important thing you need to know is that this is a push by the industry leader that feels like margins have been expanding at the retail level at the expense of sort of the competitive position relative to the amount of money that they spend on buy downs and the industry spends on buy downs and whether it's getting passed through and increasing their productivity. So, we have in our contract if they're an equitable clause, so, if margins come down for them, they come down for us. So, presumably, that would be a favorable impact. The other important thing to know is, we saw a lot of volume, which are not markets where they are even under contract. So, presumably, it's no effect there. There are some modest areas where they may get a little more competitive. And if we need to, we'll adjust. But there's a whole lot of other areas where you would think we would benefit, especially depending on the participation level.

I'm pleased to show the results of another very strong quarter for Lorillard, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the tobacco industry.

I'm pleased to show the results of another very strong quarter for Lorillard, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the tobacco industry. Our comments will be brief this morning, as we will be sharing our results and strategies going forward in great detail at the company's Investor Day next week. The meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 4, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Mandarin Hotel in New York City. We hope you can join us in person or by webcast.
Starting with volumes. For the first quarter, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased 9.4% versus a year ago, while the industry in total declined 3.4%. That's a pretty remarkable difference in trend, totaling 12.8 points.
Even after adjusting for the industry-wide benefit of 1 extra shipping day in the quarter and slightly offset by year-to-year inventory fluctuations, we estimate that Lorillard's domestic volume was up 8.3% versus a year ago.
Lorillard's domestic volume growth was driven by an 8% increase in total Newport, a 22.7% increase in Maverick and a 26% increase in Old Gold.
Encouragingly, Newport Non-Menthol was a solid contributor to the quarter as weekly volume and share on this new brand continued to grow.
As Lorillard volume trends continue to outperform the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard retail market share as measured by our proprietary retail database, EXCEL, in the first quarter increased 150 basis points versus a year ago to 14.1%.
Newport Non-Menthol achieved about 3/4 of a share point by the end of the quarter. Our core  Newport Menthol business also gained share both versus the year ago, up 38 basis points, and sequentially versus the fourth quarter, up 63 basis points.
Our discount brands, Maverick and Old Gold, also continued to gain share.
Total volume growth, along with higher prices net of promotion, translated to a 12.9% increase in net sales. Strong net sales growth, coupled with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan, resulted in a 14% year-over-year gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at $1.71 for the quarter. 
A quick word on potential menthol regulation. The issue is now with the FDA and out of the hands of TPSAC. We believe that the evidence presented in both the industry reports and even in the TPSAC report itself supports the company's position that no disproportionate menthol regulation is warranted.
We believe that this is further supported by the Gance [ph] study from Vanderbilt University, funded by the National Cancer Institute, which was surprisingly published only moments after the March 23rd deadline for reports on this topic.
Beyond the scientific evidence, we believe that when the countervailing effects are seriously studied, such as the black market implications of an additional menthol restriction, that the case that there should be no disproportionate menthol regulation becomes obvious.
So in conclusion, the Lorillard story for quarter 1 remains the same: strong volume, good cost control and a focus on returning cash to shareholders. 
Remember, we recently increased the dividend on February 17, and we continue to repurchase company stock. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the company's strong first quarter results in more detail. After David completes his review, we will answer your questions. David?"
4180255,129745129,117577,"Lorillard, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Murray. And good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We saw a continuation of the positive volume, market share and profitability trends that we experienced all last year.Net sale",768,"Thanks, Murray. And good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We saw a continuation of the positive volume, market share and profitability trends that we experienced all last year.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2011 increased to 12.9%, to $1.535 billion as compared to the first quarter of 2010. Driven by the 9.5% increase in total shipment volume and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs associated with the launch of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Unit volumes for Newport were up 8.2%, and Maverick volumes were up 22.7%. Shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the fourth quarter of last year, was a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison.
Fluctuations in wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had some dampening effect on our volume comparison but was not a significant factor. It was about 1/2 of 1%. So after adjusting for the 1 additional shipping day in the first quarter this year and the modest effect of different trade inventory patterns, we estimate that our total volume was up 8.3%.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend.
In fact, as I look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in our database, which is a better indicator of consumer takeaway, Newport Menthol's volume was slightly up for the quarter. 
In addition, net pricing was up for the quarter compared to last year, as the significant price realization on Newport Menthol overshadowed the impact of the mix change, both from the Newport Non-Menthol and from higher Maverick volume.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2011 increased by $65 million to $543 million from $478 million in last year's first quarter.
Cost of goods sold in 2011 first quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the Tobacco Growers' Assessment increased $46 million compared to last year's first quarter.
Selling, general and administrative cost increased $26 million from last year's first quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter.
This increase in litigation costs actually comprised most of the increase in SG&A and is primarily due to an unusually high number of active trials this year as compared to last year, many of which are Engle progeny cases underway in Florida. 
For example, this year we had 3 Engle trials in the first quarter: a filter case trial, the City of St. Louis trial and various post trial motions in the Evans case. Now that may not sound high for some, but it's high for Lorillard, so it impacts the comparison. Some other items included in SG&A were also higher this year than last. These includes various costs and expenses of all the activities surrounding the company's position and industry report to the FDA regarding menthol and some additional advertising and brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
So first quarter operating income increased 10.2% to $421 million, or 27.4% of sales from $382 million or 28.1% of sales in last year's first quarter. Net sales per unit and operating income per unit were both up compared to last year's first quarter. 
Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 14% from last year's first quarter to $1.71 per share. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count, as compared to the year ago quarter, added $0.11 per share to EPS for this year's first quarter.
During the first quarter 2011, we substantially increased our dividend by 16% to an annualized dividend of $5.20 per share, and we continue to repurchase shares in the market. For the quarter, through March 31, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a cost of $289 million under the $1 billion share repurchase authorization that we announced last fall. That's an average cost of $76.76 per share. As of March 31, we still had $335 million remaining on that program.
So, we're off to a good start in 2011, and we're pleased with the company's performance thus far. Of course, challenges remain for us on a number of fronts, macro economic, competitive, and regulatory. We believe that we have the ability to meet these challenges and continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Operator, can you help us with that?"

We have repeat numbers. We have all that to show you. The brand's performing extremely well, and I'm going to emphasize that while people talk a lot about the discount level -- the discount level is not even a little unusual for other premium brand launches. It's basically $1 a pack discount versus the average premium-priced product. So if you're in with some of our big markets like New York, where it's $10 or $11 per pack of cigarettes, you're talking about a 10% discount. And if you get to some of the average-priced markets, you get as high as a 20% to 25% discount during this trial period. That’s nothing like the buy 1, get 1 frees and deep, deep discounts that make it hard to ultimately get to premium pricing. I'll walk you through source of volume. I'll walk you through repeat.

We're going to defend ourselves in every case to our -- to the maximum extent, and it's really just sort of activity driven. And unfortunately, we are reactive in this matter, although the Engle progeny cases are a big deal, not just the number of trials.

In general, I think the most important thing you need to know is that this is a push by the industry leader that feels like margins have been expanding at the retail level at the expense of sort of the competitive position relative to the amount of money that they spend on buy downs and the industry spends on buy downs and whether it's getting passed through and increasing their productivity. So, we have in our contract a fair and equitable clause, so, if margins come down for them, they come down for us. So, presumably, that would be a favorable impact. The other important thing to know is, we saw a lot of volume, which are not markets where they are even under contract. So, presumably, it's no effect there. There are some modest areas where they may get a little more competitive. And if we need to, we'll adjust.

Our comments will be brief this morning, as we will be sharing our results and strategies going forward in great detail at the company's investor day next week. The meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 4, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Mandarin Hotel in New York City. We hope you can join us in person or by webcast.
Starting with volumes. For the first quarter, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased 9.4% versus a year ago, while the industry in total declined 3.4%. That's a pretty remarkable difference in trend, totaling 12.8 points.
Even after adjusting for the industry-wide benefit of 1 extra shipping day in the quarter and slightly offset by year-to-year inventory fluctuations, we estimate that Lorillard's domestic volume was up 8.3% versus a year ago.
Lorillard's domestic volume growth was driven by an 8% increase in total Newport, a 22.7% increase in Maverick and a 26% increase in Old Gold.
Encouragingly, Newport Non-Menthol was a solid contributor to the quarter as weekly volume and share on this new brand continued to grow.
As Lorillard volume trends continue to outperform the industry, we gain market share. Total Lorillard retail market share as measured by our proprietary retail database, EXCEL, in the first quarter increased 150 basis points versus a year ago to 14.1%.
Newport Non-Menthol achieved about 3/4 of a share point by the end of the quarter. Our core  Newport Menthol business also gained share both versus the year ago, up 38 basis points, and sequentially versus the fourth quarter, up 63 basis points.
Our discount brands, Maverick and Old Gold, also continued to gain share.
Total volume growth, along with higher prices net of promotion, translated to a 12.9% increase in net sales. Strong net sales growth, coupled with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan, resulted in a 14% year-over-year gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at $1.71 for the quarter. 
A quick word on potential menthol regulation. The issue is now with the FDA and out of the hands of TPSAC. We believe that the evidence presented in both the industry reports and even in the TPSAC report itself supports the company's position that no disproportionate menthol regulation is warranted.
We believe that this is further supported by the Gance [ph] study from Vanderbilt University, funded by the National Cancer Institute, which was surprisingly published only moments after the March 23rd deadline for reports on this topic.
Beyond the scientific evidence, we believe that when the countervailing effects are seriously studied, such as the black market implications of an additional menthol restriction, that the case that there should be no disproportionate menthol regulation becomes obvious.
So in conclusion, the Lorillard story for quarter 1 remains the same: strong volume, good cost control and a focus on returning cash to shareholders. 
Remember, we recently increased the dividend on February 17, and we continue to repurchase company stock. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the company's strong first quarter results in more detail. After David completes his review, we will answer your questions. David?"

As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results.

As you've already heard from Murray, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We saw a continuation of the positive volume, market share and profitability trends that we experienced all last year.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2011 increased to 12.9%, to $1.535 billion as compared to the first quarter of 2010. Driven by the 9.5% increase in total shipment volume and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs associated with the launch of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Unit volumes for Newport were up 8.2%, and Maverick volumes were up 22.7%. Shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the fourth quarter of last year, was a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison.
Fluctuations in wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had some dampening effect on our volume comparison but was not a significant factor. It was about 1/2 of 1%. So after adjusting for the 1 additional shipping day in the first quarter this year and the modest effect of different trade inventory patterns, we estimate that our total volume was up 8.3%.
While the quarter shipments included the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol, Newport Menthol continued its very strong trend.
In fact, as I look at the shipments from wholesale to retail in our database, which is a better indicator of consumer takeaway, Newport Menthol's volume was slightly up for the quarter. 
In addition, net pricing was up for the quarter compared to last year, as the significant price realization on Newport Menthol overshadowed the impact of the mix change, both from the Newport Non-Menthol and from higher Maverick volume.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2011 increased by $65 million to $543 million from $478 million in last year's first quarter.
Cost of goods sold in 2011 first quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the Tobacco Growers' Assessment increased $46 million compared to last year's first quarter.
Selling, general and administrative cost increased $26 million from last year's first quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter.
This increase in litigation costs actually comprised most of the increase in SG&A and is primarily due to an unusually high number of active trials this year as compared to last year, many of which are Engle progeny cases underway in Florida. 
For example, this year we had 3 Engle trials in the first quarter: a filter case trial, the City of St. Louis trial and various post trial motions in the Evans case. Now that may not sound high for some, but it's high for Lorillard, so it impacts the comparison. Some other items included in SG&A were also higher this year than last. These includes various costs and expenses of all the activities surrounding the company's position and industry report to the FDA regarding menthol and some additional advertising and brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
So first quarter operating income increased 10.2% to $421 million, or 27.4% of sales from $382 million or 28.1% of sales in last year's first quarter. Net sales per unit and operating income per unit were both up compared to last year's first quarter. 
Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 14% from last year's first quarter to $1.71 per share. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count, as compared to the year ago quarter, added $0.11 per share to EPS for this year's first quarter.
During the first quarter 2011, we substantially increased our dividend by 16% to an annualized dividend of $5.20 per share, and we continue to repurchase shares in the market. For the quarter, through March 31, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a cost of $289 million under the $1 billion share repurchase authorization that we announced last fall. That's an average cost of $76.76 per share. As of March 31, we still had $335 million remaining on that program.
So, we're off to a good start in 2011, and we're pleased with the company's performance thus far. Of course, challenges remain for us on a number of fronts, macro economic, competitive, and regulatory. We believe that we have the ability to meet these challenges and continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Operator, can you help us with that?"

And if you get to some of the average-priced markets, you get as high as a 20% to 25% discount during this trial period.

So, we have in our contract a fair and equitable clause, so, if margins come down for them, they come down for us. So, presumably, that would be a favorable impact. The other important thing to know is, we saw a lot of volume, which are not markets where they are even under contract. So, presumably, it's no effect there. There are some modest areas where they may get a little more competitive. And if we need to, we'll adjust. But there's a whole lot of other areas where you would think we would benefit, especially depending on the participation level.

In the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm extremely pleased to report another very strong quarter for Lorillard.

In the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm extremely pleased to report another very strong quarter for Lorillard. The company's second quarter results continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength of our brands and our organization. 
Let's start with a review of the key fundamentals on the business and how we are proceeding to responsibly bring Newport Pleasure to all adult smokers. First, total domestic Newport volume increased 9.6% versus year ago in Q2 with Newport Menthol domestic volume up 1% for the quarter. This includes what we believe is a relatively minor cannibalization effect from Newport Non-Menthol estimated as a negative 1% drag on the core menthol business. And this is also encouraging as we reduced Newport Menthol promotion spending in the quarter versus year ago. 
Second and driving the total Newport increase was a strong performance by Newport Non-Menthol. Newport Non-Menthol sales are way above our expectations for this point in the launch, crossing the 1% market share level vote by quarter end. Importantly, the second wave of our source of volume business study conducted in April continues to indicate that the branch volume is 90% incremental to the Newport franchise. That's 2/3 of purchasers claiming Newport Menthol as their usual brand. That positive purchase intent is expressed by virtually all purchasers, 96% and that the primary reason for purchase is the product's taste. This gives us confidence that long-term we can continue to migrate the brand's retail price in line with core Newport Menthol. 
Third, Maverick, our discount brand, continued to make strong gains, increasing 21% versus year ago in the quarter. 
Fourth, we made progress in the quarter with our selectively increased support on Newport Menthol in non-core markets. Four additional markets were added late in the quarter, as we mentioned at our investor conference, and our original test markets continued to experience double-digit volume growth. 
That all added to a substantial increase in Lorrilard domestic volume of 10.4% or almost 1 billion sticks more than we shipped a year ago. Even after adjusting for heightened wholesale inventories in advance of our at July first price increase, total Lorillard domestic revenue increased 8.1% a year ago. This is especially noteworthy, given the context of high unemployment, high gasoline prices and declining industry sale. We remain highly confident in our recently announced strategic plan, which places its primary focus on organic growth and outperformance relative to our peers in the U.S. cigarette industry. As always, when our brands outperforms the category, we gain market share. And this was the case in Q2.
At retail, where wholesale inventory fluctuations do not impact the numbers, industry volume was estimated to decline just under 4%. Therefore, according to our proprietary EXCEL database, which measures the shipments from wholesale to retail, total Lorillard market share increased to 14.2% or a 140 basis point increase over the second quarter last year.  
Likewise, total Newport share increased 109 basis points to 12% in Q2. Basically, we held onto the sizable gains achieved under the first quarter so we gained share versus year ago on total Lorillard, on total Lorrilard premium, on total Lorrilard discount, on total Newport including Newport Non-Menthol, on core Newport Menthol and on Maverick. This was not just a case of a successful new product. Share gains were experienced broadly across our portfolio. 
Strong organic volume growth combined with higher prices net of promotion translated to an 11.3% increase in net sales and a 9.4% operating income increase. This combined with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan resulted in a 18% year-over-year quarterly gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at $2.05 for the quarter. Obviously, the quality of the earnings for the quarter was high.  At the six-month mark, EPS for Lorillard is up 16.5% versus year ago, making the company one of the top performers in the CPG industry during these difficult economic times. 
It also demonstrates that we are not just focused on growth but as always been the case, we are focused on profitable growth. While we don't necessarily expect this phase of growth to continue in the second half, I think you'd agree we're having a darn good year, especially when you add the dividend yield. In fact, relative to our tobacco peers and the broader group of consumer products in general, we are pleased we can deliver outsized top line growth leveraged through our income statement and showcase the strength of our business despite a difficult macro consumer environment. 
Let's move on now to the regulatory environment as it relates to menthol. We made an important organizationally move during the quarter, which will help shape our relationship with the FDA. Dr. Neil Wilcox joined us as our Senior Vice President of Regulatory Compliance. Neil came recently from an important position from the FDA. He is very experienced in agency process and policy. And we expect him to provide strong guidance and governance on the regulatory issues that face us. 
Now let's turn to the regulatory events in the quarter and their impact on the company. Although some headlines around several FDA announcements created intraquarter volatility on our stock price, we see the FDA review process moving as expected. Not faster, not slower. The FDA is conducting a preliminary independent peer-reviewed scientific assessment separate from TPSAC as they promised they would. We see that as a positive because, A, we believe that the TPSAC panel was biased, which is obviously why we are engaged in litigation on this topic. B, initial FDA white papers, while they still suffer from some of the same flaws that plague the TPSAC report, were more balanced than TPSAC. And, C, the peer review process is normal for FDA on this type of issue and is an appropriate first step. 
Of course, our current view depends on the quality of the peer review process and the objectivity of the reviewers selected. We believe a thorough objective and scientific process is critical. And overall, we haven't changed our opinion that this will be a very long process and that the overwhelming body of scientific evidence does not justify increased regulation on menthol cigarettes relative to non-menthol c6. 
Accordingly, we continue to focus on our business and believe the best reason to invest in Lorrilard are strong and growing dividend, balance sheet flexibility that is being being used to lower our cost of capital via increased leverage and share repurchases and a strategic plan that clearly identifies growth opportunities within the domestic cigarette market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a double-digit shareholder return as measured by EPS growth and the dividend yield. And we remain confident in our ability to grow at a level that exceeds our domestic tobacco company peers. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board but were partially offset by other factors. First, unit volumes for Newport were up 9.6% while Maverick volumes were up 21.2%. As we reported for the last several quarters, the continuing increase in Maverick unit volumes and the resulting shift in our mix of products sold has the effect of reducing the overall revenues per unit sold. 
Second, shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the fourth quarter last year, was also a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison. Newport Non-Menthol units carrying a promotional price in this year's quarter and therefore added to this mix effect on the calculation of net price per unit, if that's calculated on a consolidated basis. This year-over-year effect is not a surprise nor does it concern us. It does not reflect the deterioration of the price point of our brand. In fact, when I look at the calculations of price realization before excise taxes for Newport Menthol only, they work out to a healthy 5.7% increase for the second quarter. The other factors bring the total down. But as we've said before, this is incremental business for us. It is profitable on its own and it strengthens our portfolio in the long term. 
Fluctuations in the wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had an effect on our second quarter volume comparison just like some others in the industry. After adjusting for the effect of the decline in wholesale inventories last year and a build this year, we estimate that our domestic wholesale shipments would've increased 8.1% for the quarter rather than a 10.4% as reported. 
These build and wholesale inventories will reverse itself in the outcoming quarter and will have the obvious effect of dampening our third quarter comparisons. 
Notably, it will also further impact reported net pricing and profitability in that quarter because of the consumer promotion, much of which follow retail movements, not wholesale movements. 
I mentioned this I know many of you develop expectations of financial performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, in part by referring to last year. As you may recall, we reported strong unit volume increases in last year's third quarter, some of which was inflated due to an inventory build in that quarter. The opposite is likely to be true this year. But we believe the underlying trends of our portfolio will continue to be strong. 
Gross profit in the second quarter 2011 increased by $57 million to $599 million. 
Cost of goods sold in the 2011 quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs including increased FDA user fees.  The amounts due under the state settlement agreement and the tobacco grower assessment increased $45 million compared to last year's second quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $15 million from last or second quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activities during the quarter just like it did in our first quarter. 
Other increases in SG&A included marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Second quarter operating income increased 9.4% to $487 million from $445 million last year's second quarter. Operating income is up 9.8% for the first half of 2011. 
Fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased 18.5% from last year's second quarter to $2.05 per share. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count is compared to the year ago quarter added $0.14 per share to EPS in this year's second quarter. 
During the quarter through June 30, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a cost of $494 million under the current share repurchase authorization. The board increased this repurchase authorization from $1 billion to $1.4 billion in May, further demonstrating our intent to return cash to shareholders in both share dividend and share repurchases. As of June 30, we had $241 million remaining on that program. 
A quick comment about the voluntary recall of certain Newport Non-Menthol product last week. As we announced, the company became aware that there was a possibility that some of our products could contain pieces of plastic. We did not find any such plastic in any of our products but could not rule out the theoretical possibility. Out of abundance of caution, we removed all of the products that could've been affected from the supply chain and voluntarily implemented a recall of any of the products that could've reached retail shelves. 
We did not experience any significant stock-outs of Newport Non-Menthol in retail and we do not believe that the one-day interruption of supply had any effect on the positive momentum of the brand.  And the cost of the recall is expected to be insignificant. 
We are pleased with the company's performance this far for this quarter and for 2011 so far. While we expect this to be another outstanding year for Lorillard, I think we can agree that one should not expect EPS growth to continue to approach 20% on a regular and ongoing basis. We do believe, however, that we can continue to outperform the industry, build on our record of success and deliver value for our shareholders over the long term.
With that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

Let's start with a review of the key fundamentals on the business and how we are proceeding to responsibly bring Newport Pleasure to all adult smokers. First, total domestic Newport volume increased 9.6% versus year ago in Q2, with the  Newport Menthol domestic volume up 1% for the quarter. This includes what we believe is a relatively minor cannibalization effect from Newport Non-Menthol estimated as a negative 1% drag on the core menthol business. And this is also encouraging, as we reduced Newport Menthol promotion spending in the quarter versus year ago. 
Second, and driving the total Newport increase, was a strong performance by Newport Non-Menthol. Newport Non-Menthol sales are way above our expectations for this point in the launch, crossing the 1% market share level vote by quarter end. Importantly, the second wave of our source of volume business study conducted in April continues to indicate that the brand's volume is 90% incremental to the Newport franchise, that 2/3 of purchasers claim Newport Non-Menthol as their usual brand; that positive purchase intent is expressed by virtually all purchasers, 96%; and that the primary reason for purchase is the product's taste. This gives us confidence that long term, we can continue to migrate the brand's retail price in line with core Newport Menthol. 
Third, Maverick, our discount brand, continued to make strong gains, increasing 21% versus year ago in the quarter. 
Fourth, we made progress in the quarter with our selectively increased support on Newport Menthol in non-core markets. Four additional markets were added late in the quarter, as we mentioned at our investor conference. And our original test markets continued to experience double-digit volume growth.  That all added to a substantial increase in Lorillard domestic volume of 10.4% or almost 1 billion sticks more than we shipped a year ago. 
Even after adjusting for heightened wholesale inventories in advance of our July 1 price increase, total Lorillard domestic volume increased 8.1% versus year ago. This is especially noteworthy, given the context of high unemployment, high gasoline prices and declining industry sale. We remain highly confident in our recently announced strategic plan, which places its primary focus on organic growth and outperformance relative to our peers in the U.S. cigarette industry.  As always, when our brands outperform the category, we gain market share. And this was the case in Q2.  
At retail, where wholesale inventory fluctuations do not impact the numbers, industry volume was estimated to decline just under 4%. Therefore, according to our proprietary EXCEL database, which measures the shipments from wholesale to retail, total Lorillard market share increased to 14.2% or a 140 basis point increase over the second quarter last year.  
Likewise, total Newport share increased 109 basis points to 12% in Q2. Basically, we held on to the sizable gains achieved under the first quarter, so we gained share versus year ago on total Lorillard; on total Lorillard premium; on total Lorillard discount; on total Newport, including Newport Non-Menthol; on core Newport Menthol; and on Maverick. This was not just the case of a successful new product. Share gains were experienced broadly across our portfolio. 
Strong organic volume growth combined with higher prices net of promotion translated to an 11.3% increase in net sales and a 9.4% operating income increase. This combined with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan, resulted in an 18% year-over-year quarterly gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at $2.05 for the quarter. So obviously, the quality of earnings for the quarter was high.  At the 6-month mark, EPS for Lorillard is up 16.5% versus year ago, making the company one of the top performers in the CPG industry during these difficult economic time.  It also demonstrates that we are not just focused on growth, but has as always been the case, we are focused on profitable growth. 
While we don't necessarily expect this pace of growth to continue in the second half, I think you'd agree we're having a darn good year, especially, when you add the dividend yield. In fact, relative to our tobacco peers and the broader group of consumer product goods companies, in general, we are pleased we can deliver outsized top line growth, leverage through our income statement and showcase the strength of our business, despite a difficult macro consumer environment. 
Let's move on now to the regulatory environment, as it relates to Menthol. We made an important organizational move during the quarter, which will help shape our relationship with the FDA. Dr. Neil Wilcox joined us as our Senior Vice President of Regulatory Compliance. Neil came most recently from an important position at the FDA. He is very experienced in agency process and policy, and we expect him to provide strong guidance and governance on the regulatory issues that face us. 
Now let's turn to the regulatory events in the quarter and their impact on the company. Although some headlines around several FDA announcements created intra-quarter volatility on our stock price, we see the FDA review process moving, as expected; not faster, not slower. The FDA is conducting a preliminary independent peer-reviewed scientific assessment separate from TPSAC, as they promised they would. We see that as a positive, because, a, we believe that the TPSAC panel was biased, which is obviously, why we are engaged in litigation on this topic; b, initial FDA white papers, while they still suffer from some of the same flaws that plagued the TPSAC report, were more balanced than TPSAC; and, c, the peer review process is normal for FDA on this type of issue and is an appropriate first step. 
Of course, our current view depends on the quality of the peer review process and the objectivity of the reviewers selected. We believe a thorough objective and scientific process is critical. And overall, we haven't changed our opinion that this will be a very long process, and that the overwhelming body of scientific evidence does not justify increased regulation on menthol cigarettes relative to non-menthol cigarettes. 
Accordingly, we continue to focus on our business and believe the best reason to invest in Lorillard are industry-leading fundamentals, a strong and growing dividend, balance sheet flexibility that is being used to lower our cost of capital via increased leverage and share repurchases and a strategic plan that clearly identifies growth opportunities within the domestic cigarette market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a double-digit shareholder return, as measured by EPS growth and the dividend yield. And we remain confident in our ability to grow at a level that exceeds our domestic tobacco company peers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the second quarter of 2011 increased 11.3% to $1.7 billion as compared to our second quarter of 2010, driven by the 1",961,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the second quarter of 2011 increased 11.3% to $1.7 billion as compared to our second quarter of 2010, driven by the 10.4% increase in domestic shipment volume.  Our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board but were partially offset by other factors. 
First, unit volumes for Newport were up 9.6%, while Maverick volumes were up 21.2%. As we've reported for the last several quarters, the continuing increase in Maverick unit volumes and the resulting shift in our mix of products sold has the effect of reducing the overall revenues per unit sold. 
Second, shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the fourth quarter of last year, was also a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison. Newport Non-Menthol units carried a promotional price in this year's quarter, and therefore, added to this mix effect on the calculation of net price per unit, if that's calculated on a consolidated basis. This year-over-year effect is not a surprise, nor does it concern us. It does not reflect the deterioration of the price point of our brand. In fact, when I look at the calculations of price realization before excise taxes for Newport Menthol only, they work out to a healthy 5.7% increase for the second quarter. The other factors bring the total down. But as we've said before, this is incremental business for us. It is profitable on its own, and it strengthens our portfolio over the long term. 
Fluctuations in wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had an effect on our second quarter volume comparison, just like some others in the industry. After adjusting for the effect of the decline in wholesale inventories last year and a build this year, we estimate that our domestic wholesale shipments would've increased 8.1% for the quarter rather than the 10.4%, as reported.  These build and wholesale inventories will reverse itself in the upcoming quarter and will have the obvious effect of dampening our third quarter volume compare [ph].  
Notably, it will also further impact reported net pricing and profitability in that quarter because of the impact of consumer promotion, much of which follow retail movements, not wholesale movements.  I mentioned this, because I know many of you develop expectations of financial performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, in part, by referring to last year. As you may recall, we reported strong unit volume increases in last year's third quarter, some of which was inflated due to an inventory build in that quarter. The opposite is likely to be true this year. But we believe the underlying trends of our portfolio will continue to be strong. 
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2011 increased by $57 million to $599 million.  Cost of goods sold in the 2011 quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fee.  The amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the tobacco grower's assessment increased $45 million compared to last year's second quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $15 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter, just like it did in our first quarter.  Other increases in SG&A included marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Second quarter operating income increased 9.4% to $487 million from $445 million in last year's second quarter. Operating income is up 9.8% for the first half of 2011.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased 18.5% from last year's second quarter to $2.05 per share. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count is compared to the year-ago quarter added $0.14 per share to EPS in this year's second quarter. 
During the quarter, through June 30, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a cost of $494 million under the current share repurchase authorization. The board increased this repurchase authorization from $1 billion to $1.4 billion in May, further demonstrating our intent to return cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. As of June 30, we had $241 million remaining on that program. 
A quick comment about the voluntary recall of certain Newport Non-Menthol product last week. As we announced, the company became aware that there was a possibility that some of our products could contain pieces of plastic. We did not find any such plastic in any of our products but could not rule out the theoretical possibility. Out of abundance of caution, we removed all of the products that could've been affected from the supply chain and voluntarily implemented a recall of any of the product that could've reached retail shelves.  We did not experience any significant stock-outs of Newport Non-Menthol at retail, and we do not believe that the one-day interruption of supply had any effect on the positive momentum of the brand.  And the cost of the recall is expected to be insignificant. 
We are pleased with the company's performance this far for this quarter and for 2011 so far. While we expect this to be another outstanding year for Lorillard, I think we can agree that one should not expect EPS growth to continue to approach 20% on a regular and ongoing basis. We do believe, however, that we can continue to outperform the industry, build on our record of success and deliver value for our shareholders over the long term.
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

So the goal is to have a pricing advantage in the beginning, kind of where other introductory brands -- brand introductory prices have been to establish and  establish them and get trial. And that's working beautifully. So let's call it -- in the beginning,  it was a little over $1 discount or around $1 dollar discount, and with this increase, it's about $0.75. But our competitors went up, so instead of being $1 advantage relative to full-priced brands, it's going to be around $0.80, $0.85, which is still pretty attractive.

In the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment, I am extremely pleased to report another very strong quarter for Lorillard.

In the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment, I am extremely pleased to report another very strong quarter for Lorillard. The company's second quarter results continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength of our brands and our organization. 
Let's start with a review of the key fundamentals on the business and how we are proceeding to responsibly bring Newport Pleasure to all adult smokers. First, total domestic Newport volume increased 9.6% versus year ago in Q2 with Newport Menthol domestic volume up 1% for the quarter. This includes what we believe is a relatively minor cannibalization effect from Newport Non-Menthol estimated as a negative 1% drag on the core menthol business. And this is also encouraging, as we reduced Newport Menthol promotion spending in the quarter versus year ago. 
Second, and driving the total Newport increase, was a strong performance by Newport Non-Menthol. Newport Non-Menthol sales are way above our expectations for this point in the launch, crossing the 1% market share level by quarter end. Importantly, the second wave of our source of volume business study conducted in April continues to indicate that the brand's volume is 90% incremental to the Newport franchise; that 2/3 of purchasers claim Newport Non-Menthol as their usual brand; that positive purchase intent is expressed by virtually all purchasers, 96%; and that the primary reason for purchase is the product's taste. This gives us confidence that long term, we can continue to migrate the brand's retail price in line with core Newport Menthol. 
Third, Maverick, our discount brand, continued to make strong gains, increasing 21% versus year ago in the quarter. 
Fourth, we made progress in the quarter with our selectively increased support on Newport Menthol in non-core markets. Four additional markets were added late in the quarter, as we mentioned at our investor conference. And our original test markets continue to experience double-digit volume growth.  That all added to a substantial increase in Lorillard domestic volume of 10.4% or almost 1 billion sticks more than we shipped a year ago. 
Even after adjusting for heightened wholesale inventories in advance of our July 1 price increase, total Lorillard domestic volume increased 8.1% versus year ago. This is especially noteworthy, given the context of high unemployment, high gasoline prices and declining industry sale. We remain highly confident in our recently announced strategic plan, which places its primary focus on organic growth and outperformance relative to our peers in the U.S. cigarette industry.  As always, when our brands outperform the category, we gain market share. And this was the case in Q2.  
At retail, where wholesale inventory fluctuations do not impact the numbers, industry volume was estimated to decline just under 4%. Therefore, according to our proprietary EXCEL database, which measures shipments from wholesale to retail, total Lorillard market share increased to 14.2% or a 140-basis-point increase over the second quarter last year.  
Likewise, total Newport share increased 109 basis points to 12% in Q2. Basically, we held on to the sizable gains achieved into the first quarter, so we gained share versus year ago on total Lorillard; on total Lorillard premium; on total Lorillard discount; on total Newport, including Newport Non-Menthol; on core Newport Menthol; and on Maverick. This was not just the case of a successful new product. Share gains were experienced broadly across our portfolio. 
Strong organic volume growth combined with higher prices net of promotion translated to an 11.3% increase in net sales and a 9.4% operating income increase. This combined with the accretive impact of the company's share repurchase plan, resulted in an 18% year-over-year quarterly gain in earnings per share. EPS finished at $2.05 for the quarter. So obviously, the quality of earnings for the quarter was high.  At the 6-month mark, EPS for Lorillard is up 16.5% versus year ago, making the company one of the top performers in the CPG industry during these difficult economic times.  It also demonstrates that we are not just focused on growth, but has as always been the case, we are focused on profitable growth. 
While we don't necessarily expect this pace of growth to continue in the second half, I think you'd agree we're having a darn good year, especially when you add the dividend yield. In fact, relative to our tobacco peers and the broader group of consumer product goods companies, in general, we are pleased we can deliver outsized top line growth, leverage through our income statement and showcase the strength of our business, despite a difficult macro consumer environment. 
Let's move on now to the regulatory environment, as it relates to Menthol. We made an important organizational move during the quarter which will help shape our relationship with the FDA. Dr. Neil Wilcox joined us as our Senior Vice President of Regulatory Compliance. Neil came most recently from an important position at the FDA. He is very experienced in agency process and policy, and we expect him to provide strong guidance and governance on the regulatory issues that face us. 
Now let's turn to the regulatory events in the quarter and their impact on the company. Although some headlines around several FDA announcements created intra-quarter volatility on our stock price, we see the FDA review process moving, as expected; not faster, not slower. The FDA is conducting a preliminary independent peer-reviewed scientific assessment separate from TPSAC, as they promised they would. We see that as a positive, because, a, we believe that the TPSAC panel was biased, which is obviously why we are engaged in litigation on this topic; b, initial FDA white papers, while they still suffer from some of the same flaws that plagued the TPSAC report, were more balanced than TPSAC; and, c, the peer review process is normal for FDA on this type of issue and is an appropriate first step. 
Of course, our current view depends on the quality of the peer review process and the objectivity of the reviewers selected. We believe a thorough, objective and scientific process is critical. And overall, we haven't changed our opinion that this will be a very long process and that the overwhelming body of scientific evidence does not justify increased regulation on menthol cigarettes relative to non-menthol cigarettes. 
Accordingly, we continue to focus on our business and believe the best reason to invest in Lorillard are industry-leading fundamentals, a strong and growing dividend, balance sheet flexibility that is being used to lower our cost of capital via increased leverage and share repurchases and a strategic plan that clearly identifies growth opportunities within the domestic cigarette market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a double-digit shareholder return, as measured by EPS growth and the dividend yield. And we remain confident in our ability to grow at a level that exceeds our domestic tobacco company peers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the second quarter of 2011 increased 11.3% to $1.7 billion as compared to our second quarter of 2010, driven by the 1",963,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the second quarter of 2011 increased 11.3% to $1.7 billion as compared to our second quarter of 2010, driven by the 10.4% increase in domestic shipment volume.  Our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board but were partially offset by other factors. 
First, unit volumes for Newport were up 9.6%, while Maverick volumes were up 21.2%. As we've reported for the last several quarters, the continuing increase in Maverick unit volumes and the resulting shift in our mix of products sold has the effect of reducing the overall revenues per unit sold. 
Second, shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, which was launched in the fourth quarter of last year, was also a significant factor in the year-over-year comparison. Newport Non-Menthol units carried a promotional price in this year's quarter and, therefore, added to this mix effect on the calculation of net price per unit, if that's calculated on a consolidated basis. This year-over-year effect is not a surprise, nor does it concern us. It does not reflect the deterioration of the price point of our brand. In fact, when I look at the calculations of price realization before excise taxes for Newport Menthol only, they work out to a healthy 5.7% increase for the second quarter. The other factors bring the total down. But as we've said before, this is incremental business for us. It is profitable on its own, and it strengthens our portfolio over the long term. 
Fluctuations in wholesale inventory levels in this year and last year had an effect on our second quarter volume comparison, just like some others in the industry. After adjusting for the effect of a decline in wholesale inventories last year and a build this year, we estimate that our domestic wholesale shipments would have increased 8.1% for the quarter rather than the 10.4%, as reported.  These build in wholesale inventories will reverse itself in the upcoming quarter and will have the obvious effect of dampening our third quarter volume comparison.  
Notably, it will also further impact reported net pricing and profitability in that quarter because of the impact of consumer promotion, much of which follow retail movements, not wholesale movements.  I mention this because I know many of you develop expectations of financial performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, in part, by referring to last year. As you may recall, we reported strong unit volume increases in last year's third quarter, some of which was inflated due to an inventory build in that quarter. The opposite is likely to be true this year. But we believe the underlying trends of our portfolio will continue to be strong. 
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2011 increased by $57 million to $599 million.  Cost of goods sold in the 2011 quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees.  The amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the tobacco grower's assessment increased $45 million compared to last year's second quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $15 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due to legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter, just like it did in our first quarter.  Other increases in SG&A included marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Second quarter operating income increased 9.4% to $487 million from $445 million in last year's second quarter. Operating income is up 9.8% for the first half of 2011.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased 18.5% from last year's second quarter to $2.05 per share. Those results reflect the strong performance we've already discussed but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count, as compared to the year-ago quarter, added $0.14 per share to EPS in this year's second quarter. 
During the quarter, through June 30, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a cost of $494 million under the current share repurchase authorization. The board increased this repurchase authorization from $1 billion to $1.4 billion in May, further demonstrating our intent to return cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. As of June 30, we had $241 million remaining on that program. 
A quick comment about the voluntary recall of certain Newport Non-Menthol product last week. As we announced, the company became aware that there was a possibility that some of our products could contain pieces of plastic. We did not find any such plastic in any of our products but could not rule out the theoretical possibility. Out of an abundance of caution, we removed all of the products that could've been affected from the supply chain and voluntarily implemented a recall of any of the product that could have reached retail shelves.  We did not experience any significant stock-outs of Newport Non-Menthol at retail, and we do not believe that the one-day interruption of supply had any effect on the positive momentum of the brand.  And the cost of the recall is expected to be insignificant. 
We are pleased with the company's performance this far for this quarter and for 2011 so far. While we expect this to be another outstanding year for Lorillard, I think we can agree that one should not expect EPS growth to continue to approach 20% on a regular and ongoing basis. We do believe, however, that we can continue to outperform the industry, build on our record of success and deliver value for our shareholders over the long term.
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

And that's working beautifully. So let's call it -- in the beginning, it was a little over a $1 discount or around a $1 dollar discount, and with this increase, it's about $0.75.

Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fu",1037,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fundamentals were masked by a significant comparative reduction in wholesale inventory, adversely affecting our reported volume growth by just over 400 basis points. But we can't emphasize enough that absent the inventory comparison which was simply a timing issue, our business is measured by retail shipments were there's strong as we've seen all year. This is especially encouraging as we reduced promotional spending versus a year ago on our flagship Newport Menthol brand and our recent round of price increases are all sticking. We also observed no unusual competitive promotional activity during the quarter. So let's take a closer look at third quarter highlights. 
First, total Lorillard domestic volume increased 2.8% versus a year ago in quarter three. Adjusting for inventory fluctuations, total Lorillard domestic volume was up an estimated 7%. This is about the same level of the growth adjusted for inventory changes we saw in the first and second quarters. The point is further illustrated by a look at shipments from wholesale to retail as measured by our proprietary EXCEL database which is unaffected by changes in wholesale inventory. 
Total Lorillard retail shipments were up over 8% versus a year ago in the quarter. Of note, Lorillard discount brand shipments to retail while still up double digits at about 12% actually slowed a little from prior quarters. So the acceleration of our retail shipment and market share growth was driven by our premium brand Newport which grew 8% in total versus a year ago during the quarter, following 5.5% growth in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, I'm referring to retail shipments which are more indicative of consumer purchasing and eliminate the noise from quarter-to-quarter due to inventory swings. 
Given the difficult macro economic environment that continue during the third quarter, we were happy to see such a strong performance on our premium brand. Our premium strength, traced to the incremental volume this year associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch and a very strong quarter and improvement in trend on our flagship Newport Menthol business. Newport Menthol benefited from our geographic expansion plan, which we highlighted during our Investor Day. Both of these initiatives are performing extremely well. Newport Non-Menthol continues to hold just under a 1% share despite our recent 20% price increase which has significantly enhanced profitability on this new brand and Newport Menthol in expansion markets continues to grow double digits. 
It's worth mentioning, as a number of investors are concerned about heightened promotional spending hurting industry pricing power, that even with our investment in these expansion markets, total Newport Menthol promotional spending was down versus year ago for the quarter and it is down for the year. This also includes the increased spending effect of volume previously sold non-promotive on Native American reservations in New York switching to promote in volume in other locations. 
So let me repeat my self, while I can't speak for the rest of the industry, Lorillard has reduced by spending this year and this quarter. We recognize that between mixed and more importantly this quarter, the negative inventory comparison, it is hard to see the impact of pricing. David will try and make this as transparent as possible during his comments. Let me reassure you however, that the price increases we took in July are being fully realized to the income statement. 
Turning to the broader industry. We estimate total industry domestic shipments declined 6.4%, similar to Lorillard, the total industry was negatively affected by inventory fluctuations. We estimate that impact to be about three percentage points. 
As our retail volume grew briskly in a declining industry, Lorillard once again gained share across all market categories. Total Lorillard share was 14.2%, up 1.3 points versus year ago. Total Newport gained 1.1 share point and our discount brands gained 0.3 share point. Total Lorillard share of Menthol was 39.2% up 0.9 share points versus a year ago, our strongest gain all year. Newport share of Menthol was 36.1%, up 0.3 share points versus a year ago, also our strongest gain all year. 
Operating profit for the quarter was down 2.2%. EPS is $1.94 per share was up 7.2%. Operating profit in EPS were obviously negatively affected by the inventory comparison. Keep in mind $400 million non-promoted units, primarily of Newport Menthol is worth about $35 million in operating profit or $0.16 per share. There were no other extraordinary variances in the quarter. 
So while we don't give earnings guidance, this is exactly what we expected. And had we given guidance for the year, we would not, and I repeat myself, would not be changing it right now. Notably, we believe the continued strength in our brand fundamentals combined with wholesale inventories now at more normal levels bode well for a very good fourth quarter. And for the same reasons, we are bullish on 2012 despite the outlook for a challenging 2012 macro economic environment. 
Finally, a brief word on the FDA's review of Menthol. We are currently awaiting the peer review of the FDA's preliminary assessment of the science which is due out shortly. We have no reason to believe that this is anything more than just that, a preliminary review. When it comes out, we will respond appropriately during the comment period. Again, we believe this is just one more step than what we believe will be a very long review process. 
You know our position. The best available scientific evidence does not support an assertion that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impacts the public health. Smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risks. A menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totality or for any demographic group. Furthermore, any. draconian regulation will have real, unintended consequences, including the expansion of a contraband market, a loss of tax revenues and a significant loss of jobs. With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"
4180255,141600488,176194,"Lorillard, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8%",1017,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% increase in wholesale shipment volume. Like last quarter, our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board, but were partially offset by other factors. We spent considerable time on these calls over the last several quarters reviewing the impact of the shift in the mix of our product, as the relatively lower-priced Maverick and Newport Non-Menthol have grown at a more rapid pace than our premium-priced Newport Menthol product. That dynamic impacts the current year's third quarter as well. Newport Non-Menthol and Maverick wholesale volumes in this year's third quarter were greater than the prior year quarter while the rest of our portfolio showed decline. 
Also as we explained in last quarter's call, the impact of fluctuations in wholesale trade inventory levels can be seen in the third quarter's results. To be more specific, even at the risk of being repetitive, we saw strong volumes in last year's third quarter, some of which was aided by a build in wholesale trade inventory in that quarter. In this year's third quarter, we saw the opposite, with wholesale trade inventories declining after building in the second quarter. This was to be expected and the impact on volume comparisons and average net pricing should not surprising. After adjusting for the effect of the increase in wholesale trade inventories last year and the decline this year, we estimate that our wholesale domestic shipments would have increased 7% for the quarter rather than the 2.8% as reported. 
In addition, and as you know, the pattern of consumer promotion buy down programs follows movement at retail, not at wholesale. The cost of these programs are accounted for as a reduction in sales. So in a quarter like this one, they disproportionately impact the consolidated net price comparison to last year. The cost of consumer buy downs in the third quarter was about flat to the second quarter and down from last year's third quarter. We would estimate that the impact of this wholesale trade inventory pattern on a net pricing comparison to last year, calculated on a simple consolidated basis reduced the net price comparison by about 1% in 2011 from 2010. Likewise, the mix effect that I discussed a moment ago amounted to about a 3% reduction in the net price comparison. 
So to summarize, a simple calculation of net price per unit in the third quarter when done on a consolidated basis before excise tax results in a about a 1% per unit increase from last year. That actually is made up of higher realized prices of about 5% across our entire portfolio. However, that 5% was masked by the 3% product mix impact and the 1% impact of the wholesale inventory movement. 
Before percentage point difference in the third quarter unit volume comparisons to last year that arises from that wholesale inventory trade fluctuations would equate to about $75 million in sales and about $35 million in operating income, which more than accounts for the $10 million decline in operating income in the quarter. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we estimate that wholesale trade inventories are closer to one would call normal. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2011 was roughly flat when compared to last year's third quarter. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter reflects increases over last year in certain cost, including increased FDA user fees. Amounts due to the State Settlement Agreements and the tobacco growers assessment increased $20 million compared to last year's third quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative cost increased $7 million from last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter, and marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Third quarter operating income declined 2.2% to $455 million from $465 million in last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, operating income is up 5.5% compared to last year. 
Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 7.2% from last year's third quarter to $1.94 per share. Year-to-date EPS is up 13% compared to last year. The lower share count as compared to the year-ago quarter added $0.18 per share to EPS in this year's third quarter accounting for the increase. 
We accessed the debt market in August, issuing $750 million in senior notes, $500 million in five-year notes at 3.5% and $250 million in 30-year notes at 7%. With this issue, we are close to our stated target of 1.5x EBITDA. We would expect that as our earnings grow, we would access the market again in the future in order to stay close to that ratio. The board would authorize a $750 million share repurchase shortly after we closed the debt transaction. That program is ongoing. 
During the quarter, through September 30, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares at a cost of $438 million under two separate share repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, we had $553 million remaining on the new $750 million program. These actions clearly demonstrate our intent to return cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. 
We are pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for 2011 so far. As Murray indicated, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and vibrant and we remain confident that we can outperform the industry and deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
When we spoke on this call three months ago, we were bullish on our future and we remain so. Nothing in the third quarter has changed our view or our expectations for 2011 volume and earnings nor our outlook beyond that, and we expect to continue the positive momentum that we've experienced thus far in 2011.

And it was down again this quarter, but it wasn't down as much this quarter. It was down prior quarters.  And I think your notes sort of nailed it. You had roughly 4% to 5% of your volume going through Native American reservations completely non-promoted in New York, and we didn't know how that was going to exactly play out, but you see our total volume trends out. So therefore, consumers kept buying the products and they had to move from a non-promotive location to a promotive location. So you had a, it's not a permanent. We'll lap it. But you had this effect of non-promoted volume becoming promoted volume in the quarter. And then the second one that I still think it's hard for all the analysts out there to model that weekend which is based on our go to market design, our buy downs are relatively larger percentage. We have a higher list price and a higher buy down. So when you get a quarter like this, where inventory is reduced, the buy down still fully occur. And when you take that volume, if you don't take out that sort of a deep enough buy down level, you also get a distortion and that's completely timing and it's not real at all. It's just in the modeling. So those two numbers alone in my estimation account for 2/3 of the variance in a model like yours and then we had a couple of small cost things with the recall, and then signing a union contract to get it. So it's not complicated. We took the price increases and those all passed through. We didn't spend back a penny more on it. We just had a couple variables, mostly timing that will work their way through."

I mean, let be just picking up in pieces. It's harder for me to talk to the industry. For Newport Menthol, we took a price increase, our buy downs in total were down versus the year ago and our volume accelerated in the third quarter, so this was one of our strongest if not the strongest all year performances on our premium Newport Menthol brand. It accelerated by a few hundred basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I'm delighted to see that going into what sort of a tough economy and everything that's out there. Our premium brand, it was Maverick that slowed done a little bit. So that's what drove the overall 8% retail consumer takeaway which is our measure -- which is wholesale to retail shipments through EXCEL. But look, we are up about 8% in the first quarter. We're about 8% in the second quarter. We're up about 8% in the third quarter retail. The difference is Maverick slowed a little bit and the different than you already know that Newport Non-Menthol Statesville and the kind of flattish during the quarter, versus the previous quarter so what made the difference up? It was our premium brand. So from a consumer standpoint, we feel very bullish and that all of the things that we've done continue and the fundamentals of our brand, I feel great about the quarter. I wished inventory didn't happen. But I feel good about the quarter in terms of what consumers are purchasing. Our price GAAP strategy is unchanged. We don't like to compete on price. We like to compete with the superior product, rate advertising and fundamental marketing. And when appropriate, carefully launching a new product. So we remain the most expensive cigarette on the market of the traditional premium brands. There's a couple smaller ones. And we try to keep that gap close, but not be the cheapest. For the discount, the deep discount I didn't see anything dramatic I think. I think it was about even in the quarter."

Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fu",1027,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fundamentals were masked by a significant comparative reduction in wholesale inventory, adversely affecting our reported volume growth by just over 400 basis points. But we can't emphasize enough that absent the inventory comparison, which was simply a timing issue, our business, as measured by retail shipments, was as strong as we've seen all year. This is especially encouraging as we reduced promotional spending versus year ago on our flagship Newport Menthol brand, and our recent round of price increases are all sticking. We also observed no unusual competitive promotional activity during the quarter. 
So let's take a closer look at third quarter highlights.  First, total Lorillard domestic volume increased 2.8% versus year ago in quarter 3. Adjusting for inventory fluctuations, total Lorillard domestic volume was up an estimated 7%. This is about the same level of the growth adjusted for inventory changes we saw in the first and second quarters. The point is further illustrated by a look at shipments from wholesale to retail, as measured by our proprietary EXCEL database, which is unaffected by changes in wholesale inventory. 
Total Lorillard retail shipments were up over 8% versus year ago in the quarter. Of note, Lorillard discount brand shipments to retail, while still up double digits at about 12%, actually slowed a little from prior quarters. So the acceleration of our retail shipment and market share growth was driven by our premium brand Newport, which grew 8% in total versus year ago during the quarter, following 5.5% growth in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, I'm referring to retail shipments, which are more indicative of consumer purchasing and eliminate the noise from quarter-to-quarter due to inventory swings.  Given the difficult macro-economic environment that continue during the third quarter, we were happy to see such a strong performance on our premium brand. 
Our premium strength traced to the incremental volume this year associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch and a very strong quarter and improvement in trend on our flagship Newport Menthol business. Newport Menthol benefited from our geographic expansion plan, which we highlighted during our Investor Day. Both of these initiatives are performing extremely well. Newport Non-Menthol continues to hold just under a 1% share despite our recent 20% price increase which has significantly enhanced profitability on this new brand, and Newport Menthol, in expansion markets, continues to grow double digits. 
It's worth mentioning, as a number of investors are concerned about heightened promotional spending hurting industry pricing power, that even with our investment in these expansion markets, total Newport Menthol promotional spending was down versus year ago for the quarter, and it is down for the year. This also includes the increased spending effect of volume previously sold non-promotive on Native American reservations in New York, switching to promoted volumes in other locations. 
So let me repeat my self. While I can't speak for the rest of the industry, Lorillard has reduced by down-spending this year and this quarter. We recognize that between mix, and more importantly this quarter, the negative inventory comparison, it is hard to see the impact of pricing. David will try and make this as transparent as possible during his comments. Let me reassure you, however, that the price increases we took in July are being fully realized to the income statement. 
Turning to the broader industry. We estimate total industry domestic shipments declined 6.4%. Similar to Lorillard, the total industry was negatively affected by inventory fluctuations. We estimate that impact to be about 3 percentage points. 
As our retail volume grew briskly in a declining industry, Lorillard, once again, gained share across all market categories. Total Lorillard share was 14.2%, up 1.3 points versus year ago. Total Newport gained 1.1 share points, and our discount brands gained 0.3 share point. Total Lorillard share of Menthol was 39.2%, up 0.9 share points versus year ago, our strongest gain all year. Newport share of Menthol was 36.1%, up 0.3 share points versus year ago, also our strongest gain all year. 
Operating profit for the quarter was down 2.2%. EPS at $1.94 per share was up 7.2%. Operating profit in EPS were, obviously, negatively affected by the inventory comparison. Keep in mind, $400 million non-promoted units, primarily of Newport Menthol, is worth about $35 million in operating profit or $0.16 per share. There were no other extraordinary variances in the quarter. 
So while we don't give earnings guidance, this is exactly what we expected. And had we given guidance for the year, we would not, and I repeat myself, would not be changing it right now. Notably, we believe the continued strength in our brand fundamentals combined with wholesale inventories now at more normal levels, bode well for a very good fourth quarter. And for these same reasons, we are bullish on 2012 despite the outlook for a challenging 2012 macro-economic environment. 
Finally, a brief word on the FDA's review of Menthol. We are currently awaiting the peer review of the FDA's preliminary assessment of the science, which is due out shortly. We have no reason to believe this is anything more than just that, a preliminary review. When it comes out, we will respond appropriately during the comment period. Again, we believe this is just one more step than what we believe will be a very long review process. 
You know our position. The best available scientific evidence does not support an assertion that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impacts the public health. Smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risks. A menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totality or for any demographic group. Furthermore, any. draconian regulation would have real, unintended consequences, including the expansion of a contraband market, a loss of tax revenues and a significant loss of jobs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"
4180255,141600488,176361,"Lorillard, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for question. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% i",1016,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for question. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% increase in wholesale shipment volume. 
Like last quarter, our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board but were partially offset by other factors. We spent considerable time on these calls over the last several quarters, reviewing the impact of the shift in the mix of our product, as the relatively lower-priced Maverick and Newport Non-Menthol have grown at a more rapid pace than our premium-priced Newport Menthol product. That dynamic impacts the current year's third quarter as well. Newport Non-Menthol and Maverick wholesale volumes, in this year's third quarter, were greater than the prior year quarter, while the rest of our portfolio showed decline. 
Also, as we explained in last quarter's call, the impact of fluctuations in wholesale trade inventory levels can be seen in the third quarter's results. To be more specific, even at the risk of being repetitive, we saw strong volumes in last year's third quarter, some of which was aided by a build in wholesale trade inventory in that quarter. In this year's third quarter, we saw the opposite, with wholesale trade inventories declining after building in the second quarter. This was to be expected, and the impact on volume comparisons and average net pricing should not surprise anyone. After adjusting for the effect of the increase in wholesale trade inventories last year and the decline this year, we estimate that our wholesale domestic shipments would have increased 7% for the quarter, rather than the 2.8% as reported. 
In addition, and as you know, the pattern of consumer promotion buydown programs follows movement at retail, not at wholesale. The cost of these programs are accounted for as a reduction in sales. So in a quarter like this one, they disproportionately impact the consolidated net price comparison to last year. The cost of consumer buydowns in the third quarter was about flat to the second quarter and down from last year's third quarter. We would estimate that the impact of this wholesale trade inventory pattern on a net pricing comparison to last year, calculated on a simple consolidated basis, reduced the net price comparison by about 1% in 2011 from 2010. Likewise, the mix effect that I discussed a moment ago amounted to about a 3% reduction in the net price comparison. 
So to summarize, a simple calculation of net price per unit in the third quarter, when done on a consolidated basis before excise tax, results in a about a 1% per unit increase from last year. That, actually, is made up of higher realized prices of about 5% across our entire portfolio. However, that 5% was masked by the 3% product mix impact and the 1% impact of the wholesale inventory movement. 
The 4 percentage point difference in the third quarter unit volume comparisons to last year that arises from that wholesale inventory trade fluctuations would equate to about $75 million in sales and about $35 million in operating income, which more than accounts for the $10 million decline in operating income in the quarter. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we estimate that wholesale trade inventories are closer to one would call normal. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2011 was roughly flat when compared to last year's third quarter. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the tobacco growers assessment increased $20 million compared to last year's third quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million from last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter and marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Third quarter operating income declined 2.2% to $455 million from $465 million in last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, operating income is up 5.5% compared to last year.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 7.2% from last year's third quarter to $1.94 per share. Year-to-date EPS is up 13% compared to last year. The lower share count as compared to the year-ago quarter added $0.18 per share to EPS in this year's third quarter, accounting for the increase. 
We accessed the debt market in August, issuing $750 million in senior notes, $500 million in 5-year notes at 3 1/2% and $250 million in 30-year notes at 7%. With this issue, we are close to our stated target of 1.5x EBITDA. We would expect that as our earnings grow, we would access the market again in the future in order to stay close to that ratio. The board authorized a $750 million share repurchase shortly after we closed the debt transaction. That program is ongoing. 
During the quarter, through September 30, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares at a cost of $438 million under 2 separate share repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, we had $553 million remaining on the new $750 million program. These actions clearly demonstrate our intent to return cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. 
We're pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for 2011 so far. As Murray indicated, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and vibrant, and we remain confident that we can outperform the industry and deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
When we spoke on this call three months ago, we were bullish on our future, and we remain so. Nothing in the third quarter has changed our view or our expectations for 2011 volume and earnings, nor our outlook beyond that, and we expect to continue the positive momentum that we've experienced thus far in 2011. 
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

And it was down again this quarter, but it wasn't down as much this quarter. It was down prior quarters.  And I think your note sort of nailed it. You had roughly 4% to 5% of your volume going through Native American reservations completely non-promoted in New York. And we didn't know how that was going to exactly play out, but you see our total volume trends out. So therefore, consumers kept buying the products, and they had to move from a non-promoted location to a promoted location. So you had a -- it's not a permanent. We'll lap it. But you had this effect of non-promoted volume becoming promoted volume in the quarter. And then the second one that I still think it's hard for all the analysts out there to model that we can, which is based on our go-to-market design, our buydowns are a relatively larger percentage. We have a higher list price and a higher buydown. So when you get a quarter like this, where inventory is reduced, the buydown still fully occur. And when you take out that volume -- if you don't take out sort of a deep enough buydown level, you also get a distortion, and that's completely timing, and it's not real at all. It's just in the modeling. So those 2 numbers alone, in my estimation, account for 2/3 of the variance in a model like yours. And then we had a couple of small cost things with the recall and signing a new union contract to get it. So it's not complicated. We took the price increases, and those all passed through. We didn't spend back $0.01 more on it. We just had a couple variables, mostly timings that'll work their way through."

Let me just break them up in pieces. It's harder for me to talk to the industry. For Newport Menthol, we took a price increase, our buydowns in total were down versus the year ago and our volume accelerated in the third quarter, so this was one of our strongest if not the strongest all-year performances on our premium Newport Menthol brand. It accelerated by a few hundred basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I'm delighted to see that, right? Going into what, sort of a tough economy and everything that's out there, our premium brands -- it was Maverick that slowed done a little bit. So that's what drove the overall 8% retail consumer takeaway which is our measure -- which is wholesale to retail shipments through EXCEL. But we're -- look, we were up about 8% in the first quarter. We're up about 8% in the second quarter. We're up about 8% in the third quarter retail. The difference is Maverick slowed a little bit, so our retail -- and you already know that Newport Non-Menthol stayed still and the kind of flattish during the quarter versus the previous quarter. So what made the difference up? It was our premium brand. So from a consumer standpoint, we feel very bullish, and that all the things that we've done continue and the fundamentals of our brand. I feel great about the quarter. I wish the inventory didn't happen. But I feel great about the quarter, in terms of what consumers are purchasing. Our price gap strategy is unchanged. We don't like to compete on price. We like to compete with a superior product, right advertising and fundamental marketing, and when appropriate, carefully launching a new product. So we remain the most expensive cigarette on the market of the sort of traditional premium brands. There's a couple smaller ones. And we try to keep that gap close, but not be the cheapest. For the discount -- the deep discount, I didn't see anything dramatic, I think it was about even in the quarter."

Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fundamentals were masked by a significant comparative reduction in wholesale inventory, adversely affecting our reported volume growth by just over 400 basis points. But we can't emphasize enough that absent the inventory comparison, which was simply a timing issue, our business, as measured by retail shipments, was as strong as we've seen all year. This is especially encouraging as we reduced promotional spending versus year ago on our flagship Newport Menthol brand, and our recent round of price increases are all sticking. We also observed no unusual competitive promotional activity during the quarter. 
So let's take a closer look at third quarter highlights.  First, total Lorillard domestic volume increased 2.8% versus year ago in quarter 3. Adjusting for inventory fluctuations, total Lorillard domestic volume was up an estimated 7%. This is about the same level of the growth adjusted for inventory changes we saw in the first and second quarters. The point is further illustrated by a look at shipments from wholesale to retail, as measured by our proprietary Excel database, which is unaffected by changes in wholesale inventory. 
Total Lorillard retail shipments were up over 8% versus year ago in the quarter. Of note, Lorillard discount brand shipments to retail, while still up double digits at about 12%, actually slowed a little from prior quarters. So the acceleration of our retail shipment and market share growth was driven by our premium brand Newport, which grew 8% in total versus year ago during the quarter, following 5.5% growth in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, I'm referring to retail shipments, which are more indicative of consumer purchasing and eliminate the noise from quarter-to-quarter due to inventory swings.  Given the difficult macro-economic environment that continued during the third quarter, we were happy to see such a strong performance on our premium brand. 
Our premium strength traced to the incremental volume this year associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch and a very strong quarter and improvement in trend on our flagship Newport Menthol business. Newport Menthol benefited from our geographic expansion plan, which we highlighted during our Investor Day. Both of these initiatives are performing extremely well. Newport Non-Menthol continues to hold just under a 1% share despite our recent 20% price increase which has significantly enhanced profitability on this new brand, and Newport Menthol, in expansion markets, continues to grow double digits. 
It's worth mentioning, as a number of investors are concerned about heightened promotional spending hurting industry pricing power, that even with our investment in these expansion markets, total Newport Menthol promotional spending was down versus year ago for the quarter, and it is down for the year. This also includes the increased spending effect of volume previously sold non-promotive on Native American reservations in New York, switching to promoted volumes in other locations. 
So let me repeat my self. While I can't speak for the rest of the industry, Lorillard has reduced by down-spending this year and this quarter. We recognize that between mix, and more importantly this quarter, the negative inventory comparison, it is hard to see the impact of pricing. David will try and make this as transparent as possible during his comments. Let me reassure you, however, that the price increases we took in July are being fully realized to the income statement. 
Turning to the broader industry. We estimate total industry domestic shipments declined 6.4%. Similar to Lorillard, the total industry was negatively affected by inventory fluctuations. We estimate that impact to be about three percentage points. 
As our retail volume grew briskly in a declining industry, Lorillard, once again, gained share across all market categories. Total Lorillard share was 14.2%, up 1.3 points versus year ago. Total Newport gained 1.1 share points, and our discount brands gained 0.3 share point. Total Lorillard share of Menthol was 39.2%, up 0.9 share points versus year ago, our strongest gain all year. Newport share of Menthol was 36.1%, up 0.3 share points versus year ago, also our strongest gain all year. 
Operating profit for the quarter was down 2.2%. EPS at $1.94 per share was up 7.2%. Operating profit in EPS were, obviously, negatively affected by the inventory comparison. Keep in mind, $400 million non-promoted units, primarily of Newport Menthol, is worth about $35 million in operating profit or $0.16 per share. There were no other extraordinary variances in the quarter. 
So while we don't give earnings guidance, this is exactly what we expected. And had we given guidance for the year, we would not, and I repeat myself, would not be changing it right now. Notably, we believe the continued strength in our brand fundamentals combined with wholesale inventories now at more normal levels, bode well for a very good fourth quarter. And for these same reasons, we are bullish on 2012 despite the outlook for a challenging 2012 macroeconomic environment. 
Finally, a brief word on the FDA's review of Menthol. We are currently awaiting the peer review of the FDA's preliminary assessment of the science, which is due out shortly. We have no reason to believe this is anything more than just that, a preliminary review. When it comes out, we will respond appropriately during the comment period. Again, we believe this is just one more step than what we believe will be a very long review process. 
You know our position. The best available scientific evidence does not support an assertion that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impacts the public health. Smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risks. A menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totality or for any demographic group. Furthermore, any. draconian regulation would have real, unintended consequences, including the expansion of a contraband market, a loss of tax revenues and a significant loss of jobs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"

I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for question. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% i",1016,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for question. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% increase in wholesale shipment volume. 
Like last quarter, our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board but were partially offset by other factors. We spent considerable time on these calls over the last several quarters, reviewing the impact of the shift in the mix of our product, as the relatively lower-priced Maverick and Newport Non-Menthol have grown at a more rapid pace than our premium-priced Newport Menthol product. That dynamic impacts the current year's third quarter as well. Newport Non-Menthol and Maverick wholesale volumes, in this year's third quarter, were greater than the prior year quarter, while the rest of our portfolio showed decline. 
Also, as we explained in last quarter's call, the impact of fluctuations in wholesale trade inventory levels can be seen in the third quarter's results. To be more specific, even at the risk of being repetitive, we saw strong volumes in last year's third quarter, some of which was aided by a build in wholesale trade inventory in that quarter. In this year's third quarter, we saw the opposite, with wholesale trade inventories declining after building in the second quarter. This was to be expected, and the impact on volume comparisons and average net pricing should not surprise anyone. After adjusting for the effect of the increase in wholesale trade inventories last year and the decline this year, we estimate that our wholesale domestic shipments would have increased 7% for the quarter, rather than the 2.8% as reported. 
In addition, and as you know, the pattern of consumer promotion buydown programs follows movement at retail, not at wholesale. The costs of these programs are accounted for as a reduction in sales. So in a quarter like this one, they disproportionately impact the consolidated net price comparison to last year. The cost of consumer buydowns in the third quarter was about flat to the second quarter and down from last year's third quarter. We would estimate that the impact of this wholesale trade inventory pattern on the net pricing comparison to last year, calculated on a simple consolidated basis, reduced the net price comparison by about 1% in 2011 from 2010. Likewise, the mix effect that I discussed a moment ago amounted to about a 3% reduction in the net price comparison. 
So to summarize, a simple calculation of net price per unit in the third quarter, when done on a consolidated basis before excise tax, results in a about a 1% per unit increase from last year. That, actually, is made up of higher realized prices of about 5% across our entire portfolio. However, that 5% was masked by the 3% product mix impact and the 1% impact of the wholesale inventory movement. 
The four percentage point difference in the third quarter unit volume comparisons to last year that arises from that wholesale inventory trade fluctuations would equate to about $75 million in sales and about $35 million in operating income, which more than accounts for the $10 million decline in operating income in the quarter. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we estimate that wholesale trade inventories are closer to one would call normal. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2011 was roughly flat when compared to last year's third quarter. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the tobacco growers assessment increased $20 million compared to last year's third quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million from last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter and marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Third quarter operating income declined 2.2% to $455 million from $465 million in last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, operating income is up 5.5% compared to last year.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 7.2% from last year's third quarter to $1.94 per share. Year-to-date EPS is up 13% compared to last year. The lower share count as compared to the year-ago quarter added $0.18 per share to EPS in this year's third quarter, accounting for the increase. 
We accessed the debt market in August, issuing $750 million in senior notes, $500 million in 5-year notes at 3 1/2% and $250 million in 30-year notes at 7%. With this issue, we are close to our stated target of 1.5x EBITDA. We would expect that as our earnings grow, we would access the market again in the future in order to stay close to that ratio. The board authorized a $750 million share repurchase shortly after we closed the debt transaction. That program is ongoing. 
During the quarter, through September 30, we repurchased approximately four million shares at a cost of $438 million under two separate share repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, we had $553 million remaining on the new $750 million program. These actions clearly demonstrate our intent to return cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. 
We're pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for 2011 so far. As Murray indicated, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and vibrant, and we remain confident that we can outperform the industry and deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
When we spoke on this call three months ago, we were bullish on our future, and we remain so. Nothing in the third quarter has changed our view or our expectations for 2011 volume and earnings, nor our outlook beyond that, and we expect to continue the positive momentum that we've experienced thus far in 2011. 
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

And it was down again this quarter, but it wasn't down as much this quarter. It was down prior quarters.  And I think your note sort of nailed it. You had roughly 4% to 5% of your volume going through Native American reservations completely non-promoted in New York. And we didn't know how that was going to exactly play out, but you see our total volume trends out. So therefore, consumers kept buying the products, and they had to move from a non-promoted location to a promoted location. So you had a -- it's not a permanent. We'll lap it. But you had this effect of non-promoted volume becoming promoted volume in the quarter. And then the second one that I still think it's hard for all the analysts out there to model that we can, which is based on our go-to-market design, our buydowns are a relatively larger percentage. We have a higher list price and a higher buydown. So when you get a quarter like this, where inventory is reduced, the buydowns still fully occur. And when you take out that volume -- if you don't take out at sort of a deep enough buydown level, you also get a distortion, and that's completely timing, and it's not real at all. It's just in the modeling. So those 2 numbers alone, in my estimation, account for 2/3 of the variance in a model like yours. And then we had a couple of small cost things with the recall and signing a new union contract to get it. So it's not complicated. We took the price increases, and those all passed through. We didn't spend back $0.01 more on it. We just had a couple variables, mostly timings that'll work their way through."

We're in about 8 markets. That's the bulk of the volume, so don't expect another big increase in spending coming there. Either, they're growing double digits. We've already lapped 2 of those markets.

Let me just break them up in pieces. It's harder for me to talk to the industry. For Newport Menthol, we took a price increase, our buydowns in total were down versus the year ago and our volume accelerated in the third quarter, so this was one of our strongest if not the strongest all-year performances on our premium Newport Menthol brand. It accelerated by a few hundred basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I'm delighted to see that, right? Going into what, sort of a tough economy and everything that's out there, our premium brands -- it was Maverick that slowed down a little bit. So that's what drove the overall 8% retail consumer takeaway which is our measure -- which is wholesale to retail shipments through Excel. But we're -- look, we were up about 8% in the first quarter. We're up about 8% in the second quarter. We're up about 8% in the third quarter retail. The difference is Maverick slowed a little bit, so our retail -- and you already know that Newport Non-Menthol stayed still and the kind of flattish during the quarter versus the previous quarter. So what made the difference up? It was our premium brand. So from a consumer standpoint, we feel very bullish, and that all the things that we've done continue and the fundamentals of our brand. I feel great about the quarter. I wish the inventory didn't happen. But I feel great about the quarter, in terms of what consumers are purchasing. Our price gap strategy is unchanged. We don't like to compete on price. We like to compete with a superior product, right advertising and fundamental marketing, and when appropriate, carefully launching a new product. So we remain the most expensive cigarette on the market of the sort of traditional premium brands. There's a couple smaller ones. And we try to keep that gap close, but not be the cheapest. For the discount -- the deep discount, I didn't see anything dramatic, I think it was about even in the quarter."

Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fu",1026,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Lorillard's third quarter played out just as we expected and just as we said it would during our last conference call. I'm pleased to report that very strong fundamentals continue. We acknowledged that strong fundamentals were masked by a significant comparative reduction in wholesale inventory, adversely affecting our reported volume growth by just over 400 basis points. But we can't emphasize enough that absent the inventory comparison, which was simply a timing issue, our business, as measured by retail shipments, was as strong as we've seen all year. This is especially encouraging as we reduced promotional spending versus year ago on our flagship Newport Menthol brand, and our recent round of price increases are all sticking. We also observed no unusual competitive promotional activity during the quarter. 
So let's take a closer look at third quarter highlights.  First, total Lorillard domestic volume increased 2.8% versus year ago in quarter 3. Adjusting for inventory fluctuations, total Lorillard domestic volume was up an estimated 7%. This is about the same level of the growth adjusted for inventory changes we saw in the first and second quarters. The point is further illustrated by a look at shipments from wholesale to retail, as measured by our proprietary Excel database, which is unaffected by changes in wholesale inventory. 
Total Lorillard retail shipments were up over 8% versus year ago in the quarter. Of note, Lorillard discount brand shipments to retail, while still up double digits at about 12%, actually slowed a little from prior quarters. So the acceleration of our retail shipment and market share growth was driven by our premium brand Newport, which grew 8% in total versus year ago during the quarter, following 5.5% growth in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, I'm referring to retail shipments, which are more indicative of consumer purchasing and eliminate the noise from quarter-to-quarter due to inventory swings.  Given the difficult macro-economic environment that continued during the third quarter, we were happy to see such a strong performance on our premium brand. 
Our premium strength traced to the incremental volume this year associated with the Newport Non-Menthol launch and a very strong quarter and improvement in trend on our flagship Newport Menthol business. Newport Menthol benefited from our geographic expansion plan, which we highlighted during our Investor Day. Both of these initiatives are performing extremely well. Newport Non-Menthol continues to hold just under a 1% share despite our recent 20% price increase which has significantly enhanced profitability on this new brand, and Newport Menthol, in expansion markets, continues to grow double digits. 
It's worth mentioning, as a number of investors are concerned about heightened promotional spending hurting industry pricing power, that even with our investment in these expansion markets, total Newport Menthol promotional spending was down versus year ago for the quarter, and it is down for the year. This also includes the increased spending effect of volume previously sold non-promotive on Native American reservations in New York, switching to promoted volumes in other locations. 
So let me repeat myself. While I can't speak for the rest of the industry, Lorillard has reduced by down-spending this year and this quarter. We recognize that between mix, and more importantly this quarter, the negative inventory comparison, it is hard to see the impact of pricing. David will try and make this as transparent as possible during his comments. Let me reassure you, however, that the price increases we took in July are being fully realized to the income statement. 
Turning to the broader industry. We estimate total industry domestic shipments declined 6.4%. Similar to Lorillard, the total industry was negatively affected by inventory fluctuations. We estimate that impact to be about 3 percentage points. 
As our retail volume grew briskly in a declining industry, Lorillard, once again, gained share across all market categories. Total Lorillard share was 14.2%, up 1.3 points versus year ago. Total Newport gained 1.1 share points, and our discount brands gained 0.3 share point. Total Lorillard share of Menthol was 39.2%, up 0.9 share points versus year ago, our strongest gain all year. Newport share of Menthol was 36.1%, up 0.3 share points versus year ago, also our strongest gain all year. 
Operating profit for the quarter was down 2.2%. EPS at $1.94 per share was up 7.2%. Operating profit in EPS were, obviously, negatively affected by the inventory comparison. Keep in mind, $400 million non-promoted units, primarily of Newport Menthol, is worth about $35 million in operating profit or $0.16 per share. There were no other extraordinary variances in the quarter. 
So while we don't give earnings guidance, this is exactly what we expected. And had we given guidance for the year, we would not, and I repeat myself, would not be changing it right now. Notably, we believe the continued strength in our brand fundamentals combined with wholesale inventories now at more normal levels, bode well for a very good fourth quarter. And for these same reasons, we are bullish on 2012 despite the outlook for a challenging 2012 macroeconomic environment. 
Finally, a brief word on the FDA's review of Menthol. We are currently awaiting the peer review of the FDA's preliminary assessment of the science, which is due out shortly. We have no reason to believe this is anything more than just that, a preliminary review. When it comes out, we will respond appropriately during the comment period. Again, we believe this is just one more step than what we believe will be a very long review process. 
You know our position. The best available scientific evidence does not support an assertion that menthol and cigarettes negatively or disproportionately impacts the public health. Smoking has serious risks, but menthol does not contribute to those risks. A menthol cigarette is just another cigarette and should be regulated no differently in totality or for any demographic group. Furthermore, any. draconian regulation would have real, unintended consequences, including the expansion of a contraband market, a loss of tax revenues and a significant loss of jobs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"

I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for question. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% i",1016,"Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly discuss the numbers, and then we'll open the line for question. Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased 3.5% to $1.622 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by the 2.8% increase in wholesale shipment volume. 
Like last quarter, our average wholesale selling prices in the quarter were higher across the board but were partially offset by other factors. We spent considerable time on these calls over the last several quarters, reviewing the impact of the shift in the mix of our product, as the relatively lower-priced Maverick and Newport Non-Menthol have grown at a more rapid pace than our premium-priced Newport Menthol product. That dynamic impacts the current year's third quarter as well. Newport Non-Menthol and Maverick wholesale volumes, in this year's third quarter, were greater than the prior year quarter, while the rest of our portfolio showed decline. 
Also, as we explained in last quarter's call, the impact of fluctuations in wholesale trade inventory levels can be seen in the third quarter's results. To be more specific, even at the risk of being repetitive, we saw strong volumes in last year's third quarter, some of which was aided by a build in wholesale trade inventory in that quarter. In this year's third quarter, we saw the opposite, with wholesale trade inventories declining after building in the second quarter. This was to be expected, and the impact on volume comparisons and average net pricing should not surprise anyone. After adjusting for the effect of the increase in wholesale trade inventories last year and the decline this year, we estimate that our wholesale domestic shipments would have increased 7% for the quarter, rather than the 2.8% as reported. 
In addition, and as you know, the pattern of consumer promotion buydown programs follows movement at retail, not at wholesale. The costs of these programs are accounted for as a reduction in sales. So in a quarter like this one, they disproportionately impact the consolidated net price comparison to last year. The cost of consumer buydowns in the third quarter was about flat to the second quarter and down from last year's third quarter. We would estimate that the impact of this wholesale trade inventory pattern on the net pricing comparison to last year, calculated on a simple consolidated basis, reduced the net price comparison by about 1% in 2011 from 2010. Likewise, the mix effect that I discussed a moment ago amounted to about a 3% reduction in the net price comparison. 
So to summarize, a simple calculation of net price per unit in the third quarter, when done on a consolidated basis before excise tax, results in a about a 1% per unit increase from last year. That, actually, is made up of higher realized prices of about 5% across our entire portfolio. However, that 5% was masked by the 3% product mix impact and the 1% impact of the wholesale inventory movement. 
The 4 percentage point difference in the third quarter unit volume comparisons to last year that arises from that wholesale inventory trade fluctuations would equate to about $75 million in sales and about $35 million in operating income, which more than accounts for the $10 million decline in operating income in the quarter. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we estimate that wholesale trade inventories are closer to one would call normal. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2011 was roughly flat when compared to last year's third quarter. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter reflects increases over last year in certain costs, including increased FDA user fees. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and the tobacco growers assessment increased $20 million compared to last year's third quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million from last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, legal fees and expenses associated with increased litigation activity during the quarter and marketing and other costs associated with our strategic initiatives, including the continuing brand-building costs in support of Newport Non-Menthol. 
Third quarter operating income declined 2.2% to $455 million from $465 million in last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, operating income is up 5.5% compared to last year.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 7.2% from last year's third quarter to $1.94 per share. Year-to-date EPS is up 13% compared to last year. The lower share count as compared to the year-ago quarter added $0.18 per share to EPS in this year's third quarter, accounting for the increase. 
We accessed the debt market in August, issuing $750 million in senior notes, $500 million in 5-year notes at 3 1/2% and $250 million in 30-year notes at 7%. With this issue, we are close to our stated target of 1.5x EBITDA. We would expect that as our earnings grow, we would access the market again in the future in order to stay close to that ratio. The board authorized a $750 million share repurchase shortly after we closed the debt transaction. That program is ongoing. 
During the quarter, through September 30, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares at a cost of $438 million under 2 separate share repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, we had $553 million remaining on the new $750 million program. These actions clearly demonstrate our intent to return cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. 
We're pleased with the company's performance this quarter and for 2011 so far. As Murray indicated, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and vibrant, and we remain confident that we can outperform the industry and deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
When we spoke on this call 3 months ago, we were bullish on our future, and we remain so. Nothing in the third quarter has changed our view or our expectations for 2011 volume and earnings, nor our outlook beyond that, and we expect to continue the positive momentum that we've experienced thus far in 2011. 
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

And it was down again this quarter, but it wasn't down as much this quarter. It was down prior quarters.  And I think your note sort of nailed it. You had roughly 4% to 5% of your volume going through Native American reservations completely non-promoted in New York. And we didn't know how that was going to exactly play out, but you see our total volume trends out. So therefore, consumers kept buying the products, and they had to move from a non-promoted location to a promoted location. So you had a -- it's not a permanent. We'll lap it. But you had this effect of non-promoted volume becoming promoted volume in the quarter. And then the second one that I still think it's hard for all the analysts out there to model that we can, which is based on our go-to-market design, our buydowns are a relatively larger percentage. We have a higher list price and a higher buydown. So when you get a quarter like this, where inventory is reduced, the buydowns still fully occur. And when you take out that volume -- if you don't take out at sort of a deep enough buydown level, you also get a distortion, and that's completely timing, and it's not real at all. It's just in the modeling. So those 2 numbers alone, in my estimation, account for 2/3 of the variance in a model like yours. And then we had a couple of small cost things with the recall and signing a new union contract to get it. So it's not complicated. We took the price increases, and those all passed through. We didn't spend back $0.01 more on it. We just had a couple variables, mostly timings that'll work their way through."

Let me just break them up in pieces. It's harder for me to talk to the industry. For Newport Menthol, we took a price increase, our buydowns in total were down versus the year ago and our volume accelerated in the third quarter, so this was one of our strongest if not the strongest all-year performances on our premium Newport Menthol brand. It accelerated by a few hundred basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I'm delighted to see that, right? Going into what, sort of a tough economy and everything that's out there, our premium brands -- it was Maverick that slowed down a little bit. So that's what drove the overall 8% retail consumer takeaway which is our measure -- which is wholesale to retail shipments through Excel. But we're -- look, we were up about 8% in the first quarter. We're up about 8% in the second quarter. We're up about 8% in the third quarter retail. The difference is Maverick slowed a little bit, so our retail -- and you already know that Newport Non-Menthol stayed still and the kind of flattish during the quarter versus the previous quarter. So what made the difference up? It was our premium brand. So from a consumer standpoint, we feel very bullish, and that all the things that we've done continue and the fundamentals of our brand. I feel great about the quarter. I wish the inventory didn't happen. But I feel great about the quarter, in terms of what consumers are purchasing. Our price gap strategy is unchanged. We don't like to compete on price. We like to compete with a superior product, right advertising and fundamental marketing, and when appropriate, carefully launching a new product. So we remain the most expensive cigarette on the market of the sort of traditional premium brands. There's a couple smaller ones. And we try to keep that gap close, but not be the cheapest. For the discount -- the deep discount, I didn't see anything dramatic, I think it was about even in the quarter."
