We achieved healthy growth on the top line and delivered record free cash flow.

We achieved healthy growth on the top line and delivered record free cash flow. At the same time, we enhanced our products and services, increased the sophistication of our marketing and accelerated the growth of our Commercial business.
We also delivered on our shareholder-oriented capital allocation strategy. We returned more than $570 million through our dividend in 2010, and we have spent roughly three quarters of $1 billion on a repurchase of our own shares since November. In addition, this morning, we announced an increase of 20% to our quarterly dividend. This increase is yet another signal of our confidence in our business, and reinforces our focus on returning capital to our shareholders while continuing to invest in long-term growth.
We also made a lot of progress in our product offerings. We completed the deployment of video switches, enabling a dramatic increase in the availability of HD channels across our footprint. We launched Look Back, providing our digital customers with on-demand access to three days of programming on 59 networks, using our network DVR technology.
At the same time, we made our movies On-Demand offering even more attractive by doubling the day and date availability of new titles. We invested in a wireless broadband offering in 2010. The investment is allowing us, providing us with key insights into the operation of a wireless business and how it fits with our wireline business.
In 2010, we continued our ongoing efforts to build a more vast marketing tools and additional analytical capabilities. Specifically, last year, we introduced a more sophisticated pricing regime. And our first products targeted at specific customer segments. We launched Signature Home broadly across our footprint in December, and we are currently engaged in trials of TV Essentials in New York City and Northeast Ohio. We expect this to be the first in a series of products designed to more closely fit the individual needs of our customers.
Now turning to 2011. We entered the new year with aggressive plans, and we're optimistic about our prospects, although weakness in employment and occupied housing will continue to provide a headwind. Competition isn't new to our business, and we expect continuing competitive pressures from the telephone and satellite companies in 2011. But with better products and better marketing than we've ever had before, we are ready.
On the regulatory front, we'll continue to press for reform and retransmission consent where 20 year old statutes effectively tipped the competitive skills on the broadcasters' favor. Regarding broadband regulation, we're pleased that we've avoided title II reclassification. However, many parties at both ends of the political spectrum remain unsatisfied, and we expect this issue to remain in the news.
I am really excited about our rapid progress in harnessing the power of consumer electronics devices to give our customers a better experience and more control as they use our services. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we demonstrated our ability to deliver video directly to IP-connected devices, such a smart TVs, tablets and Blu-Ray players, all without the need for set-top boxes. This ability to deliver TV to virtually any device in the home is a logical extension of our video product. We expect to launch this capability in the coming months.
For years, our video user interface has been constrained by the limited capabilities of set-top boxes. By taking advantage of more powerful consumer electronics devices, we can offer a much more compelling navigation experience, one that offers more functionality and is more aesthetically pleasing than anything we've done in the past. Perhaps most important, we're building processes that will enable us to rapidly update user interface and response to customer feedback. We believe the ability to deliver video to all the screens in the home, a much improved user interface and all that, coupled with TV Everywhere capability, will address many of the perceived advantages over the top video offerings.
There's tremendous value in our broadband network. Our customers continue to use it for new applications, and they're demonstrating that they're willing to pay more as they see utility in their lives expand. In the year ahead, we'll continue to invest in the network's capabilities in a variety of ways, including expansion of our DOCSIS 3.0 footprint, so that we can continue to be the best in class broadband provider.
Our broadband network is also a flexible platform for new products, coupled with our installation and call center expertise that provides us with an opportunity to enter the home monitoring and security business. We've actually been in the security business in parts of our footprint for many years. But recent advancements in technology have made the application much more interesting. We've trained installers in several cities, and this week, we began taking orders for our smart home security product as part of a soft launch. We used to the feedback we get from the early customers to fine-tune our product and process, and we expect to launch this product broadly across our footprint later this year.
In the Commercial space, we are pleased that we grew revenues by more than 20%, breaking through the $1 billion level for the first time in 2010. However, we are not resting on our laurels, and we think we have the opportunity to create a lot more growth, both through the sale of existing products and by exploring new products and new segments.
In summary, 2010 was a year of new products, accelerated growth and record free cash flow. We look forward to the challenges and opportunities of the new year, as we strive to better serve our customers and continue our quest to be the open, transparent, shareholder friendly company that our owners expect.
I want to acknowledge the terrific job that Rob has gone as our CFO in the past three years. I have full confidence in him as he takes on the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. For the next several months, as we conduct the search for his successor as CFO, Rob will do double duty. So now let me turn it over to Rob, who will give you some additional details on the financial performance."

As Glenn said, 2010 was a really good year for Time Warner Cable. We grew full year revenues by over 5.5%, as Residential subscription revenues increased nearly 4%, while Commercial and Advertising revenues each jumped over 20%. Adjusted OIBDA growth accelerated to nearly 6% in 2010, reflecting our strong revenue growth and slightly higher margins.
Operating income was up over 11%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased 21%, and free cash flow was up over 19% to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share.
Diluted EPS increased over 19% to $3.64, exceeding what we projected at the beginning of the year. True to our commitment, we continue to actively manage our balance sheet. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders during 2010, paying cash dividends of $576 million and repurchasing $515 million of our common stock. And demonstrating our confidence in our business, this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share or $1.92 on an annualized basis.
Let's move on to Q4 subscriber trends in the next slide. Before I get into the numbers, let me say a few words about the environment in which we are operating. While we've seen some modest improvement and certain macroeconomic indicators in several of our regions, overall, we continue to feel the effects of weak housing and high unemployment across our footprint. The competitive landscape also remained pretty much the same in Q4. The telcos continued their fiber build-outs, but probably at the slowest pace we've seen since they began.
We estimate that Uverse is now marketing video to about 24% of our footprint and FiOS to about 10%. Marketing and promotional intensity among our telco satellite competitors was pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. For our part, we broadly executed in our 33-by-3 Triple Play marketing program, targeting both new and existing customers.
So let's turn to sub performance. We added 94,000 high-speed data subscribers in the quarter, bringing total HSD subscriber base to over 9.8 million or 35% of passings. That's a five 5.5% year-over-year increase in our HSD sub base. Our Residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve, as customers continue to choose our higher-speed tiers. We added 147,000 and 5,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And for the first time this quarter, our total and turbo and Wideband subs combined exceeded our aggregate basic and Lightyear customers.
Commercial HSD net adds were 11,000, which was more than 5x year-ago net adds.
As I've previewed on our third quarter call, Digital Phone adds rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, as we more aggressively marketed the triple play bundle. Total Digital Phone net adds were 72,000 and we ended the quarter would almost 4.5 million total voice subscribers, 16.7% of homes passed and a 6.5% increase from the end of 2009.
We had 11,000 Business Class Phone net adds in the quarter, for a total of 111,000. That's more than double the number of subs we had 18 months ago.
Video subscriber performance continued to be impacted by the challenging competitive and economic environment. For the quarter, we had a net decline of 141,000 video subscribers. The videos sub decline were once again driven by losses in analog, Single Play video customers. Actually, net additions for both digital video subscribers and bundled video subscribers were positive during the quarter. In addition, there were some signs of life in the pay TV category, as we added 77,000 pay units. That's the first growth in pay units we've experienced in 10 quarters.
Demand for the DVR also picked up in Q4. Net adds of 47,000 were significantly better than in Q3.
Primary service unit net adds were a positive 25,000 for the quarter, an improvement from the third quarter loss. PSU churn was flat year-over-year. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on getting customers into bundles and had 72,000 Triple Play net adds during Q4, up from 64,000 in last year's fourth quarter. At quarter end, just under 60% of our customers were either double or triple plays. Once again, we fared much better with our more affluent customers, our highest income segments drove in at gains triple plays, while our lower income segments accounted for most of the declines in singles and doubles.
Despite the challenging economic and competitive environment, full year 2010 PS unit additions were 344,000, with 515,000 HSD net adds and 278,000 Digital Phone net adds, offset by 449,000 video net losses.
So far, this January's subperformance looks a lot like January of 2010. But remember that the bulk of the net adds last year occurred in February and March, so it's still really early to project Q1 subs.
Let's turn to our financial results and start with revenue on the next slide. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, and full year revenue increased 5.6% to $18.9 billion. During the fourth quarter, total subscription revenue, that's Residential and Commercial combined, grew 4.6%, driven by increased PSUs and a 3.1% increase in subscription ARPU per PSU. Advertising revenue increased nearly 34%. In dollar terms, total revenues was $269 million higher than in Q4 '09, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential subscription business, $68 million coming from Advertising and $56 million coming from Commercial.
Let's first focus on Residential subscription revenue on Slide 6. Fourth quarter Residential subscription revenue grew by 3.5% and full -year Residential subsequent revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year with both driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year Residential subscription revenue growth in Q4, HSD contributed 60% or $87 million, with video and Digital Phone contributing 25% and 15%, respectively.
Year-over-year Residential HSD revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, culminating a Q4 growth of 8.7% over last year's fourth quarter. The growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a year-over-year increase of close to 3% in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we benefited from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I talked about earlier. Residential video revenue increased as a result of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by the decline in video subs. Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q4 '09. Residential voice revenue grew 4.5%, due to continued subscriber growth. Year-over-year ARPU declined just 1.2%, which was the smallest decline in the last couple of years. On a sequential basis, Residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to Commercial revenue on the next slide. We are very pleased with the progress we made in our Commercial business in 2010. We set out delivers commercial subscription revenue growth of more than 20% for the year, and we did just that. Fourth quarter Commercial revenue was just under $300 million, a 23% increase over Q4 '09, marking the highest growth quarter of the year. Full year Commercial revenue was more than $1.1 billion, up 21.1% versus 2009. Each of Commercial data, business class phone and cell tower backhaul contributed about 30% of the $56 million year-over-year revenue improvement in the fourth quarter, with video revenue accounted for the balance. Commercial data revenue increased almost 13%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Business Class Phone revenue increased nearly 73%, driven by subscriber growth, and cell tower backhaul revenue in the fourth quarter was $26 million. That's as much cell backhaul revenue as we generated for all of 2009.
As of quarter end, our total installed base was 6,100 radios, and we had a meaningful backlog of radios under contract.
We continue to make investments in our Commercial capabilities throughout the year. And in 2011, we are focused on continuing to improve sales productivity and increasing service ability to expand the number of commercial establishments we reach. We expect these investments to enable us to continue to drive Commercial revenue growth in 2011 at a rate similar to what we achieved in 2010.
Moving to the next slide. We had a terrific year in Advertising topped off by a fourth quarter in which we generated an all-time high $269 million in ad revenue, up 33.8% over Q4 of 2009 and up 39% on a per video subscriber basis. Full year ad revenues of $881 million were 25.5% greater than in 2009.
Strong political advertising certainly helped the cause. We generated $42 million in political Advertising in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Political accounted for half the growth in the quarter and about 30% of the growth for the full year. That said, nonpolitical advertising revenues grew strongly in their own right, up around 18% for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, the automotive category generated a little over $50 million, and media advertising added about $45 million, both jumping while over 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we they began to benefit from our new ad rep deal with FiOS, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in the New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas markets in exchange for a percentage of the revenue generated. We expect that the FiOS deal and others like it would increasingly contribute to ad revenues in 2011. As we look forward, given strength in our core advertising business and our new ad deals, we do expect that we'll be able to grow ad revenues in 2011, despite the usual non-election year falloff in Advertising'
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 9. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 1.6% to $1.7 billion, and full year Adjusted OIBDA increased 5.9% to $6.9 billion, right in line with what we projected on our last Earnings Call. Full year margins improved 10 basis points.
Total fourth quarter operating expenses grew 8.5% compared to fourth quarter of 2009. The growth in OpEx and the resulting margin contraction and slowdown in adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter were driven by a number of items that I'll walk you through, several of which I've mentioned previously. First, bad debt expense was up in the quarter due to the reversal of a reserve in Q4 '09, which significantly lowered bad debt in that quarter. Similarly, casualty insurance expense increased year-over-year due to a favorable adjustment to casualty insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, fourth quarter employee expense was increased by an executive severance charge. Additionally, fourth quarter cost of revenues increased due to the reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. And finally, as expected, wireless losses and programming expenses grew faster in the fourth quarter than they did in prior quarters.
In aggregate, these items accounted for a $90 million swing in year-over-year adjusted OIBDA.
Programming expense increased 7.2% for the quarter, as video subscriber declines only partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental retrans costs. Remember that Q4 was the first full quarter under our new Disney contract. For the full year, programming costs increased 5.4% in aggregate and 8.2% on a per subscriber basis. We expect total programming cost growth will be in the same ballpark in 2011.
Employee costs were up 3.9% year-over-year in Q4, reflecting higher commercial headcount and compensation expenses and the executive severance cost I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter marketing expense of $166 million was $11 million higher than last year. Marketing spending for the fourth quarter and the full-year remained fairly constant at about 3.5% of revenues. Voice costs were up 5.5% due to growth in digital phone subscribers. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. The financial benefits of this process will flow in as our digital phone subscribers are migrated to the new platform over the next several years. When we're all done, we expect to see our voice costs cut roughly in half.
We continue to invest in wireless in Q4. As of today, we're offering our wireless data service in almost 3/4 of our footprint and we have almost 15,000 subscribers. Still early days, but as Glenn mentioned, we're gaining key insights into the wireless business, as well as the wireless needs and desires of our customers. Q4 wireless losses were approximately $20 million, and full-year losses were around $50 million. In 2011, we plan to continue investing in wireless, as well as several other new initiatives, including, as Glenn mentioned, our smart home security offering. We expect our total 2011 startup losses from wireless, home security and other new business projects to be in the $75 million range.
Before I move on to CapEx, I should note that operating income for the quarter increased 11.6% to $994 million, driven by higher adjusted OIBDA and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense. For the full year, operating income grew 11.2% to $3.7 billion. Looking forward to 2011, we expect once again to generate double-digit operating income growth.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to make great strides in enhancing our products and services in 2010. We completed the rollout of Switch Digital, launched Look Back across our footprint, deployed over 1.5 million HD set-top boxes, added to our DOCSIS 3.0 passings, continue the rollout of wireless data and invested heavily in our commercial business, and we accomplished all this while still reducing the overall capital intensity of our business for the full year by 260 basis points to 15.5% of revenue. Our capital spending in the fourth quarter was $782 million, bringing our full-year CapEx to $2.9 billion, consistent with our full-year guidance and down approximately 9% from the full year 2009.
Full year Residential capital expenditures were 14.6% of Residential revenue, and were down nearly 15% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by declines in CPE, support capital and scalable infrastructure.
Commercial CapEx was a $470 million, up nearly 34%, with about 40% of the Commercial CapEx attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Looking forward to 2011, we'll continue to spend more in our commercial business as the Residential capital intensity continues to decline. And once again, we expect that full-year capital spending will be less than $3 billion.
Onto cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the fourth quarter was $956 million, resulting in Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of $3.9 billion for the full-year 2010, a 21% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow for the quarter was $665 million, driving our full-year free cash flow to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share. Full-year free cash flow increased 19% over 2009, as higher Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions and working capital requirements more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $351 million and an increase in cash interest of $138 million.
Remarkably, for the full year, we converted more than 95% of incremental adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. For 2011, including the benefit of the bonus depreciation, we're expecting another year of double-digit free cash flow growth.
Turning to the next slide. Full-year diluted earnings per share of $3.64 increased 19% from $3.05 in 2009 and exceeded the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of 2010. Looking forward, we expect that 2011 full-year diluted EPS will be in a $4.25 to $4.50 per share range.
Moving to the balance sheet. During 2010, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $576 million or $1.60 per share in dividends, and bought back $515 million of common stock during November and December alone. Through yesterday, we repurchased almost $750 million worth of TWC common stock. Even after returning capital to shareholders, our year-end net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.4 billion, a reduction of $1.2 billion from year-end 2009.
Our leverage ratio at year end was 2.96x.
And last, but certainly not least, as Glenn discussed, we are very pleased to have announced this morning a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. That's $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, which at yesterday's closing stock price represents a 2.8% dividend yield.
So to summarize. We performed very well in 2010 from an operational and financial perspective. We generated substantial free cash flow, invested in our business for future growth and returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. And we entered 2011 well-positioned to compete and to deliver strong growth in operating income, free cash flow and EPS.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

First of all, on usage base pricing, I think I've been pretty consistent over several years on that. The good thing about broadband is that the usage is growing very rapidly as it has ever since we started the business in 1996. So people are finding it more useful. They're doing different things that make their lives better. That has, and will over time, require incremental investment by all of the infrastructure providers. And I think that implies that over time, as speeds get faster and faster and what have you, that there'll be upward pressure on prices. I think a corollary of that is there is clearly a distribution in how people use the Internet. Some use it a lot more, some use it a lot less. And I think you're going to see over time that people use it less will desire and expect to pay less than people who use it more. For our part, obviously, we paid attention to the announcements by the SEC. We are watching the market, and you are seeing in the wireless space, the beginnings of buyer base pricing. So we'll keep touching that and stay tuned. 
On wireless, again, I think we've been pretty consistent. We are basically exploring whether packaging wireless data with our wireline offerings is something that consumers want and if there's a formula that people want. So we're trying different models, different products, what have you. And to date, I would say our results are not very impressive and pretty inconclusive. So we're going to stick with that for a while. We're trying to spend not too much money while we're doing. So that is what we are up to."

As far back as I can remember, the mix of sort of bundled customers versus Single Play has been pretty consistent with bundling rising and single play subs falling.

In fact, bundled subs increased in the quarter and Single Play subs declined. The reason in the trending schedule, as you might see, that the percentage didn't increase is that we adjusted our subnumbers, and this doesn't flow through the net add calculation, just affects the ending subs. But we decreased the number of Triple Play subs and increased our customer relationships, so both the enumerator and denominator resulted in a lower bundled percentage. But that's not reflective of activity in the quarter. As part of our consolidation into two regions, we're doing some work to standardize our subscriber accounting methodologies and work to standardize across various instances of our billing systems, and that resulted in the adjustments to the subaccounts. But it's really not reflective of what's going on organically in the business. Bundles continue to increase."

There's been a lot of reading about Internet backbone economics recently and Cdns. And I think there's a lot of confusion about it. And quite frankly, the way that the economics of the money back and fourth is pretty arcane. But I think to simplify it, let's start with the idea of the Internet is a collection of a bunch of privately owned networks that are interconnected using standards. That's all it is, there's something -- the internet per se doesn't exist. It's a collection of things. So each of these private networks generates traffic and receives traffic, and has different negotiated relationships with the people that it interconnects with. In general, if somebody is handing off and receiving roughly equivalent and amounts of traffic, there's also an agreement not to charge because the bookkeeping is more expensive than what it's worth. But usually, if the traffic is out of balance, then whoever is delivering more traffic pays the other party. Again, I'm making broad generalizations. So that's how it works. And in the world of telecom, that's great comment, and that's how it's worked for many, many years. So there's nothing really new here other than people delving into it and probably more than happy."

If you step way back from all of this, the only reason we have set-top boxes is that there are a vast array of TV receivers in place in people's homes. And most of them, historically, can't receive and display all of our services because they don't really have any intelligence, they're just display devices. And they receive all different, they use all different standards and they have different kinds of input devices and what have you. And so the only reason we have set-top boxes is to make sure that our services can be displayed. So the set-top boxes have intelligence, they can do things like split program guides, and they can also decrypt signals that are encrypted for piracy protection. What we are seeing is a new generation of consumer electronics devices that have intelligence in them. And I think that's just going to get more and more as we go forward. That's number one. And number two, they are standardizing around a series of hardware inputs and around Internet Protocol, which is nothing but a bunch of standards. So that means that we can deliver television to those devices and deliver new and innovative user interfaces that can be changed rapidly using these standards. So in effect, to get rid of the need for a set-top box, which we will just assume not have in the first place. I think that we demonstrated this at CES. So a couple of consumer benefits. One is all of these devices, and there's an array of them, it's not just TVs, but tablets, iPad and the galaxy tablet and so on. Blu-Ray players, now, have this intelligence in them. So you're beginning to see, can see video on any video display at home. And all we have to due a simulcast using IP standards, just like we simulcast on analog and pay digital today. And then we need to be able to redo our user interface very rapidly, which we can, using our IP Internet kind of standards. So I think this is a win-win for the consumer. And for us, over a very long time period, as these devices were placed all of the TVs in people's homes today, which is obviously a couple of decades at the minimum. But over a very long time period, we may be able to not have set-tops at all. And that means less capital intensive business, fewer service goals and happier consumers. So I think this is all good."

I think whenever there's a lot of new technology running around, there's always a lot of confusion on all sides, so I think everybody in this space is a little confused about what's going to happen, including consumers and companies, investors, et cetera. I actually think -- and we go through waves of this. We certainly went through one in the late '90s, and everybody gets hammered with new things. I think it is useful to step back and think about it on a common sense way. So if you think about all forms of media, they are delivered in some physical way, going back to movies and movie theaters. And historically, those two, the retailer sort of bundled together the content and physicality. You don't go to a movie theater and pay one price to rent the seat and another one to buy the movie. You buy the ticket and you get both. So all of the things you're talking about really attempts to separate the sale of content from the sale of the physical infrastructure. You need both. You can't survive without both. And really, what's happening is you're creating new middlemen. In a business that if you start at the production level, there's already a lot of components. And I think the question is whether there is any real value added there by creating yet a new group of middlemen. And maybe all they have is better user interfaces, which is why we are addressing that. So as it is over, and it is that back and say what's really going on here. is there any real value being created? And therefore, is it sustainable? I think it's pretty questionable. So we'll see how it plays out. Again, users are infrastructure. So that's not a horrible thing for us at the end of today."

On price increases, I think Glenn this in various of his comments. But as customers continue to use HSD for more bandwidth-intensive applications and require more and more speed and place a greater value in short on what it is we're offering, it stands to reason that, that value will correlate with their willingness to pay more for the service. So we feel that, that should drive an ability to increase prices going forward. With respect to voice, the process by which we migrate away from the Sprint contract and onto our own platform for providing support functions will occur over really the next four years through 2014. So the first year where we'll see the full run rate, full year benefit of the entire project is 2015. And what I've said is that when we get to that point in time, we'll see our voice cost essentially cut in half. It's probably best to speak of it in those terms because margins carry with it some assumptions about revenue, and I don't think we're prepared to make those assumptions over a five-year time horizon."

We achieved healthy growth on the top line and delivered record free cash flow. At the same time, we enhanced our products and services, increased the sophistication of our marketing and accelerated the growth of our Commercial business.
We also delivered on our shareholder-oriented capital allocation strategy. We returned more than $570 million through our dividend in 2010, and we have spent roughly $0.75 billion on a repurchase of our own shares since November. In addition, this morning, we announced an increase of 20% to our quarterly dividend. This increase is yet another signal of our confidence in our business, and reinforces our focus on returning capital to our shareholders while continuing to invest in long-term growth.
We also made a lot of progress in our product offerings. We completed the deployment of video switches, enabling a dramatic increase in the availability of HD channels across our footprint. We launched Look Back, providing our digital customers with on-demand access to three days of programming on 59 networks using our network DVR technology.
At the same time, we made our movies On-Demand offering even more attractive by doubling the day and date availability of new titles. We invested in a wireless broadband offering in 2010. The investment is providing us with key insights into the operation of a Wireless business and how it fits with our Wireline business.
In 2010, we continued our ongoing efforts to build a more vast marketing tools and additional analytical capabilities. Specifically, last year, we introduced a more sophisticated product pricing regime. And our first products targeted at specific customer segments. We launched Signature Home broadly across our footprint in December, and we're currently engaged in trials of TV Essentials in New York City and Northeast Ohio. We expect this to be but the first in a series of products designed to more closely fit the individual needs of our customers.
Now turning to 2011, we entered the new year with aggressive plans, and we're optimistic about our prospects, although weakness in employment and occupied housing will continue to provide a headwind. Competition isn't new to our business, and we expect continuing competitive pressures from the telephone and satellite companies in 2011. But with better products and better marketing than we've ever had before, we're ready.
On the regulatory front, we'll continue to press for reform and retransmission consent where 20-year-old statutes effectively tipped the competitive scales of the broadcasters' favor. Regarding broadband regulation, we're pleased that we've avoided Title II Reclassification. However, many parties at both ends of the political spectrum remain unsatisfied, and we expect this issue to remain in the news.
I'm really excited about our rapid progress in harnessing the power of consumer electronics devices to give our customers a better experience and more control as they use our services. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we demonstrated our ability to deliver video directly to IP-connected devices, such a Smart TVs, tablets and Blu-ray players, all without the need for set-top boxes. This ability to deliver TV to virtually any device in the home is a logical extension of our video product. We expect to launch this capability in the coming months.
For years, our video user interfaces have been constrained by the limited capabilities of set-top boxes. By taking advantage of more powerful consumer electronics devices, we can offer a much more compelling navigation experience, one that offers more functionality and is more aesthetically pleasing than anything we've done in the past. Perhaps most important, we're building processes that will enable us to rapidly update the user interface and response to customer feedback. We believe the ability to deliver video to all the screens in the home, a much improved user interface and all that, coupled with TV Everywhere capability, will address many of the perceived advantages of over-the-top video offerings.
There is tremendous value in our broadband network. Our customers continue to use it for new applications, and they're demonstrating that they're willing to pay more as this utility in their lives expand. In the year ahead, we'll continue to invest in the network's capabilities in a variety of ways, including expansion of our DOCSIS 3.0 footprint, so that we can continue to be the best-in-class broadband provider.
Our broadband network is also a flexible platform for new products, coupled with our installation and call center expertise that provides us with an opportunity to enter the Home Monitoring and Security business. We've actually been in the Security business in parts of our footprint for many years. But recent advancements in technology have made the application much more interesting. We've trained installers in several cities, and this week, we began taking orders for our Smart Home Security product as part of a soft launch. We used the feedback we get from the early customers to fine-tune our product and processes, and we expect to launch this product broadly across our footprint later this year.
In the commercial space, we're pleased that we grew revenues by more than 20%, breaking through the $1 billion level for the first time in 2010. However, we're not resting on our laurels, and we think we have the opportunity to create a lot more growth, both through the sale of existing products and by exploring new products and new segments.
In summary, 2010 was a year of new products, accelerated growth and record free cash flow. We look forward to the challenges and opportunities of the new year, as we strive to better serve our customers and continue our quest to be the open, transparent, shareholder-friendly company that our owners expect.
I want to acknowledge the terrific job that Rob has done as our CFO in the past three years. I have full confidence in him as he takes on the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. For the next several months, as we conduct the search for his successor as CFO, Rob will do double duty. 
So now let me turn it over to Rob, who will give you some additional details on the financial performance."

As Glenn said, 2010 was a really good year for Time Warner Cable. We grew full year revenues by over 5.5%, as residential subscription revenues increased nearly 4%, while commercial and advertising revenues each jumped over 20%. Adjusted OIBDA growth accelerated to nearly 6% in 2010, reflecting our strong revenue growth and slightly higher margins. Operating income was up over 11%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased 21%, and free cash flow was up over 19% to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share.
Diluted EPS increased over 19% to $3.64, exceeding what we projected at the beginning of the year. True to our commitment, we continue to actively manage our balance sheet. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders during 2010, paying cash dividends of $576 million and repurchasing $515 million of our common stock. And demonstrating our confidence in our business, this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share or $1.92 on an annualized basis.
Let's move on to Q4 subscriber trends in the next slide. Before I get into the numbers, let me say a few words about the environment in which we're operating. While we've seen some modest improvement and certain macroeconomic indicators in several of our regions, overall, we continue to feel the effects of weak housing and high unemployment across our footprint. The competitive landscape also remained pretty much the same in Q4. The telcos continued their fiber build-outs, but probably at the slowest pace we've seen since they began.
We estimate that U-verse is now marketing video to about 24% of our footprint and FiOS to about 10%. Marketing and promotional intensity among our telco and satellite competitors was pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. For our part, we broadly executed on our $33 x 3 Triple Play marketing program, targeting both new and existing customers.
So let's turn to our sub performance. We added 94,000 high-speed data subscribers in the quarter, bringing total HSD subscriber base to over 9.8 million or 35.8% of passings. That's a five 5.5% year-over-year increase in our HSD sub base. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve, as customers continue to choose our higher-speed tiers. We added 147,000 Turbo 5,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And for the first time this quarter, our total Turbo and Wideband subs combined exceeded our aggregate basic and light tier customers. Commercial HSD net adds were 11,000, which was more than 5x year-ago net adds.
As I've previewed on our third quarter call, Digital Phone net adds rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, as we more aggressively marketed the Triple Play bundle. Total Digital Phone net adds were 72,000, and we ended the quarter with almost 4.5 million total voice subscribers, 16.7% of homes passed and a 6.5% increase from the end of 2009. We had 11,000 Business Class Phone net adds in the quarter for a total of 111,000. That's more than double the number of subs we had 18 months ago.
Video subscriber performance continued to be impacted by the challenging competitive and economic environment. For the quarter, we had a net decline of 141,000 video subscribers. The video sub declines were once again driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers. Actually, net additions for both digital video subscribers and bundled video subscribers were positive during the quarter. In addition, there were some signs of life in the Pay TV category, as we added 77,000 pay units. That's the first growth in pay units we've experienced in 10 quarters. Demand for DVR has also picked up in Q4. Net adds of 47,000 were significantly better than in Q3.
Primary Service unit net adds were a positive 25,000 for the quarter, an improvement from the third quarter loss. PSU churn was flat year-over-year. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on getting customers into bundles and had 72,000 Triple Play net adds during Q4, up from 64,000 in last year's fourth quarter. At quarter end, just under 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. Once again, we fared much better with our more affluent customers, our highest income segments drove the net gains Triple Plays, while our lower-income segments accounted for most of the declines in singles and doubles.
Despite the challenging economic and competitive environment, full year 2010 PS unit additions were 344,000, with 515,000 HSD net adds and 278,000 Digital Phone net adds, offset by 449,000 video net losses. So far, this January's sub-performance looks a lot like January of 2010. But remember that the bulk of the net adds last year occurred in February and March, so it's still really early to project Q1 subs.
Let's turn to our financial results and start with revenue on the next slide. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, and full year revenue increased 5.6% to $18.9 billion. During the fourth quarter, total subscription revenue, that's residential and commercial combined, grew 4.6%, driven by increased PSUs and a 3.1% increase in subscription ARPU per PSU. Advertising revenue increased nearly 34%. In dollar terms, total revenues was $269 million higher than in Q4 '09, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $68 million coming from Advertising and $56 million coming from Commercial.
Let's first focus on residential subscription revenue on Slide 6. Fourth quarter residential subscription revenue grew 3.5%, and full -year residential subscription revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year with both driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year residential subscription revenue growth in Q4, HSD contributed 60% or $87 million, with video and Digital Phone contributing 25% and 15%, respectively.
Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, culminating in Q4 growth of 8.7% over last year's fourth quarter. The growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a year-over-year increase of close to 3% in residential HSD ARPU. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we benefited from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I talked about earlier. Residential video revenue increased as a result of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by the decline in video subs. Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q4 '09. Residential voice revenue grew 4.5% due to continued subscriber growth. Year-over-year ARPU declined just 1.2%, which was the smallest decline in the last couple of years. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to commercial revenue on the next slide. We're very pleased with the progress we made in our Commercial business in 2010. We set out to deliver commercial subscription revenue growth of more than 20% for the year, and we did just that. Fourth quarter commercial revenue was just under $300 million, a 23% increase over Q4 '09, marking the highest-growth quarter of the year. Full year commercial revenue was more than $1.1 billion, up 21.1% versus 2009. Each of commercial data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul contributed about 30% of the $56 million year-over-year revenue improvement in the fourth quarter, with video revenue accounting for the balance. Commercial data revenue increased almost 13%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Business Class Phone revenue increased nearly 73%, driven by subscriber growth, and cell tower backhaul revenue in the fourth quarter was $26 million. That's as much cell backhaul revenue as we generated for all of 2009. As of quarter end, our total installed base was 6,100 radios, and we had a meaningful backlog of radios under contract.
We continue to make investments in our commercial capabilities throughout the year. And in 2011, we are focused on continuing to improve sales productivity and increasing service ability to expand the number of commercial establishments we reach. We expect these investments to enable us to continue to drive commercial revenue growth in 2011 at a rate similar to what we achieved in 2010.
Moving to the next slide. We had a terrific year in advertising, topped off by a fourth quarter in which we generated an all-time high $269 million in ad revenue, up 33.8% over Q4 of 2009 and up 39% on a per video subscriber basis. Full year ad revenues of $881 million were 25.5% greater than in 2009.
Strong political advertising certainly helped the cause. We generated $42 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Political accounted for half the growth in the quarter and about 30% of the growth for the full year. That said, non-political advertising revenues grew strongly in their own right, up around 18% for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, the automotive category generated a little over $50 million, and media advertising added about $45 million, both jumping well over 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we they began to benefit from our new ad-rep deal with FiOS, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in the New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas markets in exchange for a percentage of the revenue generated. We expect that the FiOS deal and others like it will increasingly contribute to ad revenues in 2011. As we look forward, given strength in our core Advertising business and our new ad-rep deals, we do expect that we'll be able to grow ad revenues in 2011, despite the usual non-election year fall-off in political advertising.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 9. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 1.6% to $1.7 billion, and full year adjusted OIBDA increased 5.9% to $6.9 billion, right in line with what we projected on our last earnings call. Full year margins improved 10 basis points.
Total fourth quarter operating expenses grew 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The growth in OpEx and the resulting margin contraction and slowdown in adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter were driven by a number of items that I'll walk you through, several of which I've mentioned previously. First, bad debt expense was up in the quarter due to the reversal of a reserve in Q4 '09, which significantly lowered bad debt in that quarter. Similarly, casualty insurance expense increased year-over-year due to a favorable adjustment to casualty insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, fourth quarter employee expense was increased by an executive severance charge. Additionally, fourth quarter cost of revenues increased due to the reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. And finally, as expected, wireless losses and programming expenses grew faster in the fourth quarter than they did in prior quarters. In aggregate, these items accounted for a $90 million swing in year-over-year adjusted OIBDA.
Programming expense increased 7.2% for the quarter, as video subscriber declines only partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental retrans costs. Remember that Q4 was the first full quarter under our new Disney contract. For the full year, programming costs increased 5.4% in aggregate and 8.2% on a per subscriber basis. We expect total programming cost growth will be in the same ballpark in 2011.
Employee costs were up 3.9% year-over-year in Q4, reflecting higher commercial headcount and compensation expenses and the executive severance cost I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter marketing expense of $166 million was $11 million higher than last year. Marketing spending for the fourth quarter and the full-year remained fairly constant at about 3.5% of revenues. Voice costs were up 5.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subscribers. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. The financial benefits of this process will flow in as our Digital Phone subscribers are migrated to the new platform over the next several years. When we're all done, we expect to see our voice costs cut roughly in half.
We continued to invest in wireless in Q4. As of today, we're offering our wireless data service in almost 3/4 of our footprint, and we have almost 15,000 subscribers. Still early days, but as Glenn mentioned, we're gaining key insights into the Wireless business, as well as the wireless needs and desires of our customers. Q4 wireless losses were approximately $20 million, and full-year losses were around $50 million. In 2011, we plan to continue investing in wireless, as well as several other new initiatives, including, as Glenn mentioned, our Smart Home Security offering. We expect our total 2011 startup losses from wireless, home security and other new business projects to be in the $75 million range.
Before I move on to CapEx, I should note that operating income for the quarter increased 11.6% to $994 million, driven by higher adjusted OIBDA and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense. For the full year, operating income grew 11.2% to $3.7 billion. Looking forward to 2011, we expect once again to generate double-digit operating income growth.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to make great strides in enhancing our products and services in 2010. We completed the rollout of Switch Digital, launched Look Back across our footprint, deployed over 1.5 million HD set-top boxes, added to our DOCSIS 3.0 passings, continue the rollout of wireless data and invested heavily in our Commercial business, and we accomplished all this while still reducing the overall capital intensity of our business for the full year by 260 basis points to 15.5% of revenue. Our capital spending in the fourth quarter was $782 million, bringing our full-year CapEx to $2.9 billion, consistent with our full-year guidance and down approximately 9% from the full year 2009.
Full year residential capital expenditures were 14.6% of residential revenue, and were down nearly 15% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by declines in CPE, support capital and scalable infrastructure. Commercial CapEx was a $470 million, up nearly 34%, with about 40% of the commercial CapEx attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Looking forward to 2011, we'll continue to spend more on our Commercial business as the residential capital intensity continues to decline. And once again, we expect that full year capital spending will be less than $3 billion.
Onto cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the fourth quarter was $956 million, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of $3.9 billion for the full-year 2010, a 21% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow for the quarter was $665 million, driving our full-year free cash flow to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share. Full-year free cash flow increased 19% over 2009, as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions and working capital requirements more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $351 million and an increase in cash interest of $138 million. Remarkably, for the full year, we converted more than 95% of incremental adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. For 2011, including the benefit of the bonus depreciation, we're expecting another year of double-digit free cash flow growth.
Turning to the next slide. Full year diluted earnings per share of $3.64 increased 19% from $3.05 in 2009 and exceeded the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of 2010. Looking forward, we expect that 2011 full-year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 per share range.
Moving to the balance sheet. During 2010, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $576 million or $1.60 per share in dividends, and bought back $515 million of common stock during November and December alone. Through yesterday, we repurchased almost $750 million worth of TWC common stock. Even after returning capital to shareholders, our year-end net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.4 billion, a reduction of $1.2 billion from year-end 2009. Our leverage ratio at year end was 2.96x.
And last, but certainly not least, as Glenn discussed, we're very pleased to have announced this morning a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. That's $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, which at yesterday's closing stock price represents a 2.8% dividend yield.
So to summarize. We performed very well in 2010 from an operational and financial perspective.

First of all, on usage-based pricing, I think I've been pretty consistent over several years on that. The good thing about broadband is that the usage is growing very rapidly as it has ever since we started the business in 1996. So people are finding it more useful. They're doing different things that make their lives better. That has, and will over time, require incremental investment by all of the infrastructure providers. And I think that implies that over time, as speeds get faster and faster and what have you, that there'll be upwards pressure on prices. I think a corollary of that is there is clearly a distribution in how people use the Internet. Some use it a lot more, some use it a lot less. And I think you're going to see over time that people who use it less will desire and expect to pay less than people who use it more. For our part, obviously, we paid attention to the announcements by the SEC. We're watching the market, and you are seeing in the wireless space, the beginnings of volume-based pricing. So we'll keep touching that and stay tuned. On wireless, again, I think we've been pretty consistent. We are basically exploring whether packaging wireless data with our wireline offerings is something that consumers want and if there's a formula that people want. So we're trying different models, different products, what have you. And to date, I would say our results are not very impressive and pretty inconclusive. So we're going to stick with that for a while. We're trying to spend not too much money while we're doing it. So that's basically what we're up to."

The reason in the trending schedule as you might see that the percentage didn't increase is that we adjusted our sub-numbers, and this doesn't flow through the net add calculation, just affects the pending subs. But we decreased the number of Triple Play subs and increased our customer relationships, so both the numerator and denominator resulted in a lower-bundled percentage. But that's not reflective of activity in the quarter. As part of our consolidation into two regions, we're doing some work to standardize our subscriber accounting methodologies and work to standardize across various instances of our billing systems, and that resulted in the adjustments to the sub counts . But it's really not reflective of what's going on organically in the business. Bundles continue to increase."

There's been a lot of reading about Internet backbone economics recently in CDNs. And I think there's a lot of confusion about it. And quite frankly, the way that the economics of the money back and fourth is pretty arcane. But I think to simplify it, just start with the idea of the Internet is a collection of a bunch of privately-owned networks that are interconnected using standards. That's all it is, there's nothing -- the Internet per se doesn't exist. It's a collection of things. So each of these private networks generates traffic and receives traffic, and has different negotiated relationships with the people that it interconnects with. In general, if somebody is handing off and receiving roughly equivalent amounts of traffic, there's also an agreement not to charge because the bookkeeping is more expensive than what it's worth. But usually, if the traffic is out of balance, then whoever is delivering more traffic pays the other party. Again, I'm making broad generalizations. So that's how it works. And in the world of telecom, that's quite common, and that's how it's worked for many, many years. So there's nothing really new here other than people were delving into it and probably more than they have before."

If you step way back from all of these, the only reason we have set-top boxes is that there are a vast array of TV receivers in place in people's homes. And most of them, historically, can't receive and display all of our services because they don't really have any intelligence. They're just display devices. And they receive all different -- they use all different standards and they have different kinds of input places and what have you. And so the only reason we have set-top boxes is to make sure that our services can be displayed. So the set-top boxes have intelligence, they can do things like display program guides, and they can also decrypt signals that are encrypted for piracy protection. What we are seeing is a new generation of consumer electronics devices that have intelligence in them. And I think that's just going to get more and more as we go forward. That's number one. And number two, they are standardizing around a series of hardware inputs and around Internet Protocol, which is nothing but a bunch of standards. So that means that we can deliver television to those devices and deliver new and innovative user interfaces that can be changed rapidly using these standards, so in effect, to get rid of the need for a set-top box, which we would just assume not have in the first place. I think that we demonstrated this at CES. So couple of consumer benefits, one is, all of these devices, and there's an array of them, it's not just TVs, but it's tablets like the iPad and the Galaxy Tablet and so on. Blu-ray players now have this intelligence in them. So you're beginning to see, you can see video on any video display in the home. And all we have to do is simulcast using IP standards, just like we simulcast an analog and paid digital today. And then, we need to be able to redo our user interface very rapidly, which we can using our IP Internet kind of standard. So I think this is a win-win for the consumer. And for us, over a very long time period, as these devices replace all of the TVs that are in people's homes today, which is obviously a couple of decades at the minimum. But over a very long time period, we may be able to not have set-tops at all. And that means a less capital-intensive business, fewer service goals and happier consumers. So I think this is all good."

So I think everybody in this space is a little confused about what's going to happen including consumers and companies, investors, et cetera. I actually think -- and we go through waves of this and we certainly went through one in the late '90s, and everybody gets enamored with new things. I think it is useful to step back and think about it all on a common sense way. So if you think about all forms of media, they are delivered in some physical way, going back to movies and movie theaters. And historically, those two -- the retailer sort of bundled together the content and the physicality. You don't go to a movie theater and pay one price to rent the seat and another one to buy the movie. You buy a ticket and you get both. So all of the things you're talking about are really attempts to separate the sale of content from the sale of the physical infrastructure. You need both. You can't survive without both. And really, what's happening is you're creating new middleman in a business that if you start at the production level, there's already a lot of middlemen. And I think the question is whether there is any real value added there by creating yet a new group of middlemen. And maybe all they have is better use of interfaces, which is why we're addressing that. So I think it's all very alluring, but I think when you step back and say what's really going on here? Is there any real value being created? And therefore, is it sustainable? I think it's pretty questionable. So we'll see how it plays out, again, uses our infrastructure. So it's not a horrible thing for us at the end of today."

Lot of these capital spending numbers down 17% in the quarter and down 9% for the full year. And it occurred to me when we were talking about the commercial revenue, with commercial revenue at $300 million and $1.1 billion for the year. That capital spending, not only is going down, but is becoming more efficient. It feels like the capital efficiency is getting better. So, I'm interested, you said full year CapEx will be below $3 billion. I'm actually interested in you guys talking about the return on that capital, feels like it's going up as the mix shift away from residential and towards commercial. So if you could give us guidance on that, that would be interesting. And then, Glenn, when you we're going into your answer when you're talking about CES stuff, one of the questions that raised to my mind is, is there some reason you're constrained to your own footprint in  this over-the-top solution that you were talking about at CES? Can you actually deliver this through the CE devices to a Comcast home, to their iTablet? Or is there some reason that this new technology to the CE continues to limit you to your existing cable footprint?"

The answer to the question about the CE devices is that right now, we purchased the rights from the content companies to distribute programming inside our cable footprint. So that's what we're talking about doing. Clearly, as I think a couple of people pointed out earlier, this technology allows you to distribute beyond somebody's footprint over the public Internet. But that's quite different than what we're doing. We're using Internet standards, but we're using it within our cable system, and it's not the public Internet."

On price increases, I think Glenn hit this in various of his comments. But as customers continue to use HSD for more bandwidth-intensive applications and require more and more speed and place a greater value in short on what it is we're offering, it stands to reason that, that value will correlate with their willingness to pay more for the service. So we feel that, that should drive an ability to increase prices going forward. With respect to voice, the process by which we migrate away from the Sprint contract and onto our own platform for providing support functions will occur over really the next four years through 2014. So the first year where we'll see the full run rate, full year benefit of the entire project is 2015. And what I've said is that when we get to that point in time, we'll see our voice costs essentially cut in half. It's probably best to speak of it in those terms because margins carry with it some assumptions about revenue, and I don't think we're prepared to make those assumptions over a five-year time horizon."

We achieved healthy growth on the top line and delivered record free cash flow. At the same time, we enhanced our products and services, increased the sophistication of our marketing and accelerated the growth of our Commercial business.
We also delivered on our shareholder-oriented capital allocation strategy. We returned more than $570 million through our dividend in 2010, and we have spent roughly $0.75 billion on a repurchase of our own shares since November. In addition, this morning, we announced an increase of 20% to our quarterly dividend. This increase is yet another signal of our confidence in our business, and reinforces our focus on returning capital to our shareholders while continuing to invest in long-term growth.
We also made a lot of progress in our product offerings. We completed the deployment of video switches, enabling a dramatic increase in the availability of HD channels across our footprint. We launched Look Back, providing our digital customers with on-demand access to three days of programming on 59 networks using our network DVR technology.
At the same time, we made our Movies On Demand offering even more attractive by doubling the day and date availability of new titles. We invested in a wireless broadband offering in 2010. The investment is providing us with key insights into the operation of a wireless business and how it fits with our Wireline business.
In 2010, we continued our ongoing efforts to build a more vast marketing tools and additional analytical capabilities. Specifically, last year, we introduced a more sophisticated product pricing regime and our first products targeted at specific customer segments. We launched Signature Home broadly across our footprint in December, and we're currently engaged in trials of TV Essentials in New York City and Northeast Ohio. We expect this to be but the first in a series of products designed to more closely fit the individual needs of our customers.
Now turning to 2011, we entered the new year with aggressive plans, and we're optimistic about our prospects, although weakness in employment and occupied housing will continue to provide a headwind. Competition isn't new to our business, and we expect continuing competitive pressures from the telephone and satellite companies in 2011. But with better products and better marketing than we've ever had before, we're ready.
On the regulatory front, we'll continue to press for reform and retransmission consent where 20-year-old statutes effectively tipped the competitive scales of the broadcasters' favor. Regarding broadband regulation, we're pleased that we've avoided Title II Reclassification. However, many parties at both ends of the political spectrum remain unsatisfied, and we expect this issue to remain in the news.
I'm really excited about our rapid progress in harnessing the power of consumer electronics devices to give our customers a better experience and more control as they use our services. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we demonstrated our ability to deliver video directly to IP-connected devices, such a Smart TVs, tablets and Blu-ray players, all without the need for set-top boxes. This ability to deliver TV to virtually any device in the home is a logical extension of our video product. We expect to launch this capability in the coming months.
For years, our video user interfaces have been constrained by the limited capabilities of set-top boxes. By taking advantage of more powerful consumer electronics devices, we can offer a much more compelling navigation experience, one that offers more functionality and is more aesthetically pleasing than anything we've done in the past. Perhaps most important, we're building processes that will enable us to rapidly update the user interface and response to customer feedback. We believe the ability to deliver video to all the screens in the home, a much improved user interface and all that, coupled with TV Everywhere capability, will address many of the perceived advantages of over-the-top video offerings.
There is tremendous value in our broadband network. Our customers continue to use it for new applications, and they're demonstrating that they're willing to pay more as this utility in their lives expand. In the year ahead, we'll continue to invest in the network's capabilities in a variety of ways, including expansion of our DOCSIS 3.0 footprint, so that we can continue to be the best-in-class broadband provider.
Our broadband network is also a flexible platform for new products, coupled with our installation and call center expertise, it provides us with an opportunity to enter the Home Monitoring and Security business. We've actually been in the Security business in parts of our footprint for many years. But recent advancements in technology have made the application much more interesting. We've trained installers in several cities, and this week, we began taking orders for our Smart Home Security product as part of a soft launch. We used the feedback we get from the early customers to fine-tune our product and processes, and we expect to launch this product broadly across our footprint later this year.
In the commercial space, we're pleased that we grew revenues by more than 20%, breaking through the $1 billion level for the first time in 2010. However, we're not resting on our laurels, and we think we have the opportunity to create a lot more growth, both through the sale of existing products and by exploring new products and new segments.
In summary, 2010 was a year of new products, accelerated growth and record free cash flow. We look forward to the challenges and opportunities of the new year, as we strive to better serve our customers and continue our quest to be the open, transparent, shareholder-friendly company that our owners expect.
I want to acknowledge the terrific job that Rob has done as our CFO in the past three years. I have full confidence in him as he takes on the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. For the next several months, as we conduct the search for his successor as CFO, Rob will do double duty.

As Glenn said, 2010 was a really good year for Time Warner Cable. We grew full year revenues by over 5.5%, as residential subscription revenues increased nearly 4%, while commercial and advertising revenues each jumped over 20%. Adjusted OIBDA growth accelerated to nearly 6% in 2010, reflecting our strong revenue growth and slightly higher margins. Operating income was up over 11%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased 21%, and free cash flow was up over 19% to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share.
Diluted EPS increased over 19% to $3.64, exceeding what we projected at the beginning of the year. True to our commitment, we continued to actively manage our balance sheet. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders during 2010, paying cash dividends of $576 million and repurchasing $515 million of our common stock. And demonstrating our confidence in our business, this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share or $1.92 on an annualized basis.
Let's move on to Q4 subscriber trends in the next slide. Before I get into the numbers, let me say a few words about the environment in which we're operating. While we've seen some modest improvement in certain macroeconomic indicators in several of our regions, overall, we continue to feel the effects of weak housing and high unemployment across our footprint. The competitive landscape also remained pretty much the same in Q4. The telcos continued their fiber build-outs, but probably at the slowest pace we've seen since they began.
We estimate that U-verse is now marketing video to about 24% of our footprint and FiOS to about 10%. Marketing and promotional intensity among our telco and satellite competitors was pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. For our part, we broadly executed on our $33 x 3 Triple Play marketing program, targeting both new and existing customers.
So let's turn to our sub performance. We added 94,000 high-speed data subscribers in the quarter, bringing total HSD subscriber base to over 9.8 million or 35.8% of passings. That's a five 5.5% year-over-year increase in our HSD sub base. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve, as customers continue to choose our higher-speed tiers. We added 147,000 Turbo and 5,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And for the first time this quarter, our total Turbo and Wideband subs combined exceeded our aggregate basic and light tier customers. Commercial HSD net adds were 11,000, which was more than 5x year-ago net adds.
As I've previewed on our third quarter call, Digital Phone net adds rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, as we more aggressively marketed the Triple Play bundle. Total Digital Phone net adds were 72,000, and we ended the quarter with almost 4.5 million total voice subscribers, 16.7% of homes passed and a 6.5% increase from the end of 2009. We had 11,000 Business Class Phone net adds in the quarter for a total of 111,000. That's more than double the number of subs we had 18 months ago.
Video subscriber performance continued to be impacted by the challenging competitive and economic environment. For the quarter, we had a net decline of 141,000 video subscribers. The video sub declines were once again driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers. Actually, net additions for both digital video subscribers and bundled video subscribers were positive during the quarter. In addition, there were some signs of life in the Pay TV category, as we added 77,000 pay units. That's the first growth in pay units we've experienced in 10 quarters. Demand for DVR has also picked up in Q4. Net adds of 47,000 were significantly better than in Q3.
Primary Service unit net adds were a positive 25,000 for the quarter, an improvement from the third quarter loss. PSU churn was flat year-over-year. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on getting customers into bundles and had 72,000 Triple Play net adds during Q4, up from 64,000 in last year's fourth quarter. At quarter end, just under 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. Once again, we fared much better with our more affluent customers, our highest income segments drove the net gains in Triple Plays, while our lower-income segments accounted for most of the declines in singles and doubles.
Despite the challenging economic and competitive environment, full year 2010 PS unit additions were 344,000, with 515,000 HSD net adds and 278,000 Digital Phone net adds, offset by 449,000 video net losses. So far, this January's sub-performance looks a lot like January of 2010. But remember that the bulk of the net adds last year occurred in February and March, so it's still really early to project Q1 subs.
Let's turn to our financial results and start with revenue on the next slide. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, and full year revenue increased 5.6% to $18.9 billion. During the fourth quarter, total subscription revenue, that's residential and commercial combined, grew 4.6%, driven by increased PSUs and a 3.1% increase in subscription ARPU per PSU. Advertising revenue increased nearly 34%. In dollar terms, total revenues was $269 million higher than in Q4 '09, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $68 million coming from Advertising and $56 million coming from Commercial.
Let's first focus on residential subscription revenue on Slide 6. Fourth quarter residential subscription revenue grew 3.5%, and full-year residential subscription revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year with both driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year residential subscription revenue growth in Q4, HSD contributed 60% or $87 million, with video and Digital Phone contributing 25% and 15%, respectively.
Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, culminating in Q4 growth of 8.7% over last year's fourth quarter. The growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a year-over-year increase of close to 3% in residential HSD ARPU. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we benefited from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I talked about earlier. Residential video revenue increased as a result of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by the decline in video subs. Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q4 '09. Residential voice revenue grew 4.5% due to continued subscriber growth. Year-over-year ARPU declined just 1.2%, which was the smallest decline in the last couple of years. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to commercial revenue on the next slide. We're very pleased with the progress we made in our Commercial business in 2010. We set out to deliver commercial subscription revenue growth of more than 20% for the year, and we did just that. Fourth quarter commercial revenue was just under $300 million, a 23% increase over Q4 '09, marking the highest-growth quarter of the year. Full year commercial revenue was more than $1.1 billion, up 21.1% versus 2009. Each of commercial data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul contributed about 30% of the $56 million year-over-year revenue improvement in the fourth quarter, with video revenue accounting for the balance. Commercial data revenue increased almost 13%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Business Class Phone revenue increased nearly 73%, driven by subscriber growth, and cell tower backhaul revenue in the fourth quarter was $26 million. That's as much cell backhaul revenue as we generated for all of 2009. As of quarter end, our total installed base was 6,100 radios, and we had a meaningful backlog of radios under contract.
We continue to make investments in our commercial capabilities throughout the year. And in 2011, we are focused on continuing to improve sales productivity and increasing service ability to expand the number of commercial establishments we reach. We expect these investments to enable us to continue to drive commercial revenue growth in 2011 at a rate similar to what we achieved in 2010.
Moving to the next slide. We had a terrific year in advertising, topped off by a fourth quarter in which we generated an all-time high $269 million in ad revenue, up 33.8% over Q4 of 2009 and up 39% on a per video subscriber basis. Full year ad revenues of $881 million were 25.5% greater than in 2009.
Strong political advertising certainly helped the cause. We generated $42 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Political accounted for half the growth in the quarter and about 30% of the growth for the full year. That said, non-political advertising revenues grew strongly in their own right, up around 18% for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, the automotive category generated a little over $50 million, and media advertising added about $45 million, both jumping well over 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we they began to benefit from our new ad-rep deal with FiOS, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in the New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas markets in exchange for a percentage of the revenue generated. We expect that the FiOS deal and others like it will increasingly contribute to ad revenues in 2011. As we look forward, given strength in our core Advertising business and our new ad-rep deals, we do expect that we'll be able to grow ad revenues in 2011, despite the usual non-election year fall-off in political advertising.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 9. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 1.6% to $1.7 billion, and full year adjusted OIBDA increased 5.9% to $6.9 billion, right in line with what we projected on our last earnings call. Full year margins improved 10 basis points.
Total fourth quarter operating expenses grew 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The growth in OpEx and the resulting margin contraction and slowdown in adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter were driven by a number of items that I'll walk you through, several of which I've mentioned previously. First, bad debt expense was up in the quarter due to the reversal of a reserve in Q4 '09, which significantly lowered bad debt in that quarter. Similarly, casualty insurance expense increased year-over-year due to a favorable adjustment to casualty insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, fourth quarter employee expense was increased by an executive severance charge. Additionally, fourth quarter cost of revenues increased due to the reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. And finally, as expected, wireless losses and programming expenses grew faster in the fourth quarter than they did in prior quarters. In aggregate, these items accounted for a $90 million swing in year-over-year adjusted OIBDA.
Programming expense increased 7.2% for the quarter, as video subscriber declines only partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental retrans costs. Remember that Q4 was the first full quarter under our new Disney contract. For the full year, programming costs increased 5.4% in aggregate and 8.2% on a per subscriber basis. We expect total programming cost growth will be in the same ballpark in 2011.
Employee costs were up 3.9% year-over-year in Q4, reflecting higher commercial headcount and compensation expenses and the executive severance cost I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter marketing expense of $166 million was $11 million higher than last year. Marketing spending for the fourth quarter and the full-year remained fairly constant at about 3.5% of revenues. Voice costs were up 5.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subscribers. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. The financial benefits of this process will flow in as our Digital Phone subscribers are migrated to the new platform over the next several years. When we're all done, we expect to see our voice costs cut roughly in half.
We continued to invest in wireless in Q4. As of today, we're offering our wireless data service in almost 3/4 of our footprint, and we have almost 15,000 subscribers. Still early days, but as Glenn mentioned, we're gaining key insights into the Wireless business, as well as the wireless needs and desires of our customers. Q4 wireless losses were approximately $20 million, and full-year losses were around $50 million. In 2011, we plan to continue investing in wireless, as well as several other new initiatives, including, as Glenn mentioned, our Smart Home Security offering. We expect our total 2011 startup losses from wireless, home security and other new business projects to be in the $75 million range.
Before I move on to CapEx, I should note that operating income for the quarter increased 11.6% to $994 million, driven by higher adjusted OIBDA and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense. For the full year, operating income grew 11.2% to $3.7 billion. Looking forward to 2011, we expect once again to generate double-digit operating income growth.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to make great strides in enhancing our products and services in 2010. We completed the rollout of Switch Digital, launched Look Back across our footprint, deployed over 1.5 million HD set-top boxes, added to our DOCSIS 3.0 passings, continued the rollout of wireless data and invested heavily in our Commercial business, and we accomplished all this while still reducing the overall capital intensity of our business for the full year by 260 basis points to 15.5% of revenue. Our capital spending in the fourth quarter was $782 million, bringing our full-year CapEx to $2.9 billion, consistent with our full-year guidance and down approximately 9% from the full year 2009.
Full year residential capital expenditures were 14.6% of residential revenue, and were down nearly 15% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by declines in CPE, support capital and scalable infrastructure. Commercial CapEx was $470 million, up nearly 34%, with about 40% of the commercial CapEx attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Looking forward to 2011, we'll continue to spend more on our Commercial business as the residential capital intensity continues to decline. And once again, we expect that full year capital spending will be less than $3 billion.
Onto cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the fourth quarter was $956 million, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of $3.9 billion for the full-year 2010, a 21% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow for the quarter was $665 million, driving our full-year free cash flow to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share. Full-year free cash flow increased 19% over 2009, as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions and working capital requirements more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $351 million and an increase in cash interest of $138 million. Remarkably, for the full year, we converted more than 95% of incremental adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. For 2011, including the benefit of the bonus depreciation, we're expecting another year of double-digit free cash flow growth.
Turning to the next slide. Full year diluted earnings per share of $3.64 increased 19% from $3.05 in 2009 and exceeded the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of 2010. Looking forward, we expect that 2011 full-year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 per share range.
Moving to the balance sheet. During 2010, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $576 million or $1.60 per share in dividends, and bought back $515 million of common stock during November and December alone. Through yesterday, we repurchased almost $750 million worth of TWC common stock. Even after returning capital to shareholders, our year-end net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.4 billion, a reduction of $1.2 billion from year-end 2009. Our leverage ratio at year end was 2.96x.
And last, but certainly not least, as Glenn discussed, we're very pleased to have announced this morning a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. That's $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, which at yesterday's closing stock price represents a 2.8% dividend yield.
So to summarize. We performed very well in 2010 from an operational and financial perspective. We generated substantial free cash flow, invested in our business for future growth and returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. And we entered 2011 well-positioned to compete and to deliver strong growth in operating income, free cash flow and EPS.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

First of all, on usage-based pricing, I think I've been pretty consistent over several years on that. The good thing about broadband is that the usage is growing very rapidly as it has ever since we started the business in 1996. So people are finding it more useful. They're doing different things that make their lives better. That has, and will over time, require incremental investment by all of the infrastructure providers. And I think that implies that over time, as speeds get faster and faster and what have you, that there'll be upwards pressure on prices. I think a corollary of that is there is clearly a distribution in how people use the Internet. Some use it a lot more, some use it a lot less. And I think you're going to see over time that people who use it less will desire and expect to pay less than people who use it more. For our part, obviously, we paid attention to the announcements by the SEC. We're watching the market, and you are seeing in the wireless space, the beginnings of volume-based pricing. So we'll keep touching that and stay tuned. On wireless, again, I think we've been pretty consistent. We are basically exploring whether packaging wireless data with our Wireline offerings is something that consumers want and if there's a formula that people want. So we're trying different models, different products, what have you. And to date, I would say our results are not very impressive and pretty inconclusive. So we're going to stick with that for a while. We're trying to spend not too much money while we're doing it. So that's basically what we're up to."

The reason in the trending schedule as you might see that the percentage didn't increase is that we adjusted our sub-numbers, and this doesn't flow through the net add calculation, just affects the pending subs. But we decreased the number of Triple Play subs and increased our customer relationships, so both the numerator and denominator resulted in a lower-bundled percentage. But that's not reflective of activity in the quarter. As part of our consolidation into two regions, we're doing some work to standardize our subscriber counting methodologies and work to standardize across various instances of our billing systems, and that resulted in the adjustments to the sub counts . But it's really not reflective of what's going on organically in the business. Bundles continue to increase."

There's been a lot of reading about Internet backbone economics recently in CDNs. And I think there's a lot of confusion about it. And quite frankly, the way that the economics of the money back and fourth is pretty arcane. But I think to simplify it, just start with the idea of the Internet is a collection of a bunch of privately-owned networks that are interconnected using standards. That's all it is, there's nothing -- the Internet per se doesn't exist. It's a collection of things. So each of these private networks generates traffic and receives traffic, and has different negotiated relationships with the people that it interconnects with. In general, if somebody is handing off and receiving roughly equivalent amounts of traffic, there's also an agreement not to charge because the bookkeeping is more expensive than what it's worth. But usually, if the traffic is out of balance, then whoever is delivering more traffic pays the other party. Again, I'm making broad generalizations. So that's how it works. And in the world of telecom, that's quite common, and that's how it's worked for many, many years. So there's nothing really new here other than people were delving into it in public more than they have before."

If you step way back from all of this, the only reason we have set-top boxes is that there are a vast array of TV receivers in place in people's homes. And most of them, historically, can't receive and display all of our services because they don't really have any intelligence. They're just display devices. And they receive all different -- they use all different standards and they have different kinds of input places and what have you. So the only reason we have set-top boxes is to make sure that our services can be displayed. So the set-top boxes have intelligence, they can do things like display program guides, and they can also decrypt signals that are encrypted for piracy protection. What we are seeing is a new generation of consumer electronics devices that have intelligence in them. And I think that's just going to get more and more as we go forward. That's number one. And number two, they are standardizing around a series of hardware inputs and around Internet Protocol, which is nothing but a bunch of standards. So that means that we can deliver television to those devices and deliver new innovative user interfaces that can be changed rapidly using these standards, so in effect, you get rid of the need for a set-top box, which we would just as soon not have in the first place. I think that we demonstrated this at CES. So couple of consumer benefits. One is, all of these devices, and there's an array of them, it's not just TVs, but it's tablets like the iPad and the Galaxy Tablet and so on. Blu-ray players now have this intelligence in them. So you're beginning to see, you can see video on any video display in the home. And all we have to do is simulcast using IP standards, just like we simulcast on analog and paid digital today. And then, we need to be able to redo our user interface very rapidly, which we can using our IP Internet kind of standard. So I think this is a win-win for the consumer. And for us, over a very long time period, as these devices replace all of the TVs that are in people's homes today, which is obviously a couple of decades at the minimum. But over a very long time period, we may be able to not have set-tops at all. And that means a less capital-intensive business, fewer service goals and happier consumers. So I think this is all good."

So I think everybody in this space is a little confused about what's going to happen including consumers and companies, investors, et cetera. I actually think -- and we go through waves of this and we certainly went through one in the late '90s, and everybody gets enamored with new things. I think it is useful to step back and think about it all on a common sense way. So if you think about all forms of media, they are delivered in some physical way, going back to movies and movie theaters. And historically, those two -- the retailer sort of bundled together the content and the physicality. You don't go to a movie theater and pay one price to rent the seat and another one to buy the movie. You buy a ticket and you get both. So all of the things you're talking about are really attempts to separate the sale of content from the sale of the physical infrastructure. You need both. You can't survive without both. And really, what's happening is you're creating new middleman in a business that if you start at the production level, there's already a whole lot of middlemen. And I think the question is whether there is any real value added there by creating yet a new group of middlemen. And maybe all they have is better user interfaces, which is why we're addressing that. So I think it's all very alluring, but I think when you step back and say what's really going on here? Is there any real value being created? And therefore, is it sustainable? I think it's pretty questionable. So we'll see how it plays out, again, uses our infrastructure. So it's not a horrible thing for us at the end of today."

But essentially, if you buy a DVD under the first-sale doctrine, you can rent it as many times as you physically can without paying for it again. So they're using a very clever interface on the web and the first-sale doctrine and the power of subscriptions, which we all know about. They built a wonderful business, which they now are trying to extend into online. And then the online part of that, what I said before, they have a wonderful interface, which anybody can hire a bunch of web designers and do that.

That capital spending, not only is going down, but is becoming more efficient. It feels like the capital efficiency is getting better. So, I'm interested, you said full year CapEx will be below $3 billion. I'm actually interested in you guys talking about the return on that capital, feels like it's going up as the mix shift away from residential and towards commercial. So if you could give us guidance on that, that would be interesting. And then, Glenn, when you we're going into your answer when you're talking about CES stuff, one of the questions that raised to my mind is, is there some reason you're constrained to your own footprint in this over-the-top solution that you were talking about at CES?

On price increases, I think Glenn hit this in various of his comments. But as customers continue to use HSD for more bandwidth-intensive applications and require more and more speed and place a greater value in short on what it is we're offering, it stands to reason that, that value will correlate with their willingness to pay more for the service. So we feel that, that should drive an ability to increase prices going forward. With respect to voice, the process by which we migrate away from the Sprint contract and onto our own platform for providing support functions will occur over really the next four years through 2014. So the first year where we'll see the full run rate, full year benefit of the entire project is 2015. And what I've said is that when we get to that point in time, we'll see our voice costs essentially cut in half. It's probably best to speak of it in those terms because margins carry with it some assumptions about revenue, and I don't think we're prepared to make those assumptions over a five-year time horizon."

We achieved healthy growth on the top line and delivered record free cash flow. At the same time, we enhanced our products and services, increased the sophistication of our marketing and accelerated the growth of our Commercial business.
We also delivered on our shareholder-oriented capital allocation strategy. We returned more than $570 million through our dividend in 2010, and we have spent roughly $0.75 billion on a repurchase of our own shares since November. In addition, this morning, we announced an increase of 20% to our quarterly dividend. This increase is yet another signal of our confidence in our business, and reinforces our focus on returning capital to our shareholders while continuing to invest in long-term growth.
We also made a lot of progress in our product offerings. We completed the deployment of video switches, enabling a dramatic increase in the availability of HD channels across our footprint. We launched Look Back, providing our digital customers with on-demand access to three days of programming on 59 networks using our network DVR technology.
At the same time, we made our Movies On Demand offering even more attractive by doubling the day and date availability of new titles. We invested in a wireless broadband offering in 2010. The investment is providing us with key insights into the operation of a wireless business and how it fits with our Wireline business.
In 2010, we continued our ongoing efforts to build a more vast marketing tools and additional analytical capabilities. Specifically, last year, we introduced a more sophisticated product pricing regime and our first products targeted at specific customer segments. We launched Signature Home broadly across our footprint in December, and we're currently engaged in trials of TV Essentials in New York City and Northeast Ohio. We expect this to be but the first in a series of products designed to more closely fit the individual needs of our customers.
Now turning to 2011, we entered the new year with aggressive plans, and we're optimistic about our prospects, although weakness in employment and occupied housing will continue to provide a headwind. Competition isn't new to our business, and we expect continuing competitive pressures from the telephone and satellite companies in 2011. But with better products and better marketing than we've ever had before, we're ready.
On the regulatory front, we'll continue to press for reform and retransmission consent where 20-year-old statutes effectively tipped the competitive scales of the broadcasters' favor. Regarding broadband regulation, we're pleased that we've avoided Title II Reclassification. However, many parties at both ends of the political spectrum remain unsatisfied, and we expect this issue to remain in the news.
I'm really excited about our rapid progress in harnessing the power of consumer electronics devices to give our customers a better experience and more control as they use our services. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we demonstrated our ability to deliver video directly to IP-connected devices, such a Smart TVs, tablets and Blu-ray players, all without the need for set-top boxes. This ability to deliver TV to virtually any device in the home is a logical extension of our video product. We expect to launch this capability in the coming months.
For years, our video user interfaces have been constrained by the limited capabilities of set-top boxes. By taking advantage of more powerful consumer electronics devices, we can offer a much more compelling navigation experience, one that offers more functionality and is more aesthetically pleasing than anything we've done in the past. Perhaps most important, we're building processes that will enable us to rapidly update the user interface and response to customer feedback. We believe the ability to deliver video to all the screens in the home, a much improved user interface and all that, coupled with TV Everywhere capability, will address many of the perceived advantages of over-the-top video offerings.
There is tremendous value in our broadband network. Our customers continue to use it for new applications, and they're demonstrating that they're willing to pay more as this utility in their lives expand. In the year ahead, we'll continue to invest in the network's capabilities in a variety of ways, including expansion of our DOCSIS 3.0 footprint, so that we can continue to be the best-in-class broadband provider.
Our broadband network is also a flexible platform for new products, coupled with our installation and call center expertise, it provides us with an opportunity to enter the Home Monitoring and Security business. We've actually been in the Security business in parts of our footprint for many years. But recent advancements in technology have made the application much more interesting. We've trained installers in several cities, and this week, we began taking orders for our Smart Home Security product as part of a soft launch. We used the feedback we get from the early customers to fine-tune our product and processes, and we expect to launch this product broadly across our footprint later this year.
In the commercial space, we're pleased that we grew revenues by more than 20%, breaking through the $1 billion level for the first time in 2010. However, we're not resting on our laurels, and we think we have the opportunity to create a lot more growth, both through the sale of existing products and by exploring new products and new segments.
In summary, 2010 was a year of new products, accelerated growth and record free cash flow. We look forward to the challenges and opportunities of the new year, as we strive to better serve our customers and continue our quest to be the open, transparent, shareholder-friendly company that our owners expect.
I want to acknowledge the terrific job that Rob has done as our CFO in the past three years. I have full confidence in him as he takes on the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. For the next several months, as we conduct the search for his successor as CFO, Rob will do double duty.

As Glenn said, 2010 was a really good year for Time Warner Cable. We grew full year revenues by over 5.5%, as residential subscription revenues increased nearly 4%, while commercial and advertising revenues each jumped over 20%. Adjusted OIBDA growth accelerated to nearly 6% in 2010, reflecting our strong revenue growth and slightly higher margins. Operating income was up over 11%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased 21%, and free cash flow was up over 19% to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share.
Diluted EPS increased over 19% to $3.64, exceeding what we projected at the beginning of the year. True to our commitment, we continued to actively manage our balance sheet. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders during 2010, paying cash dividends of $576 million and repurchasing $515 million of our common stock. And demonstrating our confidence in our business, this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share or $1.92 on an annualized basis.
Let's move on to Q4 subscriber trends in the next slide. Before I get into the numbers, let me say a few words about the environment in which we're operating. While we've seen some modest improvement in certain macroeconomic indicators in several of our regions, overall, we continue to feel the effects of weak housing and high unemployment across our footprint. The competitive landscape also remained pretty much the same in Q4. The telcos continued their fiber build-outs, but probably at the slowest pace we've seen since they began.
We estimate that U-verse is now marketing video to about 24% of our footprint and FiOS to about 10%. Marketing and promotional intensity among our telco and satellite competitors was pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. For our part, we broadly executed on our $33 x 3 Triple Play marketing program, targeting both new and existing customers.
So let's turn to our sub performance. We added 94,000 high-speed data subscribers in the quarter, bringing total HSD subscriber base to over 9.8 million or 35.8% of passings. That's a five 5.5% year-over-year increase in our HSD sub base. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve, as customers continue to choose our higher-speed tiers. We added 147,000 Turbo and 5,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And for the first time this quarter, our total Turbo and Wideband subs combined exceeded our aggregate basic and light tier customers. Commercial HSD net adds were 11,000, which was more than 5x year-ago net adds.
As I've previewed on our third quarter call, Digital Phone net adds rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, as we more aggressively marketed the Triple Play bundle. Total Digital Phone net adds were 72,000, and we ended the quarter with almost 4.5 million total voice subscribers, 16.7% of homes passed and a 6.5% increase from the end of 2009. We had 11,000 Business Class Phone net adds in the quarter for a total of 111,000. That's more than double the number of subs we had 18 months ago.
Video subscriber performance continued to be impacted by the challenging competitive and economic environment. For the quarter, we had a net decline of 141,000 video subscribers. The video sub declines were once again driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers. Actually, net additions for both digital video subscribers and bundled video subscribers were positive during the quarter. In addition, there were some signs of life in the Pay TV category, as we added 77,000 pay units. That's the first growth in pay units we've experienced in 10 quarters. Demand for DVR has also picked up in Q4. Net adds of 47,000 were significantly better than in Q3.
Primary Service unit net adds were a positive 25,000 for the quarter, an improvement from the third quarter loss. PSU churn was flat year-over-year. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on getting customers into bundles and had 72,000 Triple Play net adds during Q4, up from 64,000 in last year's fourth quarter. At quarter end, just under 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. Once again, we fared much better with our more affluent customers, our highest income segments drove the net gains in Triple Plays, while our lower-income segments accounted for most of the declines in singles and doubles.
Despite the challenging economic and competitive environment, full year 2010 PS unit additions were 344,000, with 515,000 HSD net adds and 278,000 Digital Phone net adds, offset by 449,000 video net losses. So far, this January's sub-performance looks a lot like January of 2010. But remember that the bulk of the net adds last year occurred in February and March, so it's still really early to project Q1 subs.
Let's turn to our financial results and start with revenue on the next slide. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, and full year revenue increased 5.6% to $18.9 billion. During the fourth quarter, total subscription revenue, that's residential and commercial combined, grew 4.6%, driven by increased PSUs and a 3.1% increase in subscription ARPU per PSU. Advertising revenue increased nearly 34%. In dollar terms, total revenues was $269 million higher than in Q4 '09, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $68 million coming from Advertising and $56 million coming from Commercial.
Let's first focus on residential subscription revenue on Slide 6. Fourth quarter residential subscription revenue grew 3.5%, and full-year residential subscription revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year with both driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year residential subscription revenue growth in Q4, HSD contributed 60% or $87 million, with video and Digital Phone contributing 25% and 15%, respectively.
Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, culminating in Q4 growth of 8.7% over last year's fourth quarter. The growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a year-over-year increase of close to 3% in residential HSD ARPU. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we benefited from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I talked about earlier. Residential video revenue increased as a result of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by the decline in video subs. Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q4 '09. Residential voice revenue grew 4.5% due to continued subscriber growth. Year-over-year ARPU declined just 1.2%, which was the smallest decline in the last couple of years. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to commercial revenue on the next slide. We're very pleased with the progress we made in our Commercial business in 2010. We set out to deliver commercial subscription revenue growth of more than 20% for the year, and we did just that. Fourth quarter commercial revenue was just under $300 million, a 23% increase over Q4 '09, marking the highest-growth quarter of the year. Full year commercial revenue was more than $1.1 billion, up 21.1% versus 2009. Each of commercial data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul contributed about 30% of the $56 million year-over-year revenue improvement in the fourth quarter, with video revenue accounting for the balance. Commercial data revenue increased almost 13%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Business Class Phone revenue increased nearly 73%, driven by subscriber growth, and cell tower backhaul revenue in the fourth quarter was $26 million. That's as much cell backhaul revenue as we generated for all of 2009. As of quarter end, our total installed base was 6,100 radios, and we had a meaningful backlog of radios under contract.
We continue to make investments in our commercial capabilities throughout the year. And in 2011, we are focused on continuing to improve sales productivity and increasing service ability to expand the number of commercial establishments we reach. We expect these investments to enable us to continue to drive commercial revenue growth in 2011 at a rate similar to what we achieved in 2010.
Moving to the next slide. We had a terrific year in advertising, topped off by a fourth quarter in which we generated an all-time high $269 million in ad revenue, up 33.8% over Q4 of 2009 and up 39% on a per video subscriber basis. Full year ad revenues of $881 million were 25.5% greater than in 2009.
Strong political advertising certainly helped the cause. We generated $42 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Political accounted for half the growth in the quarter and about 30% of the growth for the full year. That said, non-political advertising revenues grew strongly in their own right, up around 18% for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, the automotive category generated a little over $50 million, and media advertising added about $45 million, both jumping well over 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we they began to benefit from our new ad-rep deal with FiOS, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in the New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas markets in exchange for a percentage of the revenue generated. We expect that the FiOS deal and others like it will increasingly contribute to ad revenues in 2011. As we look forward, given strength in our core Advertising business and our new ad-rep deals, we do expect that we'll be able to grow ad revenues in 2011, despite the usual non-election year fall-off in political advertising.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 9. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 1.6% to $1.7 billion, and full year adjusted OIBDA increased 5.9% to $6.9 billion, right in line with what we projected on our last earnings call. Full year margins improved 10 basis points.
Total fourth quarter operating expenses grew 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The growth in OpEx and the resulting margin contraction and slowdown in adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter were driven by a number of items that I'll walk you through, several of which I've mentioned previously. First, bad debt expense was up in the quarter due to the reversal of a reserve in Q4 '09, which significantly lowered bad debt in that quarter. Similarly, casualty insurance expense increased year-over-year due to a favorable adjustment to casualty insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, fourth quarter employee expense was increased by an executive severance charge. Additionally, fourth quarter cost of revenues increased due to the reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. And finally, as expected, wireless losses and programming expenses grew faster in the fourth quarter than they did in prior quarters. In aggregate, these items accounted for a $90 million swing in year-over-year adjusted OIBDA.
Programming expense increased 7.2% for the quarter, as video subscriber declines only partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental retrans costs. Remember that Q4 was the first full quarter under our new Disney contract. For the full year, programming costs increased 5.4% in aggregate and 8.2% on a per subscriber basis. We expect total programming cost growth will be in the same ballpark in 2011.
Employee costs were up 3.9% year-over-year in Q4, reflecting higher commercial headcount and compensation expenses and the executive severance cost I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter marketing expense of $166 million was $11 million higher than last year. Marketing spending for the fourth quarter and the full-year remained fairly constant at about 3.5% of revenues. Voice costs were up 5.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subscribers. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. The financial benefits of this process will flow in as our Digital Phone subscribers are migrated to the new platform over the next several years. When we're all done, we expect to see our voice costs cut roughly in half.
We continued to invest in wireless in Q4. As of today, we're offering our wireless data service in almost 3/4 of our footprint, and we have almost 15,000 subscribers. Still early days, but as Glenn mentioned, we're gaining key insights into the Wireless business, as well as the wireless needs and desires of our customers. Q4 wireless losses were approximately $20 million, and full-year losses were around $50 million. In 2011, we plan to continue investing in wireless, as well as several other new initiatives, including, as Glenn mentioned, our Smart Home Security offering. We expect our total 2011 startup losses from wireless, home security and other new business projects to be in the $75 million range.
Before I move on to CapEx, I should note that operating income for the quarter increased 11.6% to $994 million, driven by higher adjusted OIBDA and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense. For the full year, operating income grew 11.2% to $3.7 billion. Looking forward to 2011, we expect once again to generate double-digit operating income growth.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to make great strides in enhancing our products and services in 2010. We completed the rollout of Switch Digital, launched Look Back across our footprint, deployed over 1.5 million HD set-top boxes, added to our DOCSIS 3.0 passings, continued the rollout of wireless data and invested heavily in our Commercial business, and we accomplished all this while still reducing the overall capital intensity of our business for the full year by 260 basis points to 15.5% of revenue. Our capital spending in the fourth quarter was $782 million, bringing our full-year CapEx to $2.9 billion, consistent with our full-year guidance and down approximately 9% from the full year 2009.
Full year residential capital expenditures were 14.6% of residential revenue, and were down nearly 15% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by declines in CPE, support capital and scalable infrastructure. Commercial CapEx was $470 million, up nearly 34%, with about 40% of the commercial CapEx attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Looking forward to 2011, we'll continue to spend more on our Commercial business as the residential capital intensity continues to decline. And once again, we expect that full year capital spending will be less than $3 billion.
Onto cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the fourth quarter was $956 million, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of $3.9 billion for the full-year 2010, a 21% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow for the quarter was $665 million, driving our full-year free cash flow to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share. Full-year free cash flow increased 19% over 2009, as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions and working capital requirements more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $351 million and an increase in cash interest of $138 million. Remarkably, for the full year, we converted more than 95% of incremental adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. For 2011, including the benefit of the bonus depreciation, we're expecting another year of double-digit free cash flow growth.
Turning to the next slide. Full year diluted earnings per share of $3.64 increased 19% from $3.05 in 2009 and exceeded the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of 2010. Looking forward, we expect that 2011 full-year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 per share range.
Moving to the balance sheet. During 2010, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $576 million or $1.60 per share in dividends, and bought back $515 million of common stock during November and December alone. Through yesterday, we repurchased almost $750 million worth of TWC common stock. Even after returning capital to shareholders, our year-end net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.4 billion, a reduction of $1.2 billion from year-end 2009. Our leverage ratio at year end was 2.96x.
And last, but certainly not least, as Glenn discussed, we're very pleased to have announced this morning a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. That's $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, which at yesterday's closing stock price represents a 2.8% dividend yield.
So to summarize. We performed very well in 2010 from an operational and financial perspective. We generated substantial free cash flow, invested in our business for future growth and returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. And we entered 2011 well-positioned to compete and to deliver strong growth in operating income, free cash flow and EPS.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

First of all, on usage-based pricing, I think I've been pretty consistent over several years on that. The good thing about broadband is that the usage is growing very rapidly as it has ever since we started the business in 1996. So people are finding it more useful. They're doing different things that make their lives better. That has, and will over time, require incremental investment by all of the infrastructure providers. And I think that implies that over time, as speeds get faster and faster and what have you, that there'll be upwards pressure on prices. I think a corollary of that is there is clearly a distribution in how people use the Internet. Some use it a lot more, some use it a lot less. And I think you're going to see over time that people who use it less will desire and expect to pay less than people who use it more. For our part, obviously, we paid attention to the announcements by the SEC. We're watching the market, and you are seeing in the wireless space, the beginnings of volume-based pricing. So we'll keep touching that and stay tuned. On wireless, again, I think we've been pretty consistent. We are basically exploring whether packaging wireless data with our Wireline offerings is something that consumers want and if there's a formula that people want. So we're trying different models, different products, what have you. And to date, I would say our results are not very impressive and pretty inconclusive. So we're going to stick with that for a while. We're trying to spend not too much money while we're doing it. So that's basically what we're up to."

There's been a lot of reading about Internet backbone economics recently in CDNs. And I think there's a lot of confusion about it. And quite frankly, the way that the economics of the money back and fourth is pretty arcane. But I think to simplify it, just start with the idea of the Internet is a collection of a bunch of privately-owned networks that are interconnected using standards. That's all it is, there's nothing -- the Internet per se doesn't exist. It's a collection of things. So each of these private networks generates traffic and receives traffic, and has different negotiated relationships with the people that it interconnects with. In general, if somebody is handing off and receiving roughly equivalent amounts of traffic, there's also an agreement not to charge because the bookkeeping is more expensive than what it's worth. But usually, if the traffic is out of balance, then whoever is delivering more traffic pays the other party. Again, I'm making broad generalizations. So that's how it works. And in the world of telecom, that's quite common, and that's how it's worked for many, many years. So there's nothing really new here other than people were delving into it in public more than they have before."

If you step way back from all of this, the only reason we have set-top boxes is that there are a vast array of TV receivers in place in people's homes. And most of them, historically, can't receive and display all of our services because they don't really have any intelligence. They're just display devices. And they receive all different -- they use all different standards and they have different kinds of input places and what have you. So the only reason we have set-top boxes is to make sure that our services can be displayed. So the set-top boxes have intelligence, they can do things like display program guides, and they can also decrypt signals that are encrypted for piracy protection. What we are seeing is a new generation of consumer electronics devices that have intelligence in them. And I think that's just going to get more and more as we go forward. That's number one. And number two, they are standardizing around a series of hardware inputs and around Internet Protocol, which is nothing but a bunch of standards. So that means that we can deliver television to those devices and deliver new innovative user interfaces that can be changed rapidly using these standards, so in effect, you get rid of the need for a set-top box, which we would just as soon not have in the first place. I think that we demonstrated this at CES. So couple of consumer benefits. One is, all of these devices, and there's an array of them, it's not just TVs, but it's tablets like the iPad and the Galaxy Tablet and so on. Blu-ray players now have this intelligence in them. So you're beginning to see, you can see video on any video display in the home. And all we have to do is simulcast using IP standards, just like we simulcast on analog and paid digital today. And then, we need to be able to redo our user interface very rapidly, which we can using our IP Internet kind of standard. So I think this is a win-win for the consumer. And for us, over a very long time period, as these devices replace all of the TVs that are in people's homes today, which is obviously a couple of decades at the minimum. But over a very long time period, we may be able to not have set-tops at all. And that means a less capital-intensive business, fewer service goals and happier consumers. So I think this is all good."

And I think all those arguments make a lot of sense. And so when you sit here today and look at where we are, and shortly after you did your Disney deal, they did a deal with Netflix, I think Netflix added like 5 million, 5.5 million gross adds last quarter, over 1/3 were streaming only. And so I'm just wondering if you think that the industry is becoming more or less aligned? There is also an article in the Journal about Hulu launching a sort of virtual cable operator product if they can convince their owners to do it. And actually, when you think about your IP-delivered video service you were just talking about in the last question, and certainly, a lot of people could probably do that who don't necessarily own a network to sort of play the string out. So just curious, when you think about where the media companies are in your negotiations and you think about the contracts you're signing, are we in a better place or worse place than we were six, nine months ago? And what do you think is happening at the customer level as we get all these internet-connected TVs sold? And obviously, your product development path is aimed at trying to address a lot of that. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that big topic?"

So I think everybody in this space is a little confused about what's going to happen including consumers and companies, investors, et cetera. I actually think -- and we go through waves of this and we certainly went through one in the late '90s, and everybody gets enamored with new things. I think it is useful to step back and think about it all on a common sense way. So if you think about all forms of media, they are delivered in some physical way, going back to movies and movie theaters. And historically, those two -- the retailer sort of bundled together the content and the physicality. You don't go to a movie theater and pay one price to rent the seat and another one to buy the movie. You buy a ticket and you get both. So all of the things you're talking about are really attempts to separate the sale of content from the sale of the physical infrastructure. You need both. You can't survive without both. And really, what's happening is you're creating new middleman in a business that if you start at the production level, there's already a whole lot of middlemen. And I think the question is whether there is any real value added there by creating yet a new group of middlemen. And maybe all they have is better user interfaces, which is why we're addressing that. So I think it's all very alluring, but I think when you step back and say what's really going on here? Is there any real value being created? And therefore, is it sustainable? I think it's pretty questionable. So we'll see how it plays out, again, uses our infrastructure. So it's not a horrible thing for us at the end of today."

And then not to take the over-the-top discussion too far, Glenn, but relative to the comments you just made, I would say Netflix certainly has created some value or new product in that. They're offering consumers content that they haven't been able to readily get at a price point that's pretty attractive. So, again, relative to your commentary, would you look at the content that Netflix has and think there's a business model for Time Warner Cable to acquire that content as well and offer to subscribers?

So they're using a very clever interface on the web and the first-sale doctrine and the power of subscriptions, which we all know about.

The answer to the question about the CE devices is that right now, we purchase the rights from the content companies to distribute programming inside our cable footprint.

On price increases, I think Glenn hit this in various of his comments. But as customers continue to use HSD for more bandwidth-intensive applications and require more and more speed and place a greater value in short on what it is we're offering, it stands to reason that, that value will correlate with their willingness to pay more for the service. So we feel that, that should drive an ability to increase prices going forward. With respect to voice, the process by which we migrate away from the Sprint contract and onto our own platform for providing support functions will occur over really the next four years through 2014. So the first year where we'll see the full run rate, full year benefit of the entire project is 2015. And what I've said is that when we get to that point in time, we'll see our voice costs essentially cut in half. It's probably best to speak of it in those terms because margins carry with it some assumptions about revenue, and I don't think we're prepared to make those assumptions over a five-year time horizon."

We achieved healthy growth on the top line and delivered record free cash flow. At the same time, we enhanced our products and services, increased the sophistication of our marketing and accelerated the growth of our Commercial business.
We also delivered on our shareholder-oriented capital allocation strategy. We returned more than $570 million through our dividend in 2010, and we have spent roughly $0.75 billion on a repurchase of our own shares since November. In addition, this morning, we announced an increase of 20% to our quarterly dividend. This increase is yet another signal of our confidence in our business, and reinforces our focus on returning capital to our shareholders while continuing to invest in long-term growth.
We also made a lot of progress in our product offerings. We completed the deployment of video switches, enabling a dramatic increase in the availability of HD channels across our footprint. We launched Look Back, providing our digital customers with on-demand access to three days of programming on 59 networks using our network DVR technology.
At the same time, we made our Movies On Demand offering even more attractive by doubling the day and date availability of new titles. We invested in a wireless broadband offering in 2010. The investment is providing us with key insights into the operation of a wireless business and how it fits with our Wireline business.
In 2010, we continued our ongoing efforts to build a more vast marketing tools and additional analytical capabilities. Specifically, last year, we introduced a more sophisticated product pricing regime and our first products targeted at specific customer segments. We launched Signature Home broadly across our footprint in December, and we're currently engaged in trials of TV Essentials in New York City and Northeast Ohio. We expect this to be but the first in a series of products designed to more closely fit the individual needs of our customers.
Now turning to 2011, we entered the new year with aggressive plans, and we're optimistic about our prospects, although weakness in employment and occupied housing will continue to provide a headwind. Competition isn't new to our business, and we expect continuing competitive pressures from the telephone and satellite companies in 2011. But with better products and better marketing than we've ever had before, we're ready.
On the regulatory front, we'll continue to press for reform and retransmission consent where 20-year-old statutes effectively tipped the competitive scales of the broadcasters' favor. Regarding broadband regulation, we're pleased that we've avoided Title II Reclassification. However, many parties at both ends of the political spectrum remain unsatisfied, and we expect this issue to remain in the news.
I'm really excited about our rapid progress in harnessing the power of consumer electronics devices to give our customers a better experience and more control as they use our services. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we demonstrated our ability to deliver video directly to IP-connected devices, such a Smart TVs, tablets and Blu-ray players, all without the need for set-top boxes. This ability to deliver TV to virtually any device in the home is a logical extension of our video product. We expect to launch this capability in the coming months.
For years, our video user interfaces have been constrained by the limited capabilities of set-top boxes. By taking advantage of more powerful consumer electronics devices, we can offer a much more compelling navigation experience, one that offers more functionality and is more aesthetically pleasing than anything we've done in the past. Perhaps most important, we're building processes that will enable us to rapidly update the user interface and response to customer feedback. We believe the ability to deliver video to all the screens in the home, a much improved user interface and all that, coupled with TV Everywhere capability, will address many of the perceived advantages of over-the-top video offerings.
There is tremendous value in our broadband network. Our customers continue to use it for new applications, and they're demonstrating that they're willing to pay more as this utility in their lives expand. In the year ahead, we'll continue to invest in the network's capabilities in a variety of ways, including expansion of our DOCSIS 3.0 footprint, so that we can continue to be the best-in-class broadband provider.
Our broadband network is also a flexible platform for new products, coupled with our installation and call center expertise, it provides us with an opportunity to enter the Home Monitoring and Security business. We've actually been in the Security business in parts of our footprint for many years. But recent advancements in technology have made the application much more interesting. We've trained installers in several cities, and this week, we began taking orders for our Smart Home Security product as part of a soft launch. We used the feedback we get from the early customers to fine-tune our product and processes, and we expect to launch this product broadly across our footprint later this year.
In the commercial space, we're pleased that we grew revenues by more than 20%, breaking through the $1 billion level for the first time in 2010. However, we're not resting on our laurels, and we think we have the opportunity to create a lot more growth, both through the sale of existing products and by exploring new products and new segments.
In summary, 2010 was a year of new products, accelerated growth and record free cash flow. We look forward to the challenges and opportunities of the new year, as we strive to better serve our customers and continue our quest to be the open, transparent, shareholder-friendly company that our owners expect.
I want to acknowledge the terrific job that Rob has done as our CFO in the past three years. I have full confidence in him as he takes on the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. For the next several months, as we conduct the search for his successor as CFO, Rob will do double duty. 
So now let me turn it over to Rob, who will give you some additional details on the financial performance."

As Glenn said, 2010 was a really good year for Time Warner Cable. We grew full year revenues by over 5.5%, as residential subscription revenues increased nearly 4%, while commercial and advertising revenues each jumped over 20%. Adjusted OIBDA growth accelerated to nearly 6% in 2010, reflecting our strong revenue growth and slightly higher margins. Operating income was up over 11%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased 21%, and free cash flow was up over 19% to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share.
Diluted EPS increased over 19% to $3.64, exceeding what we projected at the beginning of the year. True to our commitment, we continued to actively manage our balance sheet. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders during 2010, paying cash dividends of $576 million and repurchasing $515 million of our common stock. And demonstrating our confidence in our business, this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share or $1.92 on an annualized basis.
Let's move on to Q4 subscriber trends in the next slide. Before I get into the numbers, let me say a few words about the environment in which we're operating. While we've seen some modest improvement in certain macroeconomic indicators in several of our regions, overall, we continue to feel the effects of weak housing and high unemployment across our footprint. The competitive landscape also remained pretty much the same in Q4. The telcos continued their fiber build-outs, but probably at the slowest pace we've seen since they began.
We estimate that U-verse is now marketing video to about 24% of our footprint and FiOS to about 10%. Marketing and promotional intensity among our telco and satellite competitors was pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. For our part, we broadly executed on our $33 x 3 Triple Play marketing program, targeting both new and existing customers.
So let's turn to our sub performance. We added 94,000 high-speed data subscribers in the quarter, bringing total HSD subscriber base to over 9.8 million or 35.8% of passings. That's a five 5.5% year-over-year increase in our HSD sub base. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve, as customers continue to choose our higher-speed tiers. We added 147,000 Turbo and 5,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And for the first time this quarter, our total Turbo and Wideband subs combined exceeded our aggregate basic and light tier customers. Commercial HSD net adds were 11,000, which was more than 5x year-ago net adds.
As I've previewed on our third quarter call, Digital Phone net adds rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, as we more aggressively marketed the Triple Play bundle. Total Digital Phone net adds were 72,000, and we ended the quarter with almost 4.5 million total voice subscribers, 16.7% of homes passed and a 6.5% increase from the end of 2009. We had 11,000 Business Class Phone net adds in the quarter for a total of 111,000. That's more than double the number of subs we had 18 months ago.
Video subscriber performance continued to be impacted by the challenging competitive and economic environment. For the quarter, we had a net decline of 141,000 video subscribers. The video sub declines were once again driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers. Actually, net additions for both digital video subscribers and bundled video subscribers were positive during the quarter. In addition, there were some signs of life in the Pay TV category, as we added 77,000 pay units. That's the first growth in pay units we've experienced in 10 quarters. Demand for DVR has also picked up in Q4. Net adds of 47,000 were significantly better than in Q3.
Primary Service unit net adds were a positive 25,000 for the quarter, an improvement from the third quarter loss. PSU churn was flat year-over-year. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on getting customers into bundles and had 72,000 Triple Play net adds during Q4, up from 64,000 in last year's fourth quarter. At quarter end, just under 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. Once again, we fared much better with our more affluent customers, our highest income segments drove the net gains in Triple Plays, while our lower-income segments accounted for most of the declines in singles and doubles.
Despite the challenging economic and competitive environment, full year 2010 PS unit additions were 344,000, with 515,000 HSD net adds and 278,000 Digital Phone net adds, offset by 449,000 video net losses. So far, this January's sub-performance looks a lot like January of 2010. But remember that the bulk of the net adds last year occurred in February and March, so it's still really early to project Q1 subs.
Let's turn to our financial results and start with revenue on the next slide. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, and full year revenue increased 5.6% to $18.9 billion. During the fourth quarter, total subscription revenue, that's residential and commercial combined, grew 4.6%, driven by increased PSUs and a 3.1% increase in subscription ARPU per PSU. Advertising revenue increased nearly 34%. In dollar terms, total revenues was $269 million higher than in Q4 '09, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $68 million coming from Advertising and $56 million coming from Commercial.
Let's first focus on residential subscription revenue on Slide 6. Fourth quarter residential subscription revenue grew 3.5%, and full-year residential subscription revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year with both driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year residential subscription revenue growth in Q4, HSD contributed 60% or $87 million, with video and Digital Phone contributing 25% and 15%, respectively.
Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, culminating in Q4 growth of 8.7% over last year's fourth quarter. The growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a year-over-year increase of close to 3% in residential HSD ARPU. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we benefited from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I talked about earlier. Residential video revenue increased as a result of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by the decline in video subs. Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q4 '09. Residential voice revenue grew 4.5% due to continued subscriber growth. Year-over-year ARPU declined just 1.2%, which was the smallest decline in the last couple of years. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to commercial revenue on the next slide. We're very pleased with the progress we made in our Commercial business in 2010. We set out to deliver commercial subscription revenue growth of more than 20% for the year, and we did just that. Fourth quarter commercial revenue was just under $300 million, a 23% increase over Q4 '09, marking the highest-growth quarter of the year. Full year commercial revenue was more than $1.1 billion, up 21.1% versus 2009. Each of commercial data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul contributed about 30% of the $56 million year-over-year revenue improvement in the fourth quarter, with video revenue accounting for the balance. Commercial data revenue increased almost 13%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Business Class Phone revenue increased nearly 73%, driven by subscriber growth, and cell tower backhaul revenue in the fourth quarter was $26 million. That's as much cell backhaul revenue as we generated for all of 2009. As of quarter end, our total installed base was 6,100 radios, and we had a meaningful backlog of radios under contract.
We continue to make investments in our commercial capabilities throughout the year. And in 2011, we are focused on continuing to improve sales productivity and increasing service ability to expand the number of commercial establishments we reach. We expect these investments to enable us to continue to drive commercial revenue growth in 2011 at a rate similar to what we achieved in 2010.
Moving to the next slide. We had a terrific year in advertising, topped off by a fourth quarter in which we generated an all-time high $269 million in ad revenue, up 33.8% over Q4 of 2009 and up 39% on a per video subscriber basis. Full year ad revenues of $881 million were 25.5% greater than in 2009.
Strong political advertising certainly helped the cause. We generated $42 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Political accounted for half the growth in the quarter and about 30% of the growth for the full year. That said, non-political advertising revenues grew strongly in their own right, up around 18% for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, the automotive category generated a little over $50 million, and media advertising added about $45 million, both jumping well over 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we they began to benefit from our new ad-rep deal with FiOS, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in the New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas markets in exchange for a percentage of the revenue generated. We expect that the FiOS deal and others like it will increasingly contribute to ad revenues in 2011. As we look forward, given strength in our core Advertising business and our new ad-rep deals, we do expect that we'll be able to grow ad revenues in 2011, despite the usual non-election year fall-off in political advertising.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 9. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 1.6% to $1.7 billion, and full year adjusted OIBDA increased 5.9% to $6.9 billion, right in line with what we projected on our last earnings call. Full year margins improved 10 basis points.
Total fourth quarter operating expenses grew 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The growth in OpEx and the resulting margin contraction and slowdown in adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter were driven by a number of items that I'll walk you through, several of which I've mentioned previously. First, bad debt expense was up in the quarter due to the reversal of a reserve in Q4 '09, which significantly lowered bad debt in that quarter. Similarly, casualty insurance expense increased year-over-year due to a favorable adjustment to casualty insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, fourth quarter employee expense was increased by an executive severance charge. Additionally, fourth quarter cost of revenues increased due to the reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. And finally, as expected, wireless losses and programming expenses grew faster in the fourth quarter than they did in prior quarters. In aggregate, these items accounted for a $90 million swing in year-over-year adjusted OIBDA.
Programming expense increased 7.2% for the quarter, as video subscriber declines only partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental retrans costs. Remember that Q4 was the first full quarter under our new Disney contract. For the full year, programming costs increased 5.4% in aggregate and 8.2% on a per subscriber basis. We expect total programming cost growth will be in the same ballpark in 2011.
Employee costs were up 3.9% year-over-year in Q4, reflecting higher commercial headcount and compensation expenses and the executive severance cost I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter marketing expense of $166 million was $11 million higher than last year. Marketing spending for the fourth quarter and the full-year remained fairly constant at about 3.5% of revenues. Voice costs were up 5.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subscribers. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. The financial benefits of this process will flow in as our Digital Phone subscribers are migrated to the new platform over the next several years. When we're all done, we expect to see our voice costs cut roughly in half.
We continued to invest in wireless in Q4. As of today, we're offering our wireless data service in almost 3/4 of our footprint, and we have almost 15,000 subscribers. Still early days, but as Glenn mentioned, we're gaining key insights into the Wireless business, as well as the wireless needs and desires of our customers. Q4 wireless losses were approximately $20 million, and full-year losses were around $50 million. In 2011, we plan to continue investing in wireless, as well as several other new initiatives, including, as Glenn mentioned, our Smart Home Security offering. We expect our total 2011 startup losses from wireless, home security and other new business projects to be in the $75 million range.
Before I move on to CapEx, I should note that operating income for the quarter increased 11.6% to $994 million, driven by higher adjusted OIBDA and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense. For the full year, operating income grew 11.2% to $3.7 billion. Looking forward to 2011, we expect once again to generate double-digit operating income growth.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to make great strides in enhancing our products and services in 2010. We completed the rollout of Switch Digital, launched Look Back across our footprint, deployed over 1.5 million HD set-top boxes, added to our DOCSIS 3.0 passings, continued the rollout of wireless data and invested heavily in our Commercial business, and we accomplished all this while still reducing the overall capital intensity of our business for the full year by 260 basis points to 15.5% of revenue. Our capital spending in the fourth quarter was $782 million, bringing our full-year CapEx to $2.9 billion, consistent with our full-year guidance and down approximately 9% from the full year 2009.
Full year residential capital expenditures were 14.6% of residential revenue, and were down nearly 15% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by declines in CPE, support capital and scalable infrastructure. Commercial CapEx was $470 million, up nearly 34%, with about 40% of the commercial CapEx attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Looking forward to 2011, we'll continue to spend more on our Commercial business as the residential capital intensity continues to decline. And once again, we expect that full year capital spending will be less than $3 billion.
Onto cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the fourth quarter was $956 million, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of $3.9 billion for the full-year 2010, a 21% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow for the quarter was $665 million, driving our full-year free cash flow to $2.3 billion or $6.35 per diluted share. Full-year free cash flow increased 19% over 2009, as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions and working capital requirements more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $351 million and an increase in cash interest of $138 million. Remarkably, for the full year, we converted more than 95% of incremental adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. For 2011, including the benefit of the bonus depreciation, we're expecting another year of double-digit free cash flow growth.
Turning to the next slide. Full year diluted earnings per share of $3.64 increased 19% from $3.05 in 2009 and exceeded the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of 2010. Looking forward, we expect that 2011 full-year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 per share range.
Moving to the balance sheet. During 2010, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $576 million or $1.60 per share in dividends, and bought back $515 million of common stock during November and December alone. Through yesterday, we repurchased almost $750 million worth of TWC common stock. Even after returning capital to shareholders, our year-end net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.4 billion, a reduction of $1.2 billion from year-end 2009. Our leverage ratio at year end was 2.96x.
And last, but certainly not least, as Glenn discussed, we're very pleased to have announced this morning a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. That's $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, which at yesterday's closing stock price represents a 2.8% dividend yield.
So to summarize. We performed very well in 2010 from an operational and financial perspective. We generated substantial free cash flow, invested in our business for future growth and returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. And we entered 2011 well-positioned to compete and to deliver strong growth in operating income, free cash flow and EPS.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

First of all, on usage-based pricing, I think I've been pretty consistent over several years on that. The good thing about broadband is that the usage is growing very rapidly as it has ever since we started the business in 1996. So people are finding it more useful. They're doing different things that make their lives better. That has, and will over time, require incremental investment by all of the infrastructure providers. And I think that implies that over time, as speeds get faster and faster and what have you, that there'll be upwards pressure on prices. I think a corollary of that is there is clearly a distribution in how people use the Internet. Some use it a lot more, some use it a lot less. And I think you're going to see over time that people who use it less will desire and expect to pay less than people who use it more. For our part, obviously, we paid attention to the announcements by the SEC. We're watching the market, and you are seeing in the wireless space, the beginnings of volume-based pricing. So we'll keep touching that and stay tuned. On wireless, again, I think we've been pretty consistent. We are basically exploring whether packaging wireless data with our Wireline offerings is something that consumers want and if there's a formula that people want. So we're trying different models, different products, what have you. And to date, I would say our results are not very impressive and pretty inconclusive. So we're going to stick with that for a while. We're trying to spend not too much money while we're doing it. So that's basically what we're up to."

But we decreased the number of Triple Play subs and increased our customer relationships, so both the numerator and denominator resulted in a lower-bundled percentage. But that's not reflective of activity in the quarter.

There's been a lot of reading about Internet backbone economics recently in CDNs. And I think there's a lot of confusion about it. And quite frankly, the way that the economics of the money back and fourth is pretty arcane. But I think to simplify it, just start with the idea of the Internet is a collection of a bunch of privately-owned networks that are interconnected using standards. That's all it is, there's nothing -- the Internet per se doesn't exist. It's a collection of things. So each of these private networks generates traffic and receives traffic, and has different negotiated relationships with the people that it interconnects with. In general, if somebody is handing off and receiving roughly equivalent amounts of traffic, there's also an agreement not to charge because the bookkeeping is more expensive than what it's worth. But usually, if the traffic is out of balance, then whoever is delivering more traffic pays the other party. Again, I'm making broad generalizations. So that's how it works. And in the world of telecom, that's quite common, and that's how it's worked for many, many years. So there's nothing really new here other than people were delving into it in public more than they have before."

If you step way back from all of this, the only reason we have set-top boxes is that there are a vast array of TV receivers in place in people's homes. And most of them, historically, can't receive and display all of our services because they don't really have any intelligence. They're just display devices. And they receive all different -- they use all different standards and they have different kinds of input places and what have you. So the only reason we have set-top boxes is to make sure that our services can be displayed. So the set-top boxes have intelligence, they can do things like display program guides, and they can also decrypt signals that are encrypted for piracy protection. What we are seeing is a new generation of consumer electronics devices that have intelligence in them. And I think that's just going to get more and more as we go forward. That's number one. And number two, they are standardizing around a series of hardware inputs and around Internet Protocol, which is nothing but a bunch of standards. So that means that we can deliver television to those devices and deliver new innovative user interfaces that can be changed rapidly using these standards, so in effect, you get rid of the need for a set-top box, which we would just as soon not have in the first place. I think that we demonstrated this at CES. So couple of consumer benefits. One is, all of these devices, and there's an array of them, it's not just TVs, but it's tablets like the iPad and the Galaxy Tablet and so on. Blu-ray players now have this intelligence in them. So you're beginning to see, you can see video on any video display in the home. And all we have to do is simulcast using IP standards, just like we simulcast on analog and paid digital today. And then, we need to be able to redo our user interface very rapidly, which we can using our IP Internet kind of standard. So I think this is a win-win for the consumer. And for us, over a very long time period, as these devices replace all of the TVs that are in people's homes today, which is obviously a couple of decades at the minimum. But over a very long time period, we may be able to not have set-tops at all. And that means a less capital-intensive business, fewer service goals and happier consumers. So I think this is all good."

And so I'm just wondering if you think that the industry is becoming more or less aligned? There is also an article in the Journal about Hulu launching a sort of virtual cable operator product if they can convince their owners to do it. And actually, when you think about your IP-delivered video service you were just talking about in the last question, and certainly, a lot of people could probably do that who don't necessarily own a network to sort of play the string out. So just curious, when you think about where the media companies are in your negotiations and you think about the contracts you're signing, are we in a better place or worse place than we were six, nine months ago? And what do you think is happening at the customer level as we get all these internet-connected TVs sold? And obviously, your product development path is aimed at trying to address a lot of that.

So I think everybody in this space is a little confused about what's going to happen including consumers and companies, investors, et cetera. I actually think -- and we go through waves of this and we certainly went through one in the late '90s, and everybody gets enamored with new things. I think it is useful to step back and think about it all on a common sense way. So if you think about all forms of media, they are delivered in some physical way, going back to movies and movie theaters. And historically, those two -- the retailer sort of bundled together the content and the physicality. You don't go to a movie theater and pay one price to rent the seat and another one to buy the movie. You buy a ticket and you get both. So all of the things you're talking about are really attempts to separate the sale of content from the sale of the physical infrastructure. You need both. You can't survive without both. And really, what's happening is you're creating new middleman in a business that if you start at the production level, there's already a whole lot of middlemen. And I think the question is whether there is any real value added there by creating yet a new group of middlemen. And maybe all they have is better user interfaces, which is why we're addressing that. So I think it's all very alluring, but I think when you step back and say what's really going on here? Is there any real value being created? And therefore, is it sustainable? I think it's pretty questionable. So we'll see how it plays out, again, uses our infrastructure. So it's not a horrible thing for us at the end of today."

So they're using a very clever interface on the web and the first-sale doctrine and the power of subscriptions, which we all know about.

On price increases, I think Glenn hit this in various of his comments. But as customers continue to use HSD for more bandwidth-intensive applications and require more and more speed and place a greater value in short on what it is we're offering, it stands to reason that, that value will correlate with their willingness to pay more for the service. So we feel that, that should drive an ability to increase prices going forward. With respect to voice, the process by which we migrate away from the Sprint contract and onto our own platform for providing support functions will occur over really the next four years through 2014. So the first year where we'll see the full run rate, full year benefit of the entire project is 2015. And what I've said is that when we get to that point in time, we'll see our voice costs essentially cut in half. It's probably best to speak of it in those terms because margins carry with it some assumptions about revenue, and I don't think we're prepared to make those assumptions over a five-year time horizon."

We're off to a good start in 2011, with first quarter revenue growth of 5% and Adjusted OIBDA growth of almost 4%. Products ARPU growth was strong across the board and subscription performance display seasonal strengths. 
I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our high-speed data product, both product mix and ARPU growth trends continue to be very favorable. And since quarter end, we have crossed that 10 million subscriber threshold. High-speed data is quickly becoming the anchor products in the eyes of our customers.
Each of growth continue to accelerated and we're pleased with our progress in this space. Our advertising business coming off dramatic growth rates in 2010 continue to grow its revenue at double digit rates. We continue to generate a lot of free cash flow. And in the first quarter, we used our cash to repurchase shares and pay increased dividend, returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders. 
This is really exciting time in our business. New technology is making it possible for us to provide a better video experience to our customers, one that gives them more control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our iPad app which we launched last month to overwhelmingly positive consumer reviews. In its first month, 350,000 iPad users downloaded the app. We started with 30 linear channel simulcast over our cable network and we now have more than 70 channels. By year-end, we plan to offer nearly all of the linear cable channels, as well as broadcast channels at several of our biggest cities and a lot of on-demand content. 
I want to emphasize that our iPad app is not a one-off product. Rather, we are investing in a development process and the development team that will introduce new capabilities to our customers in rapid succession.
In the next month or so, we're planning to release an update that will add remote control capability and the ability to remotely program DVRs. The consumer electronics industry is embracing the idea of devices such as smart TVs with built-in intelligence and two-way communications capability, all built in IP standards. The technology that we're using to simulcast videos to iPads will eventually feed all is the space is and over time, it is mainly to a world without set-tops which we think could enable a much better customer experience. 
However, without ignoring our traditional video environment built around mpeg and analog standards, later this year, we're planning to watch a new navigation application which will be hosted in our network instead on our set-tops providing a much more intuitive and graphically rich search environment in our customers using our set-top boxes. 
Turning to the B2B space, we recently closed another set acquisition. We expect those to jumpstart our ability to sell managed and how they services into the Small and Medium Business space by bundling their services with our primary offerings, we hope to attract new customers, increase ARPU and reduce churn. 
Before closing, I should mention that during the quarter, we signed a long-term agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers to carry their games on 2 new Time Warner Cable RSMs. 1 in English and 1 in Spanish. And those will start in 2012, 2013 season. This is a unique opportunity to gain greater control over our economic destiny and enhance our brand in Los Angeles, with both English and Spanish-speaking audiences. 
In summary, our business continues to perform well. We are investing thoughtfully and strategically to further improve the value of our services to both residential and business customers. And of course, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. So now let me turn it over to Rob for more details."

We're off to a good start in 2011, with improving subscriber trends and very solid financial results. First quarter revenue was particularly strong, rising 5% year-over-year, as residential subscription revenue increased 3.5%, commercial or B2B revenue growth accelerated to over 23% and advertising revenue grew almost 14%. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew over 3.5% in the quarter and operating income was up almost 15%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased over 14% to a record $1.1 billion and free cash flow was up over 42% to $927 million or $2.65 per diluted share. 
Diluted EPS increased to 55% to $0.93. We returned just under a $1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter through our cash dividend and share repurchases. And finally, we remain on track to meet all elements of our full year financial guidance. 
As Glen mentioned, we closed our have a set acquisition on April 21 and will include their financial results with ours going forward. However, I would note that our financial guidance is all based on our organic performance and does not include have a site results or any of the was associated with the acquisition. 
Let's move on to our Q1 subscriber trends on the next slide. While the economy doesn't appear to have gotten worst for the quarter, unemployment and housing vacancy rates remain high across our footprint. The competitive environment hasn't changed significantly either, as marketing and promotional activities among our telco and satellite competitors continued to be in touch. The pace of telco fiber builds continue to slow and we estimate that AT&T as the marketing U-verse of videos of roughly 24% of our footprint while Verizon is offering FiOS TV at about 10%. 
In the first quarter, we continued to broadly execute variations in our 33 by 3 triple play offer to both new and existing customers. In addition, we began to refocus and marketing on the individual products within the bundle, especially HSD 
To target those customers that maybe less receptive to the full Triple Play. 
As I mentioned, subscriber trends improved in the first quarter. Total primary service units increased by 208,000 and while that's fewer win at add than in last year's first quarter, it's the best year-over-year the performance we delivered in more than a year. 
Churn was up about 10 basis points year-over-year, but was down sequentially in each PSU category. And although it's early in the quarter, let me say a word about Q2 subs. As you know, the second quarter is seasonally weaker than the first. But on a year-over-year basis, so far Q2 is looking a lot like Q1. 
High-speed data once again comprised the majority of Primary Service Unit net adds in the quarter. We added 189,000 HD subscribers and finished the quarter with just shy of 10 million total HSD subs or 36.5%. That's a 5.1% year-over-year increase in our HSD subscriber base. As Glen mentioned, we crossed the 10 million mark shortly after the -- quarter and. 
We continue to gain a just be share during the first quarter. on a size-adjusted basis, we again added significantly more HSD subs in both AT&T and Verizon. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve with more customers taking higher-speed tears. We added 136,000 Turbo and 9,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. 
Our Wideband net adds while a small portion of the total were nearly double our Q4 net adds largely driven by our new Signature Home offering which includes Wideband in many markets. 
Close to 16% of our residential HSD subbase now take Turbo our Wideband. Commercial ages the net at accelerated for the second that the could have quarter to 12,000. 
We continue to see good results in Digital Phone. Net adds were 84,000 and we ended the quarter with almost $4.6 million total voice subscribers, a 6.1% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, our voice penetration reached 17% of total phone passage. We had 12,000 commercial voice net adds in the quarter for a total subscriber base of 123,000. 
Although we lost 65,000 video subs for the full quarter, we actually added video subs in the seasonally strong month of March. Once again, we lost lower end analog single play customers while we added higher end digital and bundled video subs. We did well with our Spanish-language offering adding about 20,000 of the puzzle subscribers in the quarter, with particular strength in Texas and Southern California. 
DVR net adds were 42,000 and premium channel net adds for about 45,000 in the quarter. We added 26,000 customer relationships in the quarter and continue to have success with our bundled offerings adding 83,000 Triple Play subs up from 73,000 in last year's first quarter and increasing our Double Play subscriber count by 17,000. At quarter end, almost 50% of our customers were either double or triple plays. 
As you are aware, we introduced a couple of new offerings late in the fourth quarter of last year. Signature Home, our high-end Triple Play, coupling our best products with customized service and TV Essentials, a value-oriented video offering for those customers that prefer fewer channels at a lower price points. 
While it's still too early to draw conclusions, let me give you some preliminary observations. Signature Home sales have ramped each month since December launch and we now have roughly 10,000 subscribers paying an average of $210 per month. During that quarter, 70% of the Signature Home connect were existing Triple Play customers who upgraded to Signature Home. On average, those customers are paying us about $20 per month more than they did previously. 
Perhaps as important as the subscriber stats, is the extremely positive customer feedback we've received. We think we've started a quarter here with a high end customer and we're excited about the prospect prospects. 
As for TV Essentials, we launched the year and only 2 markets are the numbers there are small. But it appears to be as effective as a targeted acquisitions and retention tool among some customer segments and is an upgrade offer for basic-only customers. We're in the process of evaluating how to expand deployment of the offering across our footprint. 
Turning to our financial results in the next slide. First quarter revenue was especially strong, increasing 5% year-over-year to $4.8 billion. Total subscription revenue, that's residential and B2B combined, grew 4.6%, driven by both ARPU improvement and increased PSUs. Subscription ARPU for PSU increased 3.4%, the highest year-over-year improvement in more than 3 years, driven by ARPU growth in each PSU category. 
Advertising revenue increased almost 14% and total offer for customer relationship was 5.6% versus last year's first quarter to over $111. In dollar terms, total revenues were $228 million higher than in Q1 of '10, with $145 million of that growth coming from our residential Subscription business, $59 million coming from B2B and $24 million coming from advertising. 
Let's focus first on our residential Subscription business on Slide 6. Residential subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year residential subscription revenue growth, HSD contributed about 2/3 or $97 million and Digital Phone and video contributed roughly equal shares of the balance. 
Residential HSD revenue increased 9.4% over Q1 of last year and 3.5% double of Q4. Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth has accelerated in each of the last 5 quarters and sequential HSD revenue growth was the best in over 3 years. 
The year-over-year growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as the nearly 4% improvement in residential HSD ARPU. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we continue to benefit from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I mentioned earlier. 
Residential voice revenue grew more than 5.5% year-over-year due to continued subscriber growth. On a sequential basis, residential voice revenue growth was the highest in more than 18 months. Notably, residential voice ARPU was up year-over-year for the first time ever. 
Residential video revenue grew about 1% year-over-year, despite our smaller video subscriber base, as residential video ARPU increased about 4.5% from Q1 of '10. The ARPU improvement was the product of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, offset by lower transactional VOD and premium revenues. 
Moving on to commercial or B2B revenue on Slide 7. We had another very strong quarter in our B2B operations. B2B is an increasingly important engine of growth, contributing more than a quarter of our total year-over-year revenue improvement in Q1. As I mentioned at year end, we are focused on improving sales productivity and expanding the number of commercial establishments we reach with our plan. We are also focused on increasing the number of B2B customers that take more than 1 service from us. At quarter end, 2/3 of our roughly 450,000 B2B customers were single play, so it's a nice opportunity there. 
B2B revenue for the quarter was $313 million, up 23% over Q1 of 2010. That marks our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year B2B revenue growth. Of the $59 million of year-over-year growth, data contributed about 30% or $23 million and voice of contributed just under 30% each. B2B data revenue increased more than 15%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. B2B voice revenue increased over 60%, driven by subscriber growth. And that will revenue was $28 billion more than double our revenues in Q1 of '10. 
At quarter end, we had an install base of nearly 6,400 revenue-generating radios at a meaningful backlog under contract. So we are well on our way to achieving organic growth similar to what we achieved in 2010. 
Finally, we closed on our acquisition of Nava site last week which will jumpstart our entry into the enterprise-focused management cloud Services business and it has the suite of product that we offer our existing SMB customers. As I mentioned at the outset, Nava site results are not included in the B2B revenue or other financial guidance we provided. 
Moving on to advertising revenue in the next slide. Advertising revenue of $197 million increased $24 million or almost 14% year-over-year despite a drop in political advertising. Strength in the automotive category which grew 35% and media advertising which increased almost 55% accounted for about 85% of the year-over-year increase. 
First quarter ad revenue benefited from our add wrap deal with Verizon under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas. We booked the revenue from the sale of FiOS inventory on a gross basis and regression share of that revenue as an expense so the revenue from this deal had a lower margin of the revenue from selling our own added. 
During the first quarter, we also signed an ad wrap deal with AT&T U-verse and we'll start to see the benefit of that deal in Q4. We still expect the full year ad revenue will be greater than in 2010. But remember that the comps get much tougher as the year progresses given that we generated $55 million from political advertising in the second half of last year. 
Let's turn to Adjusted OIBDA and operating income on Slide 9. First quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.6% to $1.7 billion while operating income almost 14% to $975 million. Our Adjusted OIBDA margin fell 40 basis points versus Q1 of last year, as improved revenue mix and better voice and HSD gross margins were not enough to offset lower video gross margins, higher wireless and home security investments compared to the first quarter of last year and an increase in consulting spend related to our strategic sourcing initiatives that will yield both operating expense and CapEx savings during the year. 
Operating income margin improved 170 basis points year-over-year to 22.2% driven by a significant decline in amortization expense. Total first quarter operating expense grew 5.7% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 5.9% year-over-year, driven by annual salary increases across all of our businesses, higher headcount primarily in B2B and higher payroll taxes. B2B employee cost was 25.4% while residential employee expenses were up 4%. 
Programming expense increased 2.6% in aggregate and 6.4% on a per subscriber basis. Less than recent quarters due in part to the reversal of an $18 million accrual for programming services previously carried without a contract. We continue to expect total programming cost growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as 2010. 
Voice costs were up only 3.1% in Q1 as we began to benefit from the migration of customers off of our spring contract. As of the end of Q1, we have migrated roughly a quarter of our phone customers and we expect to move another 20% by the end of Q2. As a result, voice cost improvements should be even greater in the back half of the year. 
When we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our pre-migration voice cost cut roughly in half. First quarter marketing expense of $159 million was $8 million higher than last year and remained constant at 3.3% of revenues. 
During the first quarter, we continue to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new Smart Home Security offering. In Q1, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $15 million compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives over the course of the year and still expect our total 2011 start up losses to be at $75 million range. 
Looking forward, we expect that Adjusted OIBDA growth will be greater in the second half of the year, and we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year. 
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. First quarter CapEx was $663 million or 13.7% of revenues. Total CapEx was down about 10% year-over-year in part due to the timing of expenditures. We also benefited from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce per unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain. 
First quarter residential capital expenditures were 12.7% of residential revenues and were down about 11% year-over-year to $550 million due primarily to lower CPE as set-top box spending declined over 40%, driven by both reduced volumes and lower per unit prices. 
B2B capital expenditures were $113 million, flat with last year's first quarter. Roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our backlog footprints. While capital intensity in the first quarter was our lowest ever, we expect CapEx to be back end loaded this year. For the full year, we still expect to capital spending will be less than $3 billion. 
Moving onto cash flow in the next slide. Our cash flow by any measure has never been stronger. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the first quarter was $1.1 billion or 14% year-over-year increase and an all-time high. The $133 million of growth was the result of $60 million of year-over-year improvement in Adjusted OIBDA and a $73 million decrease in CapEx. 
Free cash flow for the quarter which benefited from a $270 million tax refund, related to overpayments in 2010 was $927 million, up 42% year-over-year. Free cash flow per share increased almost 45% to $2.65. Because of the tax refund and because we will continue to benefit from 100% bonus depreciation throughout the year, on a net basis, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes during 2011. 
As we said in our last call, with these tax benefits, we expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year. Just a reminder, as you model 2012 and beyond, the bonus depreciation benefits we're enjoying this year will reverse in future years, resulting in less tax depreciation and higher cash taxes. 
Turning to the next slide. First quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.93 increased 55% from $0.60 in Q1 of '10, primarily due to an increase in operating income, a decrease in book taxes and a modest benefit from share repurchases which will partially offset by higher net interest and other expenses. 
Both this year and last year's first quarters were impacted by a number of items highlighted in our press release. Most notably, EPS in both quarters was reduced by a non-cash charge to reverse previously recognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain Time Warner and stock options held by Time Warner Cable employees. The impact in this quarter was $0.06 per share. 
We continue to expect the 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 range. 
Let's finish up with a balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $20.3 billion essentially flat with year end 2010. Our leverage ratio was 2.93x. 
During the quarter, we returned $996 million to shareholders to our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $167 million or $0.48 a share in dividends and brought back 12 million shares of common stock or $829 million during the first quarter. Since we launched the repurchase program in November of 2010. Through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased 20 million shares at an average price of $67 per share for a total of $1.3 billion. This leaves about $2.7 billion remaining in our authorization. 
So to summarize. We're off to a strong start in 2011, both from an operational and a financial perspective. As a result, we expect to deliver strong growth in our full year operating income free cash flow and EPS. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

And so the things that drove the some of lower margins in the first quarter we were 1, we spent or on our new business initiatives in particular wireless and our home security initiatives in Q1 relative to Q1 of last year. We had some consulting expenses in connection with what we call our strategic sourcing initiatives which is really an initiative designed to improve both OpEx and CapEx. The benefits this quarter primary showed up and the CapEx line. And it's a contingent kind of an arrangement so when we save money, we've been a little bit of consulting so that's what we are you seeing there. Would it have a Delta in bad debt year-over-year of nothing meaningful to talk about their relatively small numbers. And lastly, the other driver I think relates to increases in compensation expense really primarily related to our continued ramp up of our B2B capability. So those are really -- times that are driving the 40 basis point a Delta and margins. But again for the full year, were thinking pretty flat to last year."

That's a great question, Ben. Essentially, what's going on is the consumer electronics industry is embracing devices with video displays and them and also have intelligence and have two-way radios and that are all built around the IP standard. And in the sense that's nothing magical about the IP standard versus paid or anything else. Just a bunch of standards that the world is coalescing around. So these devices and is also different thing is just tablet, there are Smart TV's that are in the market now and at least the of those PCs or what have you. And I think that the pressure from the past that the old TVs which received different standards TV by different standards those were relatively dominated a little or no intelligence with and they weren't really two-way devices. And that's why we always have set-tops because those devices could display our services without set-tops. So what we have is a possibility of transmitting our services to these devices having much better navigation using a combination of the intelligence of the device and the intelligence back in our network. Doing security and software instead of hardware and essentially getting rid of set-tops. So although the initial application was for the iPad and you're right, not everybody has an iPad. I think the bigger story here is about the TVs which we're all going to be receiving our video service this way. This isn't the public Internet.  It's essentially simulcasting the signals over our cable system. Just like today, we simulcast the several different other formats. So that's what we're doing. I think question is right on. It's going to be a better customer experience."

And then on the economics on the cost, my recollection of this, Glenn is that you guys have from the government, the ability to pass through the cost of the set-top box and to the extent to move away from that that you don't have that kind of costs returned to you with the profit margin, does that mean that we end up with less revenue issue move to this IT world where you're going to have to incur an expense on the cost as you develop this new consumer-friendly product?"

And not going to talk about any specific programming deals except to put that in context. And again this is a simulcast and I think there is great confusion about technology which is changing quickly. And there's a tendency of whatever anybody says IP for mass hysteria everybody thinks it's the Internet but IP is a setup standards and it's being used and also to different devices and also the different ways. And the use of it doesn't mean it's the public Internet. And I think that's important here. This is the way TV is going to be distributed in the future. It's not going to be new and different. We're not going to have analog anymore after a while. And so of those old forms of digital are going to migrate the IP and is  that different ways with encoding, It's not magic. Across the set-tops. it's an interesting thing. There is a residual price regulation of set-tops in places where there is an effect the competition. And there's a statutory rate of return according to our formula. It doesn't mean that we or others actually charge that amount of money. And is also not relevant whether it's an effective competition which is much of our footprint. Having said that, I think if we move to a world without set-tops, you are right, we are probably have lower revenue because we do charge for them. We also have lower capital costs and maybe slightly long in this but I think about 40% of our service calls related to set-tops. And think about not having all those service calls. So my guess is although if we magically snapped our fingers and have no set-tops which will only happen for over many years, we would have a somewhat smaller balance sheet, somewhat smaller revenue, probably more profitable company and much happier customers. So that's what this is all about."

And if there are customers for 1 reason or another went into another provider for video, that by no means is that we're not interested in selling them data and voice ultimately, would like to upsell them into the full Triple Play. When I talked earlier about highlighting the attributes of our individual products, high-speed data is kind of first and foremost in my mind on that front.

We have high-definition digital and now we have IP. Those are just different versions of the same offering that you buy from us as subscription. Clearly in the home that's Time Warner Cable. The out of home experience is we're all calling TV Everywhere and the that goes over the public Internet. So it's really quite a different thing. Which means you have to go to a little website. So in ESPN's case it's their website, We do plan to have our own portal as we get more TV Everywhere rights. And I think it remains to be seen whether consumers will want to go to an aggregated portal with the retailer name like ours or go to a bunch of individual program or portals.

So Tuna the other member all the different questions you have on subsequent what it needs that would Triple Plays. I think first and foremost, the continued improvement in Triple Play penetration is a testament to the value proposition of the bundle. Certainly, where marketing is aggressively. But it's being marketed to a receptive audience.  Customers like what you get when they buy all of the product from us whether that attractive pricing, value for their money or some of the product attributes that are particularly unleashed when you have multiple products, things like caller ID on TV. I think it's about the marketing it's about a value of the product. As for B2B. 10 of the different phenomena but I wouldn't call them divergent trends at all. Remember that for the longtime, only sold was video to Borders and doctors' waiting rooms and when we began to offer in DH is the product, it's really started the high-growth era of our Commercial business. And much more recently, we started to sell voice. So I think the fact that we have a number of customers that only take high-speed data which is the predominant single play is more a function of the early stage of our voice business and that's why I say it's an opportunity provide think there's a particular reason why we can't sell additional products into customers provide a think the typical single, double, triple play terminology really applies quite as neatly to the Commercial businesses as it does to residential. So you shouldn't expect to see as we were talking about the especially when you add things like management services on top of connectivity to various customers. They don't lend themselves on PSU categories we use to talk about.
But I don't view of the bridging credit all provide you it is an opportunity in existing customer relationships that we build. But had a question on sequential trends through the quarter and I would say that the sequential trends in Q1 month-over-month were pretty good."

We're off to a good start in 2011, with first quarter revenue growth of 5% and Adjusted OIBDA growth of almost 4%. Products ARPU growth was strong across the board and subscription performance displayed seasonal strengths. 
I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our high-speed data product, both product mix and ARPU growth trends continue to be very favorable. And since quarter end, we have crossed the 10 million subscriber threshold. High-speed data is quickly becoming the anchor product in the eyes of our customers.
B2B growth continued to accelerate and we're pleased with our progress in this space. Our advertising business coming off dramatic growth rates in 2010 continue to grow its revenue at double digit rates. We continue to generate a lot of free cash flow. And in the first quarter, we used our cash to repurchase shares and pay an increased dividend, returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders. 
This is really exciting time in our business. New technology is making it possible for us to provide a better video experience to our customers, one that gives them more control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our iPad app, which we launched last month to overwhelmingly positive consumer reviews. In its first month, 360,000 iPad users downloaded the app. We started with 30 linear channels simulcast over our cable network and we now have more than 70 channels. By year end, we plan to offer nearly all of the linear cable channels, as well as broadcast channels in several of our biggest cities and a lot of on-demand content. 
I want to emphasize that our iPad app is not a oneoff product. Rather, we are investing in a development process and a development team that will introduce new capabilities to our customers in rapid succession.
In the next month or so, we're planning to release an update that will add remote control capability and the ability to remotely program DVRs. The consumer electronics industry is embracing the idea of devices such as smart TVs, with built-in intelligence and 2-way communications capability, all built in IP standards. The technology that we're using to simulcast videos to iPads will eventually feed all of these devices and over time, it is mainly to a world without set tops, which we think could enable a much better customer experience. 
However, without ignoring our traditional video environment built MPEG MPEG and analog standards, later this year, we're planning to launch a new navigation application, which will be hosted in our network instead of in our set-tops, providing a much more intuitive and graphically-rich search environment for millions our customers using our set-top boxes. 
Turning to the B2B space, we recently closed on the NaviSite acquisition. We expect NaviSite to jumpstart our ability to sell managed and cloud-based services into the small and medium business space. By bundling their services with our primary offerings, we hope to attract new customers, increase ARPU and reduce churn. 
Before closing, I should mention that during the quarter, we signed a long-term agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers to carry their games on 2 new Time Warner Cable owned RSNs. One in English and one in Spanish. And those will start with the 2012 to 2013 season. This is a unique opportunity to gain greater control over our economic destiny and enhance our brand in Los Angeles, with both English- and Spanish-speaking audiences. 
In summary, our business continues to perform well. We're investing thoughtfully and strategically to further improve the value of our services to both residential and business customers. And, of course, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. So now let me turn it over to Rob for more details."

We're off to a good start in 2011, with improving subscriber trends and very solid financial results. First quarter revenue was particularly strong, rising 5% year-over-year, as residential subscription revenue increased 3.5%, commercial or B2B revenue growth accelerated to over 23% and advertising revenue grew almost 14%. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew over 3.5% in the quarter and operating income was up almost 15%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased over 14% to a record $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was up over 42% to $927 million or $2.65 per diluted share. 
Diluted EPS increased 55% to $0.93. We returned just under a $1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter through our cash dividend and share repurchases. And finally, we remain on track to meet all elements of our full year financial guidance. 
As Glen mentioned, we closed our NaviSite acquisition on April 21, and will include their financial results with ours going forward. However, I would note that our financial guidance is all based on our organic performance and does not include NaviSite's results or any of the cost associated with the acquisition. 
Let's move on to our Q1 subscriber trends on the next slide. While the economy doesn't appear to have gotten worst during the quarter, unemployment and housing vacancy rates remain high across our footprint. The competitive environment hasn't changed significantly either, as marketing and promotional activities among our telco and satellite competitors continued to be intense. The pace of telco fiber buildouts continued to slow and we estimate that AT&T is still marketing U-verse videos to roughly 24% of our footprint, while Verizon is offering FiOS TV in about 10%. 
In the first quarter, we continued to broadly execute variations in our $33 by 3 Triple Play offer to both new and existing customers. In addition, we began to refocus our marketing on the individual products within the bundle, especially HSD  to target those customers that maybe less receptive to the full Triple Play 
As I mentioned, subscriber trends improved in the first quarter. Total primary service units increased by 208,000, and while that's fewer net add than in last year's first quarter, it's the best year-over-year sub [subscriber] performance we've delivered in more than a year. 
Churn was up about 10 basis points year-over-year, but was down sequentially in each PSU category. And although it's early in the quarter, let me say a word about Q2 subs. As you know, the second quarter is seasonally weaker than the first. But on a year-over-year basis, so far Q2 is looking a lot like Q1. 
High-speed data once again comprised the majority of Primary Service Unit net adds in the quarter. We added 189,000 HSD subscribers and finished the quarter with just shy of 10 million total HSD subs or 36.5% of passings. That's a 5.1% year-over-year increase in our HSD subscriber base. As Glen mentioned, we crossed the 10 million mark shortly after quarter end. 
We continue to gain HSD share during the first quarter. On a size-adjusted basis, we again added significantly more HSD subs than both AT&T and Verizon. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 136,000 Turbo and 9,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. 
Our Wideband net adds, while still a small portion of the total were nearly double our Q4 net adds, largely driven by our new Signature Home offering, which includes Wideband in many markets. 
Close to 16% of our residential HSD sub base now take Turbo or Wideband. Commercial HSD net adds accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to 12,000. 
We continue to see good results in Digital Phone. Net adds were 84,000 and we ended the quarter with almost $4.6 million total voice subscribers, a 6.1% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, our voice penetration reached 17% of total phone passings. We had 12,000 commercial voice net adds in the quarter for a total subscriber base of 123,000. 
Although we lost 65,000 video subs for the full quarter, we actually added video subs in the seasonally strong month of March. Once again, we lost lower-end analog single-play video customers, while we added higher-end digital and bundled video subs. We did well with our Spanish-language offering, adding about 20,000 El Paquetazo subscribers in the quarter, with particular strength in Texas and Southern California. 
DVR net adds were 42,000 and premium channel net adds were about 45,000 in the quarter. We added 26,000 customer relationships in the quarter and continue to have success with our bundled offerings, adding 83,000 Triple Play subs, up from 73,000 in last year's first quarter and increasing our Double Play subscriber count by 17,000. At quarter end, almost 60% of our customers were either double or triple plays. 
As you are aware, we introduced a couple of new offerings late in the fourth quarter of last year. Signature Home, our high-end Triple Play, coupling our best products with customized service  and TV Essentials, a value-oriented video offering for those customers that prefer fewer channels at a lower price point.
While it's still too early to draw up conclusions, let me give you some preliminary observations. Signature Home sales have ramped each month since the December launch and we now have roughly 10,000 subscribers paying an average of $210 per month. During the quarter, 70% of the Signature Home connect were existing Triple Play customers who upgraded to Signature Home. On average, those customers are paying us about $20 per month more than they did previously. 
Perhaps as important as the subscriber stats, is the extremely positive customer feedback we've received. We think we've struck a chord with the high-end customer and we're excited by the prospects. 
As for TV Essentials, we launched the tier in only 2 markets, so the numbers there are small. But it appears to be effective as a targeted acquisition and retention tool among some customer segments and as an upgrade offer for basic-only customers. We're in the process of evaluating how to expand the deployment of the offering across our footprint. 
Turning to our financial results on the next slide. First quarter revenue was especially strong, increasing 5% year-over-year to $4.8 billion. Total subscription revenue, that's residential and B2B combined, grew 4.6%, driven by both ARPU improvement and increased PSUs. Subscription ARPU for PSU increased 3.4%, the highest year-over-year improvement in more than 3 years, driven by ARPU growth in each PSU category. 
Advertising revenue increased almost 14% and total ARPU per customer relationship was 5.6% versus last year's first quarter to over $111. In dollar terms, total revenues were $228 million higher than in Q1 of '10, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $59 million coming from B2B and $24 million coming from advertising. 
Let's focus first on our Residential Subscription business on Slide 6. Residential Subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year Residential Subscription revenue growth, HSD contributed about 2/3 or $97 million and Digital Phone and video contributed roughly equal shares of the balance. 
Residential HSD revenue increased 9.4% over Q1 of last year and 3.5% over Q4. Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth has accelerated in each of the last 5 quarters and sequential HSD revenue growth was the best in over 3 years. 
The year-over-year growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as the nearly 4% improvement in residential HSD ARPU. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we continue to benefit from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I mentioned earlier. 
Residential voice revenue grew more than 5.5% year-over-year due to continued subscriber growth. On a sequential basis, residential voice revenue growth was the highest in more than 18 months. Notably, residential voice ARPU was up year-over-year for the first time ever. 
Residential video revenue grew about 1% year-over-year, despite our smaller video subscriber base, as residential video ARPU increased over 4.5% from Q1 of '10. The ARPU improvement was the product of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, offset by lower transactional VOD and premium revenues. 
Moving on to commercial or B2B revenue on Slide 7. We had another very strong quarter in our B2B operations. B2B is an increasingly important engine of growth, contributing more than 1/4 of our total year-over-year revenue improvement in Q1. As I mentioned at year end, we're focused on improving sales productivity and expanding the number of commercial establishments we reach with our plan. We're also focused on increasing the number of B2B customers that take more than one service from us. At quarter end, 2/3 of our roughly 450,000 B2B customers were single play, so there's a nice opportunity there. 
B2B revenue for the quarter was $313 million, up 23% over Q1 of 2010. That marks our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year B2B revenue growth. Of the $59 million of year-over-year growth, data contributed about 40% or $23 million and voice and cell tower backhaul contributed just under 30% each. B2B data revenue increased more than 15%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. B2B voice revenue increased over 60%, driven by subscriber growth. And cell tower backhaul revenue was $28 million more than double our revenues in Q1 of '10. 
At quarter end, we had an install base of nearly 6,400 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. So we're well on our way to achieving organic growth similar to what we achieved in 2010. 
Finally, we closed on our acquisition of NaviSite last week, which will jumpstart our entry into the enterprise-focused managed  and cloud services business and enhance the suite of products that we offer our existing SMB customers. As I mentioned at the outset, NaviSite results are not yet included in the B2B revenue or other financial guidance we've provided. 
Moving on to advertising revenue on the next slide. Advertising revenue of $197 million increased $24 million or almost 14% year-over-year despite a drop in political advertising. Strength in the automotive category, which grew 35% and media advertising, which increased almost 55% accounted for about 85% of the year-over-year increase. 
First quarter ad revenue benefited from our ad-rep deal with Verizon, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas. We booked the revenue from the sale of FiOS inventory on a gross basis and treat Verizon share of that revenue as an expense, so the revenue from this deal has a lower margin than revenue from selling our own ad inventory. 
During the first quarter, we also signed an ad-rep deal with AT&T U-verse and we'll start to see the benefits of that deal in Q4. We still expect that full year ad revenue will be greater than in 2010. But remember that the comps get much tougher as the year progresses given that we generated $55 million from political advertising in the second half of last year. 
Let's turn to Adjusted OIBDA and operating; income on Slide 9. First quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.6% to $1.7 billion, while operating income rose 14.7% to $975 million. Our Adjusted OIBDA margin fell 40 basis points versus Q1 of last year, as improved revenue mix and better voice and HSD gross margins were not enough to offset lower video gross margins, higher wireless and home security investments compared to the first quarter of last year and an increase in consulting spend related to our strategic sourcing initiative that will yield both operating expense and CapEx savings during the year. 
Operating income margin improved 170 basis points year-over-year to 20.2%, driven by a significant decline in amortization expense. Total first quarter operating expense grew 5.7% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 5.9% year-over-year, driven by annual salary increases across all of our businesses, higher headcount primarily in B2B and higher payroll taxes. B2B employee cost grew 25.4%, while residential employee expenses were up 4%. 
Programming expense increased 2.6% in aggregate and 6.4% on a per subscriber basis, less than recent quarters due in part to the reversal of an $18 million accrual for programming services previously carried without a contract. We continue to expect total programming cost growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as 2010. 
Voice costs were up only 3.1% in Q1 as we began to benefit from the migration of customers off of our Sprint contract. As of the end of Q1, we have migrated roughly 1/4 of our phones customers and we expect to move another 20% by the end of Q2. As a result, voice cost improvements should be even greater in the back half of the year. 
When we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our pre-migration voice cost cut roughly in half. First quarter marketing expense of $159 million was $8 million higher than last year and remained constant at 3.3% of revenues. 
During the first quarter, we continued to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new Smart Home Security  offering. In Q1, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $15 million compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives over the course of the year and still expect our total 2011 start-up losses to be in the $75 million range. 
Looking forward, we expect that Adjusted OIBDA growth will be greater in the second half of the year, and we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year. 
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. First quarter CapEx was $663 million or 13.7% of revenues. Total CapEx was down about 10% year-over-year in part due to the timing of expenditures. We also benefited from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce per unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain. 
First quarter residential capital expenditures were 12.7% of residential revenues and were down about 11% year-over-year to $550 million due primarily to lower CPE as set-top box spending declined over 40%, driven by both reduced volumes and lower per unit prices. 
B2B capital expenditures were $113 million, flat with last year's first quarter. Roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backhaul footprints. While capital intensity in the first quarter was our lowest ever, we expect CapEx to be more back-end loaded this year. For the full year, we still expect that capital spending will be less than $3 billion. 
Moving onto cash flow on the next slide. Our cash flow by any measure has never been stronger. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase and an all-time high. The $133 million of growth was the result of $60 million of year-over-year improvement in Adjusted OIBDA and a $73 million decrease in CapEx. 
Free cash flow for the quarter, which benefited from a $270 million tax refund related to overpayments in 2010 was $927 million, up 42% year-over-year. Free cash flow per share increased almost 45% to $2.65. Because of the tax refund and because we will continue to benefit from 100% bonus depreciation throughout the year. On a net basis, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes during 2011. 
As we said on our last call, with these tax benefits, we expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year. Just a reminder, as you model 2012 and beyond, the bonus depreciation benefits we're enjoying this year will reverse in future years, resulting in less tax depreciation and higher cash taxes. 
Turning to the next slide. First quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.93 increased 55% from $0.60 in Q1 of '10, primarily due to an increase in operating income, a decrease in book taxes and a modest benefit from share repurchases, which was partially offset by higher net interest and other expenses. 
Both this year and last year's first quarters were impacted by a number of items highlighted in our press release. Most notably, EPS in both quarters was reduced by a non-cash charge to reverse previously recognized tax benefit related to the expiration of certain Time Warner Inc. stock options held by Time Warner Cable employees. The impact in this quarter was $0.06 per share.  We continue to expect the 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 range. 
Let's finish up with a balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $20.3 billion, essentially flat with year end 2010. Our leverage ratio was 2.93x.  During the quarter, we returned $996 million to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $167 million or $0.48 a share in dividend and bought back 12 million shares of common stock or $829 million during the first quarter. Since we launched the repurchase program in November of 2010. Through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased 20 million shares at an average price of $67 per share for a total of $1.3 billion. This leaves about $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization. 
So to summarize. We're off to a strong start in 2011, both from an operational and a financial perspective. As a result, we expect to deliver strong growth in our full year operating income, free cash flow and EPS. Thank you.

But in -- I guess, first, I'll start with an expectation for the full year. And I think we've said this before, we're expecting that margins for the full year going to look a lot like last year. So the things that drove the somewhat lower margins in the first quarter really were; one, we spent more on our new business initiatives, in particular wireless and our Home Security initiative in Q1 relative to Q1 of last year. We had some consulting expenses in connection with what we call our strategic sourcing initiative, which is really an initiative designed to improve both OpEx and CapEx. The benefits this quarter primarily showed up in the CapEx line. And it's a contingent kind of an arrangement, so when we save money, we pay a little bit of consulting. So that's what you're seeing there. We did have a delta in bad debt year-over-year, nothing meaningful to talk about, they're just relatively small numbers. And lastly, the other driver, I think, relates to increases in compensation expense. Really, primarily related to our continued ramp up of our B2B capability. So those are really the items that are driving the 40 basis point delta in margins. But again, for the full year, we're thinking pretty flat to last year."

Whether there's any more of those opportunities, I think, they come up from time to time. We'll just have to look at them.

Because even any year, 2 years from now, most of us won't have a tablet and you're doing a lot of interesting things with IP and the network around improved navigation, search and discovery, adding more on-demand long-tail content.

Essentially, what's going on is the consumer electronics industry is embracing devices with video displays in them that also have intelligence and that have 2-way radios and that are all built MPEG the IP standard. And in a sense there's nothing magical about the IP standard versus MPEG or anything else. It's just a bunch of standards that the world is coalescing around. So these devices and there's all sort of different things, these tablets, the Smart TVs that are in the market now. And obviously, there's PCs or what have you. And I think the departure from the past is that the old TVs, which received different standards, TV by different standards, those were relatively dominated, little or no intelligence and they weren't really 2-way devices. And that's why we always have set-tops because of those devices couldn't display our services without set-tops. So what we have is the possibility of transmitting our services to these devices, having much better navigation using a combination of the intelligence of the device and the intelligence back in our network. Doing security and software instead of hardware and essentially getting rid of set-tops. So although the initial application was for the iPAd and you're right, not everybody has an iPad, just 12 of our friends. I think the bigger story here is about the TVs, which were all going to be receiving our video service this way. This isn't the public Internet.  It's essentially simulcasting signals over our cable system. Just like today, we simulcast in several different other formats. So that's what we're doing. And I think this question is right on, it's going to be a better customer experience."

And then on the economics on the cost, my recollection of this, Glenn, is that you guys have a, from the government, the ability to pass-through the cost of the set-top box and to the extent you move away from that and you don't get that kind of costs returned to you with the profit margin.

And again, this is a simulcast and I think there's great confusion about technology, which is changing quickly. And there's a tendency of whenever anybody says IP for mass hysteria to rein, everybody think it's the Internet. But IP is a set of standards and it's being used in sorts of different devices, in sorts of different ways. And the use of it doesn't mean it's the public Internet. And I think that's the importance here. This is the way TV is going to be distributed in the future. It's not going to be new or different. We're not going to have analog anymore after a while. And so the old forms of digital are going to migrate to IP, it's just a different way of with encoding bits, it's not magic. On the cost of the set-tops. it's an interesting thing. There is a residual price regulation of set-tops in places where there isn't effective competition. And there's a statutory rate of return according to our formula. It doesn't mean that we or others actually charge that amount of money. And it's also not relevant where there's effective competition, which isn't much of our footprint. Having said that, I think, if we move to a world without set-tops, you are right, we will probably have lower revenue because we do charge for them. We also have lower capital costs and I maybe slightly wrong in this statistic. But I think about 40% of our service calls relate to set-tops. And think about not having all those service calls. So my guess is, although you may -- if we magically snapped our fingers and have no set-tops, which will only happen over many years, we would have a somewhat smaller balance sheet, somewhat smaller revenue, probably a more profitable company and much happier customers. So that's what this is all about."

And I think, as I said earlier, this technology that we're using with the iPad is really ultimately more about Smart TVs than it is about tablets, as fun as that is. The first TVs are really just hitting the market now. If you go to Best Buy, you can see them. And we're working with all of the top manufacturers on serving those devices. There's still sort of unknown questions about exactly where in the house is the DVR and how does that work and what have you? And it's unknown how fast those are going to sell into market and replace existing TVs. So my guess is, we're going to have set-tops with us for quite a while, but you can see where it's going to go in the long run. Because of that, I think it's too early to start talking about changing our prediction of capital intensity. But, yes, you can see a 10-year time frame where things might go."

And then separately, on the -- you seem to have some success with the shift in some residential subscribers to the Triple Play. To what extent is that like the results of your proactive marketing strategy or is that more or less a natural evolution of consumers taking more and more discounts and I think I heard you, Rob, also allude to the fact that on the B2B, that 2/3 of the subs are single play, which kind of suggested the divergence of trends there. Can you speak to the dynamics of that versus the residential? And lastly, last time you mentioned that the sequential progression of subs got better as you went through the December quarter. I was wondering if that was also the case in this quarter?"

And I think there may be additional opportunities like NaviSite that are small acquisitions, that have a couple of features. In the case of NaviSite, there were physical assets that we didn't have that are going to be very useful. It is also very importantly, management skills in the space that we didn't have. So that's -- it's a great fit. Both as a standalone business but also to marry with our existing efforts. So NaviSite mostly aimed at enterprise customers or it has been. And we think we can take their products and move them into the small, and medium business space which has been our main customer base so far. And so there's a nice synergy there. I think that whether we end up doing more acquisitions and that obviously depends on what deals there are, what have you. But I think there's fertile opportunity in the B2B space."

But let me start with Triple Plays. I think first and foremost, the continued improvement in Triple Play penetration is a testament to the value proposition of the bundle. Certainly, where marketing it aggressively. But it's being marketed to a receptive audience.  Customers like what they get when they buy all of 3 products from us, whether that's attractive pricing, value for their money or some of the product attributes that are particularly unleashed when you have multiple products, things like caller ID on TV. So I think it's about the marketing and it's about the value of the product. As for B2B, it's kind of a different phenomenon, I wouldn't call them divergent trends at all. Remember that for the longtime, all we sold was video to bars and doctors' waiting rooms, then we began to offer the HSD, which really started the high-growth era of our Commercial business. And much more recently, we started to sell voice. So I think the fact that we have a number of customers that only take high-speed data, which is the predominant single play is more a function of the early stage of our voice business and that's why I say it's an opportunity. I think there's no particular reason why we can't sell additional products into customers. I don't think the typical single, double, triple play terminology really applies quite as neatly to the Commercial businesses as it does to Residential. So you shouldn't expect us to be talking that way, especially when we add things like managed services on top of connectivity to various customers. They don't lend themselves to neat PSU categories we used to talk about.  But I don't view it as a divergent trend at all. I view it as an opportunity to sell more into existing customer relationships that we've built. You had a question on sequential trends through the quarter and I would say that the sequential trends in Q1 month-over-month were pretty good."

We're off to a good start in 2011, with first quarter revenue growth of 5% and Adjusted OIBDA growth of almost 4%. Products ARPU growth was strong across the board and subscription performance displayed seasonal strengths. 
I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our high-speed data product, both product mix and ARPU growth trends continue to be very favorable. And since quarter end, we have crossed the 10 million subscriber threshold. High-speed data is quickly becoming the anchor product in the eyes of our customers.
B2B growth continued to accelerate and we're pleased with our progress in this space. Our advertising business coming off dramatic growth rates in 2010 continue to grow its revenue at double digit rates. We continue to generate a lot of free cash flow. And in the first quarter, we used our cash to repurchase shares and pay an increased dividend, returning nearly a billion to our shareholders. 
This is really exciting time in our business. New technology is making it possible for us to provide a better video experience to our customers, one that gives them more control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our iPad app, which we launched last month to overwhelmingly positive consumer reviews. In its first month, 360,000 iPad users downloaded the app. We started with 30 linear channels simulcast over our cable network and we now have more than 70 channels. By year end, we plan to offer nearly all of the linear cable channels, as well as broadcast channels in several of our biggest cities and a lot of on-demand content. 
I want to emphasize that our iPad app is not a one-off product. Rather, we are investing in a development process and a development team that will introduce new capabilities to our customers in rapid succession.
In the next month or so, we're planning to release an update that will add remote control capability and the ability to remotely program DVRs. The consumer electronics industry is embracing the idea of devices such as smart TVs, with built-in intelligence and two-way communications capability, all built in IP standards. The technology that we're using to simulcast videos to iPads will eventually feed all of these devices and over time, this may lead to a world without set tops, which we think could enable a much better customer experience. 
However, without ignoring our traditional video environment built MPEG MPEG and analog standards.  Later this year, we're planning to launch a new navigation application, which will be hosted in our network instead of in our set-tops, providing a much more intuitive and graphically-rich search environment for millions of customers using our set-top boxes. 
Turning to the B2B space, we recently closed on the NaviSite acquisition. We expect NaviSite to jumpstart our ability to sell managed and cloud-based services into the small and medium business space. By bundling their services with our primary offerings, we hope to attract new customers, increase ARPU and reduce churn. 
Before closing, I should mention that during the quarter, we signed a long-term agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers to carry their games on two new Time Warner Cable owned RSNs. One in English and one in Spanish. And those will start with the 2012 to 2013 season. This is a unique opportunity to gain greater control over our economic destiny and enhance our brand in Los Angeles, with both English- and Spanish-speaking audiences. 
In summary, our business continues to perform well. We're investing thoughtfully and strategically to further improve the value of our services both residential and business customers. And, of course, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. So now let me turn it over to Rob for more details."

We're off to a good start in 2011, with improving subscriber trends and very solid financial results. First quarter revenue was particularly strong, rising 5% year-over-year, as residential subscription revenue increased 3.5%, commercial or B2B revenue growth accelerated to over 23% and advertising revenue grew almost 14%. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew over 3.5% in the quarter and operating income was up almost 15%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased over 14% to a record $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was up over 42% to $927 million or $2.65 per diluted share. 
Diluted EPS increased 55% to $0.93. We returned just under a billion to our shareholders in the first quarter through our cash dividend and share repurchases. And finally, we remain on track to meet all elements of our full year financial guidance. 
As Glen mentioned, we closed our NaviSite acquisition on April 21, and will include their financial results with ours going forward. However, I would note that our financial guidance is all based on our organic performance and does not include NaviSite's results or any of the cost associated with the acquisition. 
Let's move on to our Q1 subscriber trends on the next slide. While the economy doesn't appear to have gotten worst during the quarter, unemployment and housing vacancy rates remain high across our footprint. The competitive environment hasn't changed significantly either, as marketing and promotional activities among our telco and satellite competitors continued to be intense. The pace of telco fiber buildouts continued to slow and we estimate that AT&T is still marketing U-verse videos to roughly 24% of our footprint, while Verizon is offering FiOS TV in about 10%. 
In the first quarter, we continued to broadly execute variations in our $33 by 3 Triple Play offer to both new and existing customers. In addition, we began to refocus our marketing on the individual products within the bundle, especially HSD  to target those customers that maybe less receptive to the full Triple Play. 
As I mentioned, subscriber trends improved in the first quarter. Total primary service units increased by 208,000, and while that's fewer net add than in last year's first quarter, it's the best year-over-year sub [subscriber] performance we've delivered in more than a year. 
Churn was up about 10 basis points year-over-year, but was down sequentially in each PSU category. And although it's early in the quarter, let me say a word about Q2 subs. As you know, the second quarter is seasonally weaker than the first. But on a year-over-year basis, so far Q2 is looking a lot like Q1. 
High-speed data once again comprised the majority of Primary Service Unit net adds in the quarter. We added 189,000 HSD subscribers and finished the quarter with just shy of 10 million total HSD subs or 36.5% of passings. That's a 5.1% year-over-year increase in our HSD subscriber base. As Glen mentioned, we crossed the 10 million mark shortly after quarter end. 
We continue to gain HSD share during the first quarter. On a size-adjusted basis, we again added significantly more HSD subs than both AT&T and Verizon. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 136,000 Turbo and 9,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. 
Our Wideband net adds, while still a small portion of the total were nearly double our Q4 net adds, largely driven by our new Signature Home offering, which includes Wideband in many markets. 
Close to 16% of our residential HSD sub base now take Turbo or Wideband. Commercial HSD net adds accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to 12,000. 
We continue to see good results in Digital Phone. Net adds were 84,000 and we ended the quarter with almost $4.6 million total voice subscribers, a 6.1% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, our voice penetration reached 17% of total phone passings. We had 12,000 commercial voice net adds in the quarter for a total subscriber base of 123,000. 
Although we lost 65,000 video subs for the full quarter, we actually added video subs in the seasonally strong month of March. Once again, we lost lower-end analog single-play video customers, while we added higher-end digital and bundled video subs. We did well with our Spanish-language offering, adding about 20,000 El Paquetazo subscribers in the quarter, with particular strength in Texas and Southern California. 
DVR net adds were 42,000 and premium channel net adds were about 45,000 in the quarter. We added 26,000 customer relationships in the quarter and continue to have success with our bundled offerings, adding 83,000 Triple Play subs, up from 73,000 in last year's first quarter and increasing our Double Play subscriber count by 17,000. At quarter end, almost 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. 
As you are aware, we introduced a couple of new offerings late in the fourth quarter of last year. Signature Home, our high-end Triple Play, coupling our best products with customized service  and TV Essentials, a value-oriented video offering for those customers that prefer fewer channels at a lower price point.
While it's still too early to draw up conclusions, let me give you some preliminary observations. Signature Home sales have ramped each month since the December launch and we now have roughly 10,000 subscribers paying an average of $210 per month. During the quarter, 70% of the Signature Home connect were existing Triple Play customers who upgraded to Signature Home. On average, those customers are paying us about $20 per month more than they did previously. 
Perhaps as important as the subscriber stats, is the extremely positive customer feedback we've received. We think we've struck a chord here with the high-end customer and we're excited by the prospects. 
As for TV Essentials, we launched the tier in only 2 markets, so the numbers there are small. But it appears to be effective as a targeted acquisition and retention tool among some customer segments and as an upgrade offer for basic-only customers. We're in the process of evaluating how to expand the deployment of the offering across our footprint. 
Turning to our financial results on the next slide. First quarter revenue was especially strong, increasing 5% year-over-year to $4.8 billion. Total subscription revenue, that's residential and B2B combined, grew 4.6%, driven by both ARPU improvement and increased PSUs. Subscription ARPU for PSU increased 3.4%, the highest year-over-year improvement in more than 3 years, driven by ARPU growth in each PSU category. 
Advertising revenue increased almost 14% and total ARPU per customer relationship was 5.6% versus last year's first quarter to over $111. In dollar terms, total revenues were $228 million higher than in Q1 of '10, with $145 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $59 million coming from B2B and $24 million coming from advertising. 
Let's focus first on our Residential Subscription business on Slide 6. Residential Subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a combination of subscriber growth, improved subscriber mix and price increases. Of the $145 million of year-over-year Residential Subscription revenue growth, HSD contributed about 2/3 or $97 million and Digital Phone and video contributed roughly equal shares of the balance. 
Residential HSD revenue increased 9.4% over Q1 of last year and 3.5% over Q4. Year-over-year residential HSD revenue growth has accelerated in each of the last 5 quarters and sequential HSD revenue growth was the best in over 3 years. 
The year-over-year growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as the nearly 4% improvement in residential HSD ARPU. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement, as we continue to benefit from price increases and the improved subscriber mix I mentioned earlier. 
Residential voice revenue grew more than 5.5% year-over-year due to continued subscriber growth. On a sequential basis, residential voice revenue growth was the highest in more than 18 months. Notably, residential voice ARPU was up year-over-year for the first time ever. 
Residential video revenue grew about 1% year-over-year, despite our smaller video subscriber base, as residential video ARPU increased over 4.5% from Q1 of '10. The ARPU improvement was the product of price increases and higher digital video and DVR revenues, offset by lower transactional VOD and premium revenues. 
Moving on to commercial or B2B revenue on Slide 7. We had another very strong quarter in our B2B operations. B2B is an increasingly important engine of growth, contributing more than 1/4 of our total year-over-year revenue improvement in Q1. As I mentioned at year end, we're focused on improving sales productivity and expanding the number of commercial establishments we reach with our plan. We're also focused on increasing the number of B2B customers that take more than one service from us. At quarter end, 2/3 of our roughly 450,000 B2B customers were Single Play, so there's a nice opportunity there. 
B2B revenue for the quarter was $313 million, up 23% over Q1 of 2010. That marks our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year B2B revenue growth. Of the $59 million of year-over-year growth, data contributed about 40% or $23 million and voice and cell tower backhaul contributed just under 30% each. B2B data revenue increased more than 15%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. B2B voice revenue increased over 60%, driven by subscriber growth. And cell tower backhaul revenue was $28 million more than double our revenues in Q1 of '10. 
At quarter end, we had an install base of nearly 6,400 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. So we're well on our way to achieving organic growth similar to what we achieved in 2010. 
Finally, we closed on our acquisition of NaviSite last week, which will jumpstart our entry into the enterprise-focused managed  and cloud services business and enhance the suite of products that we offer our existing SMB customers. As I mentioned at the outset, NaviSite results are not yet included in the B2B revenue or other financial guidance we've provided. 
Moving on to advertising revenue on the next slide. Advertising revenue of $197 million increased $24 million or almost 14% year-over-year despite a drop in political advertising. Strength in the automotive category, which grew 35% and media advertising, which increased almost 55% accounted for about 85% of the year-over-year increase. 
First quarter ad revenue benefited from our ad-rep deal with Verizon, under which we sell regional advertising on behalf of FiOS TV in New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas. We booked the revenue from the sale of FiOS inventory on a gross basis and treat Verizon share of that revenue as an expense, so the revenue from this deal has a lower margin than revenue from selling our own ad inventory. 
During the first quarter, we also signed an ad-rep deal with AT&T U-verse and we'll start to see the benefits of that deal in Q4. We still expect that full year ad revenue will be greater than in 2010. But remember that the comps get much tougher as the year progresses given that we generated $55 million from political advertising in the second half of last year. 
Let's turn to Adjusted OIBDA and operating; income on Slide 9. First quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.6% to $1.7 billion, while operating income rose 14.7% to $975 million. Our Adjusted OIBDA margin fell 40 basis points versus Q1 of last year, as improved revenue mix and better voice and HSD gross margins were not enough to offset lower video gross margins, higher wireless and home security investments compared to the first quarter of last year and an increase in consulting spend related to our strategic sourcing initiative that will yield both operating expense and CapEx savings during the year. 
Operating income margin improved 170 basis points year-over-year to 20.2%, driven by a significant decline in amortization expense. Total first quarter operating expense grew 5.7% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 5.9% year-over-year, driven by annual salary increases across all of our businesses, higher headcount primarily in B2B and higher payroll taxes. B2B employee cost grew 25.4%, while residential employee expenses were up 4%. 
Programming expense increased 2.6% in aggregate and 6.4% on a per subscriber basis, less than recent quarters due in part to the reversal of an $18 million accrual for programming services previously carried without a contract. We continue to expect total programming cost growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as 2010. 
Voice costs were up only 3.1% in Q1 as we began to benefit from the migration of customers off of our Sprint contract. As of the end of Q1, we have migrated roughly 1/4 of our phones customers and we expect to move another 20% by the end of Q2. As a result, voice cost improvements should be even greater in the back half of the year. 
When we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our pre-migration voice cost cut roughly in half. First quarter marketing expense of $159 million was $8 million higher than last year and remained constant at 3.3% of revenues. 
During the first quarter, we continued to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new Smart Home Security  offering. In Q1, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $15 million compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives over the course of the year and still expect our total 2011 start-up losses to be in the $75 million range. 
Looking forward, we expect that Adjusted OIBDA growth will be greater in the second half of the year, and we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year. 
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. First quarter CapEx was $663 million or 13.7% of revenues. Total CapEx was down about 10% year-over-year in part due to the timing of expenditures. We also benefited from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce per unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain. 
First quarter residential capital expenditures were 12.7% of residential revenues and were down about 11% year-over-year to $550 million due primarily to lower CPE as set-top box spending declined over 40%, driven by both reduced volumes and lower per unit prices. 
B2B capital expenditures were $113 million, flat with last year's first quarter. Roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backhaul footprints. While capital intensity in the first quarter was our lowest ever, we expect CapEx to be more back-end loaded this year. For the full year, we still expect that capital spending will be less than $3 billion. 
Moving onto cash flow on the next slide. Our cash flow by any measure has never been stronger. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase and an all-time high. The $133 million of growth was the result of $60 million of year-over-year improvement in Adjusted OIBDA and a $73 million decrease in CapEx. 
Free cash flow for the quarter, which benefited from a $270 million tax refund related to overpayments in 2010 was $927 million, up 42% year-over-year. Free cash flow per share increased almost 45% to $2.65. Because of the tax refund and because we will continue to benefit from 100% bonus depreciation throughout the year. On a net basis, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes during 2011. 
As we said on our last call, with these tax benefits, we expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year. Just a reminder, as you model 2012 and beyond, the bonus depreciation benefits we're enjoying this year will reverse in future years, resulting in less tax depreciation and higher cash taxes. 
Turning to the next slide. First quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.93 increased 55% from $0.60 in Q1 of '10, primarily due to an increase in operating income, a decrease in book taxes and a modest benefit from share repurchases, which was partially offset by higher net interest and other expenses. 
Both this year and last year's first quarters were impacted by a number of items highlighted in our press release. Most notably, EPS in both quarters was reduced by a non-cash charge to reverse previously recognized tax benefit related to the expiration of certain Time Warner Inc. stock options held by Time Warner Cable employees. The impact in this quarter was $0.06 per share.  We continue to expect the 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 range. 
Let's finish up with a balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $20.3 billion, essentially flat with year end 2010. Our leverage ratio was 2.93x.  During the quarter, we returned $996 million to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $167 million or $0.48 a share in dividend and bought back 12 million shares of common stock or $829 million during the first quarter. Since we launched the repurchase program in November of 2010. Through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased 20 million shares at an average price of $67 per share for a total of $1.3 billion. This leaves about $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization. 
So to summarize. We're off to a strong start in 2011, both from an operational and a financial perspective. As a result, we expect to deliver strong growth in our full year operating income, free cash flow and EPS. Thank you. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

But in -- I guess, first, I'll start with an expectation for the full year. And I think we've said this before, we're expecting that margins for the full year going to look a lot like last year. So the things that drove the somewhat lower margins in the first quarter really were; one, we spent more on our new business initiatives, in particular wireless and our Home Security initiative in Q1 relative to Q1 of last year. We had some consulting expenses in connection with what we call our strategic sourcing initiative, which is really an initiative designed to improve both OpEx and CapEx. The benefits this quarter primarily showed up in the CapEx line. And it's a contingent kind of an arrangement, so when we save money, we pay a little bit of consulting. So that's what you're seeing there. We did have a delta in bad debt year-over-year, nothing meaningful to talk about, they're just relatively small numbers. And lastly, the other driver, I think, relates to increases in compensation expense. Really, primarily related to our continued ramp up of our B2B capability. So those are really the items that are driving the 40 basis point delta in margins. But again, for the full year, we're thinking pretty flat to last year."

So there's obviously a lot of competition there. So a little hard to predict how it's all going to turn out."

So I'm just wondering, how you think about bringing this stuff to your broader customer base over time? Because even any year, two years from now, most of us won't have a tablet and you're doing a lot of interesting things with IP and the network around improved navigation, search and discovery, adding more on-demand long-tail content.

And in a",285,"That's a great question, Ben. Essentially, what's going on is the consumer electronics industry is embracing devices with video displays in them that also have intelligence and that have two-way radios and that are all built MPEG the IP standard. And in a sense there's nothing magical about the IP standard versus MPEG or anything else. It's just a bunch of standards that the world is coalescing around. So these devices and there's all sort of different things, these tablets, the Smart TVs that are in the market now. And obviously, there's PCs and what have you. And I think the departure from the past is that the old TVs, which received different standards, TV by different standards, those were relatively dominated, little or no intelligence and they weren't really two-way devices. And that's why we always have set-tops because of those devices couldn't display our services without set-tops. 
So what we have is the possibility of transmitting our services to these devices, having much better navigation using a combination of the intelligence of the device and the intelligence back in our network. Doing security and software instead of hardware and essentially getting rid of set-tops. So although the initial application was for the iPAd and you're right, not everybody has an iPad, just all of our friends. I think the bigger story here is about the TVs, which were all going to be receiving our video service this way. This isn't the public Internet.  It's essentially simulcasting signals over our cable system. Just like today, we simulcast in several different other formats. So that's what we're doing. And I think this question is right on, it's going to be a better customer experience."

And then on the economics on the cost, my recollection of this, Glenn, is that you guys have a, from the government, the ability to pass-through the cost of the set-top box and to the extent you move away from that and you don't get that kind of costs returned to you with the profit margin.

And again, this is a simulcast and I think there's great confusion about technology, which is changing quickly. And there's a tendency of whenever anybody says IP for mass hysteria to rein, everybody think it's the Internet. But IP is a set of standards and it's being used in all sorts of different devices, in sorts of different ways. And the use of it doesn't mean it's the public Internet. And I think that's the importance here. This is the way TV is going to be distributed in the future. It's not going to be new or different. We're not going to have analog anymore after a while. And so the old forms of digital are going to migrate to IP.  It's just a different way of with encoding bits, it's not magic. On the cost of the set-tops. it's an interesting thing. There is a residual price regulation of set-tops in places where there isn't effective competition. And there's a statutory rate of return according to our formula. It doesn't mean that we or others actually charge that amount of money. And it's also not relevant where there's effective competition, which isn't much of our footprint. 
Having said that, I think, if we move to a world without set-tops, you are right, we will probably have lower revenue because we do charge for them. We also have lower capital costs and I maybe slightly wrong in this statistic. But I think about 40% of our service calls relate to set-tops. And think about not having all those service calls. So my guess is, although you may -- if we magically snapped our fingers and have no set-tops, which will only happen over many years, we would have a somewhat smaller balance sheet, somewhat smaller revenue, probably a more profitable company and much happier customers.

And then two, just in terms of following up on Jessica's question about acquisition behavior. It seems like you guys have come out and kind of talk down Insight. Curious kind of what about Insight doesn't fit the criteria or is it just the price issue? And how do you think about the overall, it seems like more and more cable systems, everyone is trying to rush to sell now and monetize valuation-wise. And  I'm just kind of curious, what are the things that you're looking for specifically?

Without commenting on anything specific about insight or anything else, suffice it to say that we look at all the synergies and we have a pretty good idea of what the synergies are having been in the business a long time. And look at what these things look like under our auspices, within our programming cost and et cetera. And we project that out and just kind of back with their cost of capital and that gives you an answer. We're a little old-fashioned.

And if there are customers who are for one reason or another wedded to another provider for video that by no means, means that we're not interested in selling them data and voice and ultimately, we'd like to upsell them to the full Triple Play. When I talked earlier about highlighting the attributes of our individual products, high-speed data is kind of first and foremost in my mind on that front.

Or you would likely to ramp up in that area of cloud computing and it seems to me your prepared remarks that, that suggested that this could actually be more of a feature, an enhancement kind of thing as opposed to kind of a standalone or profit standard so to speak. 
So can you see -- can you perhaps clarify where you see the biggest impact of that deal and any financial details will also be helpful. And then separately, on the -- you seem to have some success with the shift in some residential subscribers to the Triple Play. To what extent is that like the results of your proactive marketing strategy or is that more or less a natural evolution of consumers taking more and more discounts?  And I think I heard you, Rob, also allude to the fact that on the B2B, that 2/3 of the subs are single play, which kind of suggested the divergence of trends there. Can you speak to the dynamics of that versus the residential? And lastly, last time you mentioned that the sequential progression of subs got better as you went through the December quarter.

And I think there may be additional opportunities like NaviSite that are small acquisitions, that have a couple of features. In the case of NaviSite, there were physical assets that we didn't have that are going to be very useful. It is also very importantly, management skills in the space that we didn't have. So that's -- it's a great fit. Both as a standalone business but also to marry with our existing efforts. 
So NaviSite mostly aimed at enterprise customers or it has been. And we think we can take their products and move them into the small, and medium business space which has been our main customer base so far. And so there's a nice synergy there. I think that whether we end up doing more acquisitions and that obviously depends on what deals there are, what have you. But I think there's fertile opportunity in the B2B space."

But let me start with Triple Plays. I think first and foremost, the continued improvement in Triple Play penetration is a testament to the value proposition of the bundle. Certainly, where marketing is aggressively. But it's being marketed to a receptive audience.  Customers like what they get when they buy all of three products from us, whether that's attractive pricing, value for their money or some of the product attributes that are particularly unleashed when you have multiple products, things like caller ID on TV. 
So I think it's about the marketing and it's about the value of the product. As for B2B, it's kind of a different phenomenon, I wouldn't call them divergent trends at all. Remember that for the longtime, all we sold was video to bars and doctors' waiting rooms, then we began to offer the HSD, which really started the high-growth era of our Commercial business. And much more recently, we started to sell voice. So I think the fact that we have a number of customers that only take high-speed data, which is the predominant single play is more a function of the early stage of our voice business and that's why I say it's an opportunity. I think there's no particular reason why we can't sell additional products into customers. 
I don't think the typical single, double, triple play terminology really applies quite as neatly to the Commercial businesses as it does to Residential. So you shouldn't expect us to be talking that way, especially when we add things like managed services on top of connectivity to various customers. They don't lend themselves to neat PSU categories we used to talk about.  But I don't view it as a divergent trend at all. I view it as an opportunity to sell more into existing customer relationships that we've built. You had a question on sequential trends through the quarter and I would say that the sequential trends in Q1 month-over-month were pretty good."

Before we begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Irene Esteves, who joined us a couple of weeks ago and is here with us today. Irene is rapidly coming up with the learning curve, and you can expect to hear from her on the third quarter call. In the meantime, Rob Marcus will cover the financial results 1 last time this morning.
I'm pleased to report that our core business is healthy despite competitive pressures and the continuing weakness in the economy. We're continuing to make investments in our Residential and Business Services to drive growth. Second quarter revenue and adjusted OIBDA each grew by more than 4% year-over-year. We generated a record $1.1 billion of OIBDA, less CapEx, which drove very free strong cash flow. And our earnings per share growth topped 30%. We returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter.
Our Business Services results were very strong. And with the addition of NaviSite in the most recent quarter, Business Services revenue growth was 35%. NaviSite has own a couple of very significant contracts since the acquisition closed in April, reinforcing our enthusiasm for the acquisition. Growth in Residential Services moderate in the second quarter, driven by seasonal weakness in subscriber net additions and accentuated by the weak economy and the intensity of competition.
While we're working on enhancements to our products at the high end, we're also looking at lower cost alternatives to address a growing affordability problem amongst low-income customers. But work focused not just on products, we recognize that we also need to do a much better job of telling our story to consumers.
There's several important trends and developments I'd like to highlight this morning. Our Broadband business continues to benefit from accelerating usage trends. We're seeing more demand for our high speeds and pricing remains strong. As Broadband becomes increasingly important to our customers, we think we can create additional value by making it available to them everywhere. We're continuing to deploy Wi-Fi capabilities in Los Angeles. And we're exploring how we might sell broadband that would bundle our wireline service with Wi-Fi and wireless service for a single attractive price. You'll be hearing more about our plans in the coming months.
In video, technology is giving us the opportunity to dramatically improve the utility of our products. The second release of our iPad app is an example. We now have over 100 light channels, and the ability to use the iPad as a remote control using its enhanced program guide. The next version, which is a month or so away, will bring full keyboard enabled search and we're hard at work bringing several functionality to many other popular consumer devices such as smart TVs. We're investing in our businesses so that they remain strong and competitive. We recently announced the pending construction of a new data center on our Charlotte, North Carolina campus. That facility will enable us 2 more rapidly deploy iPad video, high-speed data, voice and business services by having storage and network elements in a shared environment. It will also have one of 2 national head ends.
Over the next 2 years, we plan to migrate the origination and distribution of our video service to this facility until a matching one in the Denver area, generating operating cost savings and enabling us to more completely standardize provision of services across the footprint. Our nationwide IT feed, which today serves iPad's and which will feed other devices such as smart TVs over time, already originates at the Denver facility. 
Through our deployment of Switched Digital Video over the last several years, we dramatically expanded our facility for high-definition and broadband services. As I've said for some time, our long-term plan is to supplement Switched Digital Video by gradually going all-digital. Consistent with that plan, we have embarked on an audit all-digital transition in Augusta, Maine, extending our existing all-digital footprint beyond New York City and parts of Los Angeles. Augusta is the first deployment of digital transport adopters or so-called DTAs. Our plan is to migrate our managed systems to all-digital over the next years or so. We continue to expand our dust DOCSIS 3.0 deployment, which now covers roughly 60% of our footprint. We expect to complete that rollout next year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter. We also continue to be interested in extending our cable footprint, and we can do so at the right price. In the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of systems serving roughly 130,000 PSUs from New Wave Communications for $260 million. This acquisition highlights our disciplined approach to capital allocation and M&A. Taking into account a full tax step-up and significant operational synergies, it enables us to expand our cable footprint at a purchase price that compares favorably to the repurchase of our own shares.
In summary, our business continues to perform well. We are thoughtfully deploying capital to improve our customer's experience with our products and to acquire a cable footprint and business service capabilities that will enable further growth. And we continue to show significant -- we continue to return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. So before I turn the call over to Rob, one last time in his role as acting CFO, I'd like to extend our thanks for the terrific job he's done as our CFO for the last 3.5 years. Rob?"

As usual, I'll jump into the second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Second quarter revenue grew 4.4% year-over-year as Residential services revenue increased 2.5%, Business Services revenue growth accelerated to almost 35%, and advertising revenue grew over 4%. Adjusted OIBDA grew over 4% in the quarter, and operating income was up almost 16%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, increased almost 11% to a record 1.1 billion dollars, and free cash flow was up almost 43% to $815 million or $2.40 per diluted share.
As you know, we closed our acquisition of NaviSite in April. And NaviSite accounted for roughly 50 basis points of total revenue growth and about 40 basis points of Adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. Diluted EPS increased over 30% to $1.24. We returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, with hefty year behind us, we remain on track to meet or exceed all elements of our financial guidance.
Let's move on to our Q2 full year subscriber trends on the next slide. As expected, subscriber performance showed typical seasonal weakness. And due to continued economic headwinds and increased competitive intensity, subscriber net adds were somewhat softer than last year. That relative weakness has continued into the early part of Q3. That said, performance varied across our footprint, with subscriber performance in Texas and Southern California notably better than the rest of the footprint.
We continue to grow our HSD serves subscribers with 67,000 net adds in the quarter, more than the HSD net adds reported last week by AT&T and Verizon combined. We finished the quarter with 10.1 million total HSD subs. That's a 4.7% year-over-year increase in our HSD subscriber base. Our Residential high-speed data subscriber mix continued to improve, with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 125,000 turbo and 25,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And at quarter end, turbo and Wideband subs comprised over 17% of our Residential HSD customer base. 
Our Wideband subscribers, while still a small portion of the total, more than doubled during the second quarter. We now have deployed our DOCSIS 3.0 technology in about 60% of our footprint. And we will complete the footprint-wide rollout next year. 
Business HSD net adds accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 13,000 representing our highest quarterly net adds ever. We continued to see growth in Voice. Net adds were 45,000, and we ended the quarter with over 4.6 million total voice subscribers, a 5.3% year-over-year increase. Included in net adds were 13,000 business voice net adds in the quarter, an all-time high.
Second quarter video sub losses were 128,000, about 17,000 more than we lost in last year's second quarter. Once again, a disproportionate share of the losses came from analog, single-play video customers. We actually added digital and bundled video customers. 
We continue to do well with our Spanish-language offering, especially in Texas and Southern California. We more than doubled the number of El Paquetazo subscribers we had just 5 quarters ago. In addition, we just launched on El Paquetazo Triple Play featuring a 1,000 minutes of international calling. We're in the process of adding 25 Spanish-language channels to our iPad app. And we're formulating a version of Signature Home for Spanish-speaking customers to be launched later this year. Customer relationship net losses were 74,000 in the quarter as we watched video-only single-play and a modest abrupt doubles and triples among our lower income customer segments and added double and triple plays among our higher end segments. All in, we were able to grow out Triple Play base by 38,000 in the quarter. At quarter end, 60% of our customers were either double or triple plays. During Q2, we nearly doubled the number of customers taking Signature Home, our high-end Triple Play, coupling our best products with customized service. We ended the quarter with about 17,000 Signature Home subs, paying an average of $220 per month.
Turning to our financial results on the next slide, as you can see from our press release, we've made some changes this quarter in how we present our revenues. The new presentation is more consistent with the way we think about and run the business. In short, going forward, we'll be talking about revenue in 4 major categories: Residential services, Business Services, advertising and other. Other captures a number of items, most notably commissions from home shopping networks and amounts we received from Bright House networks for the provision of HSD and various management services. Once we launch our LA Lakers RSN next year, affiliate fee revenue associated with those networks will also show up in other revenue. You can get more detail on the new presentation in our 10-Q and our trending schedules.
Second quarter revenue increased 4.4% year-over-year to $4.9 billion, with total ARPU per customer relationship increasing 4.8%. In dollar terms, total revenue were $210 million higher than in Q2 of last year, with $105 million of that growth coming from our Residential services, $93 million coming from Business Services and $12 million coming from advertising and other revenue combined.
Let's focus first on the Residential services revenue on Slide 6. Residential revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year, driven by a combination of year-over-year HSD and voice subscriber growth and improved ARPU for PSU, offset by video subscriber losses. Of the $105 million of year-over-year Residential revenue growth, HSD contributed over 80% or $87 million. Residential HSD revenue increased 8.5% over Q2 of last year. The year-over-year growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a 3.5% improvement in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as we continue to benefit from price increases and the improved HSD subscriber mix I mentioned earlier.
Residential Voice revenue grew 4.4% year-over-year due to continued subscriber growth, as Residential Voice ARPU was pretty much flat year-over-year. And Residential video revenue was essentially flat year-over-year as a 3.8% increase in ARPU offset the decline in video subscriber's. The ARPU increase was driven by price increases, a more favorable video subscriber mix, increased equipment rental and installation charges and a 10% increase in DVR revenue, offset by declines in premium and transactional VOD revenues. 
Transactional VOD revenues declined $14 million, with the year-over-year drop being fairly even across the movies, events and adult categories. 
Now let's move on to Business Services revenue on Slide 7. We had another very strong quarter in Business Services, which accounted for almost 45% of our total year-over-year revenue improvement in Q2. Business Services revenue for the quarter was $361 million, up almost 35% over Q2 of 2010.
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our NaviSite acquisition on April 21, which contributed $26 million of revenue in the quarter is included in our other Business Services revenue category. Even without NaviSite, Business Services revenue grew 25%, our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth.
Of the $67 million of year-over-year growth from our non-NaviSite business, HSD contributed about 40% or $27 million. Wholesale transport contributed around 30% or $19 million, and voice provided about 25% or $17 million. Business HSD revenue increased 18%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. 
Wholesale transport revenue, up $39 million, nearly doubled from Q2 of last year, and was driven by growth in backhaul. Backhaul revenue was $34 million, twice our revenue in last year's second quarter. At quarter end, we had an installed base of roughly 6,900 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. 
Business Voice revenue increased almost 60% driven by subscriber growth. So we're well on our way to achieving full year organic services revenue growth in excess of 20% and over 30% revenue growth including NaviSite.
Moving on to advertising revenue on the next slide, ad revenue of $225 million increased $9 million or 4.2% year-over-year, as the expected drop in political advertising was more than offset by revenue from the Verizon files rep deal that we described on last quarter's call. Second quarter ad revenue was driven by particular strength in the media and entertainment category. 
Automotive, which fueled our growth last year and in Q1, increased just 4% year-over-year, in part a reflection of the aftereffects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and in part a reflection of the broader economy. We still expect that full year ad revenue will be greater than in 2010. But remember that the comps get much tougher as the year progresses, given that we generated $55 million from political advertising in the second half of last year. Quarter and.
Let's turn to Adjusted OIBDA and operating income in Slide 9. Second quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 4.2% to $1.8 million, and our Adjusted OIBDA margin fell 10 basis points. Excluding NaviSite, Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.8%. Operating income rose 15.8% to nearly $1.1 billion in the second quarter, and our operating income margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 21.5%, driven by a significant decline in amortization expense.
Total second quarter operating expense, which included $19 million of operating expense for NaviSite, grew 4.6% compared to last year. Employee costs were up just over 5% year-over-year, driven by annual salary increases across all our businesses and higher headcount, primarily in Business Services including NaviSite. Business Services employee cost grew 34%, although the rest of the company was up less than 3%. Programming expense increased 4.1% in aggregate and 8% on a per subscriber basis. The increase was driven by contractual rate increases and higher retransmission consent expense, which was partially offset by the decline in video subscribers. We expect programming cost per sub growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as 2010.
Voice costs were down 9.6% in Q2, as we benefited from the insourcing of our voice support functions. The insourcing process has gone very well. And as of the end of Q2, we had migrated of almost half our phone customers, and have largely completed this year's moves. As a result of these efforts, our Q2 monthly Residential Voice cost per sub dropped nearly $2 year-over-year to $10.30. And our Voice gross margin improved over 500 basis points year-over-year. We expect Voice cost per sub to decline further in the second half as we benefit from full quarter of savings for each migrated some. Most of our remaining Voice subscribers will be moved in 2013. And when we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our premigration voice cost cut roughly in half.
Our net bad debt expense declined 15% to $34 million, reflecting the better quality of receivables and better collections. Second quarter marketing expense of $160 million was $4 million higher than last year, and remains relatively constant at 3.2% of revenues.
During the second quarter, we continue to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new home security offering. In Q2, the combined losses for these initiatives were approximately $15 million compared to $10 million in the second quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives over the course of the year, and still expect our total 2011 startup losses to be in the $75 million range. 
Looking forward, we expect that adjusted OIBDA growth will accelerate in Q4, as we benefit from insourcing our Voice support functions, the expected cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative and some onetime expenses that reduced Q4 2010 adjusted OIBDA. Operating income growth will actually moderate in the second half, as we lap last year's improvement in amortization expense. Nonetheless, we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10, through the first 6 month of the year, CapEx was under $1.4 billion or less than 14% of revenues, down from just under 16% in the first half of 2010. Second quarter CapEx was down 4.9% year-over-year to $700 million. Q2 residential capital expenditures were 13.3% of Residential revenue, and were down year-over-year to $572 million due primarily to lower CPE, upgrades and rebuilds and line extensions, proprietary offset by higher scalable Infrastructure. Business Services capital expenditures were $118 million, flat with last year's second quarter. Roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our footprint. Total CapEx continued to benefit from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce per-unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain.
As Glenn mentioned, we are spending on projects that will help us to rapidly deploy product enhancements and improve our customers experience. Specifically, our data centers in Charlotte and Denver, as well as our conversions to all-digital in the Maine. And get in to rollout DOCSIS 3.0, of course our footprint. We also expect to continue to invest in Business Services growth. So while capital intensity in the first half of the year was our lowest ever, we will spend more in the back half of the year and expect that full year capital spending will be in the $2.9 billion to $3 billion range, consistent with the 2010 level and still below $3 billion as we set at the outset of the year.
Moving onto cash flow on the next slide, we continue to grow our cash flows at strong double-digit rates. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the second quarter was $1.1 billion an almost 11% year-over-year increase and a new all-time high. The $109 million of growth was the result of the $73 million increase of adjusted OIBDA and a $36 million decrease in CapEx. 
For the first 6 months of 2011, Adjusted OIBDA, less CapEx, grew nearly 12.5% to just under $2.2 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $815 million, up nearly 43% over Q2 of '10. Free cash flow per diluted share rose 51% to $2.40. The $244 million of year-over-year free cash flow growth was largely driven by an improvement in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and a roughly $150 million decline in cash taxes, due in part to bonus depreciation benefits that I'll cover in more detail in just a moment. 
For the first half of 2011, free cash flow was over $1.7 billion, up 42% from first half of 2010, again aided by bonus depreciation related to clients and cash taxes.
First half free cash flow per share grew 48% to $5.06.
We've got lots of questions over the last several quarters regarding the impact of economic stimulus legislation on our free cash flow both historically and going forward. So we thought we'd lay it out in some detail. 
If you turn to Slide 12, you can see that the blue bars represent the gross stimulus benefit in each year. While the dark gray bars highlight the reversal of prior year benefits in each year. The green line tracks the net benefit or detriment to cash taxes and free cash flow in each year. So you can see we benefited from the bonus depreciation provisions of various Federal stimulus acts since the beginning of 2008. Current law provides for 100% bonus depreciation in 2011 which, which when netted against reversals of prior year benefits yield the current year net tax benefits of roughly $600 million. Next year, the current law provides for 50% of bonus depreciation, which will yield roughly $300 million of gross benefits. But that's less of the reversal of tax benefits resulting in a net negative impact on cash taxes. The exact amount depends on 2012 capital spending. But a 2012 CapEx is similar to this year's level. We would see a negative impact on cash taxes and free cash flow of roughly $100 million. 
So we're looking at a swing of approximately $700 million in cash taxes and free cash flow from 2011 to 2012 related solely to the effects of economic stimulus legislation. As you can see, assuming bonus depreciation and after end of next year, the net negative impact of Economic Stimulus Act is greater than 2013 and then moderates thereafter. Of course, we'd be happy to go through all of these in more detail off-line. Let's turn to the next slide.
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.24 increased over 30% from $0.95 in Q2 '10 primarily due to an increase in operating income and the benefit of our share repurchase, which were partially offset by higher book taxes, net interest expense and loss from equity investments. Both this year and last year second quarters were impacted by a number of items highlighted in our press release. For the first 2 quarters, diluted EPS was $2.16, up almost 40% over same period of last year. We continue to expect 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 range.
As usual, let's finish up with a balance sheet on the next slide. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $21 billion, $600 million increase from year end 2010. Our leverage ratio ticked up slightly to 2.99x. This quarter, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $163 million or $0.48 per share in dividend and bought back 11.5 million shares of common stock for $863 million during the second quarter. Since quarter end, we've repurchased 3.3 million additional shares. And since we launched the repurchase program in November of 2010, we have repurchased approximately 35 million shares at an average price of $71 per share, for a total of roughly $2.5 billion. So leaves this leaves about $1.5 million remaining on our original authorization.
So to summarize, another solid quarter mark a exceptionally strong growth in Business Services and continued healthy free cash flow, coupled with a methodical execution of our balance sheet and return of capital strategy. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

And Hispanics represent roughly 16% of the total U.S. population. We overindexed in our Southern California and Texas markets. I think in those markets based on the most recent census that we could push into the 30-plus percent of the population being Hispanic. Bigger amongst younger people and somewhat smaller among adults. Really what we're doing to focus on that market is ensuring that we've got the right products that appeals to what it is the Hispanic audience is looking for. And as a result, that's why we're introducing this new Triple Play, which not only focuses on Hispanic-oriented programming, Spanish-language and otherwise, but also focuses on the telecom need of that market. And by throwing a robust International calling plan into the package, we think we're going to satisfy another need of that audience. There's also a fair amount of opportunity even at the higher end of that market. And as a result, we're tailoring a Signature Home version for Hispanic customers. And as I mentioned, we are also adding Spanish-language channels to our iPad app. So we're doing a lot of the product side. And a lot of this has to do with ensuring that domestic gets hurt, and our marketing focus is getting somewhat more aggressive in making Hispanic customers aware that we have these products. I'm pleased with the growth in El Paquetazo. But just to put it in perspective, our total El Paquetazo subs now is roughly 130,000. So we don't have huge numbers, and I don't have great stats on exactly who those subs are coming from."

And we're definitely committed to doing just that. Over the last several years, I'm very pleased with the improved levels that we talked to the marketing function. We focused on customer segmentation, we paid attention to customer lifetime value. We've gotten much more scientific about our approach to pricing. But obviously, we made a management change recently. And I feel very, very confident that Jeff Hirsch, whose our new CMO, is the right guy to take us to the right next level. Jeff brings not only marketing expertise to the function, but also has the benefit of that experience in actually running cable systems. So what I expect of him is to bring some of those really cool, sophisticated marketing tools to the very practical issues of acquiring, retaining and upselling our existing customer base.

TV Everywhere, we are very good applicants that. Have been from the very beginning. And you recall, we were still part of Time Warner when this idea first came about. And I think it makes also a sense of the world. It is not the easiest thing to pull off in the deal sense, the technology is not that complicated. But negotiating deals one at a time with different programs versus very complicated, though the concept seemed simple, everybody has slightly different ideas of how we should work to get down on the details. And not every network has all the rights for all their programming to do this to begin with. So I think it's progressing actually very well. With Disney and ESPN, we have slipped into the first big TV Everywhere deals, and I think you will see more from us and other people as time goes by. The technology is not complicated. It's just all the details. Still think it's a great idea, and we're all for it. Bandwidth cost, I actually don't even know the answer, but I think the conversation about usage-based pricing should not be tied to a conversation about cost. This is not the rate of return regulated monopoly industry like AT&T was before 1984, and I think there's a tendency to think the world still works that way. We have a lot of different products, we have a lot of offerings. And we're aiming at different segments and different combinations. And the pricing will relate to that. This is not a straight cost base thing. So those facts are interesting,  but not typically relevant to pricing."

Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Irene Esteves, who joined us a couple of weeks ago and is here with us today. Irene is rapidly coming up on the learning curve, and you can expect to hear from her on the third quarter call. In the meantime, Rob Marcus will cover the financial results one last time this morning.
I'm pleased to report that our core business is healthy despite competitive pressures and the continuing weakness in the economy. We're continuing to make investments in our Residential and Business Services to drive growth. Second quarter revenue and adjusted OIBDA each grew by more than 4% year-over-year. We generated a record $1.1 billion of OIBDA, less CapEx, which drove very strong free cash flow, and our earnings per share growth topped 30%. We returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter.
Our Business Services results were very strong. And with the addition of NaviSite in the most recent quarter, Business Services revenue growth was 35%. NaviSite has won a couple of very significant contracts since the acquisition closed in April, reinforcing our enthusiasm for the acquisition. Growth in Residential Services moderated in the second quarter, driven by seasonal weakness in subscriber net additions and accentuated by the weak economy and the intensity of competition.
While we're working on enhancements to our products at the high end, we're also looking at lower cost alternatives to address a growing affordability problem amongst low-income customers. But were focused not just on products, we recognize that we also need to do a much better job of telling our story to consumers.
There's several important trends and developments I'd like to highlight this morning. The Broadband business continues to benefit from the accelerating usage trends. We're seeing more demand for our higher speeds and pricing remains strong. As Broadband becomes increasingly important to our customers, we think we can create additional value by making it available to them everywhere. We're continuing to deploy Wi-Fi capabilities in Los Angeles. And we're exploring how we might sell broadband packages that would bundle our wireline service with Wi-Fi and wireless service for a single attractive price. You'll be hearing more about our plans in the coming months.
In video, technology is giving us the opportunity to dramatically improve the utility of our products. The second release of our iPad app is a great example. We now have over 100 live channels, and the ability to use the iPad as a remote control using an enhanced program guide. The next version, which is a month or so away, will bring full keyboard-enabled search and we're hard at work bringing similar functionality to many other popular consumer electronics devices such as Smart TVs. We're investing in our businesses, so that they remain strong and competitive. We recently announced the pending construction of a new data center on our Charlotte, North Carolina campus. That facility will enable us to more rapidly deploy video, high-speed data, voice and business services by having storage and network elements in a shared environment. It will also house 1 of 2 national super headends.
Over the next 2 years, we plan to migrate the origination and distribution of our video service to this facility and to a matching one in the Denver area, generating operating cost savings and enabling us to more completely standardize the provision of services across our footprint. Our nationwide IP feed, which today serves iPads and which will feed other devices such as Smart TVs over time, already originates in the Denver facility. 
Through our deployment of Switched Digital Video over the last several years, we dramatically expanded our capacity for high-definition and broadband services. As I've said for some time, our long-term plan is to supplement Switched Digital Video by gradually going all digital. Consistent with that plan, we have embarked on an all-digital transition in Augusta, Maine, extending our existing all-digital footprint beyond New York City and parts of Los Angeles. Augusta is our first deployment of digital transport adopters or so-called DTAs. Our plan is to migrate our managed systems to all-digital over the next 5 years or so. And we continue to expand our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment, which now covers roughly 60% of our footprint. We expect to complete that rollout next year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter. We also continue to be interested in extending our cable footprint, and we can do so at the right price. In the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of systems serving roughly 130,000 PSUs from NewWave Communications for $260 million. This acquisition highlights our disciplined approach to capital allocation and M&A. Taking into account a full tax step-up and significant operational synergies, it enables us to expand our cable footprint at a purchase price that compares favorably to the repurchase of our own shares.
In summary, our business continues to perform well. We are thoughtfully deploying capital to improve our customer's experience with our products and to acquire a cable footprint and business service capabilities that will enable further growth. And we continue to show significant -- we continue to return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. 
So before I turn the call over to Rob, one last time in his role as acting CFO, I'd like to extend our thanks for the terrific job he's done as our CFO for the last 3.5 years. Rob?"

As usual, I'll jump right in to our second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Second quarter revenue grew 4.4% year-over-year as Residential Services revenue increased 2.5%, Business Services revenue growth accelerated to almost 35%, and advertising revenue grew over 4%. Adjusted OIBDA grew over 4% in the quarter, and operating income was up almost 16%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, increased almost 11% to a record $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was up almost 43% to $815 million or $2.40 per diluted share.
As you know, we closed our acquisition of NaviSite in April. And NaviSite accounted for roughly 50 basis points of total revenue growth and about 40 basis points of Adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. Diluted EPS increased over 30% to $1.24. We returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, with half the year behind us, we remain on track to meet or exceed all elements of our full year financial guidance.
Let's move on to our Q2 subscriber trends on the next slide. As expected, subscriber performance showed typical seasonal weakness. And due to continued economic headwinds and increased competitive intensity, subscriber net adds were somewhat softer than last year. That relative weakness has continued into the early part of Q3. That said, performance varied across our footprint, with subscriber performance in Texas and Southern California notably better than the rest of the footprint.
We continue to grow our HSD subscribers with 67,000 net adds in the quarter, more than the HSD net adds reported last week by AT&T and Verizon combined. We finished the quarter with 10.1 million total HSD subs. That's a 4.7% year-over-year increase in our HSD subscriber base. Our residential high-speed data subscriber mix continued to improve, with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 125,000 Turbo and 25,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And at quarter end, Turbo and Wideband subs comprised over 17% of our Residential HSD customer base. 
Our Wideband subscribers, while still a small portion of the total, more than doubled during the second quarter. We now have deployed our DOCSIS 3.0 technology in about 60% of our footprint. And we will complete the footprint-wide rollout next year. 
Business HSD net adds accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 13,000 representing our highest quarterly net adds ever. We continued to see growth in voice. Net adds were 45,000, and we ended the quarter with over 4.6 million total voice subscribers, a 5.3% year-over-year increase. Included in net adds were 13,000 business voice net adds in the quarter, an all-time high.
Second quarter video sub losses were 128,000, about 17,000 more than we lost in last year's second quarter. Once again, a disproportionate share of the losses came from analog, single-play video customers. We actually added digital and bundled video customers. 
We continue to do well with our Spanish-language offering, especially in Texas and Southern California. We more than doubled the number of El Paquetazo subscribers we had just 5 quarters ago. In addition, we just launched an El Paquetazo Triple Play featuring a 1,000 minutes of international calling. We're in the process of adding 25 Spanish-language channels to our iPad app. And we're formulating a version of Signature Home for Spanish-speaking customers to be launched later this year. 
Customer relationship net losses were 74,000 in the quarter, as we lost video-only single-plays and a modest a number of doubles and triples among our lower-income customer segments and added double and triple plays among our higher-end segments. All in, we were able to grow our Triple Play base by 38,000 in the quarter. At quarter end, 60% of our customers were either double or triple plays. During Q2, we nearly doubled the number of customers taking Signature Home, our high-end Triple Play, coupling our best products with customized service. We ended the quarter with about 17,000 Signature Home subs, paying an average of $220 per month.
Turning to our financial results on the next slide, as you can see from our press release, we've made some changes this quarter in how we present our revenues. The new presentation is more consistent with the way we think about and run the business. In short, going forward, we'll be talking about revenue in 4 major categories: Residential Services, Business Services, Advertising and Other. Other captures a number of items, most notably commissions from Home Shopping Networks and amounts we received from Bright House Networks for the provision of HSD and various management services. Once we launch our L.A. Lakers RSN next year, affiliate fee revenue associated with those networks will also show up in other revenue. You can get more detail on the new presentation in our 10-Q and our trending schedules.
Second quarter revenue increased 4.4% year-over-year to $4.9 billion, with total ARPU per customer relationship increasing 4.8%. In dollar terms, total revenue were $210 million higher than in Q2 of last year, with $105 million of that growth coming from our Residential Services, $93 million coming from Business Services and $12 million coming from Advertising and Other revenue combined.
Let's focus first on Residential Services revenue on Slide 6. Residential revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year, driven by a combination of year-over-year HSD and voice subscriber growth and improved ARPU per PSU, offset by video subscriber losses. Of the $105 million of year-over-year Residential revenue growth, HSD contributed over 80% or $87 million. Residential HSD revenue increased 8.5% over Q2 of last year. The year-over-year growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a 3.5% improvement in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as, we continue to benefit from price increases and the improved HSD subscriber mix I mentioned earlier.
Residential voice revenue grew 4.4% year-over-year due to continued subscriber growth, as Residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat year-over-year. And Residential video revenue was essentially flat year-over-year as a 3.8% increase in ARPU offset a decline in video subscribers. The ARPU increase was driven by price increases, a more favorable video subscriber mix, increased equipment rental and installation charges and a 10% increase in DVR revenue, offset by declines in premium and transactional VOD revenues. Transactional VOD revenue declined $14 million, with the year-over-year drop being fairly even across the movies, events and adult categories. 
Let's move on to Business Services revenue on Slide 7. We had another very strong quarter in Business Services, which accounted for almost 45% of our total year-over-year revenue improvement in Q2. Business Services revenue for the quarter was $361 million, up almost 35% over Q2 of 2010.
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our NaviSite acquisition on April 21, which contributed $26 million of revenue in the quarter that's included in our other Business Services revenue category. Even without NaviSite, Business Services revenue grew 25%, our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth.
Of the $67 million of year-over-year growth from our non-NaviSite business, HSD contributed about 40% or $27 million. Wholesale transport contributed around 30% or $19 million, and voice provided about 25% or $17 million. Business HSD revenue increased 18%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. 
Wholesale transport revenue of $39 million, nearly doubled from Q2 of last year, and was driven by growth in cell tower backhaul. Cell tower backhaul revenue was $34 million, twice our cell tower backhaul revenue in last year's second quarter. At quarter end, we had an installed base of roughly 6,900 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. 
Business voice revenue increased almost 60% driven by subscriber growth. So we're well on our way to achieving full year organic Business Services revenue growth in excess of 20%, and over 30% revenue growth including NaviSite.
Moving on to Advertising revenue on the next slide, ad revenue of $225 million increased $9 million or 4.2% year-over-year, as the expected drop in political advertising was more than offset by revenue from the Verizon files rep deal that we discussed on last quarter's call. Second quarter ad revenue was driven by particular strength in the media and entertainment category. 
Automotive, which fueled our growth last year and in Q1, increased just 4% year-over-year, in part a reflection of the aftereffects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and in part a reflection of the broader economy. We still expect that full year ad revenue will be greater than in 2010. But remember that the comps get much tougher as the year progresses, given that we generated $55 million from political advertising in the second half of last year.
Let's turn to Adjusted OIBDA and operating income on Slide 9. Second quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 4.2% to $1.8 billion, and our Adjusted OIBDA margin fell 10 basis points. Excluding NaviSite, Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.8%. Operating income rose 15.8% to nearly $1.1 billion in the second quarter, and our operating income margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 21.5%, driven by a significant decline in amortization expense.
Total second quarter operating expense, which included $19 million of operating expense for NaviSite, grew 4.6% compared to last year. Employee costs were up just over 5% year-over-year, driven by annual salary increases across all our businesses and higher headcount, primarily in Business Services including NaviSite. Business Services employee cost grew 34%, while the rest of the company was up less than 3%. Programming expense increased 4.1% in aggregate and 8% on a per subscriber basis. The increase was driven by contractual rate increases and higher retransmission consent expense, which was partially offset by the decline in video subscribers. We expect programming cost per sub growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as 2010.
voice costs were down 9.6% in Q2, as we benefited from the insourcing of our voice support functions. The insourcing process is going very well. And as of the end of Q2, we had migrated almost half our phone customers, and have largely completed this year's moves. As a result of these efforts, our Q2 monthly Residential voice cost per sub dropped nearly $2 year-over-year to $10.30. And our voice gross margin improved over 500 basis points year-over-year. We expect voice cost per sub to decline further in the second half as we benefit from full quarter of savings for each migrated sub. Most of our remaining voice subscribers will be moved in 2013. And when we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our premigration voice cost cut roughly in half.
Our net bad debt expense declined 15% to $34 million, reflecting the better quality of receivables and better collections. Second quarter marketing expense of $160 million was $4 million higher than last year, and remains relatively constant at 3.2% of revenues.
During the second quarter, we continue to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new home security offering. In Q2, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $15 million compared to $10 million in the second quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives over the course of the year, and still expect our total 2011 startup losses to be in the $75 million range. 
Looking forward, we expect that Adjusted OIBDA growth will accelerate in Q4, as we benefit from insourcing our voice support functions, the expected cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative and some onetime expenses that reduced Q4 2010 adjusted OIBDA. Operating income growth will actually moderate in the second half, as we lap last year's improvement in amortization expense. Nonetheless, we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10, through the first 6 months of the year, CapEx was under $1.4 billion or less than 14% of revenues, down from just under 16% in the first half of 2010. Second quarter CapEx was down 4.9% year-over-year to $700 million. Q2 Residential capital expenditures were 13.3% of Residential revenue, and were down year-over-year to $572 million due primarily to lower CPE, upgrades and rebuilds and line extensions, partially offset by higher scalable infrastructure. Business Services capital expenditures were $118 million, flat with last year's second quarter. Roughly half of the B2B  CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Total CapEx continued to benefit from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce per-unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain.
As Glenn mentioned, we are spending on projects that will help us to more rapidly deploy product enhancements and improve our customers experience. Specifically, our data centers in Charlotte and Denver, as well as our conversions to all-digital in Maine. And we continue to rollout DOCSIS 3.0 across our footprint. We also expect to continue to invest in Business Services growth. So while capital intensity in the first half of the year was our lowest ever, we will spend more in the back half of the year and expect that full year capital spending will be in the $2.9 billion to $3 billion range, consistent with the 2010 level and still below $3 billion as we set at the outset of the year.
Moving onto cash flow on the next slide. We continue to grow our cash flows at strong double-digit rates. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the second quarter was $1.1 billion, an almost 11% year-over-year increase and a new all-time high. The $109 million of growth was the result of the $73 million increase of Adjusted OIBDA and a $36 million decrease in CapEx. 
For the first 6 months of 2011, Adjusted OIBDA, less CapEx grew nearly 12.5% to just under $2.2 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $815 million, up nearly 43% over Q2 of '10. Free cash flow per diluted share rose 51% to $2.40. The $244 million of year-over-year free cash flow growth was largely driven by an improvement in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, and a roughly $150 million decline in cash taxes, due in part to bonus depreciation benefits that I'll cover in more detail in just a moment. 
For the first half of 2011, free cash flow was over $1.7 billion, up 42% from first half of 2010. Again, aided by bonus depreciation related to declines in cash taxes. First half free cash flow per share grew 48% to $5.06.
We've gotten lots of questions over the last several quarters regarding the impact of economic stimulus legislation on our cash taxes and free cash flow, both historically and going forward. So we thought we'd lay it out in some detail. 
If you turn to Slide 12, you can see that the blue bars represent the gross stimulus benefit in each year. While the dark gray bars highlight the reversal of prior year benefits in each year. The green line tracks the net benefit or detriment to cash taxes and free cash flow in each year. So you can see we benefited from the bonus depreciation provisions of various federal stimulus acts since the beginning of 2008. Current law provides for 100% bonus depreciation in 2011, which when netted against reversals of prior year benefits yield the current year net cash tax benefit of roughly $600 million. Next year, the current law provides for 50% bonus depreciation, which will yield roughly $300 million of gross benefit. But that led to the reversal of past benefits resulting in a net negative impact on cash taxes. The exact amount depends on 2012 capital spending. But if 2012 CapEx were similar to this year's expected level, we would see a negative impact on cash taxes and free cash flow of roughly $100 million. 
So we're looking at a swing of approximately $700 million in cash taxes and free cash flow from 2011 to 2012 related solely to the effects of economic stimulus legislation. As you can see, assuming bonus depreciation end after next year, the net negative impact of the Economic Stimulus Act is greatest in 2013 and then moderates thereafter. Of course, we'd be happy to go through all of these in more detail offline. Let's turn to the next slide.
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.24 increased over 30% from $0.95 in Q2 '10 primarily due to an increase in operating income and the benefit of our share repurchases, which were partially offset by higher book taxes, net interest expense and loss from equity investments. Both this year and last year second quarters were impacted by a number of items highlighted in our press release. Through the first 2 quarters, diluted EPS was $2.16, up almost 40% over the same period of last year. We continue to expect the 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 range.
As usual, let's finish up with the balance sheet on the next slide. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $21 billion, a $600 million increase from year-end 2010. Our leverage ratio ticked up slightly to 2.99x. This quarter, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $163 million or $0.48 a share in dividend and bought back 11.5 million shares of common stock for $863 million during the second quarter. Since quarter end, we've repurchased 3.3 million additional shares. And since we launched the repurchase program in November of 2010, we have repurchased approximately 35 million shares at an average price of $71 per share, for a total of roughly $2.5 billion. So this leaves about $1.5 billion remaining on our original authorization.
So to summarize, another solid quarter marked by exceptionally strong growth in Business Services and continued healthy free cash flow, coupled with the methodical execution of our balance sheet and return of capital strategy. Thank you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

I think that the total U.S. Hispanic population is somewhere in the order of 16% -- Hispanics represent approximately 16% of the total U.S. population. We over-indexed and in particular, we over-indexed in our Southern California and Texas markets. I think in those markets, based on the most recent census that we could push into the 30-plus percent of the population being Hispanic. Bigger amongst younger people and somewhat smaller among adults. Really, what we're doing to focus on that market is ensuring that we've got the right products that could appeal to what it is that the Hispanic audience is looking for. And as a result, that's why we're introducing this new Triple Play, which not only focuses on Hispanic-oriented programming, Spanish-language and otherwise, but also focuses on the telecom needs of that market. And by throwing a robust international calling plan into the package, we think we're going to satisfy another need of that audience. There's also a fair amount of opportunity even at the higher end of that market. And as a result, we're tailoring a Signature Home version for Hispanic customers. And as I've mentioned, we're also adding Spanish-language channels to our iPad app. So we're doing a lot on the product side. And a lot of this has to do with ensuring that the message gets heard, and our marketing focus is getting somewhat more aggressive in making Hispanic customers aware that we have this product. I'm pleased with the growth in El Paquetazo. But just to put it in perspective, I think, our total El Paquetazo subs now roughly 130,000. So we don't have huge numbers, and I don't have great stats on exactly who those subs are coming from."

And then 2, you mentioned that transactional VOD was down. It seemed like it was a pretty big number. Is that due to Netflix? I mean, I realized you don't have HBO Go launch yet.

But again, nothing to announce at this point. On VOD, I'll let Rob handle it, other than to say that there's -- one of the things going on in VOD is there's been a fairly steady trends over some time period now for adult to go down, largely because there's that kind of material available on the Internet for free.

So you can expect to see a pop, when you have a Pacquiao or Mosley and sometimes, when you don't get, you see a little bit of the downturn. MOD, we did see a decline in buys. And we did not see a concomitant increase in revenue per buy. So could that be in part a function of alternative availability of movies? I guess, yes. It also could be a matter of the slate.

The TV Everywhere, we are very big advocates of that, have been from the very beginning. As you recall, we were still part of Time Warner when this idea first came about. I think it makes also the sense in the world. It is not the easiest thing to pull off in the deal sense, the technology is not that complicated. But negotiating deals one at a time with different programs, well, it's very complicated. Though the concept seemed simple, everybody has slightly different ideas of how we should work when you get down on the details. And by the way, not everybody -- not every network has all the rights for all their programming to do this to begin with. So I think it's progressing actually pretty well. With Disney and ESPN, we actually did the first big TV Everywhere deals. And I think you will see more from us and other people as time goes by. Again, the technology is not complicated. It's all the details. I still think it's a great idea, and we're all for it. Bandwidth cost, I actually don't even know the answer. But I think the conversation about usage-based pricing should not be tied to a conversation about cost. This is not a rate of return regulated monopoly industry like AT&T was before 1984, and I think there's a tendency to think the world still works that way. We have a lot of different products, we have a lot of different offerings, and we're aiming at different segments and different combinations. And the pricing will relate to that. This is not a strict cost base thing. So those facts are interesting,  but not terribly relevant to pricing."

Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Irene Esteves, who joined us a couple of weeks ago and is here with us today. Irene is rapidly coming up on the learning curve, and you can expect to hear from her on the third quarter call. In the meantime, Rob Marcus will cover the financial results one last time this morning.
I'm pleased to report that our core business is healthy despite competitive pressures and the continuing weakness in the economy. We're continuing to make investments in our Residential and Business Services to drive growth. Second quarter revenue and adjusted OIBDA each grew by more than 4% year-over-year. We generated a record $1.1 billion of OIBDA, less CapEx, which drove very strong free cash flow, and our earnings per share growth topped 30%. We returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter.
Our Business Services results were very strong. And with the addition of NaviSite in the most recent quarter, Business Services revenue growth was 35%. NaviSite has won a couple of very significant contracts since the acquisition closed in April, reinforcing our enthusiasm for the acquisition. Growth in Residential Services moderated in the second quarter, driven by seasonal weakness in subscriber net additions and accentuated by the weak economy and the intensity of competition.
While we're working on enhancements to our products at the high end, we're also looking at lower cost alternatives to address a growing affordability problem amongst low-income customers. But we're focused not just on products, we recognize that we also need to do a much better job of telling our story to consumers.
There's several important trends and developments I'd like to highlight this morning. The Broadband business continues to benefit from the accelerating usage trends. We're seeing more demand for our higher speeds and pricing remains strong. As Broadband becomes increasingly important to our customers, we think we can create additional value by making it available to them everywhere. We're continuing to deploy Wi-Fi capabilities in Los Angeles. And we're exploring how we might sell broadband packages that would bundle our wireline service with Wi-Fi and wireless service for a single attractive price. You'll be hearing more about our plans in the coming months.
In video, technology is giving us the opportunity to dramatically improve the utility of our products. The second release of our iPad app is a great example. We now have over 100 live channels, and the ability to use the iPad as a remote control using an enhanced program guide. The next version, which is a month or so away, will bring full keyboard-enabled search and we're hard at work bringing similar functionality to many other popular consumer electronics devices such as Smart TVs. We're investing in our businesses, so that they remain strong and competitive. We recently announced the pending construction of a new data center on our Charlotte, North Carolina campus. That facility will enable us to more rapidly deploy video, high-speed data, voice and business services by having storage and network elements in a shared environment. It will also house 1 of 2 national super headends.
Over the next 2 years, we plan to migrate the origination and distribution of our video service to this facility and to a matching one in the Denver area, generating operating cost savings and enabling us to more completely standardize the provision of services across our footprint. Our nationwide IP feed, which today serves iPads and which will feed other devices such as Smart TVs over time, already originates in the Denver facility. 
Through our deployment of Switched Digital Video over the last several years, we dramatically expanded our capacity for high-definition and broadband services. As I've said for some time, our long-term plan is to supplement Switched Digital Video by gradually going all digital. Consistent with that plan, we have embarked on an all-digital transition in Augusta, Maine, extending our existing all-digital footprint beyond New York City and parts of Los Angeles. Augusta is our first deployment of digital transport adopters or so-called DTAs. Our plan is to migrate our remained systems to all-digital over the next 5 years or so. And we continue to expand our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment, which now covers roughly 60% of our footprint. We expect to complete that rollout next year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter. We also continue to be interested in extending our cable footprint, when we can do so at the right price. In the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of systems serving roughly 130,000 PSUs from NewWave Communications for $260 million. This acquisition highlights our disciplined approach to capital allocation and M&A. Taking into account a full tax step-up and significant operational synergies, it enables us to expand our cable footprint at a purchase price that compares favorably to the repurchase of our own shares.
In summary, our business continues to perform well. We are thoughtfully deploying capital to improve our customer's experience with our products and to acquire a cable footprint and business service capabilities that will enable further growth. And we continue to show significant -- we continue to return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. 
So before I turn the call over to Rob, one last time in his role as acting CFO, I'd like to extend our thanks for the terrific job he's done as our CFO for the last 3.5 years. Rob?"

As usual, I'll jump right in to our second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Second quarter revenue grew 4.4% year-over-year as Residential Services revenue increased 2.5%, Business Services revenue growth accelerated to almost 35%, and advertising revenue grew over 4%. Adjusted OIBDA grew over 4% in the quarter, and operating income was up almost 16%. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, increased almost 11% to a record $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was up almost 43% to $815 million or $2.40 per diluted share.
As you know, we closed our acquisition of NaviSite in April. And NaviSite accounted for roughly 50 basis points of total revenue growth and about 40 basis points of Adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. Diluted EPS increased over 30% to $1.24. We returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, with half the year behind us, we remain on track to meet or exceed all elements of our full year financial guidance.
Let's move on to our Q2 subscriber trends on the next slide. As expected, subscriber performance showed typical seasonal weakness. And due to continued economic headwinds and increased competitive intensity, subscriber net adds were somewhat softer than last year. That relative weakness has continued into the early part of Q3. That said, performance varied across our footprint, with subscriber performance in Texas and Southern California notably better than the rest of the footprint.
We continue to grow our HSD subscribers with 67,000 net adds in the quarter, more than the HSD net adds reported last week by AT&T and Verizon combined. We finished the quarter with 10.1 million total HSD subs. That's a 4.7% year-over-year increase in our HSD subscriber base. Our residential high-speed data subscriber mix continued to improve, with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 125,000 Turbo and 25,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers. And at quarter end, Turbo and Wideband subs comprised over 17% of our Residential HSD customer base. 
Our Wideband subscribers, while still a small portion of the total, more than doubled during the second quarter. We now have deployed our DOCSIS 3.0 technology in about 60% of our footprint. And we will complete the footprint-wide rollout next year. 
Business HSD net adds accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 13,000 representing our highest quarterly net adds ever. We continued to see growth in voice. Net adds were 45,000, and we ended the quarter with over 4.6 million total voice subscribers, a 5.3% year-over-year increase. Included in net adds were 13,000 business voice net adds in the quarter, an all-time high.
Second quarter video sub losses were 128,000, about 17,000 more than we lost in last year's second quarter. Once again, a disproportionate share of the losses came from analog, single-play video customers. We actually added digital and bundled video customers. 
We continue to do well with our Spanish-language offering, especially in Texas and Southern California. We more than doubled the number of El Paquetazo subscribers we had just 5 quarters ago. In addition, we just launched an El Paquetazo Triple Play featuring a 1,000 minutes of international calling. We're in the process of adding 25 Spanish-language channels to our iPad app. And we're formulating a version of Signature Home for Spanish-speaking customers to be launched later this year. 
Customer relationship net losses were 74,000 in the quarter, as we lost video-only single-plays and a modest a number of doubles and triples among our lower-income customer segments and added double and triple plays among our higher-end segments. All in, we were able to grow our Triple Play base by 38,000 in the quarter. At quarter end, 60% of our customers were either double or triple plays. During Q2, we nearly doubled the number of customers taking Signature Home, our high-end Triple Play, coupling our best products with customized service. We ended the quarter with about 17,000 Signature Home subs, paying an average of $220 per month.
Turning to our financial results on the next slide, as you can see from our press release, we've made some changes this quarter in how we present our revenues. The new presentation is more consistent with the way we think about and run the business. In short, going forward, we'll be talking about revenue in 4 major categories: Residential Services, Business Services, Advertising and Other. Other captures a number of items, most notably commissions from Home Shopping Networks and amounts we received from Bright House Networks for the provision of HSD and various management services. Once we launch our L.A. Lakers RSN next year, affiliate fee revenue associated with those networks will also show up in other revenue. You can get more detail on the new presentation in our 10-Q and our trending schedules.
Second quarter revenue increased 4.4% year-over-year to $4.9 billion, with total ARPU per customer relationship increasing 4.8%. In dollar terms, total revenue were $210 million higher than in Q2 of last year, with $105 million of that growth coming from our Residential Services, $93 million coming from Business Services and $12 million coming from Advertising and Other revenue combined.
Let's focus first on Residential Services revenue on Slide 6. Residential revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year, driven by a combination of year-over-year HSD and voice subscriber growth and improved ARPU per PSU, offset by video subscriber losses. Of the $105 million of year-over-year Residential revenue growth, HSD contributed over 80% or $87 million. Residential HSD revenue increased 8.5% over Q2 of last year. The year-over-year growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a 3.5% improvement in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as, we continue to benefit from price increases and the improved HSD subscriber mix I mentioned earlier.
Residential voice revenue grew 4.4% year-over-year due to continued subscriber growth, as Residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat year-over-year. And Residential video revenue was essentially flat year-over-year as a 3.8% increase in ARPU offset a decline in video subscribers. The ARPU increase was driven by price increases, a more favorable video subscriber mix, increased equipment rental and installation charges and a 10% increase in DVR revenue, offset by declines in premium and transactional VOD revenues. Transactional VOD revenue declined $14 million, with the year-over-year drop being fairly even across the movies, events and adult categories. 
Let's move on to Business Services revenue on Slide 7. We had another very strong quarter in Business Services, which accounted for almost 45% of our total year-over-year revenue improvement in Q2. Business Services revenue for the quarter was $361 million, up almost 35% over Q2 of 2010.
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our NaviSite acquisition on April 21, which contributed $26 million of revenue in the quarter that's included in our other Business Services revenue category. Even without NaviSite, Business Services revenue grew 25%, our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth.
Of the $67 million of year-over-year growth from our non-NaviSite business, HSD contributed about 40% or $27 million. Wholesale transport contributed around 30% or $19 million, and voice provided about 25% or $17 million. Business HSD revenue increased 18%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. 
Wholesale transport revenue of $39 million, nearly doubled from Q2 of last year, and was driven by growth in cell tower backhaul. Cell tower backhaul revenue was $34 million, twice our cell tower backhaul revenue in last year's second quarter. At quarter end, we had an install base of roughly 6,900 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. 
Business voice revenue increased almost 60% driven by subscriber growth. So we're well on our way to achieving full year organic Business Services revenue growth in excess of 20%, and over 30% revenue growth including NaviSite.
Moving on to Advertising revenue on the next slide, ad revenue of $225 million increased $9 million or 4.2% year-over-year, as the expected drop in political advertising was more than offset by revenue from the Verizon files rep deal that we discussed on last quarter's call. Second quarter ad revenue was driven by particular strength in the media and entertainment category. 
Automotive, which fueled our growth last year and in Q1, increased just 4% year-over-year, in part a reflection of the after effects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and in part a reflection of the broader economy. We still expect that full year ad revenue will be greater than in 2010. But remember that the comps get much tougher as the year progresses, given that we generated $55 million from political advertising in the second half of last year.
Let's turn to Adjusted OIBDA and operating income on Slide 9. Second quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 4.2% to $1.8 billion, and our Adjusted OIBDA margin fell 10 basis points. Excluding NaviSite, Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.8%. Operating income rose 15.8% to nearly $1.1 billion in the second quarter, and our operating income margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 21.5%, driven by a significant decline in amortization expense.
Total second quarter operating expense, which included $19 million of operating expense for NaviSite, grew 4.6% compared to last year. Employee costs were up just over 5% year-over-year, driven by annual salary increases across all our businesses and higher headcount, primarily in Business Services including NaviSite. Business Services employee cost grew 34%, while the rest of the company was up less than 3%. Programming expense increased 4.1% in aggregate and 8% on a per subscriber basis. The increase was driven by contractual rate increases and higher retransmission consent expense, which was partially offset by the decline in video subscribers. We expect programming cost per sub growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as 2010.
Voice costs were down 9.6% in Q2, as we benefited from the insourcing of our voice support functions. The insourcing process is going very well. And as of the end of Q2, we had migrated almost half our phone customers, and have largely completed this year's moves. As a result of these efforts, our Q2 monthly Residential voice cost per sub dropped nearly $2 year-over-year to $10.30. And our voice gross margin improved over 500 basis points year-over-year. We expect voice cost per sub to decline further in the second half as we benefit from full quarter of savings for each migrated sub. Most of our remaining voice subscribers will be moved in 2013. And when we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our premigration voice cost cut roughly in half.
Our net bad debt expense declined 15% to $34 million, reflecting the better quality of receivables and better collections. Second quarter marketing expense of $160 million was $4 million higher than last year, and remains relatively constant at 3.2% of revenues.
During the second quarter, we continue to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new home security offering. In Q2, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $15 million compared to $10 million in the second quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives over the course of the year, and still expect our total 2011 startup losses to be in the $75 million range. 
Looking forward, we expect that Adjusted OIBDA growth will accelerate in Q4, as we benefit from insourcing our voice support functions, the expected cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative and some one-time expenses that reduced Q4 2010 adjusted OIBDA. Operating income growth will actually moderate in the second half, as we lap last year's improvement in amortization expense. Nonetheless, we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10, through the first 6 months of the year, CapEx was under $1.4 billion or less than 14% of revenues, down from just under 16% in the first half of 2010. Second quarter CapEx was down 4.9% year-over-year to $700 million. Q2 Residential capital expenditures were 13.3% of Residential revenue, and were down year-over-year to $572 million due primarily to lower CPE, upgrades and rebuilds and line extensions, partially offset by higher scalable infrastructure. Business Services capital expenditures were $118 million, flat with last year's second quarter. Roughly half of the B2B  CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Total CapEx continued to benefit from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce per-unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain.
As Glenn mentioned, we are spending on projects that will help us to more rapidly deploy product enhancements and improve our customers' experience. Specifically, our data centers in Charlotte and Denver, as well as our conversions to all-digital in Maine. And we continue to rollout DOCSIS 3.0 across our footprint. We also expect to continue to invest in Business Services growth. So while capital intensity in the first half of the year was our lowest ever, we will spend more in the back half of the year and expect that full year capital spending will be in the $2.9 billion to $3 billion range, consistent with the 2010 level and still below $3 billion as we said at the outset of the year.
Moving onto cash flow on the next slide. We continue to grow our cash flows at strong double-digit rates. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the second quarter was $1.1 billion, an almost 11% year-over-year increase and a new all-time high. The $109 million of growth was the result of the $73 million increase of Adjusted OIBDA and a $36 million decrease in CapEx. 
For the first 6 months of 2011, Adjusted OIBDA, less CapEx grew nearly 12.5% to just under $2.2 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $815 million, up nearly 43% over Q2 of '10. Free cash flow per diluted share rose 51% to $2.40. The $244 million of year-over-year free cash flow growth was largely driven by an improvement in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, and a roughly $150 million decline in cash taxes, due in part to bonus depreciation benefits that I'll cover in more detail in just a moment. 
For the first half of 2011, free cash flow was over $1.7 billion, up 42% from first half of 2010. Again, aided by bonus depreciation related to declines in cash taxes. First half free cash flow per share grew 48% to $5.06.
We've gotten lots of questions over the last several quarters regarding the impact of economic stimulus legislation on our cash taxes and free cash flow, both historically and going forward. So we thought we'd lay it out in some detail. 
If you turn to Slide 12, you can see that the blue bars represent the gross stimulus benefit in each year. While the dark gray bars highlight the reversal of prior year benefits in each year. The green line tracks the net benefit, or detriment, to cash taxes and free cash flow in each year. So you can see we benefited from the bonus depreciation provisions of various federal stimulus acts since the beginning of 2008. Current law provides for 100% bonus depreciation in 2011, which when netted against reversals of prior year benefits, yield the current year net cash tax benefit of roughly $600 million. Next year, the current law provides for 50% bonus depreciation, which will yield roughly $300 million of gross benefit. But that led to the reversal of past benefits resulting in a net negative impact on cash taxes. The exact amount depends on 2012 capital spending. But if 2012 CapEx were similar to this year's expected level, we would see a negative impact on cash taxes and free cash flow of roughly $100 million. 
So we're looking at a swing of approximately $700 million in cash taxes and free cash flow for 2011 to 2012 related solely to the effects of economic stimulus legislation. As you can see, assuming bonus depreciation ends after next year, the net negative impact of the Economic Stimulus Act is greatest in 2013 and then moderates thereafter. Of course, we'd be happy to go through all of these in more detail offline. Let's turn to the next slide.
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.24 increased over 30% from $0.95 in Q2 '10 primarily due to an increase in operating income and the benefit of our share repurchases, which were partially offset by higher book taxes, net interest expense and loss from equity investments. Both this year and last year second quarters were impacted by a number of items highlighted in our press release. Through the first 2 quarters, diluted EPS was $2.16, up almost 40% over the same period of last year. We continue to expect the 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the $4.25 to $4.50 range.
As usual, let's finish up with the balance sheet on the next slide. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $21 billion, a $600 million increase from year-end 2010. Our leverage ratio ticked up slightly to 2.99x. This quarter, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We paid out $163 million or $0.48 a share in dividends and bought back 11.5 million shares of common stock for $863 million during the second quarter. Since quarter end, we've repurchased 3.3 million additional shares. And since we launched the repurchase program in November of 2010, we have repurchased approximately 35 million shares at an average price of $71 per share, for a total of roughly $2.5 billion. So this leaves about $1.5 billion remaining on our original authorization.
So to summarize, another solid quarter marked by exceptionally strong growth in Business Services and continued healthy free cash flow, coupled with the methodical execution of our balance sheet and return of capital strategy. Thank you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

I think that the total U.S. Hispanic population is somewhere in the order of 16% -- Hispanics represent approximately 16% of the total U.S. population. We over-indexed and in particular, we over-indexed in our Southern California and Texas markets. I think in those markets, based on the most recent census that we could push into the 30-plus percent of the population being Hispanic. Bigger amongst younger people and somewhat smaller among adults. Really, what we're doing to focus on that market is ensuring that we've got the right products that could appeal to what it is that the Hispanic audience is looking for. And as a result, that's why we're introducing this new Triple Play, which not only focuses on Hispanic-oriented programming, Spanish-language and otherwise, but also focuses on the telecom needs of that market. And by throwing a robust international calling plan into the package, we think we're going to satisfy another need of that audience. There's also a fair amount of opportunity even at the higher end of that market. And as a result, we're tailoring a Signature Home version for Hispanic customers. And as I've mentioned, we're also adding Spanish-language channels to our iPad app. So we're doing a lot on the product side. And a lot of this has to do with ensuring that the message gets heard, and our marketing focus is getting somewhat more aggressive in making Hispanic customers aware that we have this product. I'm pleased with the growth in El Paquetazo. But just to put it in perspective, I think, our total El Paquetazo subs now roughly 130,000. So we don't have huge numbers, and I don't have great stats on exactly who those subs are coming from."

We've focused on customer segmentation, we've paid attention to customer lifetime value. We've gotten much more scientific about our approach to pricing.

So there's undoubtedly some maturation of the product offering. Two, I think you're seeing some of the effects of some promotional offers that we've made available. Last year, we've put in place some Triple Plays that were -- that featured a free period of DVR. So in terms of the year-over-year impact, you're seeing the absence of that. And you're also seeing some customers who, after the free period, are rolling off. And then not surprisingly, given the still stagnant economy, one of the places that we find customers were strapped cutting back is to eliminate the DVR. So I think there's a bunch of different things going on, but those things all have an influence."

On competitive intensity, really, I think the most market change from the past is just an increasing aggressiveness of the offers we're seeing from our competitors. So the satellite guys, DIRECT in particular is offering a pretty aggressive video package, I think, $29.99 but including a free Sunday ticket offer. The phone companies are going out with very aggressive triples. Verizon has gone to a no contract, $99.99 with free MR DVR for life. And U-Verse has got a -- also an aggressive triple, I think an $89.99, with a pretty significant cash back offer. So it's really just a progression of more aggressive offers. In addition, based on our estimates, FiOS has also spent a lot more marketing dollars in our footprint than they have in the past. So that's the essence of what we're seeing on the competitive intensity side. On the ad front, I think, what I heard you say was you're looking to figure out what portion of the total advertising revenue is associated with the FiOS deal?"

The TV Everywhere, we are very big advocates of that, have been from the very beginning. As you recall, we were still part of Time Warner when this idea first came about. I think it makes also the sense in the world. It is not the easiest thing to pull off in the deal sense, the technology is not that complicated. But negotiating deals one at a time with different programs, well, it's very complicated. Though the concept seemed simple, everybody has slightly different ideas of how we should work when you get down on the details. And by the way, not everybody -- not every network has all the rights for all their programming to do this to begin with. So I think it's progressing actually pretty well. With Disney and ESPN, we actually did the first big TV Everywhere deals. And I think you will see more from us and other people as time goes by. Again, the technology is not complicated. It's all the details. I still think it's a great idea, and we're all for it. Bandwidth cost, I actually don't even know the answer. But I think the conversation about usage-based pricing should not be tied to a conversation about costs. This is not a rate of return regulated monopoly industry like AT&T was before 1984, and I think there's a tendency to think the world still works that way. We have a lot of different products, we have a lot of different offerings, and we're aiming at different segments and different combinations. And the pricing will relate to that. This is not a strict cost base thing. So those facts are interesting,  but not terribly relevant to pricing."

Time Warner Cable continue to post steady results in the third quarter with the year-over-year revenue and Adjusted OIBDA growth of just under 4%. 
Our free cash flow remains very strong. We generated more than $600 million in the third quarter and almost $2.4 billion year-to-date through September. We drove stronger residential video and broadband subscriber metrics compared to the year-ago quarter and we posted Business Services revenue growth of 35%, including NaviSite. 
As the ad sales did find. Although it's feeling the impact of a wobbly economy and the absence of 2010's election-year political advertising. 
Since our last call, we announced the acquisition of Insight Communications. We are excited about the opportunity to buy a well-run company in the business we love at an attractive price. And we look forward to serving Insight's customer and bringing them our innovative capabilities over time. We continue to expect the transaction to close at the first half of next year. 
Disciplined balance sheet management continues to be a top priority. The announced acquisition of Insight increased our pro forma leverage. As a result, we slowed the pace of our share repurchases, as we actively managed our balance sheet to meet our targeted leverage ratio and cost of capital. The slower pace notwithstanding. We still bought over $600 million worth of shares in the third quarter.
[Audio Gap]
Maximizing opportunity in our two most promising areas, residential broadband and Business Services while continuing to deliver both the content and innovation our customers expect in our video product. 
Broadband is a powerful service for which there appears to be unquenchable consumer thirst. We have a great story here. We are winning share while increasing ARPU. Over time, we'll devote much more of our plant's capacity to broadband and will allocate more capital to the service, as we continue to enable customers to access innovative and increasingly bandwidth-intensive Internet applications. 
Business Services is mostly about share shift. But I think we can also grow the category by applying new technology, including the capabilities we inquired with NaviSite. I can see the opportunity to grow this business even faster, if we make more investments in expanding our sales force and extending the plan to increase serviceability in certain parts of our footprint. 
Video is a very good, but mature business. We are striving to deploy resources thoughtfully to build on our strength. When you think about it, nearly everyone watches TV and may watch a lot of it. Cable has always been about offering access to more TV and providing greater convenience. We are building on this legacy by bringing our video products to a variety of consumer electronics devices. We're consistently updating our iPad app every few months and we're planning to bring similar functionality to existing, to additional devices later this year. 
We introduced total home DVRs across our footprint earlier this year, resulting in a better consumer experience, yet having a very modest impact on costs, hence will begin in story home gateways which we expect to further improve our services while actually reducing CPE capital and some configurations. 
And last I'd point to our user interface. We have no illusions that we can make all of our 14 million legacy set-top boxes sing and dance like an iPad. In fact, it isn't all that easy to invent a simple way to serve hundreds of channels with a remote control that isn't a keyboard. However, we are making incremental investments in the most recent generations of settops, that is those with a fast processors, the DOCSIS connection and home networking capabilities. As a result, we've now employed our first generation of cloud-based sky functionality and both the Syracuse, Los Angeles and Dallas. It provides advance search and box for on-demand content.  We expect to roll it out broadly in the next several quarters. 
We also need to refocus on the voice product. While cord cutting continues apace, we still have considerable opportunities to grow. Although, it may require new promotions and packaging to attract new customers. 
So in summary, we continue to post steady financial progress in the third quarter, powered by residential broadband and Business Services and we're particularly pleased by the stronger subscriber results in August and September. So let me turn it over to Irene and then Rob to give you additional background."

I'm excited to be here for my earnings call this morning and be part of the Time Warner Cable team. Let's start with our third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Third quarter revenue grew 3.7% over last year, as R",2751,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here for my earnings call this morning and be part of the Time Warner Cable team. Let's start with our third quarter highlights on Slide 3. 
Third quarter revenue grew 3.7% over last year, as Residential Services revenue increased 2% and Business Services revenue grew almost 35% while advertising revenue declined 3%. 
As you know, the third quarter 2011 includes the results from NaviSite which we acquired in the second quarter 2011. NaviSite accounts for roughly 70 basis points of total revenue growth and about 40 basis points Adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. 
Operating income was up 8.1% and free cash flow was up almost 55% to $613 million or $1.86 per diluted share. Excluding the benefits from the economic stimulus programs which are detailed in our trending schedules, free cash flow grew nearly 19%. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08 and we returned $731 million to our shareholders in the third quarter through share repurchases and dividends. 
And finally, with three quarters of the year behind us, we remain on track to meet or exceed all of our other elements of our full-year financial guidance, except for advertising revenues. We are moderating our expectations a bit. Now I'll touch on that in a few minutes. 
Let's move on to our Q3 subscriber trends on Slide 4. Subscriber net adds improved on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a while despite facing headwinds from a still weak economy. Once again, the performance varied across our footprint, with Texas and the Carolinas doing relatively better than the rest of our footprint.
We continue to grow our high-speed data subscribers with 105,000 net ads in the quarter, over four times the HSD net ads reported last week by AT&T and Verizon combined. We finished the quarter with nearly 10.2 million total HD subs. That's a 4.7% increase in our HSD subscriber base compared to last year. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continue to improve, with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 79,000 Turbo and 43,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers, offset somewhat by a net loss of basic and light subscribers. At quarter end, Turbo and Wideband subscribers together comprised over 80% of our residential HSD customer base. Wideband subscribers nearly doubled from the second quarter and increased tenfold from the third quarter a year ago. 
Consistent with our focus on targeting new customers, we added 97,000 residential HSD, Single Play subscribers. Business HSD net ads accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter to 16,000, representing our highest quarterly net ads ever. Third quarter video sublosses were 126,000, a 29,000 improvement from last year's third quarter and the first improvement in video net adds in almost two years as disconnects were down from the prior year period. We actually gained video subscribers in September. 
We continue to do well with our Spanish line offering, especially in Texas and Southern California. In fact, we've increased the number of ALERTEC Sasso subscribers almost 75% from the third quarter of 2010. 
We continue to see some growth in voice. Net adds were 5,000 and we ended the quarter with over 4.6 million voice subscribers, a 4.6% growth rate versus the prior year. The overall gain in voice subscribers was driven by business net adds of 13,000 which were partially offset by residential losses of 8,000 in the quarter. 
Customer relationships were largely flat for the second quarter of 2011. Our renewed focus on nonvideo customers resulted in record nonvideo net adds of 118,000, which mostly offset video only and Triple Play losses in the quarter. At quarter end, 60% of our customers were either double or triple plays. 
Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. 
Before we move on to the financials, let me give you an update on fourth quarter subscriber trends. It's still early in the quarter. But in the first few weeks of October, video and broadband net adds are in the same zone as a year ago. But voice net adds continue to be weaker. 
And turning to our financial results from the next slide, total third quarter revenue increased 3.7% year-over-year to $4.9 billion with total ARPU for customer relationship increasing 4%. Excluding NaviSite, revenue grew 3%. 
In dollar terms, total revenue was $177 million higher, with $83 million of that growth coming from Residential Services, $56 million from Organic business services growth and $34 million from NaviSite, partially offset by $6 million revenue decline in advertising and other revenue combined. 
Let's focus first on Residential Services revenue on Slide 6. Residential revenue grew 2%, driven by a combination of HSD and voice subscriber growth and improved ARPU for PSU partially offset by video subscriber losses. 
Residential HSD revenue grew by 7.8% contributing $81 million of the growth and residential voice contributed $15 million, with a 3.1% growth rate, partially offset by a $14 million or 0.5% decline in residential video revenue. 
Switching to Slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, we did a good job on retaining customers during difficult economic times. Thus, coupled our efforts on moving existing customers up the value chain to realize higher ARPU, helps drive revenue growth despite the tough economy. 
Turning to Slide 8. The residential video revenue decline reflects a 3.3% increase in ARPU which largely offset a decline in video subscribers. The ARPU increase was driven by price increases, a more favorable video subscriber mix, increased equipment rental installation charges and a 10% increase on DDR revenue offset by decline in premium channels and transactional video-on-demand revenues. 
Premium channel revenue was down $12 million from Q3 2010 and accounted for most of the decline. Transactional video in demand revenue declined $7 million, with a drop off being fairly even across the movies and adult categories, and events were flat. 
Switching to Slide 9, residential HSD revenue growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a 3.1% improvement in residential HSD ARPU. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD the ARPU improvement, as we continue to benefit from price increases and the approved HSD subscriber mix I mentioned earlier. On a sequential basis, HSD ARPU was a couple of pennies lower than the second quarter, in part due to seasonality. Most of the connects are backend loaded, as students returned to college and often students enjoyed discounted bulk rates.
In addition, as part of our effort to win over more DSL subs, we offered single play HSD promotions at $29.95. 
Moving on to Slide 10, residential voice revenue improvement was driven by subscriber growth which was slightly muted by 0.9% decrease in ARPU. 
And moving to Slide 11, organic revenue growth from Business Services accounted for over 35% of the company's overall growth versus last year. NaviSite contributed nearly 20% of the growth. Combined Business Services accounted for over 55% of our overall revenue growth this past quarter. And for the quarter, Business Services revenue was up 23% organically and almost 35%, including NaviSite. Of the $66 million of organic growth, HSD contributed over 40% or $28 million. Voice provided more than 25% or $18 million and wholesale transport contributed about 20% or $14 million. Business HSD revenue increased close to 18% driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access. Business voice revenue increased over 50% driven by subscriber growth and wholesale transport revenues of $39 billion increased more than 55% and was driven by growth in that call. 
Golder backhaul revenue was $34 million, a 55% increase from last year's third quarter. At quarter end, we had an installed base of roughly 7,200 revenue generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. So we are well under way to achieving full year Organic Business Services revenue growth in excess of 20% and over 30% revenue growth, including NaviSite. 
On the next slide, you will see advertising revenues of $216 million, a decrease of $7 million or 3.1% as expected drop in political advertising and weakness in the overall ad market in our footprint was only partially offset by revenues from third party that feels. 
Pricing in another way, the media and automotive categories had relatively strong growth offset by the decline in political. 
Given the soft advertising trends we saw in the third quarter, coupled with the $42 million of political advertising we sold in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect fourth quarter 2011 advertising revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis and that full-year advertising revenue will be down slightly from 2010. 
Let's turn to Slide 13. Third quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.9% to $1.8 billion and our margin increased 10 basis points. Excluding NaviSite, Adjusted OIBDA grew 3.5% and our margin increased 20 basis points. 
Operating income rose 8.1% to about $1 billion and our operating income margin improved 80 basis points to 20.4% driven by a decline in amortization expense related to the customer relationships associated with Adelphia and the TKCCT partnership being fully amortized in the third quarter and at the end of 2010 respectively. 
Total third quarter operating expense which included $27 million from NaviSite grew 3.6% compared to last year and costs were up 6.3% driven by annual salary increases across all of our businesses and higher headcount, primarily in Business Services which includes NaviSite. Business Services employee cost increased over 38% while the rest of the company was up around 3.5%. 
Program expense increased 3.5% in aggregate and 7.4% on a per subscriber basis. The increase was driven by contractual rate increases, higher retransmission consent expense and program adjustments that increased growth by about $5 million which were partially offset by the decline in video subscribers. Even with these increases, the video profit contribution per subscriber increased. We expect programming cost per sub growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as in 2010. 
Voice costs were down 19% in Q3, as the benefits from the in-sourcing of our voice support functions continues to accrue. As of the end of Q3, we have migrated almost half of our phone customers and have largely completed this year's moves. Our Q3 monthly residential voice cost per sub dropped over $3 versus a year ago to $9.06. And our total gross of voice gross margins improved nearly 800 basis points year-over-year. 
Fourth quarter voice cost per sub should be similar to the third part as we have fewer subscriber migrations this year. For 2012, we will benefit from a full-year of cost savings for the subs to be migrated during 2011. 
Most of our remaining voice subscribers will be moved in 2013. And when we are all done in 2014, we expect to see our pre-migration voice cost cut roughly in half. 
Third quarter marketing expense of $153 million was constant at 3.3% of revenue. And during the third quarter, we continue to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new home security offering. In Q3, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $20 million, up $5 million from the third quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives during the fourth quarter and still expect our total 2011 startup losses to be in the range of $75 million. 
Consistent with the update that we provided you in our conference in September, Q3 Adjusted OIBDA growth decelerated from the second quarter and we expect growth will accelerate in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from in-sourcing our voice support function, the expected cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiatives and some one time expenses that reduced Q4 2010 Adjusted OIBDA. Including an Executive severance charge and a reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. 
Operating income growth moderated in the third quarter since we lacked a portion of last year's improvements in amortization expense which will also affect fourth quarter operating income growth. Nonetheless, we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year. 
Moving to the next slide, third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.08 increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in operating income and the benefit of our share repurchases which were partially offset by higher net income tax and interest expenses. 
Last year's Q3 book taxes were reduced by about $23 million related to the partial release of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.7% compared to 40.4% in the third quarter of 2011. 
Through the first three quarters of 2011, diluted earnings per share was $3.24, up 27% over the same period last year. We continue to expect that 2011 full-year diluted EPS will be in those range of $4.25 to $4.50, including the additional carry on the balance we issued earlier this year. 
Turning to capital spending on Slide 15. Through the first nine months of the year, CapEx was just under $2 billion or 13.6% of revenue, down from 15.3% in the first nine months of 2010. Third quarter CapEx was down 6.5% year-over-year to $632 million. 
The decline in capital spending has driven depreciation growth rate down to 0.4% -- sorry, 0.04% for the first nine months. Total CapEx continue to benefit from our strategic sourcing initiative which is helping to reduce our pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain. 
Business Services capital expenditures were $117 million, largely flat with last year's third quarter. And roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backlog footprint. Q2 residential capital expenditures were 12% of residential revenue and were down to $508 million due primarily to lower CPE upgrades and rebuilds and scalable infrastructure.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are spending on projects that will help us to rapidly deploy product enhancements and improve our customers' experience, including data centers in Charlotte and Denver, our conversion to all-digital in Maine and the continued rollout of DOCSIS 3.0. We also expect to continue to invest in Business Services growth. So while capital intensity in the first nine months of the year was our lowest ever, we expect to spend more in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect that full-year capital spending will be in the $2.9 billion to $3 billion range, consistent with our 2010 level. 
Moving onto cash flow in Slide 16, we continue to grow our cash flow strong double digit rates in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $613 million, up nearly 55% over the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the bonus depreciation, free cash flow was still up nearly 19%. For the first nine months of 2011, free cash flow was almost $2.4 billion, up over 45% from the comparable period in 2010. Excluding bonus depreciation, nine months free cash flow grew 2.9%. 
Before we move on to our capital return, let me remind you that we expect cash taxes will increase next year. As we detailed for you last quarter, the 2012 CapEx were similar to this year's expected level cash taxes will be approximately $700 million higher in 2012 and in 2011. This is due to the reversals of benefits received in prior years in the economic legislation. 
And let's finish up with our capital return slides. We ended the quarter with a net debt and preferred equity totaling $21.2 billion an $826 million increase in year end 2010 while leverage ratio was 3.0x in the last 12 months Adjusted OIBDA. This quarter, we returned $731 million to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividend. We bought back 8 million shares of common stock worth $573 million and paid out $158 million or $0.48 per share in dividends during the third quarter. 
Since quarter end through October 25, we repurchased 1.4 million -- 1.5 million additional shares. Since we launched the repurchase program in November 2010, we have repurchased approximately 40 million shares or 11% of what was been outstanding at an average price of $70 per share for a total of roughly $2.9 billion. This leaves about $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization. 
To summarize, we had another solid quarter where we continue to drive strong growth in broadband and Business Services which lifted revenue growth and drove healthy free cash flow. We continue to return capital shareholders in excess of our free cash flow, as we prudently manage our balance sheet to our targeted leverage ratio and cost of capital. Thank you.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob"

It's great to have Irene on board to bring a fresh perspective to our organization and not incidentally to enable me to devote my full attention to our operations. I'm pleased that we continue to grow the business nicely, despit",1183,"Good morning, everyone.  It's great to have Irene on board to bring a fresh perspective to our organization and not incidentally to enable me to devote my full attention to our operations. 
I'm pleased that we continue to grow the business nicely, despite a pretty tough economic and competitive environment. That said, I always believed we can do better and we've already taken meaningful action in a couple of areas. 
We've talked a lot about improving our marketing capabilities, and we made good progress on that front during the third quarter. Over the past couple of years, we built a strong research-based foundation and marketing, with significant progress in understanding customer segmentation, customer lifetime value and pricing theory. We're now building an action-oriented marketing organization on that foundation, that is focused on getting, keeping and growing subs. In other words, basic blocking and tackling. 
On the getting or acquisition side, we're focused on a few core areas.
First and foremost, we are focused on selling our most differentiated product, broadband. We are targeting the 3.7 million residential subs who subscribed to our video services, but don't buy broadband from us. We estimate that more than 2 million of these customers by broadband from the phone companies and the lion's share of them probably by DSL. In my mind, there's no reason for a customer who already does business with us to buy an inferior broadband product from someone else. So we're devoting a lot of cross channel add inventory to appeal to these customers with messaging specifically tailored to DSL winback. 
In addition, we are redoubling our efforts to sell broadband to households that don't currently subscribe to any of our services. We have increased and refocused our broadband price to reach this audience. 
It's early, but the results are encouraging. A key measure of marketing effectiveness is gross connect volume and broadband connects were up year-over-year across the board in Q3. HSD single play connect increased the most, but HSD doubles and triples were up too. 
Another aspect of the acquisition process is targeting the right product to the right customer. We've been more aggressive here too. At the high end, we've effectively relaunched our Signature Home offering. If you live in our footprint, you probably seen the new Signature Home commercials. They're certainly more provocative and more engaging than anything we've done in the past. We're trading our product in the context of a luxurious lifestyle. 
Core volume and connect have increased since we first aired the new campaign and Signature Home customer ARPU is over $230 a month as compared to our average Triple Play customer ARPU of about $150 so we're very pleased with the early results of the relaunch. 
As we discussed in the September conferences, we're also focused on addressing the needs of more budget conscious consumers. TV Essentials which is our smaller, less expensive video package is now available in New York City and Northeast Ohio, as well as upstate New York and we plan to launch of most of the rest of the footprint by year end. We've also just launched a TV Essentials light HSD Double Play.
One interesting observation is that while the TV Essentials product has generated lots of interest, the vast majority of customers who call about the offering end up taking a more robust video package. 
The one soft spot on the acquisition front this quarter was in our phone product. It's no secret that overall boys light of declining but at 17% penetration, we still see upside here. We completed that we need to put more marketing muscle behind voice and probably need to be somewhat more aggressive on price. 
Recently, we've devoted more of our cross channel inventory to a 1995 bolt-on phone product for Double Play customers. We think this can drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars. I'm not promising an immediate turnaround, but I do expect that we can do better than the recent trends. 
As I mentioned, we're focused not just on getting subs, but also in keeping and growing them. In particular, we are taking steps to better manage our customer relationships through the key junctures in their life cycles with us like price increases, promotional roll-offs and professional disconnects. We are proactively reaching out to customers in anticipation of these events and we are applying segmentation techniques, treating differently customers differently. And rather than simply offering discounts, we are offering customers more value so we can keep the customer and preserve ARPU and margin. 
We're continuing to make good progress on the product front as well. We are pressing our advantage in broadband by adding even more speed. DOCSIS 3.0 or Wideband is now available in roughly three quarters of our footprint. And as Irene mentioned, we nearly doubled our Wideband subscriber base in Q3. 
We are also adding mobility to our broadband products. In Los Angeles, we deployed more than 750 WiFi hotspots in some of the most highly trafficked zones of the city. World standards here and above customers now get free access to these hotspots. And our Wideband 50 customers also get two gigabytes of 4G, 3G mobile broadband for no additional monthly charge. For Turbo plus and Wideband 30 customers, they can get the same 4G 3G capability for an incremental $10 a month and for standard and turbo customers, they can get it for an extra $20. We just started marketing this capability last month and we've seen an almost immediate uptick in the take rates for a higher end of our broadband tiers in LA.  So early indications are that this approach to mobility resonates more than some of the earlier efforts we've made to sell stand-alone wireless broadband. 
We're also continuing to drive improvements in our video products. Version 2.5 of our iPad app introduced last month enables parental controls and search by title or episodes.
In the fourth quarter, we're planning to add on-demand content, as well as local broadcast in other channels in New York City, in addition to even better search capabilities. We'll then add local channels in other cities during 2012. 
We also have teams working to make our video product accessible on Android devices, game consoles, smart TVs and PCs. I will be remiss if I close without saying a word or two about our best performer Business Services. The core business selling to small and medium-sized businesses is strong, with Q3 revenue growth of 23%. The investments we've made in an expanded sales force are paying off as newer salespeople gain enough tenure and experience to carry full sales quotas. 
Early success at NaviSite further boosted overall Business Services growth to 35%. All-in-all, Business Services continues to be a significant engine of our overall growth. 
So in closing, we're taking a machine that runs well and renewing our attention to detail to drive even better performance.  We're pleased with the results, although we recognize that there's more work to be done. Thank you and with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

And I think as people, the great thing about the Internet is lots of third parties dream up lots of new applications that require more speed and more bandwidth. And we anticipate that we're going to have to devote more capacity to that over time. We will do that by gradually removing our analog signals from our  analog TV signals over plan. We've been doing that over the last several years by migrating to digital usage Switched Digital Video. And over the next several years, we'll be going all digital TV space.

But it is the case that the higher speed tiers do over an existing that's a conversation that you and I had before. With respect to the question of why a Time Warner Cable video customer would take HSD from the phone company, if it wasn't completely evident from my remarks, that's a question I ask around here everyday. I find it to be kind of inexplicable and unacceptable. So that is sort of what's given rise to our renewed push on winning those customers back. My suspicion is that those were initially telco voice customers and they were faced with the prospect of an cable video customers that were faced with a product prospect of adding HSD to one of those two products and for historical reasons which I don't think still apply they chose DSL.  The messaging really is for the long time now, our setting proposition was more speed. I think what we've discovered without really giving away any secret sauce is that the naked speed message has been insufficient to win those DSL customers over and what we need to do is do a better job explaining what speed translates to, in terms of the usage experience. In other words, no buffering on video consumption more. The ability to have more devices connected in a single home without a degradation in the experience. So messages that, that puts some customer behavior color on what speed offers. That's generally the pitch, Rich. I don't know, was there another piece, you said?"

The pure video on demand that adult and movies and I think what we see is that will be part is very dependent on how many titles are released and perhaps how they did in the box office and this quarter saw a little bit fewer new 1Q were very title and some of these will be weaker than they were a year ago so that we've seen that in the past.

I don't think that transaction will have an impact on our migration. If you really think about what we do, we take consumer devices that use all sorts of different standards and we provide usable video to them. And the only reason we have settops is that historically, the consumer electronic devices have not been able to display all of our services. They haven't been capable to weigh things. They're not capable of decrypting signals. And they don't have intelligence, so they can't display program guides. So those are essentially the three reasons we have settops. With the newest devices that are increasingly IP capable and increasingly have intelligence, the devices can do those three things. So whether it's the smart TVs that we the services on, the CES or in iPad or PC the list goes on and on, those devices can receive IP-video without settops. So that's the transition we're going to be making over the next several years. But we still are going to have to serve all the hundreds of millions devices that are out there that don't have those capabilities.

Time Warner Cable continued to post steady results in the third quarter with the year-over-year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth of just under 4%. Our free cash flow remains very strong. We generated more than $600 million in the third quarter and almost $2.4 billion year-to-date through September. We drove stronger residential video and broadband subscriber metrics compared to the year-ago quarter, and we posted business services revenue growth of 35%, including NaviSite. The ad sales did fine, although it's feeling the impact of a wobbly economy and the absence of 2010's election-year political advertising. 
Since our last call, we announced the acquisition of Insight Communications. We are excited about the opportunity to buy a well-run company in the business we love at an attractive price, and we look forward to serving Insight's customers and bringing them our innovative capabilities over time. We continue to expect the transaction to close at the first half of next year. 
Disciplined balance sheet management continues to be a top priority. The announced acquisition of Insight increased our pro forma leverage. As a result, we slowed the pace of our share repurchases as we actively manage our balance sheet to meet our targeted leverage ratio and cost of capital. The slower pace notwithstanding. We still bought over $600 million worth of shares in the third quarter.
[Audio Gap]
[indiscernible] maximizing our opportunity in our 2 most promising areas, residential broadband and business services, while continuing to deliver both the content and innovation our customers expect in our video product. 
Broadband is a powerful service for which there appears to be unquenchable consumer thirst. We have a great story here. We're winning share while increasing ARPU. Over time, we'll devote much more of our plant's capacity to broadband and will allocate more capital to the service, as we continue to enable customers to access innovative and increasingly bandwidth-intensive Internet applications. 
Business services is mostly about share shift. But I think we can also grow the category by applying new technology, including the capabilities we acquired with NaviSite. I can see the opportunity to grow this business even faster if we make more investments in expanding our sales force and extending the plan to increase serviceability in certain parts of our footprint. 
Video is a very good but mature business. We're striving to deploy resources thoughtfully to build on our strength. When you think about it, nearly everyone watches TV and may watch a lot of it. Cable has always been about offering access to more TV and providing greater convenience. We are building on this legacy by bringing our video product to a variety of consumer electronics devices. We're consistently updating our iPad app every few months, and we're planning to bring similar functionality to existing -- to additional devices later this year. 
We introduced total home DVRs across our footprint earlier this year, resulting in a better consumer experience yet having a very modest impact on costs. Next, we'll begin in storing home gateways, which we expect to further improve our service while actually reducing CPE capital and some configurations. 
And last, I'd point to our user interface. We have no illusions that we can make all of our 14 million legacy set-top boxes sing and dance like an iPad. In fact, it isn't all that easy to invent a simple way to serve hundreds of channels with a remote control that isn't a keyboard. However, we're making incremental investments in the most recent generations of set-tops, that is those with the fast processors, a DOCSIS connection and home networking capabilities. As a result, we've now employed our first generation of cloud-based sky functionality in parts of Syracuse, Los Angeles and Dallas. It provides advanced search and box for on-demand content. We expect to roll it out broadly in the next several quarters. 
We also need to refocus on the voice product. While cord cutting continues apace, we still have considerable opportunity to grow, although it may require new promotions and packaging to attract new customers. 
So in summary, we continued to post steady financial progress in the third quarter powered by residential broadband and business services. And we're particularly pleased by stronger subscriber results in August and September. 
So let me turn it over to Irene and then Rob to give you additional background."

Let's start off with our third quarter highlights on Slide 3. 
Third quarter revenue grew 3.7% over last year as residential services revenue increased 2% and business services revenue grew almost 35%, while advertising revenue declined 3%. 
As you know, the third quarter 2011 includes the results from NaviSite, which we acquired in the second quarter of 2011. NaviSite accounts for roughly 70 basis points of total revenue growth and about 40 basis points of adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. 
Operating income was up 8.1%, and free cash flow was up almost 55% to $613 million or $1.86 per diluted share. Excluding the benefits from the economic stimulus programs which are detailed in our trending schedules, free cash flow grew nearly 19%. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08, and we returned $731 million to our shareholders in the third quarter through share repurchases and dividends. 
And finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we remain on track to meet or exceed all other elements of our full year financial guidance except for advertising revenue. We are moderating our expectations a bit. Now I'll touch on that in a few minutes. 
Let's move on to our Q3 subscriber trends on Slide 4. Subscriber net adds improved on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a while despite facing headwinds from a still weak economy. Once again, the performance varied across our footprint, with Texas and the Carolinas doing relatively better than the rest of our footprint.
We continue to grow our high-speed data subscribers with 105,000 net adds in the quarter, over 4x the HSD net adds reported last week by AT&T and Verizon combined. We finished the quarter with nearly 10.2 million total HSD subs. That's a 4.7% increase in our HSD subscriber base compared to last year. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 79,000 Turbo and 43,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers, offset somewhat by a net loss of basic and light subscribers. At quarter end, Turbo and Wideband subscribers together comprised over 80% of our residential HSD customer base. Wideband subscribers nearly doubled from the second quarter and increased tenfold from the third quarter a year ago. 
Consistent with our focus on targeting new customers, we added 97,000 residential HSD, Single Play subscribers. Business HSD net adds accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter to 16,000, representing our highest quarterly net adds ever. Third quarter video sub losses were 126,000, a 29,000 improvement from last year's third quarter and the first improvement in video net adds in almost 2 years as disconnects were down from the prior-year period. We actually gained video subscribers in September. 
We continue to do well with our Spanish language offering, especially in Texas and Southern California. In fact, we've increased the number of  El Paquetazo subscribers almost 75% from the third quarter of 2010. 
We continued to see some growth in voice. Net adds were 5,000, and we ended the quarter with over 4.6 million voice subscribers, a 4.6% growth rate versus the prior year. The overall gain in voice subscribers was driven by business net adds of 13,000, which were partially offset by residential losses of 8,000 in the quarter. 
Customer relationships were largely flat for the second quarter of 2011. Our renewed focus on nonvideo customers resulted in record nonvideo net adds of 118,000, which mostly offset video-only and Triple Play losses in the quarter. At quarter end, 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. 
Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. 
Before we move on to the financials, let me give you an update on fourth quarter subscriber trends. It's still early in the quarter, but in the first few weeks of October, video and broadband net adds are in the same zone as a year ago. But voice net adds continued to be weaker. 
And turning to our financial results from the next slide. Total third quarter revenue increased 3.7% year-over-year to $4.9 billion with total ARPU for customer relationship increasing 4%. Excluding NaviSite, revenue grew 3%. 
In dollar terms, total revenue was $177 million higher with $83 million of that growth coming from residential services, $56 million from organic business services growth and $34 million from NaviSite, partially offset by $6 million revenue decline in advertising and other revenue combined. 
Let's focus first on residential services revenue on Slide 6. Residential revenue grew 2%, driven by a combination of HSD and voice subscriber growth and improved ARPU for PSU, partially offset by video subscriber losses. Residential HSD revenue grew by 7.8%, contributing $81 million of the growth, and residential voice contributed $15 million with a 3.1% growth rate, partially offset by a $14 million or 0.5% decline in residential video revenue. 
Switching to Slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, we did a good job of retaining customers during difficult economic times, thus, coupled with our efforts to move existing customers up the value chain to realize higher ARPU, helps drive revenue growth despite the tough economy. 
Turning to Slide 8. The residential video revenue decline reflects a 3.3% increase in ARPU, which largely offset a decline in video subscribers. The ARPU increase was driven by price increases, a more favorable video subscriber mix, increased equipment rental installation charges and a 10% increase on DDR revenue, offset by declines in premium channels and transactional video-on-demand revenues. Premium channel revenue was down $12 million from Q3 2010 and accounted for most of the decline. Transactional video-on-demand revenue declined $7 million with a drop off being fairly even across the movies and adult categories, and events were flat. 
Switching to Slide 9. Residential HSD revenue growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a 3.1% improvement in residential HSD ARPU. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement as we continued to benefit from price increases and the approved HSD subscriber mix that I mentioned earlier. On a sequential basis, HSD ARPU was a couple of pennies lower than the second quarter in part due to seasonality. Most of the connects are backend loaded as students returned to college. And often, students enjoyed discounted bulk rates.
In addition, as part of our effort to win over more DSL subs, we offered Single Play HSD promotions at $29.95. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Residential voice revenue improvement was driven by subscriber growth, which was slightly muted by 0.9% decrease in ARPU. 
And moving to Slide 11. Organic revenue growth from business services accounted for over 35% of the company's overall growth versus last year. NaviSite contributed nearly 20% of the growth. Combined business services accounted for over 55% of our overall revenue growth this past quarter. And for the quarter, business services revenue was up 23% organically and almost 35% including NaviSite. Of the $66 million of organic growth, HSD contributed over 40% or $28 million. 
Voice provided more than 25% or $18 million, and wholesale transport contributed about 20% or $14 million. Business HSD revenue increased close to 18%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access. Business voice revenue increased over 50%, driven by subscriber growth, and wholesale transport revenues of $39 billion increased more than 55% and was driven by growth cell tower backhaul. 
Cell tower backhaul revenue was $34 million, a 55% increase from last year's third quarter. At quarter end, we had an installed base of roughly 7,200 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. So we are well under way to achieving full year organic business services revenue growth in excess of 20% and over 30% revenue growth including NaviSite. 
On the next slide, you will see advertising revenues of $216 million decrease $7 million or 3.1% as the expected drop in political advertising and weakness in the overall ad market in our footprint was only partially offset by revenue from third-party rep deals. Pricing in another way, the media and automotive categories had relatively strong growth offset by the decline in political. 
Given the soft advertising trends we saw in the third quarter, coupled with the $42 million of political advertising we sold in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect fourth quarter 2011 advertising revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis, and that full-year advertising revenue will be down slightly from 2010. 
Let's turn to Slide 13. Third quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 3.9% to $1.8 billion, and our margin increased 10 basis points. Excluding NaviSite, adjusted OIBDA grew 3.5%, and our margin increased 20 basis points. 
Operating income rose 8.1% to about $1 billion, and our operating income margin improved 80 basis points to 20.4%, driven by a decline in amortization expense related to the customer relationships associated with Adelphia and the TKCCP partnership being fully amortized in the third quarter and at the end of 2010, respectively. 
Total third quarter operating expense, which included $27 million from NaviSite, grew 3.6% compared to last year. And full year costs were up 6.4%, driven by annual salary increases across all of our businesses and higher headcount, primarily in business services, which includes NaviSite. Business services employee cost increased over 38%, while the rest of the company was up around 3.5%. 
Programming expense increased 3.5% in aggregate and 7.4% on a per subscriber basis. The increase was driven by contractual rate increases, higher retransmission consent expense and programming adjustments that increased growth by about $5 million, which were partially offset by the decline in video subscribers. Even with these increases, the video profit contribution per subscriber increased. We expect programming cost per sub growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as in 2010. 
Voice costs were down 19% in Q3 as the benefits from the in-sourcing of our voice support functions continues to accrue. As of the end of Q3, we have migrated almost half of our phone customers and have largely completed this year's moves. Our Q3 monthly residential voice cost per sub dropped over $3 versus a year ago to $9.06. And our total gross -- voice gross margin improved nearly 800 basis points year-over-year. 
Fourth quarter voice cost per sub should be similar to the third part as we have fewer subscriber migrations less this year. For 2012, we will benefit from a full year of cost savings for the subs we migrated during 2011. Most of our remaining voice subscribers will be moved in 2013. And when we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our pre-migration voice cost cut roughly in half. 
Third quarter marketing expense of $163 million was constant at 3.3% of revenue. And during the third quarter, we continued to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new home security offering. In Q3, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $20 million, up $5 million from the third quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives during the fourth quarter and still expect our total 2011 startup losses to be in the range of $75 million. 
Consistent with the update that we provided you at our conference in September, Q3 adjusted OIBDA growth decelerated from the second quarter, and we expect growth will accelerate in the fourth quarter as we benefit from in-sourcing our voice support function, the expected cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative and some onetime expenses that reduced Q4 2010 adjusted OIBDA, including an executive severance charge and a reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. 
Operating income growth moderated in the third quarter since we lacked a portion of last year's improvements in amortization expense, which will also affect fourth quarter operating income growth. Nonetheless, we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year. 
Moving to the next slide. Third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.08 increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in operating income and the benefit of our share repurchases, which were partially offset by a higher net income tax and interest expenses. 
Last year's Q3 book taxes were reduced by about $23 million related to the partial release of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.7% compared to 40.4% in the third quarter of 2011. 
Through the first 3 quarters of 2011, diluted earnings per share was $3.24, up 27% over the same period last year. We continue to expect that 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in this range of $4.25 to $4.50, including the additional carry on the bonds we issued earlier this year. 
Turning to capital spending on Slide 15. Through the first 9 months of the year, CapEx was just under $2 billion or 13.6% of revenue, down from 15.3% in the first 9 months of 2010. Third quarter CapEx was down 6.5% year-over-year to $632 million. 
The decline in capital spending has driven depreciation growth rate down to 0.4% -- sorry, 0.04% for the first 9 months. Total CapEx continued to benefit from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce our per unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain. 
Business services capital expenditures were $117 million, largely flat with last year's third quarter. And roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Q2 residential capital expenditures were 12% of residential revenue and were down to $508 million due primarily to lower CPE upgrades and rebuilds and scalable infrastructure.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are spending on projects that will help us to rapidly deploy product enhancements and improve our customers' experience, including data centers in Charlotte and Denver, our conversion to all-digital in Maine and the continued rollout of DOCSIS 3.0. We also expect to continue to invest in business services growth. So while capital intensity in the first 9 months of the year was our lowest ever, we expect to spend more in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that full year capital spending will be in the $2.9 billion to $3 billion range, consistent with our 2010 level. 
Moving on to cash flow in Slide 16. We continued to grow our cash flow strong double-digit rates in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $613 million, up nearly 55% over the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the bonus depreciation, free cash flow was still up nearly 19%. For the first 9 months of 2011, free cash flow was almost $2.4 billion, up over 45% from the comparable period in 2010. Excluding bonus depreciation, 9 months free cash flow grew 2.9%. 
Before we move on to our capital return, let me remind you that we expect cash taxes will increase next year. As we detailed for you last quarter, the 2012 CapEx were similar to this year's expected level. Cash taxes will be approximately $700 million higher in 2012 and in 2011. This is due to the reversals of benefits received in prior years in the economic stimulus legislation. 
And let's finish up with our capital return slides. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $21.2 billion and $826 million increase in year-end 2010. Our leverage ratio was 3.0x the last 12 months adjusted OIBDA. This quarter, we returned $731 million to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividend. We bought back 8 million shares of common stock worth $573 million and paid out $158 million or $0.48 per share in dividends during the third quarter. 
Since quarter end through October 25, we repurchased 1.4 million -- 1.5 million additional shares. Since we launched the repurchase program in November 2010, we have repurchased approximately 40 million shares or 11% of what would have been outstanding at an average price of $70 per share for a total of roughly $2.9 billion. This leaves about $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization. 
To summarize, we had another solid quarter where we continued to drive strong growth in broadband and business services, which lifted revenue growth and drove healthy free cash flow. We continued to return capital shareholders in excess of our free cash flow, as we prudently manage our balance sheet to our targeted leverage ratio and cost of capital. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob"

It's great to have Irene on board to bring a fresh perspective to our organization and not incidentally to enable me to devote my full attention to our operations. I'm pleased that we continue to grow the business nicely despite",1180,"Good morning, everyone. It's great to have Irene on board to bring a fresh perspective to our organization and not incidentally to enable me to devote my full attention to our operations. 
I'm pleased that we continue to grow the business nicely despite a pretty tough economic and competitive environment. That said, I always believe we can do better, and we've already taken meaningful action in a couple of areas. 
We've talked a lot about improving our marketing capabilities, and we made good progress on that front during the third quarter. Over the past couple of years, we built a strong research-based foundation in marketing with significant progress in understanding customer segmentation, customer lifetime value and pricing theory. We're now building an action-oriented marketing organization on that foundation that is focused on getting, keeping and growing subs, in other words, basic blocking and tackling. 
On the getting or acquisition side, we're focused on a few core areas. First and foremost, we are focused on selling our most differentiated product, broadband. We are targeting the 3.7 million residential subs who subscribe to our video services but don't buy broadband from us. We estimate that more than 2 million of these customers buy broadband from the phone companies, and the lion's share of them probably buy DSL. In my mind, there's no reason for a customer who already does business with us to buy an inferior broadband product from someone else. So we're devoting a lot of cross-channel ad inventory to appeal to these customers with messaging specifically tailored to DSL winback. 
In addition, we are redoubling our efforts to sell broadband to households that don't currently subscribe to any of our services. We have increased and refocused our broadcast ad bodies to reach this audience. 
It's early, but the results are encouraging. A key measure of marketing effectiveness is gross connect volume, and broadband connects were up year-over-year across the board in Q3. HSD Single Play connect increased the most, but HSD Doubles and Triples were up, too. 
Another aspect of the acquisition process is targeting the right product to the right customer. And we've been more aggressive here, too. At the high end, we've effectively relaunched our Signature Home offering. If you live in our footprint, you've probably seen the new Signature Home commercials. They're certainly more provocative and more engaging than anything we've done in the past. We're trading our product in the context of a luxurious lifestyle. 
Core volume and connects have increased since we first aired the new campaign, and Signature Home customer ARPU is over $230 a month as compared to our average Triple Play customer ARPU of about $150. So we're very pleased with the early results of the relaunch. 
As we discussed at the September conferences, we're also focused on addressing the needs of more budget-conscious consumers. TV Essentials which is our smaller, less expensive video package, is now available in New York City and Northeast Ohio, as well as upstate New York. And we plan to launch of most of the rest of the footprint by year end. We've also just launched a TV Essentials Light HSD Double Play [ph].
One interesting observation is that while the TV Essentials product has generated lots of interest, the vast majority of customers who call about the offering end up taking a more robust video package. 
The one soft spot on the acquisition front this quarter was in our phone product. It's no secret that overall voice lines are declining, but at 17% penetration, we still see upside here. We've concluded that we need to put more marketing muscle behind voice and probably need to be somewhat more aggressive on price. 
Recently, we've devoted more of our cross-channel inventory to a 1995 bolt-on phone product for Double Play customers. We think this can drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars. I'm not promising an immediate turnaround, but I do expect that we can do better than the recent trends. 
As I mentioned, we're focused not just on getting subs, but also on keeping and growing them. In particular, we're taking steps to better manage our customer relationships through the key junctures in their life cycles with us like price increases, promotional roll-offs and potential disconnects. We're proactively reaching out to customers in anticipation of these events, and we are applying segmentation techniques, treating differently -- tenured customers differently. And rather than simply offering discounts, we're offering customers more value so we can keep the customer and preserve ARPU and margin. 
We're continuing to make good progress on the product front as well. We are pressing our advantage in broadband by adding even more speed. DOCSIS 3.0 or Wideband is now available in roughly 3 quarters of our footprint. And as Irene mentioned, we nearly doubled our Wideband subscriber base in Q3. 
We're also adding mobility to our broadband products. In Los Angeles, we've deployed more than 750 WiFi hotspots in some of the most highly trafficked zones of the city. All standards here and above customers now get free access to these hotspots. And our Wideband 50 customers also get 2 gigabytes of 4G, 3G mobile broadband for no additional monthly charge. For Turbo plus and Wideband 30 customers, they can get the same 4G, 3G capability for an incremental $10 a month. And for standard and turbo customers, they can get it for an extra $20. We just started marketing this capability last month, and we've seen an almost immediate uptick in the take rates for our higher-end broadband tiers in LA. So early indications are that this approach to mobility resonates more than some of the earlier efforts we've made to sell stand-alone wireless broadband. 
We're also continuing to drive improvements in our video products. Version 2.5 of our iPad app introduced last month enables parental controls and search by title or episode.
In the fourth quarter, we're planning to add on-demand content, as well as local broadcast in other channels in New York City, in addition to even better search capabilities. We'll then add local channels in other cities during 2012. 
We also have teams working to make our video product accessible on Android devices, game consoles, smart TVs and PCs. I will be remiss if I close without saying a word or 2 about our best performer business services. The core business selling to small- and medium-sized businesses is strong with Q3 revenue growth of 23%. The investments we've made in an expanded sales force are paying off as newer salespeople gain enough tenure and experience to carry full sales quotas. 
Early success at NaviSite further boosted overall business services growth to 35%. All in all, business services continues to be a significant engine of our overall growth. 
So in closing, we're taking a machine that runs well and renewing our attention to detail to drive even better performance.  We're pleased with the results, although we recognize that there's more work to be done. 
Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

I don't think you've heard -- I've heard you pretty quite that way before, so I was hoping for more details on that comment, for example, increased capital spend on broadband. What would that entail? And would that drive your overall CapEx spending back to increasing rather than the flattish outlook you've given in the past? And when you talk about plant capacity and allocating more capacity there, you're concerned about Internet video usage driving declines in traditional video? Or do you just add capacity and let the chips fall where they may? That would be helpful."

I think you've seen this trend for a while. Our broadband product is very strong. As most people know, the usage of broadband is skyrocketing, as it has been for some time. And that means that we will need to spend more money on it. We have been already, both in capital and operating expenses. And I think as people -- the great thing about the Internet is lots of third parties dream up lots of new applications that require more speed and more bandwidth. And we anticipate that we're going to have to devote more capacity to that over time. We will do that by gradually removing our analog signals from our -- analog TV signals from our plan. We've been doing that over the last several years by migrating to digital using Switched Digital technology. And over the next several years, we'll be going all digital in the TV space. I don't see this driving a dramatic change in our cap spending, I think, to the core of your questions. The spending has been going on for a while, and I think you're seeing a change in mix. The video spending is going down over time. The business services is going to go up, although it didn't this quarter. And you're going to see the spending on broadband going up. But I don't think the overall trajectory is mutually different. I think that answers most of your questions."

But it is the case that the higher-speed tiers do over index. I think that's a conversation you and I have had before. With respect to the question of why a Time Warner Cable video customer would take HSD from the phone company, if it wasn't completely evident from my remarks, that's a question I ask around here every day. I find it to be kind of inexplicable and unacceptable. So that is sort of what's given rise to our renewed plush on winning those customers back. My suspicion is that those were initially telco voice customers and they were faced with the prospect of -- and cable video customers that were faced with a product prospect of adding HSD to 1 of those 2 products. And for historical reasons, which I don't think still apply, they chose DSL. The messaging really is for the long time now, our selling proposition was more speed. I think what we've discovered without really giving away any secret sauce is that the naked speed message has been insufficient to win those DSL customers over and what we need to do is do a better job explaining what speed translates to, in terms of the usage experience, in other words, no buffering on video consumption more, the ability to have more devices connected in a single home without a degradation in the experience. So message is that, that puts some customer behavior color on what speed offers. So that's generally the pitch, Rich. I don't know, was there another piece? You said..."

And to that end, we've turned up a bunch of WiFi sites in Los Angeles, and that's going pretty well.

I also think for both the premiums and video-on-demand, although it's not measurable, but it may well be some impact from the over-the-top, so called over-the-top services. But nobody that I know has been able to measure it yet. On the pure video-on-demand, there's 3 parts to it. That's adult and movies, and I think what we've seen is that movie part is very dependent on how many titles are released and perhaps how they did in the box office. And this quarter saw a little bit fewer new -- I think 1Q were very little title, and some of the movies were weaker than they were a year ago. So that -- we've seen that in the past.

So I'm just curious if you think there's a big market share opportunity in your footprint and broadband. Or help us think about what that business looks like over time."

I don't think that transaction will have an impact on our migration. If you really think about what we do, we take consumer devices that use all sorts of different standards, and we provide usable video to them. And the only reason we have set-tops is that historically, the consumer electronic devices have not been able to display all of our services. They haven't been capable to weigh things. They're not capable of decrypting signals. And they don't have intelligence, so they can't display program guides. So those are essentially the 3 reasons we have set-tops. With the newest devices that are increasingly IP capable and increasingly have intelligence, the devices can do those 3 things. So whether it's the smart TVs that we delve our services on, the CES or in iPad or PC, and the list goes on and on, those devices can receive IP video without set-tops. So that's the transition we're going to be making over the next several years. But we still are going to have to serve all of the hundreds of millions devices that are out there that don't have those capabilities. And so we're going to keep doing that because that's what customers demand. And I don't see this transaction is particularly affecting that or changing that. Irene, the other question's for you."

Time Warner Cable continued to post steady results in the third quarter with year-over-year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth of just under 4%. Our free cash flow remains very strong. We generated more than $600 million in the third quarter and almost $2.4 billion year-to-date through September. We drove stronger residential video and broadband subscriber metrics compared to the year-ago quarter, and we posted business services revenue growth of 35%, including NaviSite. And ad sales did fine, although it's feeling the impact of a wobbly economy and the absence of 2010's election-year political advertising. 
Since our last call, we announced the acquisition of Insight Communications. We’re excited about the opportunity to buy a well-run company in the business we love at an attractive price, and we look forward to serving Insight's customers and bringing them our innovative capabilities over time. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the first half of next year. 
Disciplined balance sheet management continues to be a top priority. The announced acquisition of Insight increased our pro forma leverage. As a result, we slowed the pace of our share repurchases as we actively managed our balance sheet to meet our targeted leverage ratio and cost of capital. The slower pace notwithstanding, we still bought almost $600 million worth of shares in the third quarter.
[Audio Gap]
[indiscernible] maximizing our opportunity in our 2 most promising areas, residential broadband and business services, while continuing to deliver both the content and innovation our customers expect in our video product. 
Broadband is a powerful service for which there appears to be unquenchable consumer thirst. We have a great story here. We're winning share while increasing ARPU. Over time, we'll devote much more of our plant's capacity to broadband, and we’ll allocate more capital to this service, as we continue to enable customers to access innovative and increasingly bandwidth-intensive Internet applications. 
Business services is mostly about share shift. But I think we can also grow the category by applying new technology, including the capabilities we acquired with NaviSite. I can see the opportunity to grow this business even faster if we make more investments in expanding our sales force and extending the plan to increase serviceability in certain parts of our footprint. 
Video is a very good but mature business. We're striving to deploy resources thoughtfully to build on our strength. When you think about it, nearly everyone watches TV, and they watch a lot of it. Cable has always been about offering access to more TV and providing greater convenience. We’re building on this legacy by bringing our video product to a variety of consumer electronics devices. We're consistently updating our iPad app every few months, and we're planning to bring similar functionality to existing -- to additional devices later this year. 
We introduced whole home DVRs across our footprint earlier this year, resulting in a better consumer experience yet having a very modest impact on costs. Next, we'll begin installing home gateways, which we expect to further improve our service while actually reducing CPE capital and some configurations. 
And last, I'd point to our user interface. We have no illusions that we can make all of our 14 million legacy set-top boxes sing and dance like an iPad. In fact, it isn't all that easy to invent a simple way to serve hundreds of channels with a remote control that isn't a keyboard. However, we're making incremental investments in the most recent generations of set-tops, that is those with fast processors, a DOCSIS connection and home networking capabilities. As a result, we have now employed our first generation of cloud-based guide functionality in parts of Syracuse, Los Angeles and Dallas. It provides advanced search and box [ph] for on-demand content. We expect to roll it out broadly in the next several quarters. 
We also need to refocus on the voice product. While cord cutting continues apace, we still have considerable opportunity to grow, although it may require new promotions and packaging to attract new customers. 
So in summary, we continued to post steady financial progress in the third quarter powered by residential broadband and business services. And we're particularly pleased by stronger subscriber results in August and September. 
So let me turn it over to Irene and then Rob to give you additional background."

Let's start off with our third quarter highlights on Slide 3. 
Third quarter revenue grew 3.7% over last year as residential services revenue increased 2% and business services revenue grew almost 35%, while advertising revenue declined 3%. 
As you know, the third quarter 2011 includes the results from NaviSite, which we acquired in the second quarter of 2011. NaviSite accounts for roughly 70 basis points of total revenue growth and about 40 basis points of adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. 
Operating income was up 8.1%, and free cash flow was up almost 55% to $613 million or $1.86 per diluted share. Excluding the benefits from the economic stimulus programs which are detailed in our trending schedules, free cash flow grew nearly 19%. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08, and we returned $731 million to our shareholders in the third quarter through share repurchases and dividends. 
And finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we remain on track to meet or exceed all other elements of our full year financial guidance except for advertising revenue. We are moderating our expectations a bit. And I'll touch on that in a few minutes. 
Let's move on to our Q3 subscriber trends on Slide 4. Subscriber net adds improved on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a while, despite facing headwinds from a still weak economy. Once again, the performance varied across our footprint with Texas and the Carolinas doing relatively better than the rest of our footprint.
We continued to grow our high-speed data subscribers with 105,000 net adds in the quarter, over 4x the HSD net adds reported last week by AT&T and Verizon combined. We finished the quarter with nearly 10.2 million total HSD subs. That's a 4.7% increase in our HSD subscriber base compared to last year. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continued to improve with more customers taking higher-speed tiers. We added 79,000 Turbo and 43,000 Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 customers, offset somewhat by a net loss of basic and light subscribers. At quarter end, Turbo and Wideband subscribers together comprised over 18% of our residential HSD customer base. Wideband subscribers nearly doubled from the second quarter and increased tenfold from the third quarter a year ago. 
Consistent with our focus on targeting new customers, we added 97,000 residential HSD, Single Play subscribers. Business HSD net adds accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter to 16,000, representing our highest quarterly net adds ever. Third quarter video sub losses were 126,000, a 29,000 improvement from last year's third quarter and the first improvement in video net adds in almost 2 years, as disconnects were down from the prior-year period. We actually gained video subscribers in September. 
We continue to do well with our Spanish language offering, especially in Texas and Southern California. In fact, we've increased the number of El Paquetazo subscribers almost 75% from the third quarter of 2010. 
We continued to see some growth in voice. Net adds were 5,000, and we ended the quarter with over 4.6 million voice subscribers, a 4.6% growth rate versus the prior year. The overall gain in voice subscribers was driven by business net adds of 13,000, which were partially offset by residential losses of 8,000 in the quarter. 
Customer relationships were largely flat with the second quarter of 2011. Our renewed focus on nonvideo customers resulted in record nonvideo net adds of 118,000, which mostly offset video-only and Triple Play losses in the quarter. At quarter end, 60% of our customers were either Double or Triple Plays. 
Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. 
Before we move on to the financials, let me give you an update on fourth quarter subscriber trends. It's still early in the quarter, but in the first few weeks of October, video and broadband net adds are in the same zone as a year ago. But voice net adds continued to be weaker. 
And turning to our financial results on the next slide. Total third quarter revenue increased 3.7% year-over-year to $4.9 billion with total ARPU for customer relationship increasing 4%. Excluding NaviSite, revenue grew 3%. 
In dollar terms, total revenue was $177 million higher with $83 million of that growth coming from residential services, $66 million from organic business services growth and $34 million from NaviSite, partially offset by a $6 million revenue decline in advertising and other revenue combined. 
Let's focus first on residential services revenue on Slide 6. Residential revenue grew 2%, driven by a combination of HSD and voice subscriber growth and improved ARPU per PSU, partially offset by video subscriber losses. Residential HSD revenue grew by 7.8%, contributing $81 million of the growth, and residential voice contributed $15 million with a 3.1% growth rate, partially offset by a $14 million or 0.5% decline in residential video revenue. 
Switching to Slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, we did a good job of retaining customers during difficult economic times. This, coupled with our efforts to move existing customers up the value chain to realize higher ARPU, helped to drive revenue growth despite the tough economy. 
Turning to Slide 8. The residential video revenue decline reflects a 3.3% increase in ARPU, which largely offset a decline in video subscribers. The ARPU increase was driven by price increases, a more favorable video subscriber mix, increased equipment rental installation charges and a 10% increase in DDR revenue, offset by declines in premium channels and transactional video-on-demand revenues. Premium channel revenue was down $12 million from Q3 2010 and accounted for most of the decline. Transactional video-on-demand revenue declined $7 million with the drop-off being fairly even across the movies and adult categories, and events were flat. 
Flipping to Slide 9. Residential HSD revenue growth was driven by subscriber increases, as well as a 3.1% improvement in residential HSD ARPU. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year residential HSD ARPU improvement as we continued to benefit from price increases and the improved HSD subscriber mix that I mentioned earlier. On a sequential basis, HSD ARPU was a couple of pennies lower than the second quarter in part due to seasonality. Most of the connects are backend loaded as students return to college. And often, students enjoy discounted bulk rates.
In addition, as part of our effort to win over more DSL subs, we offered Single Play HSD promotions at $29.95. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Residential voice revenue improvement was driven by subscriber growth, which was slightly muted by 0.9% decrease in ARPU. 
And moving to Slide 11. Organic revenue growth from business services accounted for over 35% of the company's overall growth versus last year. NaviSite contributed nearly 20% of the growth. Combined, business services accounted for over 55% of our overall revenue growth this past quarter. And for the quarter, business services revenue was up 23% organically and almost 35% including NaviSite. Of the $66 million of organic growth, HSD contributed over 40% or $28 million. 
Voice provided more than 25% or $18 million, and wholesale transport contributed about 20% or $14 million. Business HSD revenue increased close to 18%, driven by growth in shared and dedicated Internet access. Business voice revenue increased over 50%, driven by subscriber growth, and wholesale transport revenues of $39 billion (sic) [$39 million] increased more than 55% and was driven by growth in cell tower backhaul. 
Cell tower backhaul revenue was $34 million, a 55% increase from last year's third quarter. At quarter end, we had an installed base of roughly 7,200 revenue-generating radios and a meaningful backlog under contract. So we are well on our way to achieving full year organic business services revenue growth in excess of 20% and over 30% revenue growth including NaviSite. 
On the next slide, you will see advertising revenues of $216 million decrease $7 million or 3.1% as the expected drop in political advertising and weakness in the overall ad market in our footprint was only partially offset by revenue from third-party rep deals. Pricing in another way, the media and automotive categories had relatively strong growth offset by the decline in political. 
Given the soft advertising trends we saw in the third quarter, coupled with the $42 million of political advertising we sold in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect fourth quarter 2011 advertising revenues to decline on a year-over-year basis and that full-year advertising revenue will be down slightly from 2010. 
Let's turn to Slide 13. Third quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 3.9% to $1.8 billion, and our margin increased 10 basis points. Excluding NaviSite, adjusted OIBDA grew 3.5%, and our margins increased 20 basis points. 
Operating income rose 8.1% to about $1 billion, and our operating income margin improved 80 basis points to 20.4%, driven by a decline in amortization expense related to the customer relationships associated with Adelphia and the TKCCP partnership being fully amortized in the third quarter and at the end of 2010, respectively. 
Total third quarter operating expense, which included $27 million from NaviSite, grew 3.6% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 6.4%, driven by annual salary increases across all of our businesses and higher headcount, primarily in business services, which includes NaviSite. Business services employee costs increased over 38%, while the rest of the company was up around 3.5%. 
Programming expense increased 3.5% in aggregate and 7.4% on a per subscriber basis. The increase was driven by contractual rate increases, higher retransmission consent expense and programming adjustments that increased growth by about $5 million, which were partially offset by the decline in video subscribers. Even with these increases, the video profit contribution per subscriber increased. We expect programming cost per sub growth for the full year 2011 to be in the same ballpark as in 2010. 
Voice costs were down 19% in Q3 as the benefits from the in-sourcing of our voice support functions continues to accrue. As of the end of Q3, we have migrated almost half of our phone customers and have largely completed this year's moves. Our Q3 monthly residential voice cost per sub dropped over $3 versus a year ago to $9.06. And our total gross -- voice gross margin improved nearly 800 basis points year-over-year. 
Fourth quarter voice cost per sub should be similar to the third quarter as we have fewer subscriber migrations left this year. For 2012, we will benefit from a full year of cost savings for the subs we migrated during 2011. Most of our remaining voice subscribers will be moved in 2013. And when we're all done in 2014, we expect to see our pre-migration voice costs cut roughly in half. 
Third quarter marketing expense of $163 million was constant at 3.3% of revenue. And during the third quarter, we continued to invest in new business initiatives, including wireless and our new home security offering. In Q3, the combined losses from these initiatives were approximately $20 million, up $5 million from the third quarter of 2010. We plan to continue investing in these new initiatives during the fourth quarter and still expect our total 2011 startup losses to be in the range of $75 million. 
Consistent with the update that we provided you at our conference in September, Q3 adjusted OIBDA growth decelerated from the second quarter, and we expect growth will accelerate in the fourth quarter as we benefit from in-sourcing our voice support function, the expected cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative and some onetime expenses that reduced Q4 2010 adjusted OIBDA, including an executive severance charge and a reclassification of certain amounts previously recorded as depreciation. 
Operating income growth moderated in the third quarter since we lapped a portion of last year's improvements in amortization expense, which will also affect fourth quarter operating income growth. Nonetheless, we continue to expect to generate double-digit operating income growth for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.08 increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in operating income and the benefit of our share repurchases, which were partially offset by higher net income tax and interest expenses. 
Last year's Q3 book taxes were reduced by about $23 million related to the partial release of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.7% compared to 40.4% in the third quarter of 2011. 
Through the first 3 quarters of 2011, diluted earnings per share was $3.24, up 27% over the same period last year. We continue to expect that 2011 full year diluted EPS will be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50, including the additional carry on the bonds we issued earlier this year. 
Turning to capital spending on Slide 15. Through the first 9 months of the year, CapEx was just under $2 billion or 13.6% of revenue, down from 15.3% in the first 9 months of 2010. Third quarter CapEx was down 6.5% year-over-year to $632 million. 
The decline in capital spending has driven depreciation growth rates down to 0.4% -- sorry, 0.04% for the first 9 months. Total CapEx continued to benefit from our strategic sourcing initiative, which is helping to reduce our per unit pricing and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain. 
Business services capital expenditures were $117 million, largely flat with last year's third quarter. And roughly half of the B2B CapEx was attributable to line extensions and expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Q3 residential capital expenditures were 12% of residential revenue and were down to $508 million due primarily to lower CPE upgrades and rebuilds and scalable infrastructure.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are spending on projects that will help us to rapidly deploy product enhancements and improve our customers' experience, including data centers in Charlotte and Denver, our conversion to all-digital in Maine and the continued rollout of DOCSIS 3.0. We also expect to continue to invest in business services growth. So while capital intensity in the first 9 months of the year was our lowest ever, we expect to spend more in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that full year capital spending will be in the $2.9 billion to $3 billion range, consistent with our 2010 level. 
Moving on to cash flow on Slide 16. We continued to grow our cash flow strong double-digit rates in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $613 million, up nearly 55% over the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the bonus depreciation, free cash flow was still up nearly 19%. For the first 9 months of 2011, free cash flow was almost $2.4 billion, up over 45% from the comparable period in 2010. Excluding bonus depreciation, 9 months free cash flow grew 2.9%. 
Before we move on to our capital returns, let me remind you that we expect cash taxes will increase next year. As we detailed for you last quarter, if 2012 CapEx were similar to this year's expected level, cash taxes would be approximately $700 million higher in 2012 than in 2011. This is due to the reversals of benefits received in prior years in the economic stimulus legislations. 
And let's finish up with our capital return slides. We ended the quarter with net debt and preferred equity totaling $21.2 billion, an $826 million increase in year-end 2010. Our leverage ratio was 3.0x our last 12 months adjusted OIBDA. This quarter, we returned $731 million to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividend. We bought back 8 million shares of common stock for $573 million and paid out $158 million or $0.48 per share in dividends during the third quarter. 
Since quarter end through October 25, we’ve repurchased 1.4 million -- 1.5 million additional shares. Since we launched the repurchase program in November 2010, we have repurchased approximately 40 million shares or 11% of what would have been outstanding at an average price of $70 per share for a total of roughly $2.9 billion. This leaves about $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization. 
So to summarize, we had another solid quarter where we continued to drive strong growth in broadband and business services, which lifted revenue growth and drove healthy free cash flow. We continued to return capital to shareholders in excess of our free cash flow, as we prudently manage our balance sheet to our target leverage ratio and cost of capital. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

It's great to have Irene on board to bring a fresh perspective to our organization and, not incidentally, to enable me to devote my full attention to our operations. I'm pleased that we continue to grow the business nicely despit",1175,"Good morning, everyone. It's great to have Irene on board to bring a fresh perspective to our organization and, not incidentally, to enable me to devote my full attention to our operations. 
I'm pleased that we continue to grow the business nicely despite a pretty tough economic and competitive environment. That said, I always believe we can do better, and we've already taken meaningful action in a couple of areas. 
We've talked a lot about improving our marketing capabilities, and we made good progress on that front during the third quarter. Over the past couple of years, we built a strong research-based foundation in marketing with significant progress in understanding customer segmentation, customer lifetime value and pricing theory. We're now building an action-oriented marketing organization on that foundation that is focused on getting, keeping and growing subs, in other words, basic blocking and tackling. 
On the getting or acquisition side, we're focused in a few core areas. First and foremost, we’re focused on selling our most differentiated product, broadband. We are targeting the 3.7 million residential subs who subscribe to our video services but don't buy broadband from us. We estimate that more than 2 million of these customers buy broadband from the phone companies, and the lion's share of them probably buy DSL. In my mind, there's no reason for a customer who already does business with us to buy an inferior broadband product from someone else. So we're devoting a lot of cross-channel ad inventory to appeal to these customers with messaging specifically tailored to DSL winback. 
In addition, we’re redoubling our efforts to sell broadband to households that don't currently subscribe to any of our services. We have increased and refocused our broadcast ad bodies to reach this audience. 
It's early, but the results are encouraging. A key measure of marketing effectiveness is gross connect volume, and broadband connects were up year-over-year across the board in Q3. HSD Single Play connects increased the most, but HSD Doubles and Triples were up, too. 
Another aspect of the acquisition process is targeting the right product to the right customer. And we've been more aggressive here, too. At the high end, we've effectively relaunched our Signature Home offering. If you live in our footprint, you've probably seen the new Signature Home commercials. They're certainly more provocative and more engaging than anything we've done in the past, portraying our product in the context of a luxurious lifestyle. 
Call volume and connects have increased since we first aired the new campaign, and Signature Home customer ARPU is over $230 a month as compared to our average Triple Play customer ARPU of about $150. So we're very pleased with the early results of the relaunch. 
As we discussed at the September conferences, we're also focused on addressing the needs of more budget-conscious consumers. TV Essentials, which is our smaller, less expensive video package, is now available in New York City and Northeast Ohio, as well as upstate New York. And we plan to launch it in most of the rest of the footprint by year end. We've also just launched a TV Essentials Light HSD Double Play.
One interesting observation is that while the TV Essentials product has generated lots of interest, the vast majority of customers who call about the offering end up taking a more robust video package. 
The one soft spot on the acquisition front this quarter was in our phone product. It's no secret that overall voice lines are declining, but at 17% penetration, we still see upside here. We've concluded that we need to put more marketing muscle behind voice and probably need to be somewhat more aggressive on price. 
Recently, we've devoted more of our cross-channel inventory to a 1995 bolt-on phone product for Double Play customers. We think this can drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars. I'm not promising an immediate turnaround, but I do expect that we can do better than the recent trends. 
As I mentioned, we're focused not just on getting subs, but also on keeping and growing them. In particular, we're taking steps to better manage our customer relationships through the key junctures in their life cycles with us like price increases, promotional roll-offs and potential disconnects. We're proactively reaching out to customers in anticipation of these events, and we’re applying segmentation techniques, treating differently tenured customers differently. And rather than simply offering discounts, we're offering customers more value so we can keep the customer and preserve ARPU and margin. 
We're continuing to make good progress on the product front as well. We are pressing our advantage in broadband by adding even more speed. DOCSIS 3.0 or Wideband is now available in roughly 3 quarters of our footprint. And as Irene mentioned, we nearly doubled our Wideband subscriber base in Q3. 
We're also adding mobility to our broadband product. In Los Angeles, we've deployed more than 750 WiFi hotspots in some of the most highly trafficked zones of the city. All standard tier and above customers now get free access to these hotspots. And our Wideband 50 customers also get 2 gigabytes of 4G, 3G mobile broadband for no additional monthly charge. For Turbo plus and Wideband 30 customers, they can get the same 4G, 3G capability for an incremental $10 a month. And for standard and Turbo customers, they can get it for an extra $20. We just started marketing this capability last month, but we've seen an almost immediate uptick in the take rates for our higher-end broadband tiers in LA. So early indications are that this approach to mobility resonates more than some of the earlier efforts we've made to sell stand-alone wireless broadband. 
We're also continuing to drive improvements in our video product. Version 2.5 of our iPad app introduced last month enables parental controls and search by title or episode.
In the fourth quarter, we're planning to add on-demand content, as well as local broadcast in other channels in New York City, in addition to even better search capabilities. We'll then add local channels in other cities during 2012. 
We also have teams working to make our video product accessible on Android devices, game consoles, smart TVs and PCs. I would be remiss if I closed without saying a word or 2 about our best performer, business services. The core business, selling to small- and medium-sized businesses, is strong with Q3 revenue growth of 23%. The investments we've made in an expanded sales force are paying off as newer salespeople gain enough tenure and experience to carry full sales quotas. 
Early success at NaviSite further boosted overall business services growth to 35%. All in all, business services continues to be a significant engine of our overall growth. 
So in closing, we're taking a machine that runs well and renewing our attention to detail to drive even better performance.  We're pleased with the results, although we recognize that there's more work to be done. 
Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

And would that drive your overall CapEx spending back to increasing rather than the flattish outlook you've given in the past? And when you talk about plant capacity and allocating more capacity there, are you concerned about Internet video usage driving declines in traditional video?

I think you've seen this trend for a while. Our broadband product is very strong. As most people know, the usage of broadband is skyrocketing, as it has been for some time. And that means that we will need to spend more money on it. We have been already, both in capital and operating expenses. And I think as people -- the great thing about the Internet is lots of third parties dream up lots of new applications that require more speed and more bandwidth. And we anticipate that we're going to have to devote more capacity to that over time. We will do that by gradually removing our analog signals from our -- our analog TV signals from our plan. We've been doing that over the last several years by migrating to digital using Switched Digital technology. And over the next several years, we'll be going all digital in the TV space. I don't see this driving a dramatic change in our cap spending, I think, to the core of your questions. The spending has been going on for a while, and I think you're seeing a change in mix. The video spending is going down over time. The business services is going to go up, although it didn't this quarter. And you're going to see the spending on broadband going up. But I don't think the overall trajectory is mutually different. I think that answers most of your questions."

And for historical reasons, which I don't think still apply, they chose DSL. The messaging really is for a long time now, our selling proposition was more speed. I think what we've discovered without really giving away any secret sauce is that the naked speed message has been insufficient to win those DSL customers over, and what we need to do is do a better job explaining what speed translates to in terms of the usage experience, in other words, no buffering on video consumption, the ability to have more devices connected in a single home without a degradation in the experience.

We continue to see if there is a market proposition around wireless that makes sense for us recognizing the existing structure of the wireless business with 2 very large players and then a couple of smaller players and some other much smaller players. To that end, we haven't found anything wonderful so far in terms of reselling other people's capacity. We've talked about that before. We have gotten very interested in packaging in mobility with our wirelines broadband offering and, in particular, using WiFi because the data usage seems to be heavily close to home. And to that end, we've turned up a bunch of WiFi sites in Los Angeles, and that's going pretty well. So we have a theory that by building WiFi, we can cover a lot of people's mobile data needs and supplement that by accessing capacity on a wholesale basis from some of the other carriers, which, of course, is the deal we have with Sprint and Clearwire. So that's what we're doing today. And obviously, like all of us, we read the paper, and we follow AT&T and T-Mobile, but that's not really changing our strategy at this point."

And one is the subscription premium services, and the other is the paid video-on-demand. Obviously, we have a lot of free video-on-demand and the subscription that goes with the other services, too. I think the subscription premium services are clearly impacted by the economy as consumers try to cut back. We always think we could do a little better job of marketing, and we're focused on that. So it's not totally the economy, but I think that's certainly an element. I also think for both the premiums and video-on-demand, although it's not measurable, there may well be some impact from the over-the-top, so called over-the-top services. But nobody that I know has been able to measure it yet. On the pure video-on-demand, there's 3 parts to it. There's events, adult and movies, and I think what we see is the movie part is very dependent on how many titles are released and perhaps how they did in the box office. And this quarter saw a little bit fewer new -- I think one fewer very new title, and some of the movies were weaker than they were a year ago. So that -- we've seen that in the past. As I said in the last quarterly results, adult's been in decline for quite a while, and events actually were pretty good this quarter. So that's what's going on there."

It's now under 8%. It's still quite healthy. I'm wondering if you think you can accelerate that business into next year and beyond because it would seem like your market share is probably pretty healthy in data. I know there's a lot of Time Warner Cable video subs with DSL. My guess is there's probably a lot of DIRECTV subs with Time Warner Cable data. So I'm just curious if you think there's a big market share opportunity in your footprint in broadband. Or help us think about what that business looks like over time."

On the share buybacks, as we mentioned with the acquisitions we have planned on Insight and NewWave, we build those in.

As we said, we want to maintain our solid investment grade rating and achieve our -- the optimal cost of capital. So we're managing to those numbers. And we have -- in September, you'll see in the Q, we bought back $126 million, so a little bit higher than the number you mentioned. But this is really to manage our balance sheet and keep our solid investment grade rating, and that's consistent with what we've said, that we will reinvest in the business as we see opportunities at the right price, which we did with Insight and NewWave, and we'll include that as we're forecasting forward on our obligations and keep that in mind as we determine our share buyback pace."

I don't think that transaction will have any impact on our migration. If you really think about what we do, we take consumer devices that use all sorts of different standards, and we provide usable video to them. And the only reason we have set-tops is that, historically, the consumer electronic devices have not been able to display all of our services. They haven't been capable of 2-way things. They're not capable of decrypting signals. And they don't have intelligence, so they can't display program guides. So those are essentially the 3 reasons we have set-tops. With the newest devices that are increasingly IP capable and increasingly have intelligence, the devices can do those 3 things. So whether it's the smart TVs that we demoed our services on at the last CES or an iPad or PC or the list goes on and on, those devices can receive IP video without a set-top. So that's the transition we're going to be making over the next several years. But we still are going to have to serve all of the hundreds of millions of devices that are out there that don't have those capabilities. And so we're going to keep doing that because that's what customers demand. And I don't see this transaction as particularly affecting that or changing that. Irene, the other question's for you."
