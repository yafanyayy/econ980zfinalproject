Visa began fiscal 2011 with another very strong quarter delivering net operating revenues well over $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over last year. As has been the case for several quart",2165,"Thanks, Jack, and as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa began fiscal 2011 with another very strong quarter delivering net operating revenues well over $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over last year. As has been the case for several quarters now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth through payments volume, cross border volume and Visa processed transaction from across the globe. 
Net income for the quarter was $884 million, a 16% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2010. As previously reported, early in October, we funded the litigation escrow by an additional $800 million, which has the same effect as the share repurchase. Later that month, our Board authorized a $1 billion repurchase program, which we actively executed upon during the first quarter by buying over $300 million worth of shares. So we are off to a good start in terms of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Byron will provide more additional detail on the repurchase. 
Nearly one year ago at Visa's Inaugural Investor Day, we laid out our long-term strategy that will drive continued revenue growth. A key to this strategy is maintaining a dual focus on growing usage of our core products, which drives the majority of our revenue today while simultaneously advancing an aggressive innovation agenda to accelerate long-term growth through new platforms and channels. 
During that same event, we also made a commitment to further diversify our business, including a long-term goal of ensuring our revenues more fully reflect Visa's global presence. We continue to make steady progress on achieving our aspiration of having more than 50% of revenue come from outside the United States by 2015. 
Consistent with that objective, in this quarter, just over 60% of total revenue growth came from rest of the world. VisaNet is the key asset that enables Visa to deliver on these innovation and revenue diversity commitments. As we invest in long-term growth initiatives, we will maintain the unmatched scale, reliability, security and convenience that we deliver today. Our competitive advantages in this regard are significant. VisaNet's processing infrastructure is unparalleled in its capabilities, enabling us to deploy those assets and drive more volume and more value to networks and its participants. 
Importantly, the flexibility of VisaNet allows us to leave the evolution of our industry towards payment into new technologies and form factors that will spur the future growth of this industry. To illustrate that point, I'd like to provide you with our most recent updates on key initiatives. 
First, we will look at e-commerce and money transfer two critical channels to driving usage of our products. Growing our eCommerce business remains a top priority for Visa and will be an area of increased emphasis in fiscal 2011. Our investments in this category to date are yielding results as we saw 25% year-over-year growth in eCommerce payments of volume globally in Q1. 
CyberSource enables us to accelerate growth of the eCommerce category overall by extending Visa's capability to deliver innovation to merchants, consumers and partners with services such as fraud management and payment security management. CyberSource got off to a great start in 2011, delivering 40% year-over-year growth in billable transactions in the first quarter. 
We have also made progress in driving future growth by continuing to expand merchant relationships with new wins such as Hertz and Tommy Hilfiger. We also signed up land airlines thanks to a lead from our Visa LAC team that demonstrates the synergies that exist for building the business through shared lead generation. 
We've also begun making targeted investments to expand CyberSource's international footprint, including adding personnel to our existing office in Singapore, establishing a legal entity in Brazil and assessing the landscape in our SAMEA region. While the international build out will take time, we are excited about the opportunities for growth. 
Money transfer as an example of our commitment to leading the evolution in payments, giving consumers a new channel to use their credit, debit and prepaid products. In fact, today, I'm pleased to have announced substantial progress on that front. 
We have expanded our partnership with MoneyGram to introduce the first cash to Visa account program for remittances from the United States to Mexico, which according to the World Bank is the largest remittance score door in the world. Utilizing the strength of our global network, this program allows consumers in the U.S. to visit any of the 35,000 MoneyGram locations to send funds directly to any Visa credit, debit or prepaid account in Mexico in a fast, secure, reliable and cost-effective way. 
Money transfer holds significant potential for our business both in the U.S. and globally. In addition to our strong partnership with MoneyGram, we are currently engaged with other leaders in the field to pursue additional opportunities. 
As a leader in product innovation, prepaid is an area where we will continue to invest across the global growth. In the U.S., our efforts to support issuers of major government prepaid programs continue. 
With the Bank of America, we recently launched a significant prepaid disbursement car program for the state of California Employment Development Department. Additionally, the state of New York recently announced the launch of a Visa prepaid pilot program with Chase bank that will streamline how payments are made to parents receiving adoption subsidies. 
Adoptive parents now have the option to receive those funds through a Visa-branded prepaid card issued by Chase instead of receiving their funds by check. 
More and more we see prepaid making the case for itself in every pocket of the globe and particularly in emerging markets. This is true from Botswana and Georgia, two countries that recently partnered with Visa to introduce the first prepaid product solutions to India and Pakistan, which are further along the payments development curve. 
In India, Visa developed a payment solution for the Unique Identification Authority of India to support that country's massive actual program to issue unique identification numbers to local residents. This program has the benefits of deepening our relationship with the State Bank of India, potentially growing the number of transactions on Visa's network and advancing our goal of financial inclusion for under bank individuals worldwide. 
And in Pakistan, we are gratified to see the progress that has been made since we joined the government of Pakistan and United Bank Ltd., Bank of Allah [ph] and Habib Bank Limited to launch a national aid disbursement car program after last summer slips. More than 1.4 million cards have been issued, delivering $317 million in humanitarian aid, one of the fastest roll outs of the disbursement program of this kind. 
All of us who have been reading the news in seeing a clear buildup of excitement and attention around mobile payments. And we absolutely agree, the convergence of payments with mobile devices is a significant development in the evolution of digital currency and a top priority for Visa. Visa's presence in mobile payments is already well-established worldwide with 25 payment programs in 19 countries worldwide. 
We expect international markets will continue to be amongst the fastest adopters of this innovative payments technology. That said, we announced the commercial availability of mobile contactless payments in the United States and in other select markets. Last quarter I said that we were standing on the threshold. And now, for the first time in Visa's history, a mobile contactless payment solution is officially included in the list of Visa compliant products available for use by our client financial institutions. 
Wells Fargo has joined Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase and U.S. Bank in piloting the technology with their customers. The solution works with existing contactless payment terminals installed at retail outlets worldwide, enabling Visa account holders to simply hold up their phone to pay for purchases. 
We recognize that the U.S. market is complex and will require an inclusive approach which addresses the specific needs of all stakeholders. However, I believe Visa's network and payment expertise offers significant competitive advantage over new entrants, and I'm confident that we will play a key role in the evolution of mobile payments in the U.S.. 
Visa's presence in the mobile channel also offers opportunity to build deeper relationships with existing customers as well as connect new participants with Visa through value-added products and services. An example is our recent launch of the Visa mobile iPhone application, now available as a free download from the iTunes app store. 
The application delivers customized discounts and is tailored to consumers' preferences and physical locations, which enables merchants to reach consumers in a targeted way and give consumers access to exclusive deals not available to other shoppers. 
Security is another area in which we are evolving and differentiating Visa through innovation. Just last month, we announced significant improvements through VisaNet security capabilities which will dramatically improve our ability to detect and prevent global electronic payments fraud. 
By enhancing the underlying processing platform that powers Visa's advanced authorization offering, we are enabling our issuers to isolate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in realtime. And historical Industrial data tells us that this could help identify an incremental 29% of the global fraud annually. Not only is this applicable domestically but more importantly, in cross border applications where you have higher incidences of fraud, and so have greater levels of denied authorizations. Enhanced measures will allow for a greater number of transactions. 
It's often easy to take our reliable, secured global processing capabilities for granted. But the reality is as technology enables new payment platforms and competitors, our processing excellence will differentiate and advantage us competitively. So in that regard, I'm pleased to report that we have a flawless peak season of transactions processing, which means we have achieved 100% success in authorizing and settling all transactions between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. This marks the 18th year in a row that we've hit this mark.  That captures some of our most recent highlights and there will be more to come. 
Overall, we believe that we are operating from a position of strength fully utilizing our assets and points of differentiation. Our competitive advantages are significant and will continue to enable us to deliver the payment in commerce solutions that consumers and merchants want. 
Finally, I'd like to close with our thoughts about the recent legislative developments in the United States. With respect to the Federal Reserve's initial recommendations related to the debit provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, we believe the government is engaging in price mix into the benefit of virtually no one. 
The debit price control legislation has been policy and requires thorough review and revision before potential implementation. To that end, we are working with the entire industry to help the 112th Congress and the Federal Reserve better understand how the provisions create significant unintended consequences that will harm consumers, the economy and financial institutions of all sizes even if those institutions were supposedly exempt from the regulation. 
Because of these threats, particularly to the harm of the consumers, we believe Congress should re-examine the provisions and delay implementation to more carefully consider the complexities and unintended consequences of the provisions. Joint federal agencies should also provide an objective assessment of the impacts and present their findings to Congress for review and debate. 
We are encouraged by the increasing number of voices to speaking up about the unintended consequences of this legislation, most notably the authors of the financial reform Representative Frank and former Senator Dodd. 
We believe it is noteworthy that Representative Frank has indicated a willingness to work with those who were similarly concerned and amending the debit provisions to allow financial institutions to recover full costs associated with want in running a reliable and secure debit network. 
I've never seen the industry, including banks of all sizes, this engaged in around working together to improve the outcome. We and others in the industry are looking forward to participating in Representative Bacchus' proposed hearing on this legislation, currently planned for mid February. As we have seen, the more this issue is debated, the more questions are raised among who will really benefit in the end. But we don't know yet the final rules, Visa is working aggressively to protect the interests of consumers and our clients, and we'll support the industry's activities to shape a legislation that impacts community banks, credit unions and larger banks alike. 
But no matter the ultimate outcome, I want to say to you that we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth over long-term. We have developed a priority set of business strategies and are ready to deploy them when the law is finalized, allowing us to utilize our people and our assets to drive us successfully towards our goals. 
As you can appreciate, I think it's inappropriate to elaborate further on these strategies at this time for a host of reasons. 
And now, over to Byron"

We saw solid worldwide growth driven by increases in cross border travel and healthy gains in both",1279,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observation. Our business results reflect continued positive economic momentum, which remains global in scope. We saw solid worldwide growth driven by increases in cross border travel and healthy gains in both credit and debit payment volumes. Now let me quantify these trends. 
First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the September and December quarters, as well as payment and transaction results for the first four weeks of January. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter followed by guidance updates for fiscal year 2011. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 14% and improved slightly in the December quarter to 15%. We saw the following breakdowns in December quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, down slightly from 13% in the September quarter. 
Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up two percentage points from the 15% rate in the September quarter. More recently, through the 28th of January, U.S. payment volume growth moderated to a positive 10%. Although not yet available, we expect rest of world payment volume growth to be significantly higher. 
Global cross border volumes delivered a healthy 15% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter as the world continue to travel. And more recently, through the 20th of January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis sustained momentum with a 16% rate of growth. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 15% over the similar period a year ago and just slightly behind the 16% growth rate we saw in the September quarter. Through the 28th of January, processed transaction stayed with the course, posting growth of 14%. 
Driver source billable transactions totaled $987 million for the quarter, a very strong 40% growth rate. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as eCommerce activity continues to grow both in the United States and internationally. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.6 billion were up 13% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, up 14% increase over the first quarter of 2010, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing sectoral growth and better-than-anticipated cross border transaction. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was just over $1 billion, up 22% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending September and the impact of pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $844 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter based on strong processed transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions. 
As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth was moderated by the impact of key contract renewals last quarter and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting Gateway pass through revenues and expenses. 
International transaction revenues were up 14% to $630 million due to the sustained improvement in cross border volumes during the period. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 15%, a little lower than our guidance but on track with expectations. We still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for the entire year. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $872 million, up 17% from the prior year driven by the incremental expense from the acquisition of CyberSource as well as the non-recurrence of our prior year one-time benefit of $41 million associated with the prepayment of the retailers litigation. 
Additionally, remember that we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activities. As a result, $67 million of revenue and expenses which were booked in Q1 fiscal year 2010 will not reoccur in Q1 fiscal year 2011. 
In the first quarter, this represented four percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral and will impact revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the first fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed a positive 1% increase compared to the same year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 61%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund necessary long-term investments across our entire business. 
One call-out on depreciation and amortization. While the CyberSource acquisition added $22 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter, as an offset beginning this fiscal year, we no longer recognize the $17 million in quarterly amortization for the assets step up that was applied when we first merged in 2007. This step up became fully amortized at the end of September 2010. 
Capital expenditures were $75 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.5 billion. Of this total, $2.7 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining five quarterly payments with $2.3 billion uncommitted as of the end of the first quarter. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we effectively repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of Class A shares at an average per share price of $72.08. This resulted in the lowering of our outstanding share count by 15.3 million shares, taking us to 713 million on an as-converted basis at the end of the fiscal first quarter. 
Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to be active buyers of our shares in the future at prices that align with our long-term view of the value of our shares. At the end of this fiscal quarter, $694 million of open to buys still remains from the $1 billion authorization approved in October. 
Last week we announced the early release of all remaining locked up Class C shares. This means 55 million shares will become eligible for sale on February 7, a month and a half ahead of the prescribed unlock date of March 25. All Class C shares sold in the public market after this date will automatically convert to Class A shares. As a reminder, the release does not increase our outstanding share count nor is there any dilutive effect. 
In order to broaden our participation in the Brazilian prepaid market, we recently announced the sale of our 10% stake in Visa Vale issuer, CBSS. Two, Banco do Brasil. CBSS will continue to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil. Visa's gross proceeds from the sale were $103 million. Upon regulatory approval, we will recognize an estimated pretax gain of approximately $85 million net of transaction costs and we'll record the event in investment income. The amount of the gain net of tax is estimated to be approximately $44 million. 
As for our guidance for 2011, given the results to date and little incremental clarity from the recent initial fed rule-making, we have no changes from our prior outlook. As evidenced by our stock buyback, we remain optimistic about these growth prospects over the long term. Once the final rules have been promulgated by the fed, we will be in a better positioned to share with you our views on the financial impact of Visa in 2012. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

I think that money transfer takes on different forms depending on what part of the world it occurs in. The transactions or the cards that we provide in Pakistan are good example of how something might manifest. Some of the things that we are beginning to think about in doing in India also would embrace that notion.

And we're looking at several other countries right now. I can't bring that altogether as succinctly as you might like and say, ""Hey, we're going to have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in two years or three years.""

Because it seems like the fed kind of came out December 16 and said, ""Hey, it doesn't really matter whether we like the Durbin amendment or whether it makes logical sense."" They are simply charged with writing rules that implement the language and the intent of the amendment and they kind of said, ""Hey, our hands are tied.""

We'll be able to much better size the impact by line item and be able to give to all of you much more thoughtful guidance than we would today, which would be largely speculative.

But the specifics of that and the timing of what happens and how things may or may not happened really is as Byron said, pretty dependent on what the final outcome of everything is currently happening, the comps. I will remind you that the majority of our growth in the past quarter did not come from the Debit Card business. Much of it came from outside the United States and from other initiatives that we have within the United States. And I'll remind you that the Debit business is about in the neighborhood of 20% of our total revenues. So and of course, without being specific, we are not going to lose all that business under any circumstances. So you are going to have to think about it in your own terms.

I think that, that will indeed take some time. And I think most issuers and even merchants believe that to be the case. I'm not certain but I actually concur somewhat fewer contactless terminals today than there may have been a year ago. So we've got other issues in that regard as it relates to standards -- chip standards, there isn't one contactless chip standards around the world. And so all this has to be reconciled before it becomes -- we become a country where people walk on their cell phones and just automatically lock into face-to-face merchant, swipe their cell phones on a contactless. That being said, there is an inextricable momentum to mobile technology and contactless chips and that is beginning to occur. It will manifest itself over some period of time. We are extraordinarily involved in those efforts and things that doing in that regard will become apparent as each quarter goes on.

The next quarter -- so the quarter just completed is reflective of what you should be thinking about going forward recognizing that there's always going to be some degree of lumpiness in personnel as we make various accruals, but we would suggest keying more off of the first quarter. As it relates to our word, our expression is client incentives, I think another company uses rebates, with regards to client incentives, this is -- as we've talked about historically, this is a category that tends to be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on when certain contracts are signed, when renewals are signed. And so rather than seasonality, let's use, it's a bit lumpy. And therefore, we came in a bit lower than our full year guidance in the first quarter.

We are on the right side of this issue. I'd like to think that something will happen. I would like to think as I said earlier that it will take the form of a delay of the implementation of the legislation until the unintended consequences can be better assessed. But I can't promise you that, I can't tell you that I've had secret conversations with anybody and this is a good, because none of these things would be true. So now that I've answered that I forgot the mobile. That's an interesting question. But when you when you look at mobile technologies, I said just a few minutes ago, I mean it's coming words here, however, you want to define it. It makes it easier for people to shop. It opens up new avenues of things that may be purchased through your wallet. And there a lot of technology companies that have significantly, positive offerings and capabilities in this regard. Visa also has significant capability. We still have VisaNet. We still have a whole processing infrastructure. There's still 1.8 million cardholders around the world and we have been vigorously looking at and working on the technology. And we think we're going to be in a very good position as it relates to the evolution of mobile technology in the Electronic Payments business. I think that it will afford us some revenue opportunity that we currently don't have and I think that will be a very positive thing. Will it change in some of the other economics we have? I mean it could. It could. But when we look at the overall landscape, we are comfortable that this is a positive thing for Visa and will be a positive thing going forward. And remember, we've talked to these other entities that you are referring to and they do need some of the capabilities that we have or they either going to have to provide them themselves or come to somebody like us to get them. And so there are compelling reasons for partnerships to occur. A significant -- even when you look at somebody like PayPal but let's not forget the significant amount of their business is driven through Visa, MasterCard. And that isn't about to change in the near future. And I know that's not totally analogous to mobile technology but I think that what Visa has put together over the years is very compelling as it relates to what it brings to the party from speed or reliability or privacy or security point of view.

As has been the case for several quarte",2152,"Thanks, Jack, and as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa began fiscal 2011 with another very strong quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over last year. As has been the case for several quarters now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross border volume and Visa-processed transaction from across the globe. 
Net income for the quarter was $884 million, a 16% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2010. As previously reported, early in October, we funded the litigation escrow by an additional $800 million, which has the same effect as the share repurchase. Later that month, our board authorized a $1 billion repurchase program, which we actively executed upon during the first quarter by buying over $300 million worth of shares. So we're off to a good start in terms of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Byron will provide more additional detail on the repurchase. 
Nearly one year ago at Visa's inaugural Investor Day, we laid out our long-term strategy that would drive continued revenue growth. Key to this strategy is maintaining a dual focus on growing usage of our core products, which drives the majority of our revenue today while simultaneously advancing an aggressive innovation agenda to accelerate long-term growth through new platforms and channels. 
During that same event, we also made a commitment to further diversify our business, including a long-term goal of ensuring our revenues more fully reflect Visa's global presence. We continue to make steady progress on achieving our aspiration of having more than 50% of revenue come from outside the United States by 2015. 
Consistent with that objective, in this quarter, just over 60% of total revenue growth came from Rest of World. VisaNet is the key asset that enables Visa to deliver on these innovations and revenue diversity commitments. As we invest in long-term growth initiatives, we will maintain the unmatched scale, reliability, security and convenience that we deliver today. Our competitive advantages in this regard are significant. VisaNet's processing infrastructure is unparalleled in its capabilities, enabling us to deploy those assets and drive more volume and more value to networks and its participants. 
Importantly, the flexibility of VisaNet allows us to leave the evolution of our industry towards payment into new technologies and form factors that will spur the future growth of this industry. To illustrate that point, I'd like to provide you with our most recent updates on key initiatives. 
First, we will look at eCommerce and Money Transfer, two critical channels to driving usage of our products. Growing our eCommerce business remains a top priority for Visa and will be an area of increased emphasis in fiscal 2011. Our investments in this category to date are yielding results as we saw 25% year-over-year growth in eCommerce payments volume globally in Q1. 
CyberSource enables us to accelerate growth of the eCommerce category overall by extending Visa's capability to deliver innovation to merchants, consumers and partners with services such as fraud management and payment security management. CyberSource got off to a great start in 2011, delivering 40% year-over-year growth in billable transactions in the first quarter. 
We have also made progress in driving future growth by continuing to expand merchant relationships with new wins such as Hertz and Tommy Hilfiger. We also signed up LAN Airlines thanks to a lead from our Visa LAC team that demonstrates the synergies that exist for building the business through shared lead generation. 
We've also begun making targeted investments to expand CyberSource's international footprint, including adding personnel to our existing office in Singapore, establishing a legal entity in Brazil and assessing the landscape in our CEMEA region. While the international build out will take time, we are excited about the opportunities for growth. 
Money Transfer is an example of our commitment to leading the evolution in payments, giving consumers a new channel to use their credit, debit and prepaid products. In fact, today, I'm pleased to announce substantial progress on that front. 
We have expanded our partnership with MoneyGram to introduce the first cash-to-Visa account program for remittances from the United States to Mexico, which according to the World Bank is the largest remittances corridor in the world. Utilizing the strength of our global network, this program allows consumers in the U.S. to visit any of the 35,000 MoneyGram locations to send funds directly to any Visa credit, debit or prepaid account in Mexico in a fast, secure, reliable and cost-effective way. 
Money Transfer holds significant potential for our business, both in the U.S. and globally. In addition to our strong partnership with MoneyGram, we are currently engaged with other leaders in the field to pursue additional opportunities. 
As a leader in product innovation, prepaid is an area where we will continue to invest and foster global growth. In the U.S., our efforts to support issuers of major government prepaid programs continue. 
With the Bank of America, we recently launched a significant prepaid disbursement card program for the state of California Employment Development Department. Additionally, the state of New York recently announced the launch of a Visa prepaid pilot program with Chase bank that will streamline how payments are made to parents receiving adoption subsidies. 
Adoptive parents now have the option to receive those funds through a Visa-branded prepaid card issued by Chase instead of receiving their funds by check. 
More and more, we see prepaid making a case for itself in every pocket of the globe and particularly, in emerging markets. This is true from Botswana and Georgia, two countries that recently partnered with Visa to introduce their first prepaid product solutions to India and Pakistan, which are further along the payments development curve. 
In India, Visa developed the payment solution for the Unique Identification Authority of India to support that country's massive national program to issue unique identification numbers to local residents. This program has the benefits of deepening our relationship with the State Bank of India, potentially growing the number of transactions on Visa's network and advancing our goal of financial inclusion for underbanked individuals worldwide. 
And in Pakistan, we are gratified to see the progress that has been made since we joined the government of Pakistan and United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah and Habib Bank Limited to launch a national aid disbursement card program after last summer's floods. More than 1.4 million cards have been issued, delivering $317 million in humanitarian aid, one of the fastest rollouts of a disbursement program of this kind. 
All of us who have been reading the news have seen a clear build up of excitement and attention around mobile payments, and we absolutely agree. The convergence of payments with mobile devices is a significant development in the evolution of digital currency and a top priority for Visa. Visa's presence in mobile payments is already well established worldwide with 25 payment programs in 19 countries worldwide. 
We expect international markets will continue to be amongst the fastest adopters of this innovative payments technology. That said, we announced the commercial availability of mobile contactless payments in the United States and in other select markets. Last quarter, I said that we were standing on the threshold. And now for the first time in Visa's history, a mobile contactless payment solution is officially included in the list of Visa-compliant products available for use by our client financial institutions. 
Wells Fargo has joined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bank in piloting the technology with their customers. The solution works with existing contactless payment terminals installed at retail outlets worldwide, enabling Visa account holders to simply hold up their phone to pay for purchases. 
We recognize that the U.S. market is complex and will require an inclusive approach that addresses the specific needs of all stakeholders. However, I believe Visa's network and payment expertise offers significant competitive advantage over new entrants, and I'm confident that we will play a key role in the evolution of mobile payments in the U.S.
Visa's presence in the mobile channel also offers opportunity to build deeper relationships with existing customers as well as connect new participants with Visa through value-added products and services. An example is our recent launch of the Visa Mobile iPhone application, now available as a free download from the iTunes app store. 
The application delivers customized discounts and is tailored to consumer's preferences and physical location, which enables merchants to reach consumers in a targeted way and give consumers access to exclusive deals not available to other shoppers. 
Security is another area in which we are evolving and differentiating Visa through innovation. Just last month, we announced significant improvements to VisaNet security capabilities, which will dramatically improve our ability to detect and prevent global electronic payments fraud. 
By enhancing the underlying processing platform that powers Visa's advanced authorization offering, we are enabling our issuers to isolate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in real-time. And historical data tells us that this could help identify an incremental 29% of the global fraud annually. Not only is this applicable domestically but more importantly, in cross border applications, where you have higher incidences of fraud and so have greater levels of denied authorizations. Enhanced measures will allow for a greater number of transactions. 
It's often easy to take our reliable, secured global processing capabilities for granted. But the reality is that as technology enables new payment platforms and competitors, our processing excellence will differentiate and advantage us competitively. So in that regard, I'm pleased to report that we had a flawless peak season of transactions processing, which means that we achieved 100% success in authorizing and settling all transactions between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. This marks the 18th year in a row that we have hit this mark.  
That captures some of our most recent highlights and there will be more to come. Overall, we believe that we are operating from a position of strength, fully utilizing our assets and points of differentiation. Our competitive advantages are significant and will continue to enable us to deliver the payment in commerce solutions that consumers and merchants want. 
Finally, I'd like to close with our thoughts about the recent legislative developments in the United States. With respect to the Federal Reserve's initial recommendations related to the debit provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, we believe the government is engaging in price mix into the benefit of virtually no one. 
The debit price control legislation has been policy and requires thorough review and revision before potential implementation. To that end, we're working with the entire industry to help the 112th Congress and the Federal Reserve better understand how the provisions create significant unintended consequences that will harm consumers, the economy and financial institutions of all sizes, even if those institutions were supposedly exempt from the regulation. 
Because of these threats, particularly the harm to the consumers, we believe Congress should re-examine the Durbin provisions and delay implementation to more carefully consider the complexities and unintended consequences of the provisions. Joint federal agencies should also provide an objective assessment of the impacts and present their findings to Congress for review and debate. 
We are encouraged by the increasing number of voices speaking up about the unintended consequences of this legislation, most notably the authors of the financial reform, Representative Frank and former Senator Dodd. 
We believe it is noteworthy that Representative Frank has indicated a willingness to work with those who are similarly concerned and amend the debit provisions to allow financial institutions to recover full costs associated with want running a reliable and secure debit network. 
I've never seen the industry, including banks of all sizes, this engaged and coalesced around working together to improve the outcome. We and others in the industry are looking forward to participating in Representative Bachus' proposed hearing on this legislation, currently planned for mid-February. As we have seen, the more this issue is debated, the more questions are raised about who will really benefit in the end. 
While we don't know yet the final rules, Visa is working aggressively to protect the interests of consumers and our clients, and we'll support the industry's activities to shape the legislation that impacts community banks, credit unions and larger banks alike. 
But no matter the ultimate outcome, I want to say to you that we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth over the long term. We have developed a priority set of business strategies and are ready to deploy them when the law is finalized, allowing us to utilize our people and our assets to drive us successfully towards our goals. As you can appreciate, I think it's inappropriate to elaborate further on these strategies at this time for a host of reasons. 
And now over to Byron."

Our business results reflect continued positive economic momentum, which remains global in scope. We saw solid worldwide growth driven by increases in cross-border travel and healthy gains in both credit and debit payment volumes. Now let me quantify these trends. 
First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the September and December quarters, as well as payment and transaction results for the first four weeks of January. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter, followed by guidance updates for fiscal year 2011. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 14% and improved slightly in the December quarter to 15%. We saw the following breakdowns in December quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, down slightly from 13% in the September quarter. 
Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up two percentage points from the 15% rate in the September quarter. More recently, through the 28th of January, U.S. payment volume growth moderated to a positive 10%. Although not yet available, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be significantly higher. 
Global cross border volumes delivered a healthy 15% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter as the world continue to travel. And more recently, through the 28th of January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis sustained momentum with a 16% rate of growth. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 15% over the similar period a year ago and just slightly behind the 16% growth rate we saw in the September quarter. Through the 28th of January, processed transactions stayed the course, posting growth of 14%. 
CyberSource billable transactions totaled $987 million for the quarter, a very strong 40% growth rate. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as eCommerce activity continues to grow both in the United States and internationally. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.6 billion were up 13% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over the first quarter of 2010, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing sectoral growth and better-than-anticipated cross border transaction. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was just over $1 billion, up 22% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending September and the impact of pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $844 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter based on strong processed transaction growth rates for both Visa-processed and CyberSource transactions. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth was moderated by the impact of key contract renewals last quarter and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting gateway pass-through revenues and expenses. 
International transaction revenues were up 14% to $630 million due to the sustained improvement in cross border volumes during the period. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 15%, a little lower than our guidance but on track with expectations. We still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for the entire year. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $872 million, up 17% from the prior year, driven by the incremental expense from the acquisition of CyberSource as well as the non-recurrence of our prior year onetime benefit of $41 million associated with the prepayment of the retailers litigation. 
Additionally, remember that we announced an earnings-neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. As a result, $67 million of revenue and expenses, which were booked in Q1 fiscal year 2010 will not re-occur in Q1 fiscal year 2011. 
In the first quarter, this represented four percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral and will impact revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the first fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 1% increase compared to the same year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 61%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund necessary long-term investments across our entire business. 
One callout on depreciation and amortization. While the CyberSource acquisition added $22 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter, as an offset, beginning this fiscal year, we no longer recognize the $17 million in quarterly amortization for the asset step-up that was applied when we first merged in 2007. This step-up became fully amortized at the end of September 2010. 
Capital expenditures were $75 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.5 billion. Of this total, $2.7 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining five quarterly payments with $2.3 billion uncommitted as of the end of the first quarter. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we effectively repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of Class A shares at an average per share price of $72.08. This resulted in the lowering of our outstanding share count by 15.3 million shares, taking us to 713 million on an as-converted basis at the end of the fiscal first quarter. 
Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to be active buyers of our shares in the future at prices that align with our long-term view of the value of our shares. At the end of this fiscal quarter, $694 million of open-to-buys still remains from the $1 billion authorization approved in October. 
Last week, we announced the early release of all remaining locked up Class C shares. This means 55 million shares will become eligible for sale on February 7, a month and a half ahead of the prescribed unlock date of March 25. All Class C shares sold in the public market after this date will automatically convert to Class A shares. As a reminder, the release does not increase our outstanding share count nor is there any dilutive effect. 
In order to broaden our participation in the Brazilian prepaid market, we recently announced the sale of our 10% stake in Visa Vale issuer, CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Bradesco. CBSS will continue to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil. 
Visa's gross proceeds from the sale are $103 million. Upon regulatory approval, we will recognize an estimated pretax gain of approximately $85 million net of transaction costs, and we'll record the event in investment income. The amount of the gain, net of tax, is estimated to be approximately $44 million. 
As for our guidance for 2011, given the results to date and little incremental clarity from the recent initial Fed rule-making, we have no changes from our prior outlook. As evidenced by our stock buyback, we remain optimistic about Visa's growth prospects over the long term. Once the final rules have been promulgated by the Fed, we will be in a better position to share with you our views on the financial impact to Visa in 2012. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

Beyond that, Money Transfer is an integral part of our mobile strategy or our mobile technology strategy, both domestically and outside of the United States. I think that money transfer takes on different forms, depending on what part of the world it occurs in. The transactions or the cards that we provided in Pakistan are a good example of how something might be manifest. Some of the things that we are beginning to think about doing in India also would embrace that notion.

We think that the same thing will happen in Japan, and we're looking at several other countries right now. I can't bring that all together as succinctly as you might like and say, ""Hey, we're going to have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in two years or a quarter, three years.""

Because it seems like the Fed kind of came out December 16 and said, ""Hey, it doesn't really matter whether we like the Durbin amendment or whether it makes logical sense."" They're simply charged with writing rules that implement the language and intent of the amendment, and they kind of said, ""Hey, our hands are tied."" So I just wanted to get a sense from your vantage point, is the approach here to really push the legislative path to try and actually get the language of the amendment changed as opposed to just work kind of softer lobbying channels, which was kind of done back in November and December and at least, as it relates to the initial proposals, didn't seem to have a big impact on the Fed's initial decision making?"

We'll be able to much better size the impact by line item and be able to give to all of you much more thoughtful guidance than we would today, which would be largely speculative. And so until the rules are clarified at which point we'll be able to -- we'll be much more open about what our competitive strategies would be at that time, we're going to defer at least another quarter before we address 2012."

But the specifics of that timing of what happens and how things may or may not happened really is, as Byron said, pretty dependent on what the final outcome of everything is currently happening that comes. I will remind you that the majority of our growth in the past quarter did not come from the debit card business. Much of it came from outside the United States and from other initiatives that we have within the United States. And I'll remind you that the debit business is about in the neighborhood of 20% of our total revenues. So I, again -- and of course, without being specific, we're not going to lose all that business under any circumstances. So you're going to have to think about it in your own terms, but we are excited about Visa's future, and we'll be specific about how excited we are when we have a framework in which to communicate it."

Timing of when it will occur and how it will occur is still somewhat questionable, particularly in the United States.

I think that that will indeed take some time, and I think most issuers and even merchants believe that to be the case. I'm not certain, but I actually concur somewhat fewer contactless terminals today than there may have been a year ago. So we've got -- there are issues in that regard as it relates to standards, chip standards. There isn't one contactless chip standard around the world and so all of this has to be reconciled before it becomes -- we become a country, where people walk around with cell phones and just automatically walk into face-to-face merchants, swipe their cell phones on a contactless. That being said, there is an inextricable momentum to mobile technology and contactless chips that is beginning to occur, and it will manifest itself over some period of time.

As it relates to our word, our expression is client incentives. I think another company uses rebates. With regards to client incentives, this is -- as we've talked about historically, this is a category that tends to be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on when certain contracts are signed, when renewals are signed. And so rather than seasonality, let's use it's a bit lumpy, and therefore, we came in a bit lower than our full year guidance in the first quarter.

And so in that regard, I would have to think that through some of the conversations we've had and because it is the right thing -- and I want to emphasize, it is the right thing. We're on the right side of this issue. I'd like to think that something will happen. I would like to think, as I said earlier, that it will take the form of a delay in the implementation of the legislation until the unintended consequences can be better assessed. But I can't promise you that. I can't tell you that I've had secret conversations with anybody and that this is a [indiscernible] (1:03:14), because none of those things would be true. So now that I've answered that, I forgot the second part of -- Mobile. That's an interesting question. But when you look at mobile technologies, as I said just a few minutes ago, I mean, it's coming or it's here. However, you want to define it. It makes it easier for people to shop. It opens up new avenues of things that may be purchased through your wallet, and there a lot of technology companies that have significantly positive offerings and capabilities in this regard. Visa also has significant capability. We still have VisaNet. We still have a whole processing infrastructure. There are still 1.8 billion cardholders around the world, and we have been vigorously looking at and working on the technology. And we think we're going to be in a very good position as it relates to the evolution of mobile technology in the electronic payments business. I think that it will afford us some revenue opportunities that we currently don't have, and I think that will be a very positive thing. Will it change some of the other economics we have? I mean, it could. It could, but when we look at the overall landscape, we are comfortable that this is a positive thing for Visa and will be a positive thing going forward. And remember, we've talked to these other entities that you're referring to, and they do need some of the capabilities that we'd have, or they're either going to have to provide them themselves, or they're going to have to come to somebody like us to get them. And so there are compelling reasons for partnerships to occur. A significant -- even when you look at somebody like PayPal, let's not forget that a significant amount of their business is driven through Visa, MasterCard, and that isn't about to change in the near future. And I know that's not totally analogous to mobile technology, but I think that what Visa has put together over the years is very compelling as it relates to what it brings to the party from a speed or reliability or privacy and a security point of view. I don't think we're going to let that go."

As has been the case for several quarte",2152,"Thanks, Jack, and as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa began fiscal 2011 with another very strong quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over last year. As has been the case for several quarters now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross border volume and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe. 
Net income for the quarter was $884 million, a 16% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2010. As previously reported, early in October, we funded the litigation escrow by an additional $800 million, which has the same effect as the share repurchase. Later that month, our board authorized a $1 billion repurchase program, which we actively executed upon during the first quarter by buying over $300 million worth of shares. So we're off to a good start in terms of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Byron will provide more additional detail on the repurchase. 
Nearly one year ago at Visa's inaugural Investor Day, we laid out our long-term strategy that would drive continued revenue growth. Key to this strategy is maintaining a dual focus on growing usage of our core products, which drives the majority of our revenue today while simultaneously advancing an aggressive innovation agenda to accelerate long-term growth through new platforms and channels. 
During that same event, we also made a commitment to further diversify our business, including a long-term goal of ensuring our revenues more fully reflect Visa's global presence. We continue to make steady progress on achieving our aspiration of having more than 50% of revenue come from outside the United States by 2015. 
Consistent with that objective, in this quarter, just over 60% of total revenue growth came from Rest of World. VisaNet is the key asset that enables Visa to deliver on these innovations and revenue diversity commitments. As we invest in long-term growth initiatives, we will maintain the unmatched scale, reliability, security and convenience that we deliver today. Our competitive advantages in this regard are significant. VisaNet's processing infrastructure is unparalleled in its capabilities, enabling us to deploy those assets and drive more volume and more value to networks and its participants. 
Importantly, the flexibility of VisaNet allows us to lead the evolution of our industry towards payment into new technologies and form factors that will spur the future growth of this industry. To illustrate that point, I'd like to provide you with our most recent updates on key initiatives. 
First, we will look at eCommerce and Money Transfer, two critical channels to driving usage of our products. Growing our eCommerce business remains a top priority for Visa and will be an area of increased emphasis in fiscal 2011. Our investments in this category to date are yielding results as we saw 25% year-over-year growth in eCommerce payments volume globally in Q1. 
CyberSource enables us to accelerate growth of the eCommerce category overall by extending Visa's capability to deliver innovation to merchants, consumers and partners with services such as fraud management and payment security management. CyberSource got off to a great start in 2011, delivering 40% year-over-year growth in billable transactions in the first quarter. 
We have also made progress in driving future growth by continuing to expand merchant relationships with new wins such as Hertz and Tommy Hilfiger. We also signed up LAN Airlines thanks to a lead from our Visa LAC team that demonstrates the synergies that exist for building the business through shared lead generation. 
We've also begun making targeted investments to expand CyberSource's international footprint, including adding personnel to our existing office in Singapore, establishing a legal entity in Brazil and assessing the landscape in our CEMEA region. While the international build out will take time, we are excited about the opportunities for growth. 
Money Transfer is an example of our commitment to leading the evolution in payments, giving consumers a new channel to use their credit, debit and prepaid products. In fact, today, I'm pleased to announce substantial progress on that front. 
We have expanded our partnership with MoneyGram to introduce the first cash-to-Visa account program for remittances from the United States to Mexico, which according to the World Bank is the largest remittances corridor in the world. Utilizing the strength of our global network, this program allows consumers in the U.S. to visit any of the 35,000 MoneyGram locations to send funds directly to any Visa credit, debit or prepaid account in Mexico in a fast, secure, reliable and cost-effective way. 
Money Transfer holds significant potential for our business, both in the U.S. and globally. In addition to our strong partnership with MoneyGram, we are currently engaged with other leaders in the field to pursue additional opportunities. 
As a leader in product innovation, prepaid is an area where we will continue to invest and foster global growth. In the U.S., our efforts to support issuers of major government prepaid programs continue. 
With the Bank of America, we recently launched a significant prepaid disbursement card program for the state of California Employment Development Department. Additionally, the state of New York recently announced the launch of a Visa prepaid pilot program with Chase bank that will streamline how payments are made to parents receiving adoption subsidies. 
Adoptive parents now have the option to receive those funds through a Visa-branded prepaid card issued by Chase instead of receiving their funds by check. 
More and more, we see prepaid making a case for itself in every pocket of the globe and particularly, in emerging markets. This is true from Botswana and Georgia, two countries that recently partnered with Visa to introduce their first prepaid product solutions to India and Pakistan, which are further along the payments development curve. 
In India, Visa developed the payment solution for the Unique Identification Authority of India to support that country's massive national program to issue unique identification numbers to local residents. This program has the benefits of deepening our relationship with the State Bank of India, potentially growing the number of transactions on Visa's network and advancing our goal of financial inclusion for underbanked individuals worldwide. 
And in Pakistan, we are gratified to see the progress that has been made since we joined the government of Pakistan and United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah and Habib Bank Limited to launch a national aid disbursement card program after last summer's floods. More than 1.4 million cards have been issued, delivering $317 million in humanitarian aid, one of the fastest rollouts of a disbursement program of this kind. 
All of us who have been reading the news have seen a clear build up of excitement and attention around mobile payments, and we absolutely agree. The convergence of payments with mobile devices is a significant development in the evolution of digital currency and a top priority for Visa. Visa's presence in mobile payments is already well established worldwide with 25 payment programs in 19 countries worldwide. 
We expect international markets will continue to be amongst the fastest adopters of this innovative payments technology. That said, we announced the commercial availability of mobile contactless payments in the United States and in other select markets. Last quarter, I said that we were standing on the threshold. And now for the first time in Visa's history, a mobile contactless payment solution is officially included in the list of Visa-compliant products available for use by our client financial institutions. 
Wells Fargo has joined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bank in piloting the technology with their customers. The solution works with existing contactless payment terminals installed at retail outlets worldwide, enabling Visa account holders to simply hold up their phone to pay for purchases. 
We recognize that the U.S. market is complex and will require an inclusive approach that addresses the specific needs of all stakeholders. However, I believe Visa's network and payment expertise offers significant competitive advantage over new entrants, and I'm confident that we will play a key role in the evolution of mobile payments in the U.S.
Visa's presence in the mobile channel also offers opportunity to build deeper relationships with existing customers as well as connect new participants with Visa through value-added products and services. An example is our recent launch of the Visa Mobile iPhone application, now available as a free download from the iTunes app store. 
The application delivers customized discounts and is tailored to consumer's preferences and physical location, which enables merchants to reach consumers in a targeted way and gives consumers access to exclusive deals not available to other shoppers. 
Security is another area in which we are evolving and differentiating Visa through innovation. Just last month, we announced significant improvements to VisaNet security capabilities, which will dramatically improve our ability to detect and prevent global electronic payments fraud. 
By enhancing the underlying processing platform that powers Visa's advanced authorization offering, we are enabling our issuers to isolate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in real-time. And historical data tells us that this could help identify an incremental 29% of the global fraud annually. Not only is this applicable domestically but more importantly, in cross border applications, where you have higher incidences of fraud and so have greater levels of denied authorizations. Enhanced measures will allow for a greater number of transactions. 
It's often easy to take our reliable, secured global processing capabilities for granted. But the reality is that as technology enables new payment platforms and competitors, our processing excellence will differentiate and advantage us competitively. So in that regard, I'm pleased to report that we had a flawless peak season of transactions processing, which means that we achieved 100% success in authorizing and settling all transactions between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. This marks the 18th year in a row that we have hit this mark.  
That captures some of our most recent highlights and there will be more to come. Overall, we believe that we are operating from a position of strength, fully utilizing our assets and points of differentiation. Our competitive advantages are significant and will continue to enable us to deliver the payment in commerce solutions that consumers and merchants want. 
Finally, I'd like to close with our thoughts about the recent legislative developments in the United States. With respect to the Federal Reserve's initial recommendations related to the debit provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, we believe the government is engaging in price mix into the benefit of virtually no one. 
The debit price control legislation has been policy and requires thorough review and revision before potential implementation. To that end, we're working with the entire industry to help the 112th Congress and the Federal Reserve better understand how the provisions create significant unintended consequences that will harm consumers, the economy and financial institutions of all sizes, even if those institutions were supposedly exempt from the regulation. 
Because of these threats, particularly the harm to the consumers, we believe Congress should re-examine the Durbin provisions and delay implementation to more carefully consider the complexities and unintended consequences of the provisions. Joint federal agencies should also provide an objective assessment of the impacts and present their findings to Congress for review and debate. 
We are encouraged by the increasing number of voices speaking up about the unintended consequences of this legislation, most notably the authors of the financial reform, Representative Frank and former Senator Dodd. 
We believe it is noteworthy that Representative Frank has indicated a willingness to work with those who are similarly concerned and amend the debit provisions to allow financial institutions to recover full costs associated with want running a reliable and secure debit network. 
I've never seen the industry, including banks of all sizes, this engaged and coalesced around working together to improve the outcome. We and others in the industry are looking forward to participating in Representative Bachus' proposed hearing on this legislation, currently planned for mid-February. As we have seen, the more this issue is debated, the more questions are raised about who will really benefit in the end. 
While we don't know yet the final rules, Visa is working aggressively to protect the interests of consumers and our clients, and we'll support the industry's activities to shape the legislation that impacts community banks, credit unions and larger banks alike. 
But no matter the ultimate outcome, I want to say to you that we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth over the long term. We have developed a priority set of business strategies and are ready to deploy them when the law is finalized, allowing us to utilize our people and our assets to drive us successfully towards our goals. As you can appreciate, I think it's inappropriate to elaborate further on these strategies at this time for a host of reasons. 
And now over to Byron."

Our business results reflect continued positive economic momentum, which remains global in scope. We saw solid worldwide growth driven by increases in cross-border travel and healthy gains in both credit and debit payment volumes. Now let me quantify these trends. 
First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the September and December quarters, as well as payment and transaction results for the first four weeks of January. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter, followed by guidance updates for fiscal year 2011. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 14% and improved slightly in the December quarter to 15%. We saw the following breakdowns in December quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, down slightly from 13% in the September quarter. 
Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up two percentage points from the 15% rate in the September quarter. More recently, through the 28th of January, U.S. payment volume growth moderated to a positive 10%. Although not yet available, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be significantly higher. 
Global cross border volumes delivered a healthy 15% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter as the world continued to travel. And more recently, through the 28th of January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis sustained momentum with a 16% rate of growth. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 15% over the similar period a year ago and just slightly behind the 16% growth rate we saw in the September quarter. Through the 28th of January, processed transactions stayed the course, posting growth of 14%. 
CyberSource billable transactions totaled $987 million for the quarter, a very strong 40% growth rate. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as eCommerce activity continues to grow both in the United States and internationally. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.6 billion were up 13% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over the first quarter of 2010, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing sectoral growth and better-than-anticipated cross border transaction. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was just over $1 billion, up 22% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending September and the impact of pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $844 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter based on strong processed transaction growth rates for both Visa-processed and CyberSource transactions. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth was moderated by the impact of key contract renewals last quarter and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting gateway pass-through revenues and expenses. 
International transaction revenues were up 14% to $630 million due to the sustained improvement in cross border volumes during the period. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 15%, a little lower than our guidance but on track with expectations. We still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for the entire year. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $872 million, up 17% from the prior year, driven by the incremental expense from the acquisition of CyberSource as well as the non-recurrence of our prior year onetime benefit of $41 million associated with the prepayment of the retailers litigation. 
Additionally, remember that we announced an earnings-neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. As a result, $67 million of revenue and expenses, which were booked in Q1 fiscal year 2010 will not re-occur in Q1 fiscal year 2011. 
In the first quarter, this represented four percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral and will impact revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the first fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 1% increase compared to the same year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 61%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund necessary long-term investments across our entire business. 
One callout on depreciation and amortization. While the CyberSource acquisition added $22 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter, as an offset, beginning this fiscal year, we no longer recognize the $17 million in quarterly amortization for the asset step-up that was applied when we first merged in 2007. This step-up became fully amortized at the end of September 2010. 
Capital expenditures were $75 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.5 billion. Of this total, $2.7 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining five quarterly payments with $2.3 billion uncommitted as of the end of the first quarter. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we effectively repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of Class A shares at an average per share price of $72.08. This resulted in the lowering of our outstanding share count by 15.3 million shares, taking us to 713 million on an as-converted basis at the end of the fiscal first quarter. 
Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to be active buyers of our shares in the future at prices that align with our long-term view of the value of our shares. At the end of this fiscal quarter, $694 million of open-to-buys still remains from the $1 billion authorization approved in October. 
Last week, we announced the early release of all remaining locked up Class C shares. This means 55 million shares will become eligible for sale on February 7, a month and a half ahead of the prescribed unlock date of March 25. All Class C shares sold in the public market after this date will automatically convert to Class A shares. As a reminder, the release does not increase our outstanding share count nor is there any dilutive effect. 
In order to broaden our participation in the Brazilian prepaid market, we recently announced the sale of our 10% stake in Visa Vale issuer, CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Bradesco. CBSS will continue to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil. 
Visa's gross proceeds from the sale are $103 million. Upon regulatory approval, we will recognize an estimated pretax gain of approximately $85 million net of transaction costs, and we'll record the event in investment income. The amount of the gain, net of tax, is estimated to be approximately $44 million. 
As for our guidance for 2011, given the results to date and little incremental clarity from the recent initial Fed rule-making, we have no changes from our prior outlook. As evidenced by our stock buyback, we remain optimistic about Visa's growth prospects over the long term. Once the final rules have been promulgated by the Fed, we will be in a better position to share with you our views on the financial impact to Visa in 2012. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

I think that money transfer takes on different forms, depending on what part of the world it occurs in. The transactions or the cards that we provided in Pakistan are a good example of how something might be manifest. Some of the things that we are beginning to think about doing in India also would embrace that notion.

We'll be able to much better size the impact by line item and be able to give to all of you much more thoughtful guidance than we would today, which would be largely speculative. And so until the rules are clarified at which point we'll be able to -- we'll be much more open about what our competitive strategies would be at that time, we're going to defer at least another quarter before we address 2012."

But the specifics of that and the timing of what happens and how things may or may not happened really is, as Byron said, pretty dependent on what the final outcome of everything is currently happening becomes. I will remind you that the majority of our growth in the past quarter did not come from the debit card business. Much of it came from outside the United States and from other initiatives that we have within the United States. And I'll remind you that the debit business is about in the neighborhood of 20% of our total revenues. So I, again -- and of course, without being specific, we're not going to lose all that business under any circumstances.

Timing of when it will occur and how it will occur is still somewhat questionable, particularly in the United States.

I think that that will indeed take some time, and I think most issuers and even merchants believe that to be the case. I'm not certain, but I actually think there are somewhat fewer contactless terminals today than there may have been a year ago. So we've got -- there are issues in that regard as it relates to standards, chip standards. There isn't one contactless chip standard around the world and so all of this has to be reconciled before it becomes -- we become a country, where people walk around with cell phones and just automatically walk into face-to-face merchants, swipe their cell phones on a contactless.

As it relates to our word, our expression is client incentives. I think another company uses rebates. With regards to client incentives, this is -- as we've talked about historically, this is a category that tends to be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on when certain contracts are signed, when renewals are signed. And so rather than seasonality, let's use it's a bit lumpy, and therefore, we came in a bit lower than our full year guidance in the first quarter.

We're on the right side of this issue. I'd like to think that something will happen. I would like to think, as I said earlier, that it will take the form of a delay in the implementation of the legislation until the unintended consequences can be better assessed. But I can't promise you that. I can't tell you that I've had secret conversations with anybody and that this is a [indiscernible] (1:03:14), because none of those things would be true. So now that I've answered that, I forgot the second part of -- Mobile. That's an interesting question. But when you look at mobile technologies, as I said just a few minutes ago, I mean, it's coming or it's here. However, you want to define it. It makes it easier for people to shop. It opens up new avenues of things that may be purchased through your wallet, and there are a lot of technology companies that have significantly positive offerings and capabilities in this regard. Visa also has significant capability. We still have VisaNet. We still have a whole processing infrastructure. There are still 1.8 billion cardholders around the world, and we have been vigorously looking at and working on the technology. And we think we're going to be in a very good position as it relates to the evolution of mobile technology in the electronic payments business. I think that it will afford us some revenue opportunities that we currently don't have, and I think that will be a very positive thing. Will it change some of the other economics we have? I mean, it could. It could, but when we look at the overall landscape, we are comfortable that this is a positive thing for Visa and will be a positive thing going forward. And remember, we've talked to these other entities that you're referring to, and they do need some of the capabilities that we'd have, or they're either going to have to provide them themselves, or they're going to have to come to somebody like us to get them. And so there are compelling reasons for partnerships to occur. A significant -- even when you look at somebody like PayPal, let's not forget that a significant amount of their business is driven through Visa, MasterCard, and that isn't about to change in the near future. And I know that's not totally analogous to mobile technology, but I think that what Visa has put together over the years is very compelling as it relates to what it brings to the party from a speed or reliability or privacy and a security point of view. I don't think we're going to let that go."

And as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of solid financial performance posting net operating revenue of over $2.2 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. As has been the case f",1632,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of solid financial performance posting net operating revenue of over $2.2 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. As has been the case for over a year now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe. Notably, 62% of our total revenue growth came from outside the United States, getting us progressively closer to our stated objective of having our business outside the United States represent more than 1/2 of our revenue by fiscal 2015. 
Net income for the second quarter were $881 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 28% increase over the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we effectively repurchased an additional $630 million worth of shares nearly exhausting our $1 billion authorization first announced at the beginning of this fiscal year. Given that, and recognizing our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, today, we are pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This brings our total amount of repurchases in fiscal 2011 to $2.8 billion. Byron will provide some additional detail on the specifics of the activity. 
Before I'll be covering some of the business highlights from the quarter, I'd like to first address the ongoing legislative dialogue in Washington in the industry's efforts to address the Durbin Bill. Reiterating what I said on last quarters call, since the introduction of the Durbin amendment, Visa has worked with the industry to help educate legislators on the unintended consequences of this piece of legislation. And our efforts are gaining increasing traction. 
As you know, Senators Costa and Carter have introduced legislation calling for a delay in the study of the Durbin Bill. The Senators' efforts have generated support from a large, growing and diverse group of individuals and organizations who are concerned about the unintended anticonsumer consequences of debit regulation. We believe strongly that Congress should examine what the real impact of this regulation will be on consumers, the financial institutions that serve them, the payment system and the economy as a whole. This would be the reasonable and rational course of action. To that end, we are hopeful that the Senate will consider Senators Tester and Corkers Bill in the very near future. 
That said, no matter what happens with the Durbin, we will continue to compete in and lead the U.S. electronics payment market and be a growth company for years to come. 
I'll now turn to Business Developments from the past quarter that underscore our focus on driving global revenue growth today, while also setting the stage for future growth through new and innovative ways to pay. As ever, our strong relationships with clients continue to help drive our success. In addition to delivering solid financial gains in the second fiscal quarter, we were successful in advancing our strategy of growing and protecting our core business through key wins and relationship renewals with financial institutions and merchants. 
First, we grew our core issuance business with several important new deals. For example, in India, we've made significant strides in expanding our business with the State Bank of India. We signed a multiyear deal to issue Visa debit products across the SBI franchise, whereas until now the bank's business was entirely with our competitor. Nearly 1/2 million Visa cards have been issued since March and we expect several million to be issued within the first year of the program with significant runway beyond that. 
This new win is in addition to the joint venture we already have in the works with SBI and Alamon to terminalize major metropolitan areas of the country. We also recently signed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with HSBC, covering most of our Latin America and Caribbean region that will considerably broaden our issuance with HSBC in this part of the world. 
This builds upon the long-term issuing relationship we have had with HSBC globally for many years. And in the U.S., we expanded our credit program portfolio with a new 7-year program with U.S. Bank and Kroger, one of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., which will begin converting to Visa in September. 
We also strengthened several relationships with longtime key issuing clients in the U.S.. Most recently, we resigned Regions Bank to a multiyear credit debit agreement to include signature debit, interlink and some processing services. Regions is a top credit and debit issuer in the U.S. and a longtime client of Visa. 
We also continue to see good traction on the prepaid front in the U.S. with our state government programs. We recently initiated unemployment insurance programs in Connecticut with Chase, and in Florida, with Wells Fargo. On that subject, our unemployment programs with the Bank of America in New Jersey and California are ramping up at a very nice pace. Importantly though, we are seeing increasing use of these cards at the point of sale versus cash withdrawals, ATM as consumers get more comfortable with this form of prepaid product. 
Beyond working with our financial institution and merchant clients to expand issuance and acceptance of our core products, we also continue to look ahead and develop new channels and form factors to diversify the utility of these products. 
For instance in the mobile space, we just announced our realtime messaging service with our first client, the GAP. This service allows merchants to send realtime location-based discounts and promotions to consumers via text message. In this case, consumers can opt into the GAP Mobile for You program to receive GAP discounts that are triggered when they conduct a qualified Visa transaction, which they can choose to redeem at a GAP store while they are on traffic. GAP was the first national retailer to test and rollout realtime messaging and we have a strong pipeline of other retailers to follow. 
This is an excellent example of a value-added service that supports merchants' desires to personalize the consumer shopping experience made possible by the realtime processing capabilities and unparalleled data from our Visa Net processing infrastructure. 
Equally important is the legislation has not delayed, ITM along with other offerings such as CyberSource's enhanced with decision manager, which I'll talk about in a moment, are the types of Visa value-added services that would consent merchants to route transactions over Visa Net. 
In the area of person-to-person payments, we continue to make important strides in leveraging our network and significant card base to enable people to pay each other using Visa cards. Our recent announcement with Cash Edge and Price Serve in the U.S. underscores one of the important ways we are accelerating growth in this area. Increasingly by working with partners like these, we have existing distribution channels, we can broaden the reach and ease of use of the prepayment programs of Visa products. 
A recent example of one of these P2P programs overseas involves a service we recently launched in Russia and the Ukraine. We are working with Kiwi, Russia's largest payment kiosk operator, first processing bank in Russia and Pre Bank Ukraine's largest bank. Together, we are enabling domestic transfers within Russia and with the cross-border functionality between Visa account holders in the U.K. and Russia. Over time, we will partner with additional entities to expand these programs globally. 
On the eCommerce front, we closed PlaySpan the acquisition on March 1. In the meantime, we have seen CyberSource's business continue to grow rapidly and gain increasing traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, CyberSource delivered 38% global transaction growth and secured a number of new business wins with major merchants including IDS, America and Olympus America. I also want to point out one or more of the recent examples of the synergies we are finding with CyberSource that deliver tangible value to our global merchant base. 
This quarter, we combined the strength of Visa and CyberSource's individual fraud detection capabilities to launch our first iteration of enhanced decision manager, which I mentioned earlier. By combining the risk force that CyberSource has historically provided to its merchants clients with data from the Visa Inc. advanced authorization service, we are delivering a unique and unparalleled view of transaction data that merchant clients recognize will serve them as a powerful new fraud detection mechanism with their business. 
All of these advancements are important steps towards capturing the enormous we see ahead, with payments innovation fueling our business growth over the moderate to long term. All of us know the way people connect and transact across the globe is changing dramatically driven by 2 global forces. First, the continued secular shift from paper base to electronic payments that still largely occurs at the physical point of sale, and second, the widespread adoption of global and Internet technology. These forces our conversion, and consumers and merchants are looking for payment solutions that harness these technologies. To that end, we have been working hard to develop a Visa quality payment solution that brings reliability, security and convenience to mobile and eCommerce environments. 
In our view, a globally viable payment solution must have 5 fundamental characteristics: convenience and simplicity, standardization, interoperability, global accessibility and security. None of the solutions we have seen from competitors is comprehensive enough because they don't address all of these criteria at once. Visa has long delivered solutions at the physical point of sale that passed this test and we are applying the same standard in the online and mobile arena. 
Look for us to make an announcement of our global eCommerce and mobile strategy later this month. And now, I'll turn the call over to Byron"

First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth was broad based with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 21% growth rate in rest of world. As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue is now 45% of Visa's total. Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of February and March both comped at 11%, which is the first time we have seen double-digit growth since the recession. We are clearly encouraged by this strength. Third call out relates to client incentives. Incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16.7%, up from 15.3% in the first quarter. Taken together, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16% for the first half of the fiscal year, at the low end of our guidance. While we still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for fiscal 2011, if implementation of the Durbin amendment is not delayed beyond July, it is probable that we would see some upward pressure on this number as a result of potential actions we would take to mitigate volume loss with certain issuers and merchants. 
Fourth call out relates to Durbin. Whether the legislation gets delayed or not, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. Finally, it's worth noting that beginning with the second fiscal quarter, our 3 key revenue drivers are now growing at double-digit rates, while comping double-digit growth in the same quarter of the prior year. This is true both globally and for the U.S., indicating that the strength of the recovery is now more broad based. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for the December and March quarters, as well as more recent payment and transaction results for the entire month of April. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal year 2011. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter income in constant dollars was 13%, a modest decline from the 15% growth we saw in the December quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the March quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, relatively flat from the December quarter. Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis, grew at 15%, down 2 points from the 17% rate in the December quarter. Most recently, in the month of April, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 11%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the second quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be higher than the U.S.'s 11%. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant currency basis in the March quarter, down slightly from a 15% rate in the December quarter. There was notable drop off in inbound travel to Japan, Middle East and North Africa. In aggregate, these situations may have negatively impacted growth by about 50 basis points. 
In April, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 13%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 13% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 15% growth rate we saw in the December quarter. In April, processed transactions posted growth of 12%. CyberSource billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion for the quarter, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. 
We continue to expect strong results in this part of our business as eCommerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenue of $2.7 billion was up 16% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year, driven by a sustained economic recovery, previously enacted pricing changes and cross-border transaction growth. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 24% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $823 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transaction. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth has moderated due to the impact of key contract renewals 2 quarters ago and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting Gateway pass through revenue and expense. 
International transaction revenue was up 14% to $624 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentive as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.7% and are running at 16% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Approximately 65% of the year-over-year dollar increase in incentives is due to payment volume growth in client portfolio, about another 25% of the increase is due to non-U.S. client renewal. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter was $862 million, up 3% from the prior year. Increases in personnel, professional fees and general and administrative expense were offset by lower marketing in the period. Additionally, and I'll continue to remind you of this for the next 2 quarters, recall that we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activity. 
As a result, $55 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q2 fiscal year 2010 did not reoccur in Q2 fiscal year 2011. In Q2, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral and will affect revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the second fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 2% increase compared to the same prior year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund important long-term investments across our entire business. 
Capital expenditures was $72 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Lastly, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. And we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04 for the full 2011 fiscal year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.6 billion. Of this total, $3 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining 3 quarters with $2.7 billion uncommitted as of the end of the second quarter. 
In terms of our ongoing buyback, at the end of the quarter, we announced the prefunding of the litigation escrow by $400 million to be funded with cash previously designated for our $1 billion share repurchase. This was executed at an average price of $73.81 per share. Additionally, we repurchased $230 million of our shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $70.53 per share. Also we effectively repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $72.58. This leaves us with $64 million of open to buy under the original program. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had 704 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. And importantly, the A class now accounts for almost 75% of our outstanding shares. Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And for this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. 
As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given the results today, we are not making any adjustments at this time. With or without a Durbin delay, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Once the timing and content of the Reformed Act Regulations are clarified, we will determine whether any 2011 guidance requires adjustment, not just client incentives, and we will consider providing an early earnings outlook for fiscal 2012. 
In summary, we expect Visa to remain a solid growth company for years to come. Our core businesses continue to grow at healthy rates, while we are aggressively investing in technologies and platforms that will extend our core payment and processing capability, thereby creating new sources of growth. 
Finally, we expect to deliver this growth while driving significant free cash flow, which we will use to enhance shareholder returns through a continued dividend increases and share repurchases. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

But is it one way to look at it of $2.2 billion of net revenue this quarter, I figure about 10% given your previous numbers came from issuers at U.S. debit, so you call that maybe $200 million. And in theory if that were reduced say, 20% just to pick a number or maybe worst case or $40 million a quarter, the other $2 billion of revenue is growing faster as you said with 60% of revenue growth coming from Rest of World, particularly strong in credit given that credit is much larger Rest of the World than debit. Is it one way to look at it and say that the other $2 billion of revenue not impacted by Durbin growing say, 15% will more than offset say, that $40 million decline and the $200 million of U.S. debit coming from issuers, is that one way try to size this in the second half if we get a worst case?"

That revenue, this quarter grew at 21%, twice what the growth rate is of the U.S. at '10.

So no impact on EPS and no impact on the full year guidance for marketing because when we guided, while marketing is down versus the same quarter last year, as always, given the campaign that we have last year relative to the Olympics, you would naturally expect it to be down somewhat. So we are still fully consistent with the guidance that we gave earlier for marketing. And the adjustments we made for Extras has no income statement impact. With regards to the margin at 62 for the quarter, that would be what you should take away is that we are increasingly investing in our products platforms to drive future growth. And the margin will simply be an outcome of the level of investment that we make and we continue to invest aggressively in that arena."

We refer to it as oil, the oil category. In the months of April, that was just a little over 10% of the U.S. payment volume, suggesting that the share had moved up about that's 25% increase in the share of U.S. payment volume. When you compare that to roughly based on our measures of 32% increase in the average price of gasoline, April versus about where we were a year ago, and you factor in that there is probably been some degree of consumption cutback given prices that are now posted in the $4-plus range. That is the immediate impact. We have not yet seen and it may be a bit early, we have not yet seen any specific call outs relative to trade outs on other spending categories, which may be in part due to the additional disposable income created by reductions and withholding tax and social security, so we're still trying to sort that out. Inevitably, there is probably going to be some friction. But at the moment, it's hard for us to identify it."

We delivered the first 6 months at 16% incentive as a percent of growth. And our guidance was 16% to 16.5%. That 16% to 16.5% guidance did assume that Durbin would not be delayed, that we would have some impact of Durbin before the end of the year and we provided for some degree of incentives in the event if that-that were to happen. Without knowing the exact timing, without knowing exactly how the rules will be promulgated, without knowing the timing, the implementation timing associated with those rules, those are some pretty big wildcards with regards to the incentives that we may or may not be putting on the table this fiscal year. And therefore, we are drawing attention to the fact that we've got a year in the bag at 16, but there's some significant uncertainties still to go. But some of those uncertainties we're contemplating. So don't automatically assume that were it to be -- we're it not to be delayed that we would necessarily be above that range. But where we end up is going to be a function of the timing and the exact wording of the rules. And I would say on the second, it's just hard to know with regards to how we would be deploying incentives today versus how we would do it under Durbin. The notion that incentives would be in play I think is a fair assumption. To what degree whether it be one time sustained, I think it will be, once we understand better than the environment ahead, we'll be much be better able to opine on that."

And so we've been reluctant to talk about it until we have put together and put together in an appropriate way were we can tell you something positive and significant and we can talk about how it all comes together. So that's how we are."

Visa delivered another quarter of solid financial performance posting net operating revenue of over $2.2 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. As has been the case for over a year now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume, and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe. 
Notably, 62% of our total revenue growth came from outside the United States, getting us progressively closer to our stated objective of having our business outside the United States represent more than 1/2 of our revenue by fiscal 2015. 
Net income for the quarter were $881 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 28% increase over the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we effectively repurchased an additional $630 million worth of shares nearly exhausting our $1 billion authorization first announced at the beginning of this fiscal year. 
Given that, and recognizing our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, today, we're pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This brings our total amounts of repurchases in fiscal 2011 to $2.8 billion. Byron will provide some additional detail on the specifics of the activity. 
Before covering some of the business highlights from the quarter, I'd like to first address the ongoing legislative dialogue in Washington in the industry's efforts to address the Durbin Bill. Reiterating what I said on last quarters call, since the introduction of the Durbin amendment, Visa has worked with the industry to help educate legislators on the unintended consequences of this piece of legislation. And our efforts are gaining increasing traction. 
As you know, Senators [indiscernible] and Carter have introduced legislation calling for a delay in the study of the Durbin Bill. The Senators' efforts have generated support from a large, growing and diverse group of individuals and organizations who are concerned about the unintended, anticonsumer consequences of debit regulation. We believe strongly that Congress should examine what the real impact of this regulation will be on consumers, the financial institutions that serve them, the payment system and the economy as a whole. This would be the reasonable and rational course of action. To that end, we are hopeful that the Senate will consider Senators Tester and Corker's Bill in the very near future. 
That said, no matter what happens with Durbin, we will continue to compete in and lead the U.S. electronic payments market, and be a growth company for years to come. 
I'll now turn to Business Developments from the past quarter that underscore our focus on driving global revenue growth today, while also setting the stage for future growth through new and innovative ways to pay. As ever, our strong relationships with clients continue to help drive our success. In addition to delivering solid financial gains in the second fiscal quarter, we were successful in advancing our strategy of growing and protecting our core business through key wins and relationship renewals with financial institutions and merchants. 
First, we grew our core issuance business with several important new deals. For example, in India, we've made significant strides in expanding our business with the State Bank of India. We signed a multiyear deal to issue Visa debit products across the SBI franchise, whereas until now the bank's business was entirely with our competitor. Nearly 500,000 Visa cards have been issued since March, and we expect several million to be issued within the first year of the program with significant runway beyond that. 
This new win is in addition to the joint venture we already have in the works with SBI and Elavon to terminalize major metropolitan areas of the country. We also recently signed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with HSBC, covering most of our Latin America and Caribbean region that will considerably broaden our issuance with HSBC in this part of the world. 
This builds upon the long-term issuing relationship we have had with HSBC globally for many years. And in the U.S., we expanded our credit program portfolio with a new 7-year program with U.S. Bank and Kroger, one of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., which will begin converting to Visa in September. 
We also strengthened several relationships with longtime key issuing clients in the U.S. Most recently, we resigned Regions Bank to a multiyear credit debit agreement to include signature debit, interlink, and some processing services. Regions is a top 10 debit issuer in the U.S. and a longtime client of Visa. 
We also continue to see good traction on the prepaid front in the U.S. with our state government programs. We recently initiated unemployment insurance programs in Connecticut with Chase, and in Florida, with Wells Fargo. On that subject, our unemployment programs with the Bank of America in New Jersey and California are ramping up at a very nice pace. Importantly though, we are seeing increasing use of these cards at the point of sale versus cash withdrawals at the ATM, as consumers get more comfortable with this form of prepaid product. 
Beyond working with our financial institution and merchant clients to expand issuance and acceptance of our core products, we also continue to look ahead and develop new channels and form factors to diversify the utility of these products. 
For instance in the mobile space, we just announced our realtime messaging service with our first client, the GAP. This service allows merchants to send realtime location-based discounts and promotions to consumers via text message. In this case, consumers can opt into the GAP Mobile for You program to receive GAP discounts that are triggered when they conduct a qualified Visa transaction, which they can choose to redeem at a GAP store while they are out shopping. GAP was the first national retailer to test and rollout realtime messaging and we have a strong pipeline of other retailers to follow. 
This is an excellent example of a value-added service that supports merchants' desires to personalize the consumer shopping experience made possible by the realtime processing capabilities and unparalleled data from our Visa Net processing infrastructure. 
Equally important is the legislation has not delayed, RTM along with other offerings such as CyberSource's enhanced decision manager, which I'll talk about in a moment, are the types of Visa value-added services that would incent merchants to route transactions over Visa Net. 
In the area of person-to-person payments, we continue to make important strides in leveraging our network and significant card base to enable people to pay each other using Visa cards. Our recent announcement with CashEdge and Fiserv in the U.S. underscores one of the important ways we are accelerating growth in this area. Increasingly by working with partners like these, we have existing distribution channels, we can broaden the reach and ease of use of the prepayment programs of Visa products. 
A recent example of one of these P2P programs overseas involves a service we recently launched in Russia and the Ukraine. We are working with Kiwi, Russia's largest payment kiosk operator, First Processing Bank in Russia, and PrivatBank, the Ukraine's largest bank. Together, we are enabling domestic transfers within Russia and with the cross-border functionality between Visa account holders in the U.K. and Russia. Over time, we will partner with additional entities to expand these programs globally. 
On the eCommerce front, we closed the PlaySpan the acquisition on March 1. In the meantime, we have seen CyberSource's business continue to grow rapidly and gain increasing traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, CyberSource delivered 38% billable transaction growth and secured a number of new business wins with major merchants including IDS, America and Olympus America. I also want to point out one or more of the recent examples of the synergies we are finding with CyberSource that deliver tangible value to our global merchant base. 
This quarter, we combined the strength of Visa and CyberSource's individual fraud detection capabilities to launch our first iteration of enhanced decision manager, which I mentioned earlier. By combining the risk force that CyberSource has historically provided to its merchants clients with data from the Visa Inc. advanced authorization service, we are delivering a unique and unparalleled view of transaction data that merchant clients recognize will serve them as a powerful new fraud detection mechanism for their business. 
All of these advancements are important steps towards capturing the enormous opportunity we see ahead, with payments innovation fueling our business growth over the moderate to long term. All of us know the way people connect and transact across the globe is changing dramatically driven by 2 global forces. First, the continued secular shift from paper base to electronic payments that still largely occurs at the physical point of sale, and second, the widespread adoption of mobile and Internet technology. These forces our conversion, and consumers and merchants are looking for payment solutions that harness these technologies. To that end, we have been working hard to develop a Visa quality payment solution that brings reliability, security and convenience to mobile and eCommerce environments. 
In our view, a globally viable payment solution must have 5 fundamental characteristics: convenience and simplicity, standardization, interoperability, global accessibility and security. None of the solutions we have seen from competitors is comprehensive enough because they don't address all of these criteria at once. Visa has long delivered solutions at the physical point of sale that passed this test and we are applying the same standard in the online and mobile arena. 
Look for us to make an announcement of our global eCommerce and mobile strategy later this month. And now, over to Byron."

As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's reve",1525,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth was broad based, with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 21% growth rate in rest of world. As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue is now 45% of Visa's total. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of February and March both comped at 11%, which is the first time we have seen double-digit growth since the recession. We are clearly encouraged by this trend. Third call out relates to client incentives. Incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16.7%, up from 15.3% in the first quarter. Taken together, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16% for the first half of the fiscal year, at the low end of our guidance.
While we still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for fiscal 2011, if implementation of the Durbin amendment is not delayed beyond July, it is probable that we would see some upward pressure on this number as a result of potential actions we would take to mitigate volume loss with certain issuers and merchants. 
Fourth call out relates to Durbin. Whether the legislation gets delayed or not, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and earnings per share growth of greater than 20%.
Finally, it's worth noting that beginning with the second fiscal quarter, our 3 key revenue drivers are now growing at double-digit rates, while comping double-digit growth in the same quarter of the prior year. This is true both globally and for the U.S., indicating that the strength of the recovery is now more broad based. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for the December and March quarters, as well as more recent payment and transaction results for the entire month of April. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal year 2011. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 13%, a modest decline from the 15% growth we saw in the December quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the March quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, relatively flat from the December quarter. Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis, grew at 15%, down 2 points from the 17% rate in the December quarter. 
More recently, in the month of April, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 11%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the second quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be higher than the U.S.'s 11%. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the March quarter, down slightly from a 15% rate in the December quarter. There was notable drop off in inbound travel to Japan, Middle East and North Africa. In aggregate, these situations may have negatively impacted growth by about 50 basis points. In April, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 13%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 13% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 15% growth rate we saw in the December quarter. In April, processed transactions posted growth of 12%. CyberSource billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion for the quarter, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. 
We continue to expect strong results in this part of our business as eCommerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenue of $2.7 billion was up 16% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year, driven by a sustained economic recovery, previously enacted pricing changes and cross-border transaction growth. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 24% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $823 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transaction. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth has moderated due to the impact of key contract renewals 2 quarters ago, and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting Gateway pass-through revenue and expense. 
International transaction revenue was up 14% to $624 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentive as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.7% and are running at 16% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Approximately 65% of the year-over-year dollar increase in incentives is due to payment volume growth in client portfolio, about another 25% of the increase is due to non-U.S. client renewals. 
Total operating expense for the quarter was $862 million, up 3% from the prior year. Increases in personnel, professional fees and general and administrative expense were offset by lower marketing in the period. Additionally, and I'll continue to remind you of this for the next 2 quarters, recall that we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activity. 
As a result, $55 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q2 fiscal year 2010 did not reoccur in Q2 fiscal year 2011. In Q2, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral, and will affect revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the second fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 2% increase compared to the same prior year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund important long-term investments across our entire business. 
Capital expenditures was $72 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Lastly, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. And we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04 for the full 2011 fiscal year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.6 billion. Of this total, $3 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining 3 quarters with $2.7 billion uncommitted as of the end of the second quarter. 
In terms of our ongoing buyback, at the end of the quarter, we announced the prefunding of the litigation escrow by $400 million to be funded with cash previously designated for our $1 billion share repurchase. This was executed at an average price of $73.81 per share. Additionally, we repurchased $230 million of our shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $70.53 per share. All told, we effectively repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $72.58. This leaves us with $64 million of open to buy under the original program. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 704 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. And importantly, the A class now accounts for almost 75% of our outstanding shares. Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And through this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. 
As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given the results to date, we are not making any adjustments at this time. With or without a Durbin delay, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Once the timing and content of the Reformed Act Regulations are clarified, we will determine whether any 2011 guidance requires adjustment, not just client incentives, and we will consider providing an early earnings outlook for fiscal 2012. 
In summary, we expect Visa to remain a solid growth company for years to come. Our core businesses continue to grow at healthy rates, while we are aggressively investing in technologies and platforms that will extend our core payment and processing capabilities, thereby creating new sources of growth. 
Finally, we expect to deliver this growth while driving significant free cash flow, which we will use to enhance shareholder returns through a continued dividend increases and share repurchases. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

But is it one way to look at it of $2.2 billion of net revenue this quarter, I figure about 10% given your previous numbers came from issuers at U.S. debit, so call that maybe $200 million. And in theory if that were reduced say, 20% just to pick a number or maybe worst case, or $40 million a quarter, the other $2 billion of revenue is growing faster as you said with 60% of revenue growth coming from Rest of World, particularly strong in credit given that credit is much larger Rest of the World than debit. Is it one way to look at it and say that, that other $2 billion of revenue not impacted by Durbin growing say, 15% would more than offset say, the $40 million decline and the $200 million of U.S. debit coming from issuers.

Is that the question? Because the revenue came out equal to the expenses, so while marketing is down and it is down in part because of the removal of Extras and also because of timing, the full year impact of the change that we made with Visa Extras is income statement neutral. So no impact on EPS, and no impact on the full year guidance for marketing because when we guided, while marketing is down versus the same quarter last year, there's always, given the campaign that we have last year relative to the Olympics, you would naturally expect it to be down somewhat. So we are still fully consistent with the guidance that we gave earlier on marketing. And the adjustments we made for Extras no income statement impact. With regards to the margin at 62 for the quarter, that would be -- what you should take away is that we are increasingly investing in our products platforms to drive future growth.

With regards -- let's talk about this in the context of the U.S. So for gas, historically, go back a year. At gas prices that we're roughly 30% less than they average, on average than they are today, we were running about 8% of total U.S. payment volume in the gas category. We refer to it as oil, in the oil category. In the month of April, that was just a little over 10% of U.S. payment volume, suggesting that the share had moved up about -- that's about a 25% increase in the share of U.S. payment volume. When you compare that to roughly based on our measures of 32% increase in the average price of gasoline, April versus about where we were a year ago, and you factor in that there is probably been some degree of consumption cutback given prices that are now posted in the $4-plus range. That is the immediate impact. We have not yet seen and it may be a bit early, we have not yet seen any specific call outs relative to trade outs on other spending categories, which may be in part due to the additional disposable income created by reductions in withholding tax and social security. So we're still trying to sort that out. Inevitably, there is probably going to be some friction. But at the moment, it's hard for us to identify it."

But some of those uncertainties we're contemplated. So don't automatically assume that were it to be -- were it not to be delayed that we would necessarily be above that range.

And as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today.

As has been the case f",1622,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of solid financial performance posting net operating revenue of over $2.2 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. As has been the case for over a year now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume, and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe. 
Notably, 62% of our total revenue growth came from outside the United States, getting us progressively closer to our stated objective of having our business outside the United States represent more than 1/2 of our revenue by fiscal 2015. 
Net income for the quarter were $881 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 28% increase over the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we effectively repurchased an additional $630 million worth of shares nearly exhausting our $1 billion authorization first announced at the beginning of this fiscal year. 
Given that, and recognizing our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, today, we're pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This brings our total amounts of repurchases in fiscal 2011 to $2.8 billion. Byron will provide some additional detail on the specifics of the activity. 
Before covering some of the business highlights from the quarter, I'd like to first address the ongoing legislative dialogue in Washington in the industry's efforts to address the Durbin Bill. Reiterating what I said on last quarters call, since the introduction of the Durbin amendment, Visa has worked with the industry to help educate legislators on the unintended consequences of this piece of legislation. And our efforts are gaining increasing traction. 
As you know, Senators Tester and Carter have introduced legislation calling for a delay in the study of the Durbin Bill. The Senators' efforts have generated support from a large, growing and diverse group of individuals and organizations who are concerned about the unintended, anticonsumer consequences of debit regulation. We believe strongly that Congress should examine what the real impact of this regulation will be on consumers, the financial institutions that serve them, the payment system and the economy as a whole. This would be the reasonable and rational course of action. To that end, we are hopeful that the Senate will consider Senators Tester and Corker's Bill in the very near future. 
That said, no matter what happens with Durbin, we will continue to compete in and lead the U.S. electronic payments market, and be a growth company for years to come. 
I'll now turn to Business Developments from the past quarter that underscore our focus on driving global revenue growth today, while also setting the stage for future growth through new and innovative ways to pay. As ever, our strong relationships with clients continue to help drive our success. In addition to delivering solid financial gains in the second fiscal quarter, we were successful in advancing our strategy of growing and protecting our core business through key wins and relationship renewals with financial institutions and merchants. 
First, we grew our core issuance business with several important new deals. For example, in India, we've made significant strides in expanding our business with the State Bank of India. We signed a multiyear deal to issue Visa debit products across the SBI franchise, whereas until now the bank's business was entirely with our competitor. Nearly 500,000 Visa cards have been issued since March, and we expect several million to be issued within the first year of the program with significant runway beyond that. 
This new win is in addition to the joint venture we already have in the works with SBI and Elavon to terminalize major metropolitan areas of the country. We also recently signed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with HSBC, covering most of our Latin America and Caribbean region that will considerably broaden our issuance with HSBC in this part of the world. 
This builds upon the long-term issuing relationship we have had with HSBC globally for many years. And in the U.S., we expanded our credit program portfolio with a new 7-year program with U.S. Bank and Kroger, one of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., which will begin converting to Visa in September. 
We also strengthened several relationships with longtime key issuing clients in the U.S. Most recently, we resigned Regions Bank to a multiyear credit debit agreement to include signature debit, interlink, and some processing services. Regions is a top 10 debit issuer in the U.S. and a longtime client of Visa. 
We also continue to see good traction on the prepaid front in the U.S. with our state government programs. We recently initiated unemployment insurance programs in Connecticut with Chase, and in Florida, with Wells Fargo. On that subject, our unemployment programs with the Bank of America in New Jersey and California are ramping up at a very nice pace. Importantly though, we are seeing increasing use of these cards at the point of sale versus cash withdrawals at the ATM, as consumers get more comfortable with this form of prepaid product. 
Beyond working with our financial institution and merchant clients to expand issuance and acceptance of our core products, we also continue to look ahead and develop new channels and form factors to diversify the utility of these products. 
For instance in the mobile space, we just announced our realtime messaging service with our first client, the GAP. This service allows merchants to send realtime location-based discounts and promotions to consumers via text message. In this case, consumers can opt into the GAP Mobile for You program to receive GAP discounts that are triggered when they conduct a qualified Visa transaction, which they can choose to redeem at a GAP store while they are out shopping. GAP was the first national retailer to test and rollout realtime messaging and we have a strong pipeline of other retailers to follow. 
This is an excellent example of a value-added service that supports merchants' desires to personalize the consumer shopping experience made possible by the realtime processing capabilities and unparalleled data from our Visa Net processing infrastructure. 
Equally important is the legislation has not delayed, RTM along with other offerings such as CyberSource's enhanced decision manager, which I'll talk about in a moment, are the types of Visa value-added services that would incent merchants to route transactions over Visa Net. 
In the area of person-to-person payments, we continue to make important strides in leveraging our network and significant card base to enable people to pay each other using Visa cards. Our recent announcement with CashEdge and Fiserv in the U.S. underscores one of the important ways we are accelerating growth in this area. Increasingly by working with partners like these, we have existing distribution channels, we can broaden the reach and ease of use of the prepayment programs of Visa products. 
A recent example of one of these P2P programs overseas involves a service we recently launched in Russia and the Ukraine. We are working with Kiwi, Russia's largest payment kiosk operator, First Processing Bank in Russia, and PrivatBank, the Ukraine's largest bank. Together, we are enabling domestic transfers within Russia and with the cross-border functionality between Visa account holders in the U.K. and Russia. Over time, we will partner with additional entities to expand these programs globally. 
On the eCommerce front, we closed the PlaySpan the acquisition on March 1. In the meantime, we have seen CyberSource's business continue to grow rapidly and gain increasing traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, CyberSource delivered 38% billable transaction growth and secured a number of new business wins with major merchants including IDS, America and Olympus America. I also want to point out one or more of the recent examples of the synergies we are finding with CyberSource that deliver tangible value to our global merchant base. 
This quarter, we combined the strength of Visa and CyberSource's individual fraud detection capabilities to launch our first iteration of enhanced decision manager, which I mentioned earlier. By combining the risk force that CyberSource has historically provided to its merchants clients with data from the Visa Inc. advanced authorization service, we are delivering a unique and unparalleled view of transaction data that merchant clients recognize will serve them as a powerful new fraud detection mechanism for their business. 
All of these advancements are important steps towards capturing the enormous opportunity we see ahead, with payments innovation fueling our business growth over the moderate to long term. All of us know the way people connect and transact across the globe is changing dramatically driven by 2 global forces. First, the continued secular shift from paper base to electronic payments that still largely occurs at the physical point of sale, and second, the widespread adoption of mobile and Internet technology. These forces our conversion, and consumers and merchants are looking for payment solutions that harness these technologies. To that end, we have been working hard to develop a Visa quality payment solution that brings reliability, security and convenience to mobile and eCommerce environments. 
In our view, a globally viable payment solution must have 5 fundamental characteristics: convenience and simplicity, standardization, interoperability, global accessibility and security. None of the solutions we have seen from competitors is comprehensive enough because they don't address all of these criteria at once. Visa has long delivered solutions at the physical point of sale that passed this test and we are applying the same standard in the online and mobile arena. 
Look for us to make an announcement of our global eCommerce and mobile strategy later this month. And now, over to Byron."
38043467,129151925,123284,"Visa, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth was broad based, with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 21% growth rate in rest of world. As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's reve",1525,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth was broad based, with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 21% growth rate in rest of world. As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue is now 45% of Visa's total. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of February and March both comped at 11%, which is the first time we have seen double-digit growth since the recession. We are clearly encouraged by this trend. Third call out relates to client incentives. Incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16.7%, up from 15.3% in the first quarter. Taken together, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16% for the first half of the fiscal year, at the low end of our guidance.
While we still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for fiscal 2011, if implementation of the Durbin amendment is not delayed beyond July, it is probable that we would see some upward pressure on this number as a result of potential actions we would take to mitigate volume loss with certain issuers and merchants. 
Fourth call out relates to Durbin. Whether the legislation gets delayed or not, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and earnings per share growth of greater than 20%.
Finally, it's worth noting that beginning with the second fiscal quarter, our 3 key revenue drivers are now growing at double-digit rates, while comping double-digit growth in the same quarter of the prior year. This is true both globally and for the U.S., indicating that the strength of the recovery is now more broad based. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for the December and March quarters, as well as more recent payment and transaction results for the entire month of April. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal year 2011. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 13%, a modest decline from the 15% growth we saw in the December quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the March quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, relatively flat from the December quarter. Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis, grew at 15%, down 2 points from the 17% rate in the December quarter. 
More recently, in the month of April, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 11%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the second quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be higher than the U.S.'s 11%. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the March quarter, down slightly from a 15% rate in the December quarter. There was notable drop off in inbound travel to Japan, Middle East and North Africa. In aggregate, these situations may have negatively impacted growth by about 50 basis points. In April, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 13%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 13% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 15% growth rate we saw in the December quarter. In April, processed transactions posted growth of 12%. CyberSource billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion for the quarter, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. 
We continue to expect strong results in this part of our business as eCommerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenue of $2.7 billion was up 16% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year, driven by a sustained economic recovery, previously enacted pricing changes and cross-border transaction growth. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 24% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $823 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transaction. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth has moderated due to the impact of key contract renewals 2 quarters ago, and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting Gateway pass-through revenue and expense. 
International transaction revenue was up 14% to $624 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentive as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.7% and are running at 16% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Approximately 65% of the year-over-year dollar increase in incentives is due to payment volume growth in client portfolio, about another 25% of the increase is due to non-U.S. client renewals. 
Total operating expense for the quarter was $862 million, up 3% from the prior year. Increases in personnel, professional fees and general and administrative expense were offset by lower marketing in the period. Additionally, and I'll continue to remind you of this for the next 2 quarters, recall that we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activity. 
As a result, $55 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q2 fiscal year 2010 did not reoccur in Q2 fiscal year 2011. In Q2, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral, and will affect revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the second fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 2% increase compared to the same prior year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund important long-term investments across our entire business. 
Capital expenditures was $72 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Lastly, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. And we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04 for the full 2011 fiscal year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.6 billion. Of this total, $3 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining 3 quarters with $2.7 billion uncommitted as of the end of the second quarter. 
In terms of our ongoing buyback, at the end of the quarter, we announced the prefunding of the litigation escrow by $400 million to be funded with cash previously designated for our $1 billion share repurchase. This was executed at an average price of $73.81 per share. Additionally, we repurchased $230 million of our shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $70.53 per share. All told, we effectively repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $73.58. This leaves us with $64 million of open to buy under the original program. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 704 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. And importantly, the A class now accounts for almost 75% of our outstanding shares. Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And through this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. 
As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given the results to date, we are not making any adjustments at this time. With or without a Durbin delay, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Once the timing and content of the Reformed Act Regulations are clarified, we will determine whether any 2011 guidance requires adjustment, such as client incentives, and we will consider providing an early earnings outlook for fiscal 2012. 
In summary, we expect Visa to remain a solid growth company for years to come. Our core businesses continue to grow at healthy rates, while we are aggressively investing in technologies and platforms that will extend our core payment and processing capabilities, thereby creating new sources of growth. 
Finally, we expect to deliver this growth while driving significant free cash flow, which we will use to enhance shareholder returns through a continued dividend increases and share repurchases. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

But is it one way to look at it of $2.2 billion of net revenue this quarter, I figure about 10% given your previous numbers came from issuers at U.S. debit, so call that maybe $200 million. And in theory if that were reduced say, 20% just to pick a number or maybe worst case, or $40 million a quarter, the other $2 billion of revenue is growing faster as you said with 60% of revenue growth coming from Rest of World, particularly strong in credit given that credit is much larger Rest of the World than debit. Is it one way to look at it and say that, that other $2 billion of revenue not impacted by Durbin growing say, 15% would more than offset say, the $40 million decline and the $200 million of U.S. debit coming from issuers. Is that one way to try to size this in the second half if we get a worst case?"

And we were particularly pleased to see that this is the fifth straight quarter of positive payment volume growth in U.S. credit. And so, within the U.S. portfolio, which is being outgrown by Rest of World, credit is beginning to take a stronger presence and thereby putting debit in a different financial perspective than it was say, 12 months ago. So I think that thesis is exactly what we were trying to convey on the call. Thank you for asking."

Is that the question? Because the revenue came out equal to the expenses, so while marketing is down and it is down in part because of the removal of Extras and also because of timing, the full year impact of the change that we made with Visa Extras is income statement neutral. So no impact on EPS, and no impact on the full year guidance for marketing because when we guided, while marketing is down versus the same quarter last year, there's always, given the campaign that we have last year relative to the Olympics, you would naturally expect it to be down somewhat. So we are still fully consistent with the guidance that we gave earlier on marketing. And the adjustments we made for Extras no income statement impact. With regards to the margin at 62 for the quarter, that would be -- what you should take away is that we are increasingly investing in our products platforms to drive future growth. And the margin will simply be an outcome of the level of investment that we make and we continue to invest aggressively in that arena."

With regards -- let's talk about this in the context of the U.S. So for gas, historically, go back a year. At gas prices that we're roughly 30% less than they average, on average than they are today, we were running about 8% of total U.S. payment volume in the gas category. We refer to it as oil, in the oil category. In the month of April, that was just a little over 10% of U.S. payment volume, suggesting that the share had moved up about -- that's about a 25% increase in the share of U.S. payment volume. When you compare that to roughly based on our measures of 32% increase in the average price of gasoline, April versus about where we were a year ago, and you factor in that there is probably been some degree of consumption cutback given prices that are now posted in the $4-plus range. That is the immediate impact. We have not yet seen and it may be a bit early, we have not yet seen any specific call outs relative to trade outs on other spending categories, which may be in part due to the additional disposable income created by reductions in withholding tax and social security. So we're still trying to sort that out. Inevitably, there is probably going to be some friction. But at the moment, it's hard for us to identify it."

And therefore, we were drawing attention to the fact that we've got a year in the bag at 16, but there's some significant uncertainties still to go. But some of those uncertainties we're contemplated. So don't automatically assume that were it to be -- were it not to be delayed that we would necessarily be above that range. But where we end up is going to be a function of the timing and the exact wording of the rules. And I would say on the second, it's just hard to know with regards to how we would be deploying incentives today versus how we would do it under Durbin.

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa at court option was $883 million, a 23% increase over last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26, a 29% increase over the third quarter of 2010. 
Our performance over the past quarter reaffirmed Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and services offering, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
Before turning to the business highlights, I'd like to update you on Visa's activities to adapt to the new United States regulatory environment. As stated during our update call on July 6, overall, I continue to expect the impact resulting from regulation to be dilutive but manageable with fiscal 2012 bearing the majority of the financial impact. It is important to appreciate that we were prepared for a wide range of outcomes. And with the federal reserves final rules in hand, we have the clarity needed to execute on our strategies. We are now moving forward on multiple fronts and with a variety of new offerings for our clients. And today, I'd like to share with you at a high level a feel of our areas of focus. 
We will offer additional details in the coming quarters once we have had the opportunity to further discuss these strategies with our clients and partners. Regulation has dramatically altered the competitive environment in the United States and given merchant broad discretion over how transactions will be routed. Recognizing this new dynamic, we are resetting our business approach and implementing a number of new strategies for all products. 
Specifically for debit, we will continue to focus on maintaining Visa debt issuance through strong partnerships with our issuing clients, thereby positioning Visa to compete for as many transactions as possible. Equally important, we will ensure that Visa is positioned to compete for routing for merchants and acquirers by strengthening these important relationships. We are adapting Visa's business to deliver even more value to all participants in the value chain, while preserving our ability to grow and positioning Visa for continued leadership in the U.S. 
Our approach is based on multiple actions which were incorporated into the guidance we provided earlier this month. I'm going to address 2 of them now. 
First, we are modifying our economics in a way that we expect will result in a reduction in merchant cost in total and on the margin. The modifications include both fixed processing fees and a reduction in variable fees. We expect this will help us win routing decisions and maintain debit volume in the new environment. Specifically, Visa is implementing a new fixed acquirer fee called the network participation fee, which will apply to the acceptance of all of Visa products and is based on both the size of the merchant and the number of merchant location. This fee will allow Visa to continue investing in our secure, reliable and interoperable mobile payments network, a long-standing area of strength for our organization. These attributes are cornerstones of Visa's brand promise and it is critical that we make ongoing upgrades, innovations and enhancement. 
In fact, Visa facilitates issuers standing processing each day for more than 600,000 transactions, minimizing system disruption and ensuring more transactions to get completed. In order to reduce fees in the aggregate, Visa will also lower our variable processing fees for all Visa debit products across all market segments. The combination of fixed and variable fees offers merchants an even better incentive throughout more transactions over our network by providing them an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction costs and take advantage of economies of scale that are now more readily available to them. 
As I said a few moments ago, our 2012 guidance, which incorporates the reductions we expect to Visa's debit, volumes increase and the fees we charge, also reflects our appreciation of regulation change and plans in which we operate. 
We recognize that we need to focus more than ever on delivering greater value to both issuers and merchants to win debit routing while continuing to grow our successful credit business. 
In that regard, we are taking multiple actions to ensure we are well-positioned to compete for both issuance and routing. We will extend the merchants of all sizes through direct negotiations and through acquirers with successful partnership programs we have historically offered issuers. We will also increase our engagement with merchant associations to achieve the same goal. Now a broad set of acquirers and merchants can receive incentives from Visa in exchange for routing commitments. 
The second quarter element of our strategy focuses on additional investment and value-added services aimed at winning routing decisions. These include powerful merchant benchmark analytics, loyalty, rewards programs and realtime mobile messaging to drive merchant sales growth. 
For example, we continue to make progress on our realtime messaging program, including the GAP recent decision to expand their existing program across more brands in their portfolio as well as new agreements with the Sports Authority and the Kangaroo Express, a leading convenience store operator in the Southeastern United States with more than 1,600 location. 
With these actions, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the United States and positioning Visa to grow from here. We are 100% prepared. We are fully engaged with our key stakeholders. We are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Taken together, our strategies will provide Visa with a strong foundation to adapt to the new landscape while also generating sufficient revenue to make the investments needed to drive forward the future of this industry. Of course, while the regulatory process generated headlines over the last 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa's revenues are derived from products and geographies that are completely untouched by VisaNet. In that regard I'm pleased to say that Visa's employees maintained their focus and continued to advance our growth agenda. 
In the U.S., we saw a continued strong performance in credit, posting Visa's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Of note, a credit posted particularly strong performance growing 3 times faster than the overall credit category. Building on that success, we announced a multiyear agreement with United Continental Holdings to continue to issue co-branded Mileage PLUS Visa card. The recent merger of the United and Continental Airlines will result in the consolidation of their card portfolios under mileage plus and the combined entity will begin exclusively issuing Mileage PLUS Visa cards to all new customers beginning January 1, 2012. An important aspect of this major co-brand program is the proportionally larger number of affluent card carriers and the greater cross border volume usage associated with Mileage PLUS Visa card, all benefits to Visa's overall growth. 
Another key renewal was with Disney with whom we have enjoyed an important co-branding and promotional relationship for many years. Outside of the U.S., International markets are increasingly important contributor of Visa's growth, increasing payment volume by 17%, which is driving approximately 60% of the company's overall revenue growth. In line with our strategic aspiration to grow Visa's business outside the U.S., we continue to make progress on our long-standing commitment to invest in key markets which show the greatest potential. 
In critical markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, the GCC, Mexico and Sub Saharan Africa, we have tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase revenue growth over a 5-year horizon. We will continue to target additional countries for our investment in 2012 and beyond. 
For example, in Russia, one of the fastest-growing countries globally, we are focused on delivering the core Visa product with value proposition and continuing to expand acceptance. We are investing to enhance mass card and premium credit offerings and delivering products like prepaid and Visa Money transfer to our Russian issuers and consumers. 
In Brazil, where the acquiring landscape is changing, Visa is accelerating growth of processed transactions versus new acquirer relationships in renewing issuing partnerships. We continue to differentiate ourselves by delivering superior products across our core portfolio of credit, debit, small business and commercial solutions. 
We also continue to advance our core product growth in India, establishing new or expanded agreements with several large clients including the Life Insurance Corporation of India as well as the State Bank of India. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, we signed a multiyear agreement to support Visa debit products across the State Bank of India franchise. In just a few short months, over 1 million Visa debit cards has been issued as part of this program. 
In Japan, we are accelerating growth by driving more sophisticated product offerings such as co-brand programs with major issuers, merchants and commercial card programs that deliver solutions to more mature electronic payments environments. For example, we recently launched a debit program with Arizona Bank, Japan's fourth-largest financial institution. It's our first traditional debit program in that market and we are hopeful that it will lead to similar programs with other clients, accelerating the migration towards electronic payments in Japan's traditionally cash-centric economy. And we are partnering with clients and governments and investing in long-term growth in developing markets in Africa, Latin America and South Asia to accelerate efforts to advance financial inclusion and ultimately grow domestic transaction growth. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. We continue to make progress on Visa's next-generation e-commerce and mobile payment solutions announced in May, including a focus on single click and aliasing capabilities. We believe these elements of the Visa offering will help to differentiate and deliver value to the other NFC-only solutions recently announced. This remains a top priority for the organization and we are moving full speed ahead towards broad commercial availability. 
As we've said all along, Visa firmly believes in open approach is the key to success in mobile commerce. So in addition to building Visa's own capability, our strategy must also enable Visa payments on third-party platforms. That's why last week, we announced an agreement with Isis to join their consortium and we continue to engage in productive discussions with other potential partners. 
Part of our efforts to make mobile a reality in emerging markets, we completed our acquisition of Fundamo, a leading mobile wallet software provider for emerging markets with over 40 programs in more than 25 countries. I can report that the integration is progressing well and we are now focused on building managed services for issuers and mobile operators around the Fundamo platform. Additionally, we are developing capabilities to overlay a virtual Visa pre-paid account on the closed loop accounts managed by Fundamo and other wallet platforms. 
Since our announcement, we have received substantial interest from issuers and mobile operators in Asia and Latin America. We are also taking action to further tap into the creativity and the expertise of the developer community, an increasingly critical participant in the creation and rollout of new payment technology. Today, our existing developer center has more than 6,000 active developers using our tools and resources to build Visa payment functionality into websites for mobile applications, which in turn brings more merchants into the Visa network, ultimately, driving transactions and payments growth. Additionally, through the center, Visa helps to reduce e-commerce transaction risks, which means even more transactions are approved and flow through the network. This makes Visa a more attractive payment network partner.  To accelerate these efforts, we will launch our expanded Visa developer center in the current quarter, combining our existing PlaySpan and CyberSource developer activities into a single platform while also introducing direct connectivity to VisaNet for the first time. By connecting directly to VisaNet, we can offer to our merchant partners and financial institution customers faster and easier access to Visa products and services, making them more competitive and ultimately driving incremental revenue growth. 
On the e-commerce front, CyberSource's business continues to gain traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. We secured a number of new business wins with major merchants, including Twitter and. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the United States and internationally. 
Finally, we continue to deliver on our long-standing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This comes on the heels of completing our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in April. At approximately $77 per share, we retired 13.7 million shares in the quarter. This brings our repurchases in fiscal 2011, including escrow funding actions, $2.8 billion. 
In conclusion, as we reorient the U.S. debit business in the wake of the new regulations, we will simultaneously pursue our growth strategies both at home and abroad. Our commitment to our clients, new product rollouts and ongoing innovation combine to make Visa's value proposition more compelling than ever. And we are prepared to use our comprehensive array of products and functionalities to win in the marketplace. Visa remains a strong, globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,137098293,147258,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of the world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth ca",1486,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of the world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue is now 44% of Visa's total, up from 41% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 6 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of May and June comped at 8% and 12%, respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. We continue to be encouraged by this trend. 
Third, price incentives for the quarter as a percent of growth revenue was 16.2%, down from 16.7% in the second quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16.1%, in line with the lower end of our guidance. However, as we stated on our update call on July 6, we expect client incentives for the full fiscal year to be at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range based on the pacing of our contract pipeline and potential Q4 partnership contracts that provide merchants incentive aimed at further encouraging Visa routing preference. 
Fourth, as first discussed back in January, we sold our 10% stake in Visa Vale, a Brazilian prepaid issuer. Though we expect to book a gain as investment income in our second quarter, we actually recorded a gain in Q3 once we receive the necessary Brazilian regulatory approval. The net benefit to Visa in the quarter was $85 million pretax and $44 million after tax. 
Finally, as we did in the fourth fiscal quarter last year, we revalued the Visa Europe court option, which had a positive noncash impact to our earnings this quarter. The $122 million decrease in the value of the option is nontaxable, is recorded in other income and is solely due to decline in Visa's TE ratio relative to historical level. It does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise the put. The put option is not valued on our balance sheet at $145 million. 
Eliminating this impact, provides a cleaner picture of our operating performance on yields and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the March and June quarters as well as the results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 13%, relatively flat from the March quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the June quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 10%, a slight decrease from the 12% growth we saw in the March quarter; rest of the world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up 2 points from the 15% growth rate in the March quarter. More recently, through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 10%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the third quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth to be higher. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the June quarter, up slightly from a 13% rate in the March quarter. We have seen some rebound in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa but it is still too early to gauge the longer term trends. Through July 21, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 18%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 13% growth rate we saw in the March quarter. Through July 21, processed transactions posted growth of 10%. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenue of $2.8 billion was up 14% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the U.S., continued recovery in the U.S. economy, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the March quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. Data processing revenue was $886 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. 
International transaction revenue was up 15% to $652 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.2% and are running at 16.1% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Total operating expense for the quarter is $977 million, up 10% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were included in Q3 of the prior year. While marketing expense was up, approximately $70 million on a sequential quarter basis. This was due to the timing of planned campaign and is consistent with our full year guidance of less than $900 million. 
In the U.S., we have continued to rightsize our spend and refined our marketing focus to put greater investment toward digital media. We have also focused on marketing efforts on driving greater cross-border transaction growth. As a reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activity. Consistent with this announcement, $52 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q3 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q3 fiscal year 2011. In Q3, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the third fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Our operating margin for the quarter was 58%, on target with our expectation for the full year. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter and now total $236 million year-to-date. 
Given the pace of our investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives, we now expect our full year 2011 capital spending to be moderately above $300 million. 
On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. For the full year of 2011, we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. Full year EPS dilution is also expected to be $0.01. Finally, our recorded tax rate for the period was 35% including the favorable impact from the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe transaction. Adjusting to exclude the impact, the tax rate would have been 38%. On an as-adjusted basis we continue to expect full year, rate to be consistent with our guidance. 
As we announced on July 6, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April. During the quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to repurchase 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Year-to-date, Visa has spent $2.8 billion to effectively repurchase 37.8 million shares at an average price of $74.12. At the end of the quarter, we had 691 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. 
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Bill mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan through July 20, 2012, which will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. 
As to guidance, for the back half of 2011, given results to date and to reiterate what we told you on the July 6 call, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Client incentives are expected to come in at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range. And we are now expecting capital expenditures to be moderately above $300 million for the year, up from our prior range of $250 million to $275 million. 
Our net revenue outlook for 2012 stands at high single to low double-digit growth while earnings per share growth is expected to be mid  to high teens range. We will have additional guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 when we report our fourth quarter earnings in October. 
With that, we are ready to take questions."

With regards to a deeper portion of the impact on the 20%, I think the way we've chosen to respond to that for now is related to what we described on our last call that in preparing for a new post-Durbin environment, there are a number of ways this can play out competitively. We have run a variety of scenarios. We have used those to inform the revenue range we gave you all at the July 6 call. And I think you'll recognize that there's a lot of market reaction here yet to unfold. Strategies need to play out before we can be more descriptive about these impacts. And as they do, we will update appropriately. Having said that, we do believe that the primary impact of the Durbin legislation will be felt in 2012 and we would expect to regain some revenue growth momentum in this arena in 2013. With regards to CLO, it was contemplated all along that CLO would be entering in this market. It is a lower income profile, lower spend-oriented market segment and that's a segment very different from the one that we currently occupy.

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven",2269,"Thanks, Jack, and as always, thank you all for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put option was $883 million, a 23% increase over last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26, a 29% increase over the third quarter of 2010. 
Our performance over the past quarter reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and services offering, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
Before turning to the business highlights, I'd like to update you on Visa's activities to adapt to the new United States regulatory environment. As stated during our update call on July 6, overall, I continue to expect the impact resulting from regulation to be dilutive but manageable with fiscal 2012, bearing the majority of the financial impact. It is important to appreciate that we were prepared for a wide range of outcomes. And with the federal reserve's final rules in hands, we have the clarity needed to execute on our strategies. We are now moving forward on multiple fronts and with a variety of new offerings for our clients. And today, I'd like to share with you, at a high level, a feel of our areas of focus. 
We will offer additional detail in the coming quarters once we've had the opportunity to further discuss these strategies with our clients and partners. Regulation has dramatically altered the competitive environment in the United States and given merchants' broad discretion over how transactions will be routed. Recognizing this new dynamic, we are resetting our business approach and implementing a number of new strategies for all products. 
Specifically for debit, we will continue to focus on maintaining Visa debit issuance through strong partnerships with our issuing clients, thereby positioning Visa to compete for as many transactions as possible. Equally important, we will ensure that Visa is positioned to compete for routing for merchants and acquirers by strengthening these important relationships. We are adapting Visa's business to deliver even more value to all participants in the value chain while preserving our ability to grow and positioning Visa for continued leadership in the U.S.  
Our approach is based on multiple actions, which were incorporated into the guidance we provided earlier this month. I'm going to address 2 of them now. 
First, we are modifying our economics in a way that we expect will result in a reduction in merchant cost in total and on the margin. The modifications include both fixed processing fees and a reduction in variable fees. We expect this will help us win routing decisions and maintain debit volume in the new environment. Specifically, Visa is implementing a new fixed acquirer fee called the network participation fee, which will apply to the acceptance of all Visa products and is based on both the size of the merchant and the number of merchant location. This fee will allow Visa to continue investing in our secure, reliable and interoperable global payments network, a long-standing area of strength for our organization. These attributes are cornerstones of Visa's brand promise, and it is critical that we make ongoing upgrades, innovations and enhancements. 
In fact, Visa facilitates issuer-standing processing each day for more than 600,000 transactions, minimizing system disruption and ensuring more transactions get completed. In order to reduce fees in the aggregate, Visa will also lower our variable processing fees for all Visa debit products across all merchant segments. That combination of fixed and variable fees offers merchants an even greater incentive throughout more transactions over our network by providing them an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction costs and take advantage of economies of scale that are now more readily available to them. 
As I said a few moments ago, our 2012 guidance, which incorporates the reductions we expect at Visa's debit, volumes and fees and the fees we charge also reflects our appreciation that regulation has changed the landscape in which we operate. 
We recognized that we need to focus more than ever on delivering greater value to both issuers and merchants to win debit routing while continuing to grow our successful credit business. In that regard, we are taking multiple actions to ensure we are well-positioned to compete for both issuance and routing. We will extend the merchants of all sizes through direct negotiations and through acquirers the successful partnership programs we have historically offered issuers. We will also increase our engagement with merchant associations to achieve the same goal. Now a broad set of acquirers and merchants can receive incentives from Visa in exchange for routing commitments. 
The second quarter element of our strategy focuses on additional investment and value-added services aimed at winning routing decisions. These include powerful merchant benchmark analytics, loyalty rewards programs and realtime mobile messaging to drive merchant sales growth. 
For example, we continue to make progress on our realtime messaging program, including the Gap's recent decision to expand their existing program across more brands in their portfolio as well as new agreements with the Sports Authority and the Kangaroo Express, a leading convenience store operator in the Southeastern United States with more than 1,600 locations. 
With these actions, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the United States and positioning Visa to grow from here. We are 100% prepared. We are fully engaged with our key stakeholders. We are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Taken together, our strategies will provide Visa with a strong foundation to adapt to the new landscape while also generating sufficient revenue to make the investments needed to drive forward the future of this industry. Of course, while the regulatory process generated headlines over the past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa's revenues are derived from products and geographies that are completely untouched by VisaNet. And in that regard, I'm pleased to say that Visa's employees maintained their focus and continued to advance our growth agenda. 
In the U.S., we saw a continued strong performance in credit, posting Visa's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Of note, affluent credit posted particularly strong performance, growing 3 times faster than the overall credit category. Building on that success, we announced a multiyear agreement with United Continental Holdings to continue to issue co-branded Mileage Plus Visa cards. The recent merger of the United and Continental Airlines will result in the consolidation of their card portfolios under Mileage Plus, and the combined entity will begin exclusively issuing Mileage Plus Visa cards to all new customers beginning January 1, 2012. An important aspect of this major co-brand program is the proportionally larger number of affluent card carriers and the greater cross-border volume usage associated with Mileage Plus Visa card, all big benefits to Visa's overall growth. 
Another key renewal was with Disney with whom we have enjoyed an important co-branding and promotional relationship for many years. Outside of the U.S., International markets are increasingly important contributor of Visa's growth, increasing payment volume by 17%, which is driving approximately 60% of the company's overall revenue growth. In line with our strategic aspiration to grow Visa's business outside the U.S., we continue to make progress on our long-standing commitment to invest in key markets that show the greatest potential. 
In critical markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, the GCC, Mexico and Sub Saharan Africa, we have tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase revenue growth over a 5-year horizon. We will continue to target additional countries for our investment in 2012 and beyond. 
For example, in Russia, one of the fastest-growing countries globally, we are focused on delivering the core Visa product at value proposition and continuing to expand acceptance. We are investing to enhance mass credit and premium credit offerings and delivering products like prepaid and Visa Money Transfer to our Russian issuers and consumers. 
In Brazil, where the acquiring landscape is changing, Visa is accelerating growth of processed transactions versus new acquirer relationships in renewing issuing partnerships. We continue to differentiate ourselves by delivering superior products across our core portfolio of credit, debit, small business and commercial solutions. 
We also continue to advance our core product growth in India, establishing new or expanded agreements with several large clients, including the Life Insurance Corporation of India as well as the State Bank of India. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, we signed a multiyear agreement to support Visa debit products across the State Bank of India franchise. In just a few short months, over 1 million Visa debit cards have been issued as part of this program. 
In Japan, we are accelerating growth by driving more sophisticated product offerings, such as co-brand programs with major issuers, merchants and commercial card programs that deliver solutions to more mature electronic payments environments. For example, we recently launched a debit program with Resona Bank, Japan's fourth largest financial institution. It's our first traditional debit program in that market, and we are hopeful that it will lead to similar programs with other clients, accelerating the migration towards electronic payments in Japan's traditionally cash-centric economy. And we are partnering with clients and governments and investing in long-term growth in developing markets in Africa, Latin America and South Asia to accelerate efforts to advance financial inclusion and ultimately grow domestic transaction growth. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. We continue to make progress on Visa's next-generation e-commerce and mobile payment solutions announced in May, including a focus on single-click and aliasing capabilities. We believe these elements of the Visa offering will help to differentiate and deliver value to the other NFC-only solutions recently announced. This remains a top priority for the organization, and we are moving full speed ahead towards broad commercial availability. 
As we've said all along, Visa firmly believes an open approach is the key to success in mobile commerce. So in addition to building Visa's own capability, our strategy must also enable Visa payments on third-party platforms. That's why last week, we announced an agreement with Isis to join their consortium and we continue to engage in productive discussions with other potential partners. 
Part of our efforts to make mobile a reality in emerging markets, we completed our acquisition of Fundamo, a leading mobile wallet software provider for emerging markets with over 40 programs in more than 25 countries. I can report that the integration is progressing well and we are now focused on building managed services for issuers and mobile operators around the Fundamo platform. Additionally, we are developing capabilities to overlay a virtual Visa prepaid account on the closed loop accounts managed by Fundamo and other wallet platforms. 
Since our announcement, we have received substantial interest from issuers and mobile operators into Asia and Latin America. We are also taking action to further tap into the creativity and the expertise of the developer community, an increasingly critical participant in the creation and rollout of new payment technology. 
Today, our existing developer center has more than 6,000 active developers using our tools and resources to build Visa payment functionality into websites for mobile applications, which in turn brings more merchants into the Visa network, ultimately driving transactions and payments growth. Additionally, through the center, Visa helps reduce e-commerce transaction risks, which means even more transactions are approved and flow through the network. This makes Visa a more attractive payment network partner. 
To accelerate these efforts, we will launch our expanded Visa developer center in the current quarter, combining our existing PlaySpan and CyberSource developer activities into a single platform while also introducing direct connectivity to VisaNet for the first time. By connecting directly to VisaNet, we can offer our merchant partners and financial institution customers faster and easier access to Visa products and services, making them more competitive and ultimately driving incremental revenue growth. 
On the e-commerce front, CyberSource's business continues to gain traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. We secured a number of new business wins with major merchants, including Twitter and Torno [ph]. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the United States and internationally. 
Finally, we continue to deliver on our long-standing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that our board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This comes on the heels of completing our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in April. At approximately $77 per share, we retired 13.7 million shares in the quarter. This brings our repurchases in fiscal 2011, including escrow funding actions to $2.8 billion. 
In conclusion, as we reorient the U.S. debit business in the wake of the new regulations, we will simultaneously pursue our growth strategies both at home and abroad. Our commitment to our clients, new product rollouts and ongoing innovation combine to make Visa's value proposition more compelling than ever. And we are prepared to use our comprehensive array of products and functionalities to win in the marketplace. Visa remains a strong, globally-oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,137098293,147455,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came f",1489,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means the non-U.S. revenue is now 44% of Visa's total, up from 41% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 6 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of May and June comped at 8% and 12%, respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. We continue to be encouraged by this trend. 
Third, incentives for the quarter as a percent of growth revenue was 16.2%, down from 16.7% in the second quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16.1%, in line with the lower end of our guidance. However, as we stated on our update call on July 6, we expect client incentives for the full fiscal year to be at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range based on the pacing of our contract pipeline and potential Q4 partnership contract that provide merchant incentives aimed at further encouraging Visa routing preference. 
Fourth, as first discussed back in January, we sold our 10% stake in Visa Vale, a Brazilian prepaid issuer. Though we expect to book the gain as investment income in our second quarter, we actually recorded a gain in Q3 once we received the necessary Brazilian regulatory approval. The net benefit to Visa in the quarter was $85 million pretax and $44 million after tax. 
Finally, as we did in the fourth fiscal quarter last year, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, which had a positive noncash impact to our earnings this quarter. The $122 million decrease in the value of the option is nontaxable, is reported in other income and is solely due to decline in Visa's TE ratio relative to historical level. It does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise the put. The put option is now valued on our balance sheet at $145 million. Eliminating this impact provides a cleaner picture of our operating performance and yields and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the March and June quarters as well as the results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollar was 13%, relatively flat from the March quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the June quarter. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 10%, a slight decrease from the 12% growth we saw in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up 2 points from the 15% growth rate in the March quarter. More recently, through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 10%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the third quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth to be higher. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the June quarter, up slightly from a 13% rate in the March quarter. We have seen some rebound in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa, but it is still too early to gauge the longer-term trends. Through July 21, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 18%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 13% growth rate we saw in the March quarter. Through July 21, processed transactions posted growth of 10%. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenue of $2.8 billion was up 14% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the U.S., continued recovery in the U.S. economy, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the March quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. Data processing revenue was $886 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions. 
International transaction revenue was up 15% to $652 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.2% and are running at 16.1% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Total operating expense for the quarter is $977 million, up 10% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were included in Q3 of the prior year. While marketing expense was up, approximately $70 million on a sequential quarter basis, this was due to the timing of planned campaign and is consistent with our full year guidance of less than $900 million. 
In the U.S., we have continued to rightsize our spend and refine our marketing focus to put greater investment toward digital media. We have also focused on marketing efforts on driving greater cross-border transaction growth. As a reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentations related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activity. Consistent with this announcement, $52 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q3 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q3 fiscal year 2011. In Q3, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the third fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Our operating margin for the quarter was 58%, on target with our expectation for the full year. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter and now total $236 million year-to-date. 
Given the pace of our investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives, we now expect our full year 2011 capital spending to be moderately above $300 million. 
On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. For the full year 2011, we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. Full year EPS dilution is also expected to be $0.01. Finally, our recorded tax rate for the period was 35%, including the favorable impact from the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe consumption. Adjusting to exclude the put impact, the tax rate would have been 38%. On an as adjusted basis, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with our guidance. 
As we announced on July 6, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board in April. During the quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to repurchase 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Year-to-date, Visa has spent $2.8 billion to effectively repurchase 37.8 million shares at an average price of $74.12. At the end of the quarter, we had 691 million shares outstanding on an as converted basis. 
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Bill mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan through July 20, 2012, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. 
As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given results to date and to reiterate what we told you on the July 6 call, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Client incentives are expected to come in at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range. And we are now expecting capital expenditures to be moderately above $300 million for the year, up from our prior range of $250 million to $275 million. 
Our net revenue outlook for 2012 stands at high single to low double-digit growth, while earnings per share growth is expected to be at the mid- to high teens range. We will have additional guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 when we report our fourth quarter earning in October. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

We said that 2012 will be the low point. So that is the net result. The net result is that we won't do as well as we have here for in the debit card business at least in 2012. Hopefully, we can grow off of what we do in 2012 to 2013. But what we have done is, in our opinion, consistent with helping to ensure that Visa will be successful in the long run and within the spirit and the intention of the regulation."

Let me respond to both questions. With regards to a deeper description of the impact on the 20%, I think the way we've chosen to respond to that for now is related to what we described on our last call that in preparing for a new post-Durbin environment, there are a number of ways this can play out competitively. We have run a variety of scenarios. We have used those to inform the revenue range we gave to you all at the July 6 call. And I think you all recognize that there's a lot of market reaction here yet to unfold. Strategies need to play out before we can be more descriptive about these impacts. And as they do, we will update appropriately. Having said that, we do believe that the primary impact of the Durbin legislation will be felt in 2012, and we would expect to regain some revenue growth momentum in this arena in 2013. With regards to Cielo, it was contemplated all along that Cielo would be entering in this market. It is a lower income profile, lower spend-oriented market segment, and that's a segment very different from the one that we currently occupy.

So in '12, we are projecting a global payment volume growth off of current trends adjusted for the investments we are making related to our country acceleration strategies. In U.S. debit, in particular, we do expect, as Joe mentioned, a decrease in yield. We expect to lose some routing, weighted more to PIN. We expect some volume shift from Signature to PIN. We expect much of that to play out in '12, therefore becoming part of our base in '12. And so from a revenue standpoint, by the time we run into 2013, we are benefiting from strong growth outside the United States that is accelerated based on investments we are making in a number of key markets to amplify the growth in those markets and with post-Durbin impacts substantially embedded in the 2012 base with our strategies in place and gaining more traction with each passing quarter.

So do you expect the other networks to be more aggressive on pricing? And to the extent that they are, are you prepared to do something with your financials to try to buffer the impact, such as cutting advertising expenses or something along those lines? Can you just give us an idea because I know you run multiple scenarios on how competitors might react. But if those worser scenarios play out, where pricing competition gets more aggressive on a more aggressive side, you have a kind of a plan b to buffer the impact."

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven",2269,"Thanks, Jack, and as always, thank you all for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put option was $883 million, a 23% increase over last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26, a 29% increase over the third quarter of 2010. 
Our performance over the past quarter reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and services offering, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
Before turning to the business highlights, I'd like to update you on Visa's activities to adapt to the new United States regulatory environment. As stated during our update call on July 6, overall, I continue to expect the impact resulting from regulation to be dilutive but manageable with fiscal 2012, bearing the majority of the financial impact. It is important to appreciate that we were prepared for a wide range of outcomes. And with the Federal Reserve's final rules in hand, we have the clarity needed to execute on our strategies. We are now moving forward on multiple fronts and with a variety of new offerings for our clients. And today, I'd like to share with you, at a high level, a feel of our areas of focus. 
We will offer additional detail in the coming quarters once we've had the opportunity to further discuss these strategies with our clients and partners. Regulation has dramatically altered the competitive environment in the United States and given merchants' broad discretion over how transactions will be routed. Recognizing this new dynamic, we are resetting our business approach and implementing a number of new strategies for all products. 
Specifically for debit, we will continue to focus on maintaining Visa debit issuance through strong partnerships with our issuing clients, thereby positioning Visa to compete for as many transactions as possible. Equally important, we will ensure that Visa is positioned to compete for routing for merchants and acquirers by strengthening these important relationships. We are adapting Visa's business to deliver even more value to all participants in the value chain, while preserving our ability to grow and positioning Visa for continued leadership in the U.S.  
Our approach is based on multiple actions, which were incorporated into the guidance we provided earlier this month. I'm going to address 2 of them now. 
First, we are modifying our economics in a way that we expect will result in a reduction in merchant cost in total and on the margin. The modifications include both fixed processing fees and a reduction in variable fees. We expect this will help us win routing decisions and maintain debit volume in the new environment. Specifically, Visa is implementing a new fixed acquirer fee called the network participation fee, which will apply to the acceptance of all Visa products and is based on both the size of the merchant and the number of merchant location. This fee will allow Visa to continue investing in our secure, reliable and interoperable global payments network, a long-standing area of strength for our organization. These attributes are cornerstones of Visa's brand promise, and it is critical that we make ongoing upgrades, innovations and enhancements. 
In fact, Visa facilitates issuer-standing processing each day for more than 600,000 transactions, minimizing system disruption and ensuring more transactions get completed. In order to reduce fees in the aggregate, Visa will also lower our variable processing fees for all Visa debit products across all merchant segments. That combination of fixed and variable fees offers merchants an even greater incentive throughout more transactions over our network by providing them an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction costs and take advantage of economies of scale that are now more readily available to them. 
As I said a few moments ago, our 2012 guidance, which incorporates the reductions we expect at Visa's debit, volumes and fees and the fees we charge also reflects our appreciation that regulation has changed the landscape in which we operate. 
We recognized that we need to focus more than ever on delivering greater value to both issuers and merchants to win debit routing while continuing to grow our successful credit business. In that regard, we are taking multiple actions to ensure we are well-positioned to compete for both issuance and routing. We will extend the merchants of all sizes through direct negotiations and through acquirers the successful partnership programs we have historically offered issuers. We will also increase our engagement with merchant associations to achieve the same goal. Now a broad set of acquirers and merchants can receive incentives from Visa in exchange for routing commitments. 
The second quarter element of our strategy focuses on additional investment and value-added services aimed at winning routing decisions. These include powerful merchant benchmark analytics, loyalty rewards programs and realtime mobile messaging to drive merchant sales growth. 
For example, we continue to make progress on our realtime messaging program, including the Gap's recent decision to expand their existing program across more brands in their portfolio as well as new agreements with the Sports Authority and the Kangaroo Express, a leading convenience store operator in the Southeastern United States with more than 1,600 locations. 
With these actions, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the United States and positioning Visa to grow from here. We are 100% prepared. We are fully engaged with our key stakeholders. We are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Taken together, our strategies will provide Visa with a strong foundation to adapt to the new landscape while also generating sufficient revenue to make the investments needed to drive forward the future of this industry. Of course, while the regulatory process generated headlines over the past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa's revenues are derived from products and geographies that are completely untouched by VisaNet. And in that regard, I'm pleased to say that Visa's employees maintained their focus and continued to advance our growth agenda. 
In the U.S., we saw a continued strong performance in credit, posting Visa's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Of note, affluent credit posted particularly strong performance, growing 3 times faster than the overall credit category. Building on that success, we announced a multiyear agreement with United Continental Holdings to continue to issue co-branded Mileage Plus Visa cards. The recent merger of the United and Continental Airlines will result in the consolidation of their card portfolios under Mileage Plus, and the combined entity will begin exclusively issuing Mileage Plus Visa cards to all new customers beginning January 1, 2012. An important aspect of this major co-brand program is the proportionally larger number of affluent card carriers, and the greater cross-border volume usage associated with Mileage Plus Visa cards, all big benefits to Visa's overall growth. 
Another key renewal was with Disney, with whom we have enjoyed an important co-branding and promotional relationship for many years. Outside of the U.S., International markets are increasingly important contributor of Visa's growth, increasing payment volume by 17%, which is driving approximately 60% of the company's overall revenue growth. In line with our strategic aspiration to grow Visa's business outside the U.S., we continue to make progress on our long-standing commitment to invest in key markets that show the greatest potential. 
In critical markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, the GCC, Mexico and Sub Saharan Africa, we have tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase revenue growth over a 5-year horizon. We will continue to target additional countries for our investment in 2012 and beyond. 
For example, in Russia, one of the fastest-growing countries globally, we are focused on delivering the core Visa product at value proposition and continuing to expand acceptance. We are investing to enhance mass credit and premium credit offerings and delivering products like prepaid and Visa Money Transfer to our Russian issuers and consumers. 
In Brazil, where the acquiring landscape is changing, Visa is accelerating growth of processed transactions versus new acquirer relationships in renewing issuing partnerships. We continue to differentiate ourselves by delivering superior products across our core portfolio of credit, debit, small business and commercial solutions. 
We also continue to advance our core product growth in India, establishing new or expanded agreements with several large clients, including the Life Insurance Corporation of India as well as the State Bank of India. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, we signed a multiyear agreement to support Visa debit products across the State Bank of India franchise. In just a few short months, over 1 million Visa debit cards have been issued as part of this program. 
In Japan, we are accelerating growth by driving more sophisticated product offerings, such as co-brand programs with major issuers, merchants and commercial card programs that deliver solutions to more mature electronic payments environments. For example, we recently launched a debit program with Resona Bank, Japan's fourth largest financial institution. It's our first traditional debit program in that market, and we are hopeful that it will lead to similar programs with other clients, accelerating the migration towards electronic payments in Japan's traditionally cash-centric economy. And we are partnering with clients and governments and investing in long-term growth in developing markets in Africa, Latin America and South Asia to accelerate efforts to advance financial inclusion and ultimately grow domestic transaction growth. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. We continue to make progress on Visa's next-generation e-commerce and mobile payment solutions announced in May, including a focus on single-click and aliasing capabilities. We believe these elements of the Visa offering will help to differentiate and deliver value to the other NFC-only solutions recently announced. This remains a top priority for the organization, and we are moving full speed ahead towards broad commercial availability. 
As we've said all along, Visa firmly believes an open approach is the key to success in mobile commerce. So in addition to building Visa's own capability, our strategy must also enable Visa payments on third-party platforms. That's why last week, we announced an agreement with Isis to join their consortium and we continue to engage in productive discussions with other potential partners. 
Part of our efforts to make mobile a reality in emerging markets, we completed our acquisition of Fundamo, a leading mobile wallet software provider for emerging markets with over 40 programs in more than 25 countries. I can report that the integration is progressing well and we are now focused on building managed services for issuers and mobile operators around the Fundamo platform. Additionally, we are developing capabilities to overlay a virtual Visa prepaid account on the closed loop accounts managed by Fundamo and other wallet platforms. 
Since our announcement, we have received substantial interest from issuers and mobile operators into Asia and Latin America. We are also taking action to further tap into the creativity and the expertise of the developer community, an increasingly critical participant in the creation and rollout of new payment technology. 
Today, our existing developer center has more than 6,000 active developers using our tools and resources to build Visa payment functionality into websites for mobile applications, which in turn brings more merchants into the Visa network, ultimately driving transactions and payments growth. Additionally, through the center, Visa helps reduce e-commerce transaction risks, which means even more transactions are approved and flow through the network. This makes Visa a more attractive payment network partner. 
To accelerate these efforts, we will launch our expanded Visa developer center in the current quarter, combining our existing PlaySpan and CyberSource developer activities into a single platform while also introducing direct connectivity to VisaNet for the first time. By connecting directly to VisaNet, we can offer our merchant partners and financial institution customers faster and easier access to Visa products and services, making them more competitive and ultimately driving incremental revenue growth. 
On the e-commerce front, CyberSource's business continues to gain traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. We secured a number of new business wins with major merchants, including Twitter and Torno [ph]. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business, as e-commerce growth remains strong in the United States and internationally. 
Finally, we continue to deliver on our long-standing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that our board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This comes on the heels of completing our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in April. At approximately $77 per share, we retired 13.7 million shares in the quarter. This brings our repurchases in fiscal 2011, including escrow funding actions, to $2.8 billion. 
In conclusion, as we reorient the U.S. debit business in the wake of the new regulations, we will simultaneously pursue our growth strategies both at home and abroad. Our commitment to our clients, new product rollouts and ongoing innovation combine to make Visa's value proposition more compelling than ever. And we are prepared to use our comprehensive array of products and functionalities to win in the marketplace. Visa remains a strong, globally-oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,137098293,147547,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations.

Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came f",1489,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means the non-U.S. revenue is now 44% of Visa's total, up from 41% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 6 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of May and June comped at 8% and 12%, respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. We continue to be encouraged by this trend. 
Third, incentives for the quarter as a percent of growth revenue was 16.2%, down from 16.7% in the second quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16.1%, in line with the lower end of our guidance. However, as we stated on our update call on July 6, we expect client incentives for the full fiscal year to be at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range based on the pacing of our contract pipeline and potential Q4 partnership contract that provide merchant incentives aimed at further encouraging Visa routing preference. 
Fourth, as first discussed back in January, we sold our 10% stake in Visa Vale, a Brazilian prepaid issuer. Though we expect to book the gain as investment income in our second quarter, we actually recorded a gain in Q3 once we received the necessary Brazilian regulatory approval. The net benefit to Visa in the quarter was $85 million pretax and $44 million after tax. 
Finally, as we did in the fourth fiscal quarter last year, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, which had a positive noncash impact to our earnings this quarter. The $122 million decrease in the value of the option is nontaxable, is reported in other income and is solely due to decline in Visa's TE ratio relative to historical level. It does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise the put. The put option is now valued on our balance sheet at $145 million. Eliminating this impact provides a cleaner picture of our operating performance, and yields an adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the March and June quarters, as well as the results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollar was 13%, relatively flat from the March quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the June quarter. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 10%, a slight decrease from the 12% growth we saw in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up 2 points from the 15% growth rate in the March quarter. More recently, through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 10%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the third quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth to be higher. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the June quarter, up slightly from a 13% rate in the March quarter. We have seen some rebound in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa, but it is still too early to gauge the longer-term trends. Through July 21, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 18%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 13% growth rate we saw in the March quarter. Through July 21, processed transactions posted growth of 10%. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenue of $2.8 billion was up 14% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the U.S., continued recovery in the U.S. economy, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the March quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. Data processing revenue was $886 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions. 
International transaction revenue was up 15% to $652 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.2% and are running at 16.1% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Total operating expense for the quarter is $977 million, up 10% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were included in Q3 of the prior year. While marketing expense was up, approximately $70 million on a sequential quarter basis, this was due to the timing of planned campaign and is consistent with our full year guidance of less than $900 million. 
In the U.S., we have continued to rightsize our spend, and refine our marketing focus to put greater investment toward digital media. We have also focused on marketing efforts on driving greater cross-border transaction growth. As a reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentations related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activity. Consistent with this announcement, $52 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q3 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q3 fiscal year 2011. In Q3, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the third fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity, and contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Our operating margin for the quarter was 58%, on target with our expectation for the full year. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter and now total $236 million year-to-date. 
Given the pace of our investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives, we now expect our full year 2011 capital spending to be moderately above $300 million. 
On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. For the full year 2011, we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. Full year EPS dilution is also expected to be $0.01. Finally, our recorded tax rate for the period was 35%, including the favorable impact from the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe consumption. Adjusting to exclude the put impact, the tax rate would have been 38%. On an as adjusted basis, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with our guidance. 
As we announced on July 6, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board in April. During the quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to repurchase 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Year-to-date, Visa has spent $2.8 billion to effectively repurchase 37.8 million shares at an average price of $74.12. At the end of the quarter, we had 691 million shares outstanding on an as converted basis. 
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Bill mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan through July 20, 2012, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive, relative to the long-term value of Visa. 
As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given results to date, and to reiterate what we told you on the July 6 call, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Client incentives are expected to come in at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range. And we are now expecting capital expenditures to be moderately above $300 million for the year, up from our prior range of $250 million to $275 million. 
Our net revenue outlook for 2012 stands at high single to low double-digit growth, while earnings per share growth is expected to be at the mid- to high teens range. We will have additional guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 when we report our fourth quarter earning in October. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

Hopefully, we can grow off of what we do in 2012 to 2013.

Let me respond to both questions. With regards to a deeper description of the impact on the 20%, I think the way we've chosen to respond to that for now is related to what we described on our last call that in preparing for a new post-Durbin environment, there are a number of ways this can play out competitively.

This is a very important nuance for investors in the street. I was wondering if you can provide us with a little roadmap of how you see that occurring. I mean, I appreciate the color you gave today on Russia, Brazil and India, but those are going to take some time. So where is the fiscal '13 reacceleration going to come from? And then given that margins are pretty healthy already, could we still expect the same spread between revenue and earnings growth and why?"

So in '12, we are projecting a global payment volume growth off of current trends adjusted for the investments we are making related to our country acceleration strategies. In U.S. debit, in particular, we do expect, as Joe mentioned, a decrease in yield. We expect to lose some routing, weighted more to PIN. We expect some volume shift from Signature to PIN. We expect much of that to play out in '12, therefore becoming part of our base in '12. And so from a revenue standpoint, by the time we run into 2013, we are benefiting from strong growth outside the United States that is accelerated, based on investments we are making in a number of key markets, to amplify the growth in those markets, and with post-Durbin impacts substantially embedded in the 2012 base, with our strategies in place and gaining more traction with each passing quarter. That is the underpinning of why we would expect to see revenue begin regaining momentum in '13."

U.S. guys debit payment volume growth decelerated by a couple of points from March to June. And I guess I'm wondering if Durbin potentially had a disrupted impact at all in your opinion on the debit volume growth. And then the meatier question is really about how do you expect your debit competitors might react to the altered debit pricing structure that you're rolling out? It seems desirable to avoid price-based competition, but it seems price-based competition is now somewhat of a certainty given that the other competitors are likely to respond to your altered structure. So do you expect the other networks to be more aggressive on pricing? And to the extent that they are, are you prepared to do something with your financials to try to buffer the impact, such as cutting advertising expenses, or something along those lines? Can you just give us an idea, because I know you run multiple scenarios on how competitors might react. But if those worser scenarios play out, where pricing competition gets more aggressive on a more aggressive side, you have a kind of a plan b to buffer the impact."

38043467,141075551,178578,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for",2493,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.27, an increase of 34% on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, our adjusted figures exclude the reevaluation of the Visa Europe put option in the prior-year.
Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by strong payments volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spent worldwide.
Net operating revenue growth for the quarter was impacted in part by a strategic decision to increase client incentives, as Visa aggressively pursued routing decisions from U.S. merchants and acquirers. These deals, most of which are 1 time in nature, were the primary reason we modestly exceeded our annual incentive guidance of 16.5%.
Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue was a record $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over 2010. Adjusted net income for the full year was $3.5 billion, a 22% increase over the prior-year. Full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $4.99, 28% of that of last year. 
While Byron will get into more specifics on fiscal 2012, we are continuing to commit to our guidance provided in July of high single to low double-digit revenue growth and mid to high teens earnings-per-share growth. This takes into account only modest global economic growth as well as anticipated industry reaction to the debit regulation.
Given our outlook for continued growth, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, Visa repurchased $423 million worth of our stock at an average price of $80.87. 
Last week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion, bringing our current repurchase authorization to almost $1.6 billion.
And as reported last week, our Board raised our dividend 47% over last year's rate at $0.88 per share on an annualized basis.
Visa is fundamentally committed to growth by expanding our core debit, credit prepaid and commercial businesses, which offer tremendous potential to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth and to deliver greater value to our financial institutions and merchant clients. The goal is to grow the number of users, acceptance locations and ways to use Visa products.
All of our priorities and investments focus on expanding that core well into the future. This includes applying both the businesses we've recently acquired, which are generating revenue growth today as discrete entities, as well as the innovative technologies we're developing in-house.
Importantly, our core business is performing well today. Worldwide Visa delivered strong growth in the September quarter, with credit and debit payment volumes growing 13% and 14% respectively.
Cross-border volumes also posted healthy gains percent. 
As I review highlights for the quarter, let's first turn our attention to the United States. To help drive future growth, Visa finalized several deals with financial institutions over the past quarter. These include an extension of our long-term credit and debit issues agreement with PNC Bank, the long-term brand agreements with the Independent Community Bankers Association, and card services for creditors. In all cases, I firmly believe Visa's extensive industry expertise and experience were critical differentiating factors that helped secure these important wins.
We also continue to win important co-brand deals with valued partners. This includes a new agreement with William Sonoma, as well as of the Marathon Oil co-brand mandate, which is a conversion from 1 of our largest competitors. These build on our momentum from the United Continental Holdings Agreements announced last quarter.
On the acceptance front, our ongoing strategic initiative to expand merchant acceptance is yielding important benefits. For the 12 months ended June 30, the most recent date we have available, Visa expanded U.S. acceptance by 400,000 merchants acceptance locations. And now, we are building on that. Beginning next month, me and Marcus will accept Visa in all of their stores building upon their long-standing acceptance of Visa products worldwide.
Of course, we are moving forward on several fronts to implement our revolving debit strategies for the newly regulated U.S. market. These activities are progressing well and quickly as we address the needs of both our merchants and issuers. Our first set of activities focuses on winning merchant preference period as a reminder, U.S. debit revenue impacted by the regulation contributes approximately 20% of Visa's total revenue today. Of that, signature debit contributes more than 75% the U.S. debit revenue and we are confident in our ability to retain the overwhelming majority of that as we move forward in the newly regulated environment.
However, to address the pockets of debit revenue at risk, as a result of the regulation, particularly revenues related to debit, we are moving forward quickly with a program to end sent routing decisions. In fact, between the start of the fourth quarter today, Visa completed dozens of merchant deals and executed contracts with a handful of our largest acquirers. 
As I noted by expanding our incentive program to the merchant community, we increased our client incentives for the most recent quarter. Byron will provide additional context, but I wanted to be clear that I view these merchant sentiment agreements as a critical aspect of Visa's business building strategy in this environment. These are investments that create strong and productive relationships with our merchant client. 
We're also moving forward with our modified debit economics, including the implementation of our network participation date and the reduction of variable acquiring fees on debt, Visa debit and something. As stated last quarter, we believe this offers merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction costs.
As for details, we anticipate providing the specific pricing information to merchants and acquirers in January, which will go into effect on April 1. As a result, we will begin to recognize the related revenue impacting in our fiscal third quarter of 2012 period
At the same time, we are intensely focused on maintaining and expanding debit issuance through a strong partnerships with financial institution clients. I have been clear since the FED debit rules were finalized, the new legal requirements will likely result in a portion of transactions being moved away from Interlink as issuers take action to comply with regulation.
Specifically, in limited cases, this may very well result in the removal of Interlink from the card and migration to a competing network. These changes to the markets are incorporated in our guidance.
A key part of our strategy positions Visa to compete for every transaction on a Visa-branded debit card. To that and, earlier this year, we reminded clients that Visa check cards are enabled for PIN authentication. While merchant acquirers have historically used signature authentication for check cards, in the overwhelming majority of circumstances, Visa is fully capable of facilitating both signature and PIN debit transactions over 1 network: VisaNet. This is an important competitive advantage and differentiator in the new environment period
Bottom line. As a long-term leader in debit, I'm confident Visa offers issuers a differentiated suite of debit products, a robust processing platform and economics that will help clients optimize their growth.
Turning our attention to outside the United States, we are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international markets by 2015. 
In fact, our international businesses grew 19% in the fourth quarter, driving 65% of Visa's overall revenue growth. 
Each market is distinct and requires a unique approach to drive local growth. But much like the United States, the overwhelming majority of near-term revenue growth will come from expanding Visa's core businesses, including affluent debit, credit and process.
For 1 example, let's turn our attention to Latin America where our core fundamentals are incredibly strong and Visa has increased share in each of the past five years. That is bulk share versus cash and checks and share versus our traditional network competition. 
And we are building on that momentum. In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bank, to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.
In Brazil, we strengthened our partnership with Bronco Rhona Bento to provide Visa processing services on prepaid products in the country. We are also engaged in productive discussion with other Brazilian clients and hope to soon announce some important transactions. 
Our Asia-Pacific region also continues to deliver very strong growth with payments volume growing by 17% for the most recent quarter. And to drive future growth in the region, we signed several important agreements with key clients. 
For example, in Australia, we secured an important agreement with Westpick Banking Group for expanded prepaid processing services. On the merchant front, we established acceptance for Visa prepaid products at something group, the largest retailer in Australia, a critical step towards bringing prepaid into the financial mainstream in that country.
Lastly, let's talk about innovation. We are aggressively stepping up investment in new technologies that will increase transactions with our core business platforms and add incremental value to the merchant unity and create a new revenue opportunities for both fees and our clients. 
As technology, and thus the physical and digital shopping worlds converge, Visa is building its platforms in anticipation of a broad global adoption of next-generation payment technology, including e-commerce, mobile payments and information products. 
Over the past 18 months, we've enhanced our position by assembling what we believe are the best assets of the business, including CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Each of these are discrete businesses driving revenue growth today and arm Visa with best in class technology and capabilities to quickly bring emerging products to market.
Combined with Visa technology, global reach and proven reliability and security, these new assets will enable Visa to capture significant new revenue opportunities by providing the backbone for our next-generation offerings in the U.S. and globally. 
When it comes to next-generation products, everybody is talking digital wallet. As a reminder, you don't transact with a wallet, whether it's leather or digital. You transact with what's stored in that wallet. And we have spent decades successfully placing nearly 2 billion visa cards and cardholders' wallets.
And today, when most people talk about digital wallets, they're talking about NFC payment on a mobile phone. And in that regard, no company is doing more than visa to set the stage for broad adoption. Visa suite of wallet solutions include Click to Buy, Touch to Buy and Tap to Buy, which embrace e-commerce transactions, mobile commerce transactions and transactions at the physical point-of-sale using NFC chips. Our top priority is making the act of purchasing online or on a mobile device as convenient as when you use your plastic card, benefiting both consumers and merchants.
Today, 46% of all e-commerce transactions are conducted with a Visa product and I'm confident Visa is positioned for continued leadership in this category.
To that end, we will soon begin rolling out a superior and simple online shopping experience through a Click to Buy payment capability which will be available on mobile devices and at home in your computer. Our Click to Buy and Touch to Buy functionality include aliasing capabilities requiring only a username and a password at checkout. This increases ease-of-use and customer convenience while maintaining the highest levels of security for Visa cardholder accounts. 
Rollout of our Click to Buy functionality begins in November with pilot programs and integration with merchants. Following that, we will introduce subsequent releases in the first quarter of calendar year 2012, expanding functionality to include loyalty programs and the like over the following months.
In parallel, we are committed to consumer choice and developing partnerships to ensure that core Visa products can be used easily no matter which wallet a consumer chooses to use. Our recent agreements to license PayWave technology to Google Wallet and Isus are 2 prominent examples and we are actively engaged with other leading players in the social networking, mobile e-commerce and related industries.
Another import element of our innovation strategy is creating new offerings that deliver differentiated value with the tremendous data that Visa generates. 
Our scale and reach provide the most compelling transaction information in the world, and we will use this data to strategically grow our business. 
We use that advantage today in applying aggregated anonymous data to power our advanced authorization service which has helped to drive fraud rates to the worst level in years. And now we plan to extend that capability to drive even more value to consumers as well as merchants.
Let me be clear that we are 100% committed to maintaining the highest standard of security and privacy with this information. And of course, account-specific information will only be used with direct consumer promotion.
One example of what Visa can do with the information products is our realtime messaging service, which brings benefits of the virtual world to the point of sale. We are building sales momentum, and now have 14 major merchants under contract representing 68 brands across a wide range of verticals. 
We are exploring ways in which this platform can be leveraged to enhance issuers' relationship with their cardholders. 
Prominent partners signed during the fourth quarter include United Mileage Plus, Nordstrom's Guess and Pepco and we are working towards more deals in the near-term. I strongly believe this transaction in the market is a testament to the effectiveness of this product in enhancing the value proposition these offers to merchants by helping to drive their customer loyalty and sales while also in sending routing decisions for the future.
Outside the U.S., we are investing in innovative mobile money solutions in both developed and emerging markets, recognizing the different geographies required specifically tailored. An important key to our efforts is Fundamo, the global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets. Fundamo has a track record of more than 50 successful client the planets in 40 countries and putting 27 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East and is in the process of integrating its mobile money services platform VisaNet and an array of Visa products and services. I look forward to providing some important updates on our progress in the coming months.
So to sum it up, I think the examples showcased by today highlights how Visa is building off our strong foundation and moving ahead both in the U.S. and around the world. We are harnessing our strong core businesses, our competitive differentiators and our ongoing focus on new technologies to position Visa for revenue growth and as a leader for the payments industry well into the future. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,141075551,178578,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observation. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad-based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in the rest of the world. Approxima",1703,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observation. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad-based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in the rest of the world. Approximately 65% of the quarters revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 45% of Visa's total.
Second, U.S. revenue growth is been supported by 7 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of August and September comped 11% respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. While encouraging, much of this volume over the past year has been driven by affluent cardholders. As we enter fiscal 2012, it is worth noting that we have not yet seen any discernible broadening of the U.S. credit spending base beyond this affluent income group.
Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 19.5%, resulting in a full-year incentive level of 17%, slightly ahead of our full fiscal year expectation.
Two, incentive call outs. First, on the issue inside. asked telegraphing our last earnings call, a disproportionate number of our contracts got signed in Q4. Second, on the acceptance side, we experienced greater success than anticipated in the signing of partnership contracts with merchants and acquirers. 
Finally, operating expenses for the quarter were 2% above the prior year while on a fiscal year basis, they were up 7 percent. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of previously unplanned restructuring expenses, close of 1/2 of which were the result of the decommissioning of our London office. 
The majority of these sessions will be relocated to other countries, placing them closer to the clients we serve, and of course, we also encourage incremental expenses associated with acquisitions PlaySpan and Fundamo. 
Excluding the restructuring and acquisition-related cost, expense growth this fiscal year was in line with our expectations for heightened investment spending to support our core businesses, our e-commerce and mobile initiatives as well as the growth of our services business internationally. 
Now, let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for both the June and September quarters as well as results through October 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth-quarter followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13% relatively flat from the June quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the September quarter. In the U.S, payment volume growth was 9%, a slight decrease from the 10% growth we saw in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on constant dollar basis grew 18%, unchanged from the June quarter. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 9%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw in the quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 15% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the September quarter up slightly from a 14% rate in the June quarter period we continue this year recovering inbound travel in Japan in the Middle East, North Africa and the longer-term trend absent an economic downturn, appears to be back on track. Through October 31, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 13%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior-year period and modestly behind the 11% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. 
Through October 31, process transactions posted growth of 8%. 
Now turning to the statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year driven by strong growth in regions outside of the United States, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, net revenues were $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. The foreign-exchange impact on net revenue was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed 2 percentage points of growth in Q4 and on a full-year basis.
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior-year. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the June quarter as well as previously enacted strategic pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $925 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter and based on strong transaction growth rates for both visa process and CyberSource transactions. 
On that note, CyberSource posted a 31% gain on transaction over the prior years quarter and 36% growth for the full fiscal year. 
International transaction revenue was up 23% to $758 million, reflecting continued strength across in cross-border volumes, strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States and above-average currency volatility during the period.
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the full year came in at 17%, slightly ahead of guidance but fully consistent with our strategy to incense U.S. merchants and acquirers to choose Visa when routing signature and PIN debit transactions.
Total operating expense for the quarter was $1 billion, up 2% from the prior-year period. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, for which the latter 2 were not included in Q4 if the prior year for the full fiscal year 2011, expenses totaled $3.7 million, a 7% increase over the 2010.
As a final reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expenses associated with certain pass-through activity. Consistent with this announcement, $45 million of revenue and expense which were booked in Q4 fiscal year 2010 did not recur in Q4 fiscal year 2011. 
In the current quarter, this represented 2 percentage points of revenue growth. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 57% after absorbing 120 basis points of impact from 1 time restructuring charges. Our full fiscal year operating margin was 59% in line with our yearly guidance. Capital expenditures were $117 million in the quarter, and totaled $353 million for the year. This was on target with last quarter's revised guidance.
On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 for the fourth quarter and $0.03 for the full year. The Fundamo acquisition was EPS dilutive $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 for the full-year.
Finally, our reported GAAP tax rate for the Q4 was 35% and 35.5% for the full year. Adjusting to exclude the beneficial impact of the put revaluation last quarter, the tax rate would've been 36.3% for the fiscal year consistent with our guidance.
As Joe mentioned, we were buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing 5.2 million shares at an average price of $80.87.
For the full fiscal year, Visa spent $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43 million shares at an average price of $74.94. Inclusive of dividend payments, we returned over $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2011.
At the end of the quarter, we had 687 million shares outstanding on an as converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled $692 million. Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, Joe mentioned on the outset our board of directors authorized a $1 million increased our existing share repurchase plan. Our current open to buy now stands at approximately $1.6 billion.
As has been our practice, we will execute trades at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. We also raised our annual dividend 47% to $0.88 per share, which represents a pay-out ratio of about 17% on 2011 adjusted earnings.
Finally, our guidance for fiscal 2012. Last quarter, we communicated to you our expectation for revenue and earnings. As Joe said at the outset, we remain comfortable with that initial look. Net revenue growth in the high single to low double digit range and diluted EPS growth in the mid to high teens.
Client incentives are expected to range from 17% to 18% of growth such as gross revenues, the modest up big over fiscal 2011 is driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the United States in combination with the incentive contracts for large merchants aimed at influencing routing decisions for Visa debit transactions.
Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion, while somewhat higher than the past 2 years, it is reflective of incremental investments to support our key country growth strategies. Our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions as well as some modest incremental spend associated with Visa's sponsorship of the summer Olympics games.
Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The cash tax rate is expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. This reduction anticipates a change in the formula for calculating our state tax rate as well as our initial filing for foreign tax credit. 
Since this lower tax rate is expected to be ongoing, it will likely result in a revaluation of our deferred tax liability. This 1 time non-cash adjustment may reduce Visa's tax rate an additional 1 to 2 percentage points for the year. However, to be clear, our adjusted earnings per share growth target for 2012 assumes a 33% to 34% cash rate.
Capital expenditures are projected to range from $350 million to $400 million. This represents a modest increase over the $353 million we spent in 2011 and fully funds investments we're making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiative.
Finally, we expect free cash flow above $4 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same. First, reinvesting in the business. Second, appropriate acquisition. And third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
As the fiscal 2013 guidance, as we previously stated in July, we expect an acceleration of revenue and EPS of 2012 levels.
We will provide additional clarity around 2013 as we approach the beginning of that fiscal year. 
And with that operator, we are ready to take questions."

As we begin to grow and penetrate outside the United States, remember, the first areas that are penetrated tend to be cross-volume, cross-border types of transactions. So the yields there, early in the development curve, are much higher. As we begin to penetrate more and more domestic payment volume of countries outside the United States, domestic comes with less international. And therefore, the yields frankly in any country including the United States will naturally move down as domestic picks up a bigger piece of the payment volume. And then there's 1 final dynamic, which is actually important to understanding how our incentives behave in 2012, which is when we originally went public, the notion of having multi-year contracts was primarily a U.S. phenomenon. What has happened over time is that we have pursued a deliberate strategy of entering into multi-year contracts with our major clients. As we have pursued that aggressively outside the United States, the quick pro-quote for a multi-year contract is incentives. So as we put more, as our volumes build overseas, as more and more of our clients are under multi-year contract, our incentives will just naturally rise which then has an impact on yield. So to sum, the most important element as Joe said we have a much higher degree of processing penetration in the U.S. Outside the U.S. because of that, it tends to be lower. But we pursue the strategies that optimize the growth of our revenue and it is revenue measured in dollars we saw for, not yield."

And then as you may recall from my earnings commentary today and really over the past several quarters, this is a credit recovery that is plainly in the U.S. affluent German.

38043467,141075551,178811,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for",2489,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.27, an increase of 34% on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, our adjusted figures exclude the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in the prior year.
Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by strong payments volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spent worldwide. Net operating revenue growth for the quarter was impacted in part by a strategic decision to increase client incentives, as Visa aggressively pursued routing decisions from U.S. merchants and acquirers. These deals, most of which are onetime in nature, were the primary reason we modestly exceeded our annual incentive guidance of 16.5%.
Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue was a record $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over 2010. Adjusted net income for the full year was $3.5 billion, a 22% increase over the prior year. full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $4.99, 28% add of last year. 
While Byron will get into more specifics on fiscal 2012, we are continuing to commit to our guidance provided in July of high-single to low double-digit revenue growth and mid to high-teens earnings per share growth. This takes into account only modest of global economic growth as well as anticipated industry reaction to the debit regulation.
Given our outlook for continued growth, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, Visa repurchased $423 million worth of our stock at an average price of $80.87. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion, bringing our current repurchase authorization to almost $1.6 billion. And as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 47% over last year's rate at $0.88 per share on an annualized basis.
Visa is fundamentally committed to driving growth by expanding our core debit, credit, prepaid and commercial businesses, which offer tremendous potential to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth and to deliver greater value to our financial institution and merchant clients. The goal is to grow the number of users, acceptance locations and ways to use Visa products.
All of our priorities and investments focus on expanding that core well into the future. This includes applying both the businesses we've recently acquired, which are generating revenue growth today as discrete entities, as well as the innovative technologies we're developing in-house.
Importantly, our core business is performing well today. Worldwide Visa delivered strong growth in the September quarter, with credit and debit payment volumes growing 14% and 13%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains increase in 15%. 
As I review highlights for the quarter, let's first turn our attention to the United States. To help drive future growth, Visa finalized several deals with financial institutions over the past quarter. These include an extension of our long-term credit and debit issuance agreement with PNC Bank and long-term brand agreements with the Independent Community Bankers Association and card services for credit units. In all cases, I firmly believe Visa's extensive industry expertise and experience were critical differentiating factors that helped secure these important wins.
We also continue to win important co-brand deals with valued partners. This includes a new agreement with Williams-Sonoma, as well as the Marathon Oil co-brand mandate, which is a conversion from one of our largest competitors. These build on our momentum from the United Continental Holdings agreements announced last quarter.
On the acceptance front, our ongoing strategic initiative to expand merchant acceptance is yielding important benefits. For the 12 months ended June 30, the most recent date we have available, Visa expanded U.S. acceptance by 400,000 merchant acceptance locations. And now, we are building on that. Beginning next month, The Neiman Marcus will accept Visa in all of their stores, building upon their long-standing acceptance of Visa products online.
Of course, we are moving forward on several fronts to implement our revolving debit strategies for the newly regulated U.S. market. These activities are progressing well and quickly, as we address the needs of both merchants and issuers. Our first set of activities focuses on winning merchant preference. 
As a reminder, U.S. debit revenue impacted by the regulation contributes approximately 20% of Visa's total revenue today. Of that, signature debit contributes more than 75% of the U.S. debit revenue, and we are confident in our ability to retain the overwhelming majority of that as we move forward in the newly regulated environment.
However, to address the pockets of debit revenue at risk as a result of the regulation, particularly revenues related to pin debit, we are moving forward quickly with a program to incent routing decisions. In fact, between the start of the fourth quarter today, Visa completed dozens of merchant deals and executed contracts with a handful of our largest acquirers. 
As I noted, by expanding our incentive program to the merchant community, we increased our client incent assign for the most recent quarter. Byron will provide additional context, but I want it to be clear that our view of these merchant incentive agreements is a critical aspect of Visa's business-building strategy in this environment. These are investments that create strong and productive relationships with our merchant client. 
We're also moving forward with our modified debit economics, including the implementation of our network participation fee date and the reduction of variable acquiring fees on debt, Visa debit and Interlink. As stated last quarter, we believe this offers merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per-unit transaction costs.
As for details, we anticipate providing the specific pricing information to merchants and acquirers in January, which will go into effect on April 1. As a result, we will begin to recognize the related revenue impacting in our fiscal third quarter of 2012. 
At the same time, we are intensely focused on maintaining and expanding debit issuance through a strong partnerships with financial institution client. I've been clear since the Fed debit rules were finalized, the new legal requirements will likely result in a portion of transactions being moved away from Interlink as issuers take action to comply with the regulation. Specifically, in limited cases, this may very well result in the removal of Interlink from the card and migration to a competing network. These changes to the markets are incorporated in our guidance.
A key part of our strategy positions Visa to compete for every transaction on a Visa-branded debit card. To that end, earlier this year, we reminded clients that Visa check cards are enabled for PIN authentication. While merchant acquirers have historically used signature authentication for check cards, in the overwhelming majority of circumstances, Visa is fully capable of facilitating both signature and PIN debit transactions over one network, VisaNet. This is an important competitive advantage and differentiator in the new environment.
Bottom line. As a long-term leader in debit, I'm confident Visa offers issuers a differentiated suite of debit products, a robust processing platform and economics that will help clients optimize their growth.
Turning our attention to outside the United States, we are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international markets by 2015. In fact, our international businesses grew 19% in the fourth quarter, driving 65% of Visa's overall revenue growth. 
Each market is distinct and requires a unique approach to drive local growth. But much like the United States, the overwhelming majority of near-term revenue growth will come from expanding Visa's core businesses, including affluent credit, debit and processing.
For one example, let's turn our attention to Latin America, where our core fundamentals are incredibly strong, and Visa has increased share in each of the past 5 years, that is, bulk share versus cash and checks and share versus our traditional network competition. 
And we are building on that momentum. In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.
In Brazil, we strengthened our partnership with Banco Rendimento to provide Visa processing services on prepaid products in the country. We are also engaged in productive discussions with other Brazilian clients and hope to soon announce some important transactions. 
Our Asia Pacific region also continues to deliver very strong growth, with payments volume growing by 17% for the most recent quarter. And to drive future growth in the region, we signed several important agreements with key clients. 
For example, in Australia, we secured an important agreement with Westpac Banking Group for expanded prepaid processing services. On the merchant front, we established acceptance for Visa prepaid products at Woolworths Group, the largest retailer in Australia, a critical step towards bringing prepaid into the financial mainstream in that country.
Lastly, let's talk about innovation. We are aggressively stepping up investment in new technologies that will increase transactions on our core business platforms and add incremental value to the merchant community and create a new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients. As technology and thus with physical and digital shopping worlds converge, Visa is building its platforms in anticipation of a broad global adoption of next-generation payment technologies, including e-commerce and mobile payments and information products. 
Over the past 18 months, we've enhanced our position by assembling what we believe are the best assets in the business, including CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Each of these are discrete businesses driving revenue growth today and arm Visa with best-in-class technology and capabilities to quickly bring emerging products to market. Combined with Visa technology, global reach and proven reliability and security, these new assets will enable Visa to capture significant new revenue opportunities by providing the backbone for our next-generation offerings in the U.S. and globally. 
When it comes to next-generation products, everyone is talking digital wallet. As a reminder, you don't transact with a wallet, whether it's leather or digital. You transact with what's stored in that wallet. And we have spent decades successfully placing nearly 2 billion Visa cards in cardholders' wallets.
And today, when most people talk about digital wallets, they're talking about NFC payment on mobile phone, and in that regard, no company is doing more than Visa to set the stage for broad adoption. Visa's suite of wallet solutions include Click-to-buy, touch to buy and tap to buy, which embrace e-commerce transactions, mobile commerce transactions and transactions at the physical point-of-sale using NFC chips. Our top priority is making the act of purchasing online or on-a-mobile device as convenient as when you use your plastic cards, benefiting both consumers and merchants. 
Today, 46% of all e-commerce transactions are conducted with a Visa product, and I'm confident Visa is positioned for continued leadership in this category. To that end, we will soon begin rolling out a superior and simple online shopping experience through a Click-to-buy payment capability, which will be available on mobile devices and at home on your computer. 
Our Click-to-buy and touch to buy functionality includes aliasing capabilities requiring only a user name and a password at checkout. This increases ease of use and customer convenience, while maintaining the highest levels of security for Visa cardholder accounts. 
Rollout of our Click-to-buy functionality begins in November with pilot programs and integration with merchants. Following that, we will introduce subsequent releases in the first quarter of calendar year 2012, expanding functionality to include loyalty programs and the like over the following months.
In parallel, we are committed to consumer choice and developing partnerships to ensure that core Visa products can be used easily no matter which wallet a consumer chooses to use. Our recent agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with other leading players in the social networking, mobile e-commerce and related industries.
Another import element of our innovation strategy is creating new offerings that deliver differentiated value with the tremendous data that Visa generates. Our scale and reach provide the most compelling transaction information available in the world, and we will use this data to strategically grow our business. 
We use that advantage today in applying aggregated anonymous data to power our advanced authorization service, which has helped to drive fraud rates to the lowest level in years. And now we intend to extend that capability to drive even more value to consumers as well as merchants. Let me be clear that we are 100% committed to maintaining the highest standard of security and privacy with this information. And of course, account-specific information will only be used with direct consumer permission.
One example of what Visa can do with the information products is our real-time messaging service, which brings benefits of the virtual world to the point of sale. We are building sales momentum, and now have 14 major merchants under contract representing 68 brands across a wide range of verticals. We are exploring ways in which this platform can be leveraged to enhance issuers' relationship with their cardholders. 
Prominent partners signed during the fourth quarter include United MileagePlus, Nordstrom's Guess and Pepco, and we are working towards more deals in the near term. I strongly believe this transaction in the market is a testament to the effectiveness of this product in enhancing the value proposition these offers to merchants by helping to drive their customer loyalty and sales, while also in sending routing decisions for the Visa network.
Outside the U.S., we are investing in innovative mobile money solutions in both developed and emerging markets, recognizing the different geographies require specifically tailored. An important key to our efforts is Fundamo, the global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing market. Fundamo has a track record of more than 50 successful client deployments in 40 countries including 27 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East and is in the process of integrating its mobile money services platform with VisaNet in an array of Visa products and services. I look forward to providing some important updates on our progress in the coming months.
So to sum it up, I think the examples showcased by today highlight how Visa is building off of our strong foundation and moving ahead both in the U.S. and around the world. We are harnessing our strong core businesses, our competitive differentiators and our ongoing focus on new technologies to position Visa for revenue growth and as a leader of the payments industry well into the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,141075551,178811,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in Rest of World. Approximately 65",1706,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in Rest of World. Approximately 65% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 45% of Visa's total.
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 7 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of August and September comped at 11% respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. While encouraging, much of this volume over the past year has been driven by affluent cardholders. As we enter fiscal 2012, it is worth noting that we have not yet seen any discernible broadening of the U.S. credit spending base beyond this affluent income group.
Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19.5%, resulting in a full year incentive level of 17%, slightly ahead of our full fiscal year expectation.
Two incentive callouts. First, on the issuing side. As telegraphed on our last earnings call, a disproportionate number of our contracts got signed in Q4. Second, on the acceptance side, we experienced greater success than anticipated in the signing of partnership contracts with merchants and acquirers. 
Finally, operating expenses for the quarter were 2% above the prior year, while on a fiscal year basis, they were up 7%. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of previously unplanned restructuring expenses, close to 1/2 of which were the result of the decommissioning of our London office. The majority of these positions will be relocated to other countries, placing them closer to the clients we serve. And of course, we also incurred incremental expenses associated with the acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo. 
Excluding the restructuring and acquisition-related cost, expense growth this fiscal year was in-line with our expectations for heightened investment spending to support our core businesses, our e-commerce and mobile initiatives, as well as the growth of our service worth's business internationally. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for both the June and September quarters, as well as results through October 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13%, relatively flat from the June quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the September quarter: In the U.S, payment volume growth was 9%, a slight decrease from the 10% growth we saw in the June quarter; Rest of World payment volume, on a constant-dollar basis grew at 18%, unchanged from the June quarter. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 9%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 15% growth rate on a constant-dollar basis in the September quarter, up slightly from a 14% rate in the June quarter. We continue to see a recovery in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East, in North Africa and the longer-term trend, absent an economic downturn, appears to be back on track. Through October 21, cross-border volumes on a constant-dollar basis grew 13%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior-year period and modestly behind the 11% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Through October 21, process transactions posted growth of 8%. 
Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the United States, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, net revenues were $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed 2 percentage points of growth in Q4 and on a full year basis.
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior-year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, as well as previously enacted strategic pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $925 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter and based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. On that note, CyberSource posted a 31% gain in transaction over the prior year's quarter and 36% growth for the full fiscal year. 
International transaction revenue was up 23% to $758 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States and above-average currency volatility during the period. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the full year came in at 17%, slightly ahead of a guidance, but fully consistent with our strategy to incent U.S. merchants and acquirers to choose Visa when routing signature and PIN debit transactions.
Total operating expense for the quarter was $1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, of which the latter 2 were not included in Q4 of the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2011, expenses totaled $3.7 million, a 7% increase over the 2010 period.
As a final reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expenses associated with certain pass-through activities. Consistent with this announcement, $45 million of revenue and expense, which were booked in Q4 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q4 fiscal year 2011. In the current quarter, this represented 2 percentage points of revenue growth. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 57% after absorbing 120 basis points of impact from onetime restructuring charges. Our full fiscal year operating margin was 59%, in-line with our yearly guidance. Capital expenditures were $117 million in the quarter and totaled $353 million for the year. This was on target with last quarter's revised guidance.
On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 for the fourth quarter and $0.03 for the full year. The Fundamo acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 for the full year.
Finally, our recorded GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 35% and 35.5% for the full year. Adjusting to exclude the beneficial impact of the put revaluation last quarter, the tax rate would have been 36.3% for the fiscal year, consistent with our guidance.
As Joe mentioned, we were buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing 5.2 million shares at an average price of $80.87. For the full fiscal year, Visa spent $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43 million shares at an average price at $74.94. Inclusive of dividend payments, we returned over $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2011.
At the end of the quarter, we had 687 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 692 million. 
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to our existing share repurchase plan. Our current open to buy now stands at approximately $1.6 billion.
As has been our practice, we will execute trades at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. We also raised our annual dividend 47% to $0.88 per share, which represents a payout ratio of about 17% on 2011 adjusted earnings.
Finally, our guidance for fiscal 2012. Last quarter, we communicated to you our expectation for revenue and earnings. As Joe said at the outset, we remain comfortable with that initial look. Net revenue growth in the high single to low double-digit range and diluted EPS growth in the mid to high teens.
Client incentives are expected to range from 17% to 18% of gross revenues. The modest uptick over fiscal 2011 is driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the United States, in combination with incentive contracts with large merchants aimed at influencing routing decisions for Visa debit transactions.
Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion, while somewhat higher than the past 2 years, it is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions as well as some modest incremental spend associated with Visa's sponsorship of the summer Olympic game.
Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The cash tax rate is expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. This reduction anticipates a change in the formula for calculating our state tax rate, as well as our initial filing for foreign tax credit. 
Since this lower tax rate is expected to be ongoing, it will likely result in a revaluation of our deferred tax liability. This onetime non-cash adjustment may reduce Visa's tax rate an additional 1 to 2 percentage points for the year. However, to be clear, our adjusted earnings per share growth target for 2012 assumes a 33% to 34% cash rate.
Capital expenditures are projected to range from $350 million to $400 million. This represents a modest increase over the $353 million we spent in 2011 and fully funds investments we're making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiative.
Finally, we expect free cash flow above $4 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. As the fiscal 2013 guidance, as we previously stated in July, we expect an acceleration of revenue and EPS of 2012 levels.
We will provide additional clarity around 2013 as we approach the beginning of that fiscal year. And with that operator, we are ready to take questions."

As we begin to grow and penetrate outside the United States, remember, the first areas that are penetrated tend to be cross-volume, cross-border types of transactions. So the yields there, early in the development curve, are much higher. As we begin to penetrate more and more domestic payment volume of countries outside the United States, domestic comes with less international. And therefore, the yields, frankly, in any country, including the United States, will naturally move down as domestic picks up a bigger piece of the payment volume. And then there's one final dynamic, which is actually important to understanding how our incentives behave in 2012, which is, when we originally went public, the notion of having multi-year contracts was primarily a U.S. phenomenon. What has happened over time is that we have pursued a deliberate strategy of entering into multi-year contracts with our major clients. As we have pursued that aggressively outside the United States, the quick pro quo for a multi-year contract is incentives. So as we put more, as our volumes build overseas, as more and more of our clients are under multi-year contract, our incentives will just naturally rise, which then has an impact on yield. So to sum, the most important element is what Joe said, we have a much higher degree of processing penetration in the U.S. outside the U.S. Because of that, it tends to be lower. But we pursue the strategies that optimize the growth of our revenue, and it is revenue measured in dollars we saw for, not yield."

It has gradually moved up, so that now, for the quarter just ended, it's 10%, 10% in October. And so for us, this is been a gradual return to credit. It's been a sustained but very modestly paced built. And then, as you may recall from my earnings commentary today and really over the past several quarters, this is a credit recovery that is primarily in the U.S. affluent driven.

And then secondly, to the extent that, that trend continues, do you feel like your business and your strategy going forward is such that you can drive incremental revenue growth, I think from a greater standpoint from increasing prices, throughout the year as opposed to just kind of a secular volume growth?"

We're not looking to drive any material top line revenue growth from pricing, recognizing that when we talk about pricing, that's pricing net of incentives. So it's one thing to adjust your pricing at the top level. But in the end, it's your net pricing that really matters. And so, it is primarily secular growth, which is one of the reasons why we continue to emphasize how much growth we are now delivering outside the United States. And in the quarter just ended, 65% of our growth, our revenue growth, came from outside the United States. And in the fourth quarter, 45% of our entire revenue base is now outside the United States. And as you know, we have an objective to drive that over 50%, and that is absolutely secular growth. With regards to the process transaction growth, that is primarily attributable to 2 things: one, a slowing in the growth rate of U.S. debit; and then second, a year ago, we began -- we had some significant increases in transaction penetration outside the United States, which are now beginning to anniversary. And so, where we are today and that drift down into high single digits, in terms of Visa process transactions, is primarily influenced by those 2 factors for the moment. But we are very focused in our future strategies at increasing Visa process transactions, increasing the percent of transactions, particularly outside the United States, that Visa processes as a function of the total transactions that are performed on Visa cards. And that's where we stand."

Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for",2484,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.27, an increase of 34% on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, our adjusted figures exclude the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in the prior year.
Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by strong payments volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Net operating revenue growth for the quarter was impacted in part by a strategic decision to increase client incentives, as Visa aggressively pursued routing decisions from U.S. merchants and acquirers. These deals, most of which are onetime in nature, were the primary reason we modestly exceeded our annual incentive guidance of 16.5%.
Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue was a record $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over 2010. Adjusted net income for the full year was $3.5 billion, a 22% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $4.99, 28% ahead of last year. 
While Byron will get into more specifics on fiscal 2012, we are continuing to commit to our guidance provided in July of high-single to low double-digit revenue growth and mid to high-teens earnings per share growth. This takes into account only modest of global economic growth as well as anticipated industry reaction to the debit regulation.
Given our outlook for continued growth, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, Visa repurchased $423 million worth of our stock at an average price of $80.87. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion, bringing our current repurchase authorization to almost $1.6 billion. And as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 47% over last year's rate to $0.88 per share on an annualized basis.
Visa is fundamentally committed to driving growth by expanding our core debit, credit, prepaid and commercial businesses, which offer tremendous potential to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth and to deliver greater value to our financial institution and merchant clients. The goal is to grow the number of users, acceptance locations and ways to use Visa products.
All of our priorities and investments focus on expanding that core well into the future. This includes applying both the businesses we've recently acquired, which are generating revenue growth today as discrete entities, as well as the innovative technologies we're developing in-house.
Importantly, our core business is performing well today. Worldwide Visa delivered strong growth in the September quarter, with credit and debit payment volumes growing 14% and 13%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 15%. 
As I review highlights for the quarter, let's first turn our attention to the United States. To help drive future growth, Visa finalized several deals with financial institutions over the past quarter. These include an extension of our long-term credit and debit issuance agreement with PNC Bank and long-term brand agreements with the Independent Community Bankers Association and card services for credit unions. In all cases, I firmly believe Visa's extensive industry expertise and experience were critical differentiating factors that helped secure these important wins.
We also continue to win important co-brand deals with valued partners. This includes a new agreement with Williams-Sonoma, as well as the Marathon Oil co-brand mandate, which is a conversion from one of our largest competitors. These build on our momentum from the United Continental Holdings agreements announced last quarter.
On the acceptance front, our ongoing strategic initiative to expand merchant acceptance is yielding important benefits. For the 12 months ended June 30, the most recent date we have available, Visa expanded U.S. acceptance by 400,000 merchant acceptance locations. And now, we are building on that. Beginning next month, Neiman Marcus will accept Visa in all of their stores, building upon their long-standing acceptance of Visa products online.
Of course, we are moving forward on several fronts to implement our evolving debit strategies for the newly regulated U.S. market. These activities are progressing well and quickly, as we address the needs of both merchants and issuers. Our first set of activities focuses on winning merchant preference. 
As a reminder, U.S. debit revenue impacted by the regulation contributes approximately 20% of Visa's total revenue today. Of that, signature debit contributes more than 75% of the U.S. debit revenue, and we are confident in our ability to retain the overwhelming majority of that as we move forward in the newly regulated environment.
However, to address the pockets of debit revenue at risk as a result of the regulation, particularly revenues related to PIN debit, we are moving forward quickly with a program to incent routing decisions. In fact, between the start of the fourth quarter today, Visa completed dozens of merchant deals and executed contracts with a handful of our largest acquirers. 
As I noted, by expanding our incentive program to the merchant community, we increased our client incentive sign for the most recent quarter. Byron will provide additional context, but I want it to be clear that I view these merchant incentive agreements as a critical aspect of Visa's business-building strategy in this environment. These are investments that create strong and productive relationships with our merchant client. 
We're also moving forward with our modified debit economics, including the implementation of our network participation fee and the reduction of variable acquiring fees on debt, Visa debit and Interlink. As stated last quarter, we believe this offers merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per-unit transaction costs.
As for details, we anticipate providing the specific pricing information to merchants and acquirers in January, which will go into effect on April 1. As a result, we will begin to recognize the related revenue impact in our fiscal third quarter of 2012. 
At the same time, we are intensely focused on maintaining and expanding debit issuance through a strong partnerships with financial institution client. I've been clear since the Fed debit rules were finalized, the new legal requirements will likely result in a portion of transactions being moved away from Interlink as issuers take action to comply with the regulation. Specifically, in limited cases, this may very well result in the removal of Interlink from the card and migration to a competing network. These changes to the market are incorporated in our guidance.
A key part of our strategy positions Visa to compete for every transaction on a Visa-branded debit card. To that end, earlier this year, we reminded clients that Visa check cards are enabled for PIN authentication. While merchant acquirers have historically used signature authentication for check cards, in the overwhelming majority of circumstances, Visa is fully capable of facilitating both signature and PIN debit transactions over one network, VisaNet. This is an important competitive advantage and differentiator in the new environment.
Bottom line. As a long-term leader in debit, I'm confident Visa offers issuers a differentiated suite of debit products, a robust processing platform and economics that will help clients optimize their growth.
Turning our attention outside the United States, we are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international markets by 2015. In fact, our international businesses grew 19% in the fourth quarter, driving 65% of Visa's overall revenue growth. 
Each market is distinct and requires a unique approach to drive local growth. But much like the United States, the overwhelming majority of near-term revenue growth will come from expanding Visa's core businesses, including affluent credit, debit and processing.
For one example, let's turn our attention to Latin America, where our core fundamentals are incredibly strong, and Visa has increased share in each of the past 5 years, that is, bulk share versus cash and checks and share versus our traditional network competition. 
And we are building on that momentum. In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.
In Brazil, we strengthened our partnership with Banco Rendimento to provide Visa processing services on prepaid products in the country. We are also engaged in productive discussions with other Brazilian clients and hope to soon announce some important transactions. 
Our Asia Pacific region also continues to deliver very strong growth, with payments volume growing by 17% for the most recent quarter. And to drive future growth in the region, we signed several important agreements with key clients. 
For example, in Australia, we secured an important agreement with Westpac Banking Group for expanded prepaid processing services. On the merchant front, we established acceptance for Visa prepaid products at Woolworths Group, the largest retailer in Australia, a critical step towards bringing prepaid into the financial mainstream in that country.
Lastly, let's talk about innovation. We are aggressively stepping up investment in new technologies that will increase transactions on our core business platforms and add incremental value to the merchant community and create a new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients. As technology and thus the physical and digital shopping worlds converge, Visa is building its platforms in anticipation of a broad global adoption of next-generation payment technologies, including e-commerce mobile payments and information products. 
Over the past 18 months, we've enhanced our position by assembling what we believe are the best assets in the business, including CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Each of these are discrete businesses driving revenue growth today and arm Visa with best-in-class technology and capabilities to quickly bring emerging products to market. Combined with Visa technology, global reach and proven reliability and security, these new assets will enable Visa to capture significant new revenue opportunities by providing the backbone for our next-generation offerings in the U.S. and globally. 
When it comes to next-generation products, everyone is talking digital wallets. As a reminder, you don't transact with a wallet, whether it's leather or digital. You transact with what's stored in that wallet. And we have spent decades successfully placing nearly 2 billion Visa cards in cardholders' wallets.
And today, when most people talk about digital wallets, they're talking about NFC payment on a mobile phone, and in that regard, no company is doing more than Visa to set the stage for broad adoption. Visa's suite of wallet solutions include Click-to-buy, touch to buy and tap to buy, which embrace e-commerce transactions, mobile commerce transactions and transactions at the physical point-of-sale using NFC chips. Our top priority is making the act of purchasing online or on-a-mobile device as convenient as when you use your plastic cards, benefiting both consumers and merchants. 
Today, 46% of all e-commerce transactions are conducted with a Visa product, and I'm confident Visa is positioned for continued leadership in this category. To that end, we will soon begin rolling out a superior and simple online shopping experience through a Click-to-buy payment capability, which will be available on mobile devices and at home on your computer. 
Our Click-to-buy and touch to buy functionality includes aliasing capabilities requiring only a user name and a password at checkout. This increases ease of use and customer convenience, while maintaining the highest levels of security for Visa cardholder accounts. 
Rollout of our Click-to-buy functionality begins in November with pilot programs and integration with merchants. Following that, we will introduce subsequent releases in the first quarter of calendar year 2012, expanding functionality to include loyalty programs and the like over the following months.
In parallel, we are committed to consumer choice and developing partnerships to ensure that core Visa products can be used easily no matter which wallet a consumer chooses to use. Our recent agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with other leading players in the social networking, mobile e-commerce and related industries.
Another import element of our innovation strategy is creating new offerings that deliver differentiated value with the tremendous data that Visa generates. Our scale and reach provide the most compelling transaction information available in the world, and we will use this data to strategically grow our business. 
We use that advantage today in applying aggregated anonymous data to power our advanced authorization service, which has helped to drive fraud rates to the lowest level in years. And now we intend to extend that capability to drive even more value to consumers as well as merchants. Let me be clear that we are 100% committed to maintaining the highest standard of security and privacy with this information. And of course, account-specific information will only be used with direct consumer permission.
One example of what Visa can do with the information products is our real-time messaging service, which brings benefits of the virtual world to the point of sale. We are building sales momentum, and now have 14 major merchants under contract representing 68 brands across a wide range of verticals. We are exploring ways in which this platform can be leveraged to enhance issuers' relationship with their cardholders. 
Prominent partners signed during the fourth quarter include United MileagePlus, Nordstrom's, Guess and Petco, and we are working towards more deals in the near term. I strongly believe this transaction in the market is a testament to the effectiveness of this product in enhancing the value proposition Visa offers to merchants by helping to drive their customer loyalty and sales, while also incenting routing decisions to the Visa network.
Outside the U.S., we are investing in innovative mobile money solutions in both developed and emerging markets, recognizing that different geographies require specifically tailored [indiscernible]. An important key to our efforts is Fundamo, the global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing market. Fundamo has a track record of more than 50 successful client deployments in 40 countries including 27 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East and is in the process of integrating its mobile money services platform with VisaNet in an array of Visa products and services. I look forward to providing some important updates on our progress in the coming months.
So to sum it up, I think the examples showcased by today highlight how Visa is building off of our strong foundation and moving ahead both in the U.S. and around the world. We are harnessing our strong core businesses, our competitive differentiators and our ongoing focus on new technologies to position Visa for revenue growth and as a leader of the payments industry well into the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,141075551,178861,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in Rest of World. Approximately 65",1705,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in Rest of World. Approximately 65% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 45% of Visa's total.
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 7 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of August and September comped at 11% respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. While encouraging, much of this volume over the past year has been driven by affluent cardholders. As we enter fiscal 2012, it is worth noting that we have not yet seen any discernible broadening of the U.S. credit spending base beyond this affluent income group.
Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19.5%, resulting in a full year incentive level of 17%, slightly ahead of our full fiscal year expectation.
Two incentive callouts. First, on the issuing side. As telegraphed on our last earnings call, a disproportionate number of our contracts got signed in Q4. Second, on the acceptance side, we experienced greater success than anticipated in the signing of partnership contracts with merchants and acquirers. 
Finally, operating expenses for the quarter were 2% above the prior year, while on a fiscal year basis, they were up 7%. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of previously unplanned restructuring expenses, close to 1/2 of which were the result of the decommissioning of our London office. The majority of these positions will be relocated to other countries, placing them closer to the clients we serve. And of course, we also incurred incremental expenses associated with the acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo. 
Excluding the restructuring and acquisition-related cost, expense growth this fiscal year was in-line with our expectations for heightened investment spending to support our core businesses, our e-commerce and mobile initiatives, as well as the growth of our CyberSource business internationally. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for both the June and September quarters, as well as results through October 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13%, relatively flat from the June quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the September quarter: In the U.S, payment volume growth was 9%, a slight decrease from the 10% growth we saw in the June quarter; Rest of World payment volume, on a constant-dollar basis grew at 18%, unchanged from the June quarter. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 9%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 15% growth rate on a constant-dollar basis in the September quarter, up slightly from a 14% rate in the June quarter. We continue to see a recovery in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa and the longer-term trend, absent an economic downturn, appears to be back on track. Through October 21, cross-border volumes on a constant-dollar basis grew 13%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior-year period and modestly behind the 11% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Through October 21, process transactions posted growth of 8%. 
Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the United States, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, net revenues were $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed 2 percentage points of growth in Q4 and on a full year basis.
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior-year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, as well as previously enacted strategic pricing adjustments. 
Data processing revenue was $925 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter and based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. On that note, CyberSource posted a 31% gain in transaction over the prior year's quarter and 36% growth for the full fiscal year. 
International transaction revenue was up 23% to $758 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States and above-average currency volatility during the period. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the full year came in at 17%, slightly ahead of a guidance, but fully consistent with our strategy to incent U.S. merchants and acquirers to choose Visa when routing signature and PIN debit transactions.
Total operating expense for the quarter was $1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, of which the latter 2 were not included in Q4 of the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2011, expenses totaled $3.7 million, a 7% increase over the 2010 period.
As a final reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. Consistent with this announcement, $45 million of revenue and expense, which were booked in Q4 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q4 fiscal year 2011. In the current quarter, this represented 2 percentage points of revenue growth. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 57% after absorbing 120 basis points of impact from onetime restructuring charges. Our full fiscal year operating margin was 59%, in-line with our yearly guidance. Capital expenditures were $117 million in the quarter and totaled $353 million for the year. This was on target with last quarter's revised guidance.
On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 for the fourth quarter and $0.03 for the full year. The Fundamo acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 for the full year.
Finally, our reported GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 35% and 35.5% for the full year. Adjusting to exclude the beneficial impact of the put revaluation last quarter, the tax rate would have been 36.3% for the fiscal year, consistent with our guidance.
As Joe mentioned, we were buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing 5.2 million shares at an average price of $80.87. For the full fiscal year, Visa spent $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43 million shares at an average price of $74.94. Inclusive of dividend payments, we returned over $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2011.
At the end of the quarter, we had 687 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 692 million. 
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to our existing share repurchase plan. Our current open to buy now stands at approximately $1.6 billion.
As has been our practice, we will execute trades at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. We also raised our annual dividend 47% to $0.88 per share, which represents a payout ratio of about 17% on 2011 adjusted earnings.
Finally, our guidance for fiscal 2012. Last quarter, we communicated to you our expectation for revenue and earnings. As Joe said at the outset, we remain comfortable with that initial look. Net revenue growth in the high single to low double-digit range and diluted EPS growth in the mid to high teens.
Client incentives are expected to range from 17% to 18% of gross revenues. The modest uptick over fiscal 2011 is driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the United States, in combination with incentive contracts with large merchants aimed at influencing routing decisions for Visa debit transactions.
Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion, while somewhat higher than the past 2 years, it is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions as well as some modest incremental spend associated with Visa's sponsorship of the summer Olympic game.
Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The cash tax rate is expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. This reduction anticipates a change in the formula for calculating our state tax rate, as well as our initial filing for foreign tax credit. 
Since this lower tax rate is expected to be ongoing, it will likely result in a revaluation of our deferred tax liability. This onetime non-cash adjustment may reduce Visa's tax rate an additional 1 to 2 percentage points for the year. However, to be clear, our adjusted earnings per share growth target for 2012 assumes a 33% to 34% cash rate.
Capital expenditures are projected to range from $350 million to $400 million. This represents a modest increase over the $353 million we spent in 2011 and fully funds investments we're making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiative.
Finally, we expect free cash flow above $4 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. As the fiscal 2013 guidance, as we previously stated in July, we expect an acceleration of revenue and EPS off 2012 levels.
We will provide additional clarity around 2013 as we approach the beginning of that fiscal year. And with that operator, we are ready to take questions."

And to your second question, I would say no, they would be more ""back end of year"" weighted, once we begin to see what the actual routing experience is related to those contacts. Much of what was booked in the fourth quarter was onetime, and therefore, the bulk of the incentives associated with this will be validated during the course of the year once we understand what the actual routing experience is."

So I just wanted to get a sense that if we continue to see this trend of non-U.S. growing revs and volumes faster than the U.S., what does that imply for overall operating margins over the longer term if you continue to go through that makeshift and ultimately get non-U.S. to be north of 50% of total revs?"

As we begin to grow and penetrate outside the United States, remember, the first areas that are penetrated tend to be cross-volume, cross-border types of transactions. So the yields there, early in the development curve, are much higher. As we begin to penetrate more and more domestic payment volume of countries outside the United States, domestic comes with less international. And therefore, the yields, frankly, in any country, including the United States, will naturally move down as domestic picks up a bigger piece of the payment volume. And then there's one final dynamic, which is actually important to understanding how our incentives behave in 2012, which is, when we originally went public, the notion of having multi-year contracts was primarily a U.S. phenomenon. What has happened over time is that we have pursued a deliberate strategy of entering into multi-year contracts with our major clients. As we have pursued that aggressively outside the United States, the quid pro quo for a multi-year contract is incentives. So as we put more, as our volumes build overseas, as more and more of our clients are under multi-year contract, our incentives will just naturally rise, which then has an impact on yield. So to sum, the most important element is what Joe said, we have a much higher degree of processing penetration in the U.S. Outside the U.S., because of that, it tends to be lower. But we pursue the strategies that optimize the growth of our revenue, and it is revenue measured in dollars we saw [ph]  for, not yield."

This is the seventh consecutive quarter of credit card year-over-year growth. Eight quarters ago, it was actually negative. And I think what we're seeing here is a just a continuation of a recovery. The recession hit credit hard, and it actually turned growth negative. And I'm speaking here of the U.S. And so, in the first quarter of recovery, which was second quarter, our second fiscal quarter 2010, growth was 3% year-over-year. It has gradually moved up, so that now, for the quarter just ended, it's 10%, 10% in October. And so for us, this is been a gradual return to credit. It's been a sustained but very modestly paced build. And then, as you may recall from my earnings commentary today and really over the past several quarters, this is a credit recovery that is primarily in the U.S. affluent driven. And that through the quarter, through, I would say the June quarter, which is the data where we have more granular data, this growth is primarily affluent, and we haven't really seen a broadening of the credit base yet. So that's in terms of increased and growth and spend [ph]. And so, that is the opportunity to come. And with a further recovery, we expect credit to benefit -- future credit benefit growth to benefit from that expanded set of cardholders."

And then most recent data, Byron, that you pointed to, is around 8%. So it continues to be kind of on the downward slope. So I'm wondering, what do you attribute that to? And then secondly, to the extent that, that trend continues, do you feel like your business and your strategy going forward is such that you can drive incremental revenue growth, I think from a greater standpoint from increasing prices, throughout the year as opposed to just kind of the secular volume growth?"

We're not looking to drive any material top line revenue growth from pricing, recognizing that when we talk about pricing, that's pricing net of incentives. So it's one thing to adjust your pricing at the top level. But in the end, it's your net pricing that really matters. And so, it is primarily secular growth, which is one of the reasons why we continue to emphasize how much growth we are now delivering outside the United States. And in the quarter just ended, 65% of our growth, our revenue growth, came from outside the United States. And in the fourth quarter, 45% of our entire revenue base is now outside the United States. And as you know, we have an objective to drive that over 50%, and that is absolutely secular growth. With regards to the process transaction growth, that is primarily attributable to 2 things: one, a slowing in the growth rate of U.S. debit; and then second, a year ago, we began -- we had some significant increases in transaction penetration outside the United States, which are now beginning to anniversary. And so, where we are today and that drift down into high single digits, in terms of Visa process transactions, is primarily influenced by those 2 factors for the moment. But we are very focused in our future strategies at increasing Visa process transactions, increasing the percent of transactions, particularly outside the United States, that Visa processes as a function of the total transactions that are performed on Visa cards. And that's where we stand."
