I'm pleased to report that Peabody posted the second best year in our history and that we entered 2011 in our strongest financial position ever. To summarize, our Mining Operations delivered record results, we grew the top line 14% both the line on cost and expanded margins across the platform. Our cash flow generation was substantial and our balance sheet is stronger than ever. we raised our dividend and we're executing on a number of growth projects all over the world. In short, Peabody is a long-runway of growth and financial opportunities ahead. I'll begin with a review of our income statement and operational highlights.
Our 2010 sales volume totaled 246 million tons slightly above last year as higher Western U.S. and Australian volumes more than offset lower Trading and Brokerage activity. Revenues reached a record $6.9 billion on a The combination of improved realized prices and higher volumes in Australia and the Western U.S. Australia was a key driver with revenues $842 million above last year.
Those higher prices, combined with lower U.S. costs showed a consolidated EBITDA of $1.82 billion, 41% above the prior year.
Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate, excluding currency remeasurement was 23% for the full year. Taxes for the fourth quarter were below previous quarters of 2010 due to lower-than-expected contributions from Australia which have a higher effective tax rate. Going forward, we anticipate our full year effective tax rate will be up to 25% higher or 25% depending on the mix of earnings.
Income from continuing operations rose to $805.1 million. Excluding the impact of $48 million of non-cash currency measurement, our adjusted income from continuing operations totaled $853 million with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.05 both significantly above prior-year levels.
Let me take you through the EBITDA components in more detail, beginning with Australia which more than doubled its contribution. Our volumes in Australia  reached 27 million tons which was nearly 5 million tons higher than last year, reflecting both the investments we've made in the platform and the rising demand in the Pacific.
Breaking down Australia sales volumes, we sold 9.8 million tons of met coal in 2010 at an average price of $164 per metric ton which was approximately 20% higher than last year. On the thermal side, we sold 11 million tons of seaborne thermal product the throughout the year, our largest such volumes to date and at a higher average price of $78 per metric ton.
Let me take a moment to discuss the Australia rains that have been occurring most notably since December. For the industry, one of the hardest hit areas has been the mines and rail system serving the port which we don't ship through. For Peabody, we've been impacted by flooding to varying degrees at our service mines and have also seen reduced rail and port performance.
The combination of lower-than-expected fourth quarter volumes along with repair recovery expenses reduced EBITDA approximately $85 million or $0.22 per share after tax. First quarter were also be impacted by lower volumes as we ramped back up to normal levels.
In 2010, our full year cost to Australia averaged $58 per ton in line with our expectations despite the rain effects. All told, our Australia gross margin rose to 38% for the year versus 26% in 2009.
Turning now to the U.S. Our operations ran very well and related EBITDA rose 14% to $1.1 billion. In the Midwest, our margins per ton increased 22% to nearly $11 per ton as higher contracted prices more than offset a modest increase in cost from slightly lower volumes. And in the West, our margins increased 11% on higher average revenues and costs that were more than 2% below 2009 levels.
All in, our consolidated Mining Operations turned in record results. We also generated $101 million of EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage and Resource Management businesses. 
You'll know our fourth quarter Trading results were lower than average largely to three factors. First, we had lower international brokerage earnings relative to higher 2009 performance. We also had some shipment deferrals due to Australia weather, several of which have been shipped or are expected to ship this quarter. And finally, the freight position that supports our future expert volumes had unfavorable mark-to-market movements. Whether depressed of freight markets causing them to decline in the fourth quarter versus an increase last year. Like the deferrals these are temporary and at the latest, will reverse when the shipments occur.
Going forward, we continue to target quarterly EBITDA from this segment at a two-year quarterly average of approximately 31%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our strong performance resulted in cash flows from operation of $1.1 billion, which drove our cash balance to $1.3 billion. Our rise in cash flow allowed us to increase our dividend by more than 20% even as we fun a number of growth projects.
The capital program for 2011 is rising to accommodate our organic growth projects. Of this year's $900 million to $950 million of planned spending, $500 million to $550 million is earmarked for growth and extension projects in Australia and the U.S. 2011 sustaining capital is estimated to average approximately $1.80 per produced ton on continued modernization of our equipment fleet.
Before I close, I'd like to cover our outlook. For the first quarter, we're expecting lower sales volumes and higher average costs due to the rains in Australia. We also have a long wall moved plan for Colorado and one in Australia. As a result, first quarter EBITDA is targeted in the range of $325 million to $425 million with adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.65.
For the full year, our U.S. volumes are targeted to be 195 million to 205 million tons with stable average margins across the platform leading to U.S. EBITDA within 5% of 2010.
Australia sales are targeted to be 28 million to 30 million tons compared with 27 million tons in 2010. And with Trading and Brokerage, our total company 2011 sales are likely to be in the 245 million to 265 million-ton range. Given the rapid market developments and their potential for meaningful impact, we look forward to providing you outlook updates throughout the year.
And so with that review, a very strong 2010 results and our outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

Absent the December weather impacts, 2010 EBITDA would have been our best year ever. And as it is, we set new company records in the areas such as global safety and revenues and had major increases in our EBITDA, operating profit and income. We started up the Bear Run Mine in the Midwest and shipped our first coal through the NCIG terminal in New Castle. We expanded El Segundo in New Mexico and sold record volumes from our premium PRB for shell mine and we move forward our project pipeline in Australia and various JVs in China, Mongolia and Indonesia.
We've began 2011 solidly in the first phase of a long-term coal supercycle. [Audio Gap] Continuation of the two speed global engine with China, India and emerging Asia growing at 8% to 10% and Europe and the U.S. still in lower gear. In the Pacific Sewall market coal demand grew nearly 20% in 2010 to a record 700 million tons. China continued as the world's fastest-growing coal importer and shattered its prior-year net import record with 147 million tons. India continue to expand coal imports and Japan and Korea also bounced back from earlier recession.
This year, we expect further robust growth in global seaborne coal demand, which may exceed 1 billion metric tons for the first time ever, look for China and India to again lead the growth. And at the same time, coal supplies are being challenged by events in most major exporting nations. The Southern Hemisphere is home to more than 3/4 of the world's seaborne coal supplies. La Nina has brought heavy rains to Australia, Indonesia, South Africa and South America as well has been hampered in the Eastern U.S. and Western Canada. So rising demand and strain supplies are translating into sharp sharper price increases. Just since October, the spot met coal price is up well over 50% and the new castle thermal has risen more than 35%. This bodes extremely well as we approach upcoming settlements for quarterly met in annual thermal contracts. And our leverage to these markets is outstanding. Essentially all of Peabody's met coal beyond this quarter is open to pricing and half of our thermal export coals available to price for 2011 was 85% open for 2012.
Now Mike reviewed the effects of the Australia  flooding on our results. I'd like to the give you a brief update where we stand today. Our Cleveland mines continue to work through force majeurs with customers and recover from the storms. Today, the major questions are: What will the normal rainy season which urges beginning bring to us?
Whether our coal shippers will have coal available when we have coal products ready to ship, and for our quick operation, when will the rail line to the fork be restored. We received multiple reports each day from our Australia team, which has been working tirelessly through personal and professional challenges. But their goal is to minimize the impacts of flooding and to recover as quickly as possible. Case in point. We just sold a spot of semi-hard coking coal to a major customer for prices that are significantly above those settled for the first quarter.
So as we quickly work through these short-term weather-related issues, we're keenly focused on capturing the significant upside potential resulting from the 7 million to 8 million tons of metallurgical coal and the 6 million to 7 million tons of thermal coal that we have yet to price for 2011.
Now let's look at the U.S. markets. Last year, a low natural gas price still wasn't enough to derail a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation. Coal regain market share in 2010 and powered nearly 2/3 of incremental power outlet. Exports increased, led by met coal in the East and PRB in the West. And I'd note that U.S. coal demand has largely tracked industrial output, which were declining 9% in 2009 bounced back 6% in 2010. We see muted improvement in 2011 with manufacturing growth, natural gas prices and export volumes holding the keys to any further increases.
On the supply side, we expect continued market share gains from the Illinois Basin and Powder River Basin. And we continue to shape our contract book to the match the curve of the U.S. rebound, with 2012 and beyond continuing to look much brighter.
Now embedded in this near-term market movements are elements of much longer trends. I've noted that I believe we're in the early stages of a long-term supercycle for coal. We see evidence of these around us today. Coal has been the world's fastest-growing fuel and i.e. projects that growth in coal generation will be more than double that of any other fuel through 2020. And by 2020, global generation capacity in steel production are both expected to grow some 50%. China's electricity and industrial production will again grow at low-teen rates and China's new power plants and steel mills will require several hundred million tons of added coal each year.
India is rapidly increasing coal imports and developed economies are starting to see growth in their manufacturing base. So what's important to investors goes beyond whether met coal is $375 per ton. The key is that global demand for coal is strongly and steadily rising and supplies stretched such that disruptions become quickly apparent.
So where does this lead Peabody? We are ideally position for the supercycle. Peabody benefits from rising volumes within a support of price backdrop. A powerful earnings combination that should sustain our growth for years to come. In 2011, Peabody will use its position in the fastest-growing markets to target the following key areas. We will capture value from upward price, movements, within our significant open position. We will advance expansion of six major Australian metallurgical and thermal export mines and work to recapture value lost from the recent flooding.
We will advanced emerging growth projects and commercial transactions in China, Mongolia, Indonesia and India. And we will continue to leverage Peabody's leadership in the three primary growth avenues for the U.S., the Powder River Basin, Illinois Basin and U.S. exports.
And we will maintain our intensity for excellence in our core areas of safety, operations, portfolio management, Trading and Brokerage and social responsibility. I want to thank all Peabody employees for their continued efforts. They are the key to our success. And we believe Peabody offers all of you a pure play investment for the global reach, access to the very best markets and growth rate well above our peers.
So with that overview, we'll now be happy to answer any questions you may have."

When you remember back in 2008 there was a central core in Queensland along that Black Water line in the gladstone that was hardest hit. This year, there were impact across the entire Queensland platform and right at the end of 2010, some impacts in New South Wales. When you look at 2010, you're probably 8 million to 10 million-ton impact out of Australia. This year we're looking at 15 million to 20 million tons of impact, so almost twice. Plus you've got South Africa, you've got Colombia, all and in Indonesia all having concurrent impacts. So when you look at the global perspective, this year's event is much more significant.

When I just start from the south let's say that New South Wales is essentially back on track and operating normally from any impacts that they might have in the fourth quarter. As we move up into Queensland it's a couple of different stories. As I mentioned earlier, the most significant impacts and the most catastrophic impacts were along that Blackwater Gladstone quarter which we do not have any operations in that area. As you go through the Goonyella DBCT Port Corridor, which affects our northern basin operations, and you look at our surface operations, our Burton operations, Eagle Field and the Millennium, all have significant rainfall. Millennium is essentially up and running at capacity although we've got some lower seeings that we have still yet to pump the pits down to be able to access for blending purposes. Our Burton operation, we still have significant pumping to do. You might recall, we've got multiple pits at that operation and we are beginning and we are producing out of some of those pits but we don't have access to 100% of them yet. It will take us a bit of time to pump those down. Eagle Field is essentially back up and running as an  a junk to our North Goonyella operations. In terms of North Goonyella we've had some access issues which will result fairly quickly and we also had a some geologic issues that we work through at the end of the year. But it is essentially up and running at full production as we speak today. So as you move south to our Wilke Creek operations, it's probably where we've had our biggest impact. We've just recently, within this week, been able to get full access to the site again and our back up limited production and we will be building that production based over the course of the next week. But longer-term, the rail line from Wilke Creek to the port of Brisbane was washed out in the significant flooding that they have in Brisbane which work we are all aware of. And we're still talking to Queensland rail as to what they think the repair estimates and time frame might be. But logically, that will probably be a month or two before we can see any clarity as to when that will be up and running. Hopefully it won't not be longer than within the quarter."

I think the other question you asked is do we think that 15 million to 20 million is the end of it? It may not be in terms of we don't have visibility into what all of the other producers and their various impacts are as we talked about co-shipping is still a risk that we have for the first quarter. So the 15 million to 20 million may actually increase somewhat as we go through the rest of the first quarter and the recovery effort is really taking the place. Everybody has remember is there's a significant amount of recovery across all of Queensland it has to take place not just the coal sector. And so the resources will be strained as everybody tries to get back up and running and get the real in the ports where they need to be."

What I could tell is that our goal is to get a low-cost option that could be a game changer for the market. And when we look at the options, we want a deepwater facility because to ship PRB coal, we believe we have to use Capesize vessels that improves your economics by $5 to $6 in metric ton over Panamax vessels that are being used in some of the other facilities that were available to look at. It has to have affordable rail opportunities and rail rates where as we evaluate some of the further north opportunities such as, it's a $10 to $15 disadvantage to some of the options that other options that we look at. So we try to find the right option that has long-term competitive advantages that can ship meaningful quantities of PRB coal and it has a one-line haul as opposed to a two or three line rail haul to get to the port. So we hope to be able to give you information in the next quarter on this but continues to progress very rapidly a lot of work is going on and we don't want to announce anything prematurely."

I'm pleased to report that Peabody posted the second best year in our history and that we entered 2011 in our strongest financial position ever. To summarize, our mining operations delivered record results, we grew the top line 14%, held the line on cost and expanded margins across the platform. Our cash flow generation was substantial, and our balance sheet is stronger than ever. We raised our dividend, and we're executing on a number of growth projects all over the world. In short, Peabody has a long runway of growth and financial opportunities ahead. I'll begin with the review of our income statement and operational highlights.
Our 2010 sales volume totaled 246 million tons, slightly above last year as higher Western U.S. and Australian volumes more than offset lower Trading and Brokerage activity. Revenues reached a record $6.9 billion on a combination of improved realized prices and higher volumes in Australia and the Western U.S. Australia was a key driver with revenues $842 million above last year. Those higher prices, combined with lower U.S. costs, drove consolidated EBITDA to $1.82 billion, 41% above the prior year.
Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate, excluding currency remeasurement was 23% for the full year. Taxes for the fourth quarter were below previous quarters of 2010 due to lower-than-expected contributions from Australia, which have a higher effective tax rate. Going forward, we anticipate our full year effective tax rate will be up to 25% higher or 25% depending on the mix of earnings.
Income from continuing operations rose to $805.1 million. Excluding the impact of $48 million of non-cash currency remeasurement, our adjusted income from continuing operations totaled $853 million with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.05, both significantly above prior year levels.
Let me take you through the EBITDA components in more detail, beginning with Australia which more than doubled its contribution. Our volumes in Australia  reached 27 million tons, which was nearly 5 million tons higher than last year, reflecting both the investments we've made in the platform and the rising demand in the Pacific.
Breaking down Australia sales volumes, we sold 9.8 million tons of met coal in 2010 at an average price of $164 per metric ton, which was approximately 20% higher than last year. On the thermal side, we sold 11 million tons of seaborne thermal product throughout the year, our largest such volumes to date and at a higher average price of $78 per metric ton.
Let me take a moment to discuss the Australia rains that have been occurring most notably since December. For the industry, one of the hardest hit areas has been the mines and rail system serving the Gladstone port, which we don't ship through. For Peabody, we've been impacted by flooding to varying degrees at our service mines and have also seen reduced rail and port performance.
The combination of lower-than-expected fourth quarter volumes, along with repair recovery expenses, reduced EBITDA approximately $85 million or $0.22 per share after tax. The first quarter will also be impacted by lower volumes as we ramp back up to normal levels.
In 2010, our full year cost in Australia averaged $58 per ton in line with our expectations despite the rain effects. All told, our Australia gross margin rose to 38% for the year versus 26% in 2009.
Turning now to the U.S. Our operations ran very well, and related EBITDA rose 14% to $1.1 billion. In the Midwest, our margins per ton increased 22% to nearly $11 per ton as higher contracted prices more than offset a modest increase in cost from slightly lower volumes. And in the West, our margins increased 11% on higher average revenues and costs that were more than 2% below 2009 levels.
All in, our consolidated Mining Operations turned in record results. We also generated $101 million of EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage and Resource Management businesses. You'll know that our fourth quarter Trading results were lower than average largely due to three factors. First, we had lower international brokerage earnings relative to higher 2009 performance. We also had some shipment deferrals due to Australia weather, several of which had since shipped or are expected to ship this quarter. 
And finally, the freight position that supports our future expert volumes had unfavorable mark-to-market movements. Weather depressed the freight markets, causing them to decline in the fourth quarter versus an increase last year. Like the deferrals, these are temporary and at the latest, will reverse when the shipments occur.
Going forward, we continue to target quarterly EBITDA from this segment at a two-year quarterly average of approximately $30 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our strong performance resulted in cash flows from operation of $1.1 billion, which drove our cash balance to $1.3 billion. Our rise in cash flow allowed us to increase our dividend by more than 20% even as we fund a number of growth projects.
The capital program for 2011 is rising to accommodate our organic growth projects. Of this year's $900 million to $950 million of planned spending, $500 million to $550 million is earmarked for growth in extension projects in Australia and the U.S. 2011 sustaining capital is estimated to average approximately $1.80 per produced ton on continued modernization of our equipment fleet.
Before I close, I'd like to cover our outlook. For the first quarter, we're expecting lower sales volumes and higher average costs due to the rains in Australia. We also have a longwall move planned for Colorado and one in Australia. As a result, first quarter EBITDA is targeted in the range of $325 million to $425 million with adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.65.
For the full year, our U.S. volumes are targeted to be 195 million to 205 million tons, with stable average margins across the platform, leading to U.S. EBITDA within 5% of 2010. Australia sales are targeted to be 28 million to 30 million tons compared with 27 million tons in 2010. And with Trading and Brokerage, our total company 2011 sales are likely to be in the 245 million to 265 million-ton range. Given the rapid market developments and their potential for meaningful impact, we look forward to providing you outlook updates throughout the year.
And so with that review, a very strong 2010 results and our outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

Absent the December weather impacts, 2010 EBITDA would have been our best year ever. And as it is, we set new company records in the are",1166,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 2010 was a year of significant accomplishments for Peabody across the board. Absent the December weather impacts, 2010 EBITDA would have been our best year ever. And as it is, we set new company records in the areas such as global safety and revenues and had major increases in our EBITDA, operating profit and income. We started up the Bear Run Mine in the Midwest and shipped our first coal through the NCIG terminal in Newcastle. We expanded El Segundo in New Mexico and sold record volumes from our premium PRB North Antelope Rochelle Mine, and we moved forward our project pipeline in Australia and various JVs in China, Mongolia and Indonesia.
We began 2011 solidly in the first phase of a long-term coal supercycle. And Peabody has growth projects advancing in Australia, Asia and in the U.S. I'd like to review the key markets for our products as well as our key focus areas for 2011. 
This year, we see a continuation of the two-speed global economic engine with China, India and emerging Asia growing at 8% to 10%, and Europe and the U.S. still in lower gear. In the Pacific seaborne market, coal demand grew nearly 20% in 2010 to a record 700 million tons. China continued as the world's fastest-growing coal importer and shattered its prior year net import record with 147 million tons. India continue to expand the coal imports, and Japan and Korea also bounced back from earlier recession.
This year, we expect further robust growth in global seaborne coal demand, which may exceed 1 billion metric tons for the first time ever, look for China and India to again lead the growth, and at the same time coal supplies are being challenged by events in most major exporting nations. 
The Southern Hemisphere is home to more than 3/4 of the world's seaborne coal supplies. La Nina has brought heavy rains to Australia, Indonesia, South Africa and South America, as well exports have been hampered in the Eastern U.S. and Western Canada. So rising demand and strained supplies are translating into sharp price increases. Just since October, the spot met coal price is up well over 50%, and the Newcastle thermal has risen more than 35%. 
This bodes extremely well as we approach upcoming settlements for quarterly met in annual thermal contracts. And our leverage to these markets is outstanding. Essentially all of Peabody's met coal beyond this quarter is open to pricing and half of our thermal export coal is available to price for 2011, with 85% open for 2012.
Now Mike reviewed the effects of the Australia  flooding on our results. I'd like to the give you a brief update where we stand today. Our Cleveland mines continue to work through force majeures with customers and recover from the storms. Today, the major questions are what will the normal rainy season, which were just beginning, bring to us? Whether our coal shippers will have coal available when we have coal product ready to ship? And for our Wilkie Creek operation, when will the rail line to the Brisbane Port be restored? 
We receive multiple reports each day from our Australia team, which has been working tirelessly through personal and professional challenges. But their goal is to minimize the impacts of flooding and to recover as quickly as possible. A case in point, we just sold a spot Panamax of semi-hard coking coal to a major customer for prices that are significantly above those settled for the first quarter.
So as we quickly work through these short-term weather-related issues, we're keenly focused on capturing the significant upside potential resulting from the 7 million to 8 million tons of metallurgical coal and the 6 million to 7 million tons of thermal coal that we have yet to price for 2011.
Now let's look at the U.S. markets. Last year, a low natural gas price still wasn't enough to derail a 5.5% increase in coal-fueled generation. Coal regained market share in 2010 and powered nearly 2/3 of incremental power outlet. Exports increased, led by met coal in the East and PRB in the West. And I'd note that U.S. coal demand has largely tracked industrial output, which while declining 9% in 2009, bounced back 6% in 2010. We see muted improvement in 2011 with manufacturing growth, natural gas prices and export volumes holding the keys to any further increases.
On the supply side, we expect continued market share gains from the Illinois Basin and Powder River Basin. And we continue to shape our contract book to the match the curve of the U.S. rebound, with 2012 and beyond continuing to look much brighter.
Now embedded in these near-term market movements are elements of much longer trends. I've noted that I believe we're in the early stages of a long-term supercycle for coal. We see evidence of these around us today. Coal has been the world's fastest-growing fuel, and EIA [Energy Information Administration]
Projects that growth in coal generation will be more than double that of any other fuel through 2020. And by 2020, global generation capacity in steel production are both expected to grow some 50%. China's electricity and industrial production will again grow at low-teen rates, and China's new power plants and steel mills will require several hundred million tons of added coal each year. 
India is rapidly increasing coal imports and developed economies are starting to see growth in their manufacturing base. So what's important to investors goes beyond whether met coal is $375 per ton. The key is that global demand for coal is strongly and steadily rising, and supply is stretched such that disruptions become quickly apparent. 
So where does this lead Peabody? We are ideally positioned for this supercycle. Peabody benefits from rising volumes within a supportive price backdrop, a powerful earnings combination that should sustain our growth for years to come. In 2011, Peabody will use its position in the fastest-growing markets to target the following key areas: We will capture value from upward price, movements within our significant open position. We will advance expansion of six major Australian metallurgical and thermal export mines and work to recapture value loss from the recent flooding. We will advance emerging growth projects and commercial transactions in China, Mongolia, Indonesia and India. And we will continue to leverage Peabody's leadership in the three primary growth avenues for the U.S, the Powder River Basin; Illinois Basin; and U.S. exports. And we will maintain our intensity for excellence in our core areas of safety, operations, portfolio management, trading and brokerage and social responsibility. 
I want to thank all Peabody employees for their continued efforts. They are the key to our success. And we believe Peabody offers all of you a pure play investment for the global reach, access to the very best markets and growth rates well above our peers.

There's no question, Mike, although the flooding and the impacts in Australia  are much greater today than they were in the 2008, they're more widespread. They cover a larger area. If you remember back in 2008, there was a central core in Queensland along that Black Water line into Gladstone that was hardest hit. This year, there were impacts across the entire Queensland platform and right at the end of 2010, some impacts in New South Wales. When you look at 2010, you're probably 8 million to 10 million ton impact out of Australia. This year we're looking at 15 million to 20 million tons of total impact, so almost twice, plus you've got South Africa, you've got Colombia and Indonesia all having concurrent impacts. So when you look at the global perspective, this year's event is much more significant and in some cases, will take a longer period of time to recover depending on the region that we're talking about."

We see prices that are high in Europe, that support more exports out of the Illinois Basin, out of the Colorado, out of the East. We see what's happening in the West Coast, there's opportunities that move it. And we're also moving a lot more coal out of the Gulf.

Let me just give a sense as to where we're at operationally today and what we see as some of the recovery times. If I just start from the south, let's say that New South Wales is essentially back on track and operating normally from any impacts that they might have had in the fourth quarter. As we move up into Queensland, it's a couple of different stories. As I mentioned earlier, the most significant impacts and the most catastrophic impacts were along that Blackwater, Gladstone quarter, which we do not have any operations in that area. As you go to the Goonyella DBCT Port Corridor, which affects our northern Bowen Basin operations, and you look at our surface operations, our Burton operation, Eagle Field and Millennium, all had significant rainfall. Millennium is essentially up and running at capacity, although we've got some lower seams that we have still yet to pump the pits down to be able to access for blending purposes. Our Burton operation, we still have significant pumping to do. You might recall, we've got multiple pits at that operation. And we are beginning and we are producing out of some of those pits, but we don't have access to 100% of them yet. It'll take us a bit of time to pump those down. Eagle Field is essentially back up and running as an  adjunct to our North Goonyella operation. In terms of North Goonyella, we had some access issues, which will result fairly quickly. We also had a certain -- some geologic issues that we worked through at the end of the year. But it is essentially up and running at full production as we speak today. So as you move south to our Wilkie Creek operation, it's probably where we've had our biggest impact. We've just recently, within this week, been able to get full access to the site again and our back up limited production. And we'll be building that production base over the course of the next week. But longer term, the rail line from Wilkie Creek to port of Brisbane was washed out in the significant flooding that they had in Brisbane, which we're all aware of. And we're still talking to Queensland Rail as to what they think the repair estimates and time frame might be. But logically, that will probably be a month or two before we can see any clarity as to when that will be up and running. Hopefully, it won't not be longer than within the quarter."

But what I can tell is that our goal is to get a low-cost option that can be a game changer for the market. And when we look at the options, we want a deepwater facility, because to ship PRB coal, we believe you have to use capesize vessels. That improves your economics by $5 to $6 in metric ton over Panamax vessels that are being used in some of the other facilities that were available to us to look at. It has to have affordable rail opportunities and rail rates where -- and as we evaluate some of the further north opportunities such as Ridley, it's probably a $10 to $15 disadvantage to some of the other options that we look at.

Let me give you a little bit of background on the projects and there's a couple of other projects. We told you last quarter, we were working on these projects, and we'd hopefully have something to announce and we did. We're at the stage right now in both of these projects where we've signed Memorandums of Understanding. We're moving towards the signing of a joint venture agreement in mid-2011. And then, we'll work towards getting the permits for the coal reserves in 2011 as well. So at the same time we're finishing diligence and mine planning. But the expectation is, yes, these are significant projects. And in Peabody's case, we would expect to be 45% to 49% owners of coal mine and collecting revenues from, of course, that part of the business as well as participating at some level to be determined in the downstream part of the business as well. So in all likelihood, it won't be a consolidated revenue, it will be an equity method accounting in the future. It's probably at least three years in the future before we start having meaningful production of those operations, but we're very optimistic with these projects. And I think there's more to come as we head towards our goal that's pretty aggressive in Asia to expand our platform over there. So these are some good projects for us, and I think the endorsement by the Chinese government and U.S. government is very, very helpful as to get us to move forward and get those reserves secured."

We've never thought that there as it existed, which says that for that gap to be closed, it might get tampered when we get back up to full production. But in our view, it's not going to get closed.

I'm pleased to report that Peabody posted the second best year in our history and that we enter 2011 in our strongest financial position ever. To summarize, our mining operations delivered record results, we grew the top line 14%, held the line on cost and expanded margins across the platform. Our cash flow generation was substantial, and our balance sheet is stronger than ever. We raised our dividend, and we're executing on a number of growth projects all over the world. In short, Peabody has a long runway of growth and financial opportunities ahead. I'll begin with the review of our income statement and operational highlights.
Our 2010 sales volume totaled 246 million tons, slightly above last year as higher Western U.S. and Australian volumes more than offset lower Trading and Brokerage activity. Revenues reached a record $6.9 billion on a combination of improved realized prices and higher volumes in Australia and the Western U.S. Australia was a key driver with revenues $842 million above last year. Those higher prices, combined with lower U.S. costs, drove consolidated EBITDA to $1.82 billion, 41% above the prior year.
Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate, excluding currency remeasurement was 23% for the full year. Taxes for the fourth quarter were below previous quarters of 2010 due to lower-than-expected contributions from Australia, which have a higher effective tax rate. Going forward, we anticipate our full year effective tax rate will be up to 25% depending on the mix of earnings.
Income from continuing operations rose to $805.1 million. Excluding the impact of $48 million of non-cash currency remeasurement, our adjusted income from continuing operations totaled $853 million with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.05, both significantly above prior year levels.
Let me take you through the EBITDA components in more detail, beginning with Australia which more than doubled its contribution. Our volumes in Australia  reached 27 million tons, which was nearly 5 million tons higher than last year, reflecting both the investments we've made in the platform and the rising demand in the Pacific.
Breaking down Australia sales volumes, we sold 9.8 million tons of met coal in 2010 at an average price of $164 per metric ton, which was approximately 20% higher than last year. On the thermal side, we sold 11 million tons of seaborne thermal product throughout the year, our largest such volumes to date and at a higher average price of $78 per metric ton.
Let me take a moment to discuss the Australia rains that have been occurring most notably since December. For the industry, one of the hardest hit areas has been the mines and rail system serving the Gladstone port, which we don't ship through. For Peabody, we've been impacted by flooding to varying degrees at our service mines and have also seen reduced rail and port performance.
The combination of lower-than-expected fourth quarter volumes, along with repair recovery expenses, reduced EBITDA approximately $85 million or $0.22 per share after tax. The first quarter will also be impacted by lower volumes as we ramp back up to normal levels.
In 2010, our full year cost in Australia averaged $58 per ton in line with our expectations despite the rain effects. All told, our Australia gross margin rose to 38% for the year versus 26% in 2009.
Turning now to the U.S. Our operations ran very well, and related EBITDA rose 14% to $1.1 billion. In the Midwest, our margins per ton increased 22% to nearly $11 per ton as higher contracted prices more than offset a modest increase in cost from slightly lower volumes. And in the West, our margins increased 11% on higher average revenues and costs that were more than 2% below 2009 levels.
All in, our consolidated Mining Operations turned in record results. We also generated $101 million of EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage and Resource Management businesses. You'll know our fourth quarter Trading results were lower than average largely due to three factors. First, we had lower international brokerage earnings relative to higher 2009 performance. We also had some shipment deferrals due to the Australia weather, several of which had since shipped or are expected to ship this quarter. 
And finally, the freight position that supports our future expert volumes had unfavorable mark-to-market movements. Weather depressed the freight markets, causing them to decline in the fourth quarter versus an increase last year. Like the deferrals, these are temporary and at the latest, will reverse when the shipments occur.
Going forward, we continue to target quarterly EBITDA from this segment at the two-year quarterly average of approximately $30 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our strong performance resulted in cash flows from operations of $1.1 billion, which drove our cash balance to $1.3 billion. Our rise in cash flow allowed us to increase our dividend by more than 20% even as we fund a number of growth projects.
The capital program for 2011 is rising to accommodate our organic growth projects. Of this year's $900 million to $950 million of planned spending, $500 million to $550 million is earmarked for growth in extension projects in Australia and the U.S. 2011 sustaining capital is estimated to average approximately $1.80 per produced ton on continued modernization of our equipment fleet.
Before I close, I'd like to cover our outlook. For the first quarter, we're expecting lower sales volumes and higher average costs due to the rains in Australia. We also have a longwall move planned for Colorado and one in Australia. As a result, first quarter EBITDA is targeted in the range of $325 million to $425 million with adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.65.
For the full year, our U.S. volumes are targeted to be 195 million to 205 million tons, with stable average margins across the platform, leading to expected U.S. EBITDA within 5% of 2010. Australia sales are targeted to be 28 million to 30 million tons compared with 27 million tons in 2010. And with Trading and Brokerage, our total company 2011 sales are likely to be in the 245 million to 265 million-ton range. Given the rapid market developments and their potential for meaningful impact, we look forward to providing you outlook updates throughout the year.
And so with that review, a very strong 2010 results and our outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

Absent the December weather impacts, 2010 EBITDA would have been our best year ever. And as it is, we set new company records in the areas such as global safety and revenues and had major increases in our EBITDA, operating profit and income. We started up the Bear Run Mine in the Midwest and shipped our first coal through the NCIG terminal in Newcastle. We expanded El Segundo in New Mexico and sold record volumes from our premium PRB North Antelope Rochelle Mine, and we moved forward our project pipeline in Australia and various JVs in China, Mongolia and Indonesia.
We began 2011 solidly in the first phase of a long-term coal supercycle. And Peabody has growth projects advancing in Australia, Asia and in the U.S. I'd like to review the key markets for our products as well as our key focus areas for 2011. 
This year, we see a continuation of the two-speed global economic engine with China, India and emerging Asia growing at 8% to 10%, and Europe and the U.S. still in lower gear. In the Pacific seaborne market, coal demand grew nearly 20% in 2010 to a record 700 million tons. China continued as the world's fastest-growing coal importer and shattered its prior year net import record with 147 million tons. India continue to expand the coal imports, and Japan and Korea also bounced back from earlier recession.
This year, we expect further robust growth in global seaborne coal demand, which may exceed 1 billion metric tons for the first time ever, look for China and India to again lead the growth, and at the same time coal supplies are being challenged by events in most major exporting nations. 
The Southern Hemisphere is home to more than 3/4 of the world's seaborne coal supplies. La Nina has brought heavy rains to Australia, Indonesia, South Africa and South America, as well exports have been hampered in the Eastern U.S. and Western Canada. So rising demand and strained supplies are translating into sharp price increases. Just since October, the spot met coal price is up well over 50%, and the Newcastle thermal has risen more than 35%. 
This bodes extremely well as we approach upcoming settlements for quarterly met in annual thermal contracts. And our leverage to these markets is outstanding. Essentially all of Peabody's met coal beyond this quarter is open to pricing and half of our thermal export coal is available to price for 2011, with 85% open for 2012.
Now Mike reviewed the effects of the Australia flooding on our results. I'd like to the give you a brief update where we stand today. Our Cleveland mines continue to work through force majeures with customers and recover from the storms. Today, the major questions are what will the normal rainy season, which we’re just beginning, bring to us? Whether our coast shippers will have coal available when we have coal product ready to ship? And for our Wilkie Creek operation, when will the rail line to the Brisbane Port be restored? 
We receive multiple reports each day from our Australia team, which has been working tirelessly through personal and professional challenges. But their goal is to minimize the impacts of flooding and to recover as quickly as possible. A case in point, we just sold a spot Panamax of semi-hard coking coal to a major customer for prices that are significantly above those settled for the first quarter.
So as we quickly work through these short-term weather-related issues, we're keenly focused on capturing the significant upside potential resulting from the 7 million to 8 million tons of metallurgical coal and the 6 million to 7 million tons of thermal coal that we have yet to price for 2011.
Now let's look at the U.S. markets. Last year, a low natural gas price still wasn't enough to derail a 5.5% increase in coal-fueled generation. Coal regained market share in 2010 and powered nearly 2/3 of incremental power outlet. Exports increased, led by met coal in the East and PRB in the West. And I'd note that U.S. coal demand has largely tracked industrial output, which while declining 9% in 2009, bounced back 6% in 2010. We see muted improvement in 2011 with manufacturing growth, natural gas prices and export volumes holding the keys to any further increases.
On the supply side, we expect continued market share gains from the Illinois Basin and Powder River Basin. And we continue to shape our contract book to the match the curve of the U.S. rebound, with 2012 and beyond continuing to look much brighter.
Now embedded in these near-term market movements are elements of much longer trends. I've noted that I believe we're in the early stages of a long-term supercycle for coal. We see evidence of these around us today. Coal has been the world's fastest-growing fuel, and EIA [Energy Information Administration]
Projects that growth in coal generation will be more than double that of any other fuel through 2020. And by 2020, global generation capacity in steel production are both expected to grow some 50%. China's electricity and industrial production will again grow at low-teen rates, and China's new power plants and steel mills will require several hundred million tons of added coal each year. 
India is rapidly raising coal imports and developed economies are starting to see growth in their manufacturing base. So what's important to investors goes beyond whether met coal is $375 per ton. The key is that global demand for coal is strongly and steadily rising, and supply is stretched such that disruptions become quickly apparent. 
So where does this lead Peabody? We are ideally positioned for this supercycle. Peabody benefits from rising volumes within a supportive price backdrop, a powerful earnings combination that should sustain our growth for years to come. In 2011, Peabody will use its position in the fastest-growing markets to target the following key areas: We will capture value from upward price movements within our significant open position. We will advance expansion of six major Australian metallurgical and thermal export mines and work to recapture value loss from the recent flooding. We will advance emerging growth projects and commercial transactions in China, Mongolia, Indonesia and India. And we will continue to leverage Peabody's leadership in the three primary growth avenues for the U.S, the Powder River Basin; Illinois Basin; and U.S. exports. And we will maintain our intensity for excellence in our core areas of safety, operations, portfolio management, trading and brokerage and social responsibility. 
I want to thank all Peabody employees for their continued efforts. They are the key to our success. And we believe Peabody offers all of you a pure play investment for the global reach, access to the very best markets and growth rates well above our peers.
So with that overview, we'll now be happy to answer any questions you may have."

If you remember back in 2008, there was a central core in Queensland along that Black Water line into Gladstone that was hardest hit. This year, there were impacts across the entire Queensland platform and right at the end of 2010, some impacts in New South Wales. When you look at 2010, you're probably 8 million to 10 million ton impact out of Australia. This year we're looking at 15 million to 20 million tons of total impact, so almost twice, plus you've got South Africa, you've got Colombia and Indonesia all having concurrent impacts.

Let me just give a sense as to where we're at operationally today and what we see as some of the recovery times. If I just start from the south, let's say that New South Wales is essentially back on track and operating normally from any impacts that they might have had in the fourth quarter. As we move up into Queensland, it's a couple of different stories. As I mentioned earlier, the most significant impacts and the most catastrophic impacts were along that Blackwater, Gladstone quarter, which we do not have any operations in that area. As you go to the Goonyella DBCT Port Corridor, which affects our northern Bowen Basin operations, and you look at our surface operations, our Burton operation, Eaglefield and Millennium, all had significant rainfall. Millennium is essentially up and running at capacity, although we've got some lower seams that we have still yet to pump the pits down to be able to access for blending purposes. Our Burton operation, we still have significant pumping to do. You might recall, we've got multiple pits at that operation. And we are beginning and we are producing out of some of those pits, but we don't have access to 100% of them yet. It'll take us a bit of time to pump those down. Eaglefield is essentially back up and running as an adjunct to our North Goonyella operation. In terms of North Goonyella, we had some access issues, which will result fairly quickly. We also had a certain -- some geologic issues that we worked through at the end of the year. But it is essentially up and running at full production as we speak today. So as you move south to our Wilkie Creek operation, it's probably where we've had our biggest impact. We've just recently, within this week, been able to get full access to the site again and are back up limited production. And we'll be building that production base over the course of the next week. But longer term, the rail line from Wilkie Creek to port of Brisbane was washed out in the significant flooding that they had in Brisbane, which we're all aware of. And we're still talking to Queensland Rail as to what they think the repair estimates and time frame might be. But logically, that will probably be a month or two before we can see any clarity as to when that will be up and running. Hopefully, it won't be longer than within the quarter."

But what I can tell is that our goal is to get a low-cost option that can be a game changer for the market. And when we look at the options, we want a deepwater facility, because to ship PRB coal, we believe you have to use capesize vessels. That improves your economics by $5 to $6 in metric ton over Panamax vessels that are being used in some of the other facilities that were available to us to look at. It has to have affordable rail opportunities and rail rates where -- and as we evaluate some of the further north opportunities such as Ridley, it's probably a $10 to $15 disadvantage to some of the other options that we look at. So we're trying to find the right option that has long-term competitive advantages, that can ship meaningful quantities of PRB coal.

I think that all bodes well for what will be a more rational time frame as we go through the future in terms of what some of these new regulations might be. In terms of where we're at, in terms of permitting, current regulatory environment for new operations, I think those are moving along. I don't see significant changes there. I think it's more on the generation side, and I think there'll be a more fulsome discussion around the impacts of those at a time frame that allows continued electricity growth in this country as we move forward and not the Draconian [ph] effects of what we might have seen before."

So you layer on top of that, the production has been lost, we don't have overcapacity in the met coal circuit. We've never thought that there as it existed, which says that for that gap to be closed, it might get tempered when we get back up to full production. But in our view, it's not going to get closed.

32792,129482204,115609,"Peabody Energy Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Peabody Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vic. And good morning, everyone. Peabody turned in very solid results in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit and earnings per share all rose sharply over the prior year. Our operating cash flows expanded further and our balance s",1105,"Thanks, Vic. And good morning, everyone. Peabody turned in very solid results in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit and earnings per share all rose sharply over the prior year. Our operating cash flows expanded further and our balance sheet's extremely strong. We expect to grow from here as we target results over the balance of 2011.
Let's review the quarter beginning with our income statement. Sales volume rose 5% to 61 million tons led by higher demand in the Powder River and Illinois basin. Australia volumes are predictably lower given the record flooding that we discussed in our last call, coupled with continuing rains in Queensland throughout the quarter. 
Higher U.S. volumes and increased metallurgical and thermal coal pricing in Australia drove over 50% increase in revenues to $1.7 billion. Even with the rains, Australia was the primary driver of a 17% increase in EBITDA to $416 million. Operating profit expanded 22% while net income climbed to 32% to $177 million.
Our effective tax rate was 25% in the quarter, excluding currency remeasurement. But we are targeting the upper 20% range for the full year. Income from continuing operations rose to $180 million. Excluding the non-cash remeasurement of income taxes, our adjusted income was $186 million with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67, both significantly above the prior-year level.
Now let's review the building blocks of EBITDA in more detail on the supplemental income statement. I'll first turn to Australia where we expected a lighter quarter for shipments. The substantial weather events that continued in the first quarter led to a 10% volume decrease from the same period in 2010. I'm pleased to report that all of our Australia mines are producing and shipping coal with the rail line that serves our Wilkie thermal coal mine coming back on line at the end of March. We are also beginning to rebuild Australian inventories.
Australian revenues rose 30%, demonstrating Peabody's leverage to rising seaborne pricing. The average revenue per ton rose 43% over the prior year and exceeded $100 per short ton. And this will both move higher with the rising benchmark prices. 
We sold 2.1 million tons of met coal in the first quarter at an average price of $186 per short ton, which was more than 50% higher than last year based on the benchmark price set last December. We also shipped 2.1 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average of $83 per short ton. Weather-related production effects were the largest items that impacted cost for the quarter. Other factors included increasing sales related royalties, as well as the higher mix of met coal shipments and unfavorable exchange rate movements. Peabody remains approximately 75% hedged for the remainder of 2011 at approximately $0.80 per dollar. 
First quarter Australia margins still rose 70% over the prior year and would've been higher but for the impacts of flooding. We expect cost to be the same or a bit higher in the second quarter. In addition to a longwall move at a Queensland met coal mine, weather-related mine plan changes at a number of locations are temporarily impacting productivity and cost for removal. We are targeting full year Australia cost per ton in the mid-60s range as our production increases and new capacity comes online.
We look forward to ramping up with an Australian shipment run rate for the remainder of the year that should 30% to 40% higher for the first quarter.
Turning to the U.S., strong demand increase in shipments of the quarter. PRB, Illinois Basin, Colorado and the Southwest all saw shipment increases. Year-over-year revenues were higher in the Midwest from contracts at the Bear Run and Wild Boar mines. Western revenues per ton eased on the combination of mix and some roll-off of via price contracts signed before the recession. 
We held the line on cost in the Midwest, with western cost effective by the timing of repairs as well as a longwall move in Colorado.
Overall, EBITDA contributions from the U.S. operations grossed 30% over the prior year. And we're looking for that trend to hold for the full year. Australia operations saw a 55% increase in EBITDA, and our trading a broker at rebounded for the fourth quarter, contributing more than $26 million.
Overall, our operating profit per ton rose 16%. Reviewing the balance sheet, our results led to cash flow from operations of $221 million, a 28%increase over the prior year. Our cash and short-term investment stand at a healthy $1.4 billion. And you'll recall that our capital spending is targeted at $900 million to $950 million with a majority slated for projects. We had a slower start to the year on capital given the weather challenges in Australia but expect spending to ramp up over the next 3 quarters.
I'd like to conclude by turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we see improvements in volume, revenues in EBITDA led by Australia. We are targeting second quarter EBITDA of $525 million to $625 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 to $1.10. Australian contributions will benefit from increased volumes, as well as record settlements for both metallurgical and thermal coal in Australia.
Our second quarter is likely to be impacted by residual effects of the Australia rains, as well as lower Colorado production related to geologic issues at 20-mile. 20-mile had -- just last week on the longwall tailgate section. We had no incidents or injuries but for safety reasons we stopped production. Our technical teams are working with -- on the best way to resume production. This involves a range of possibilities from added support near the tailgate to relocating the longwall. We may have significantly reduce longwall production coming from 20-mile in the second quarter.
The impacts of this could range from $25 million to $75 million between loss production and higher cost of relocated equipment.
For the year, we are targeting improvements in all major financial metrics. With EBITDA ranging from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of 350 to 450. We expect a tightness range as the year please proceeds. For now, our largest unknown related to met coal pricing in the third and fourth quarters. I would also refer you to our Reg E schedule on the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A, taxes and other line items.
It is clear we are looking at significant earnings increases year-over-year 15% to 40% EBITDA over 2010 levels and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. So with that review of our quarterly results and expectations, I will now turn the call over to Greg."

Following a strong start to what is expected to be a very good year, I'd like to discuss the dramatic events shaping the global coal markets along with the multiple growth initiative that Peabody has been advancing all over the world. 
Let's turn to one of the most active energy markets in recent memory. So far this year, heavy rains have limited shipments for most coal suppliers south of the equator. Australian met and thermal settlements have set new records. Oil prices have again surged and questions have been raised about the future of nuclear power and the emissions profile of shale gas.
With oil prices again over $100 per barrel, some have cited political unrest or the weak dollar to suggest this is temporary. To us, it is more basic. And the answer lies in limited supplies, major emerging market demand and developed country economies that have begun to recover. 
Now the very unfortunate event in Japan have a number of implications for coal. We see modest near-term dislocations on Japanese coal imports, our shift in coal use for steel mills and power plants elsewhere as they run at higher rates and added steel demand for the rebuilding effort. Longer term, however, all admissions are reviewing their nuclear programs, taking some nuclear plants off-line and looking hard at licensed extension request. 
Third-party reports indicate more than 600 gigawatts of nuclear power are currently under consideration. Now if coal satisfied half of that increase, it would translate to approximately 1 billion tons of increased annual demand. March numbers show a nation that is rapidly accelerating with industrial production up 15%, thermal generation rising 13% and imports stronger than February. China's first quarter GDP once again beat the pundits and grew at almost 10% clip. India's thermal coal imports rose 33% in the past 12 months. European coal markets are strengthening as gas prices escalate and nuclear plants go off-line. And global steel production is up some 10% year-to-date, which over the course of the year would require nearly 100 million tons of additional metallurgical coal. 
The supply side remains very tight, heavy rains removed some 30 million tons from the seaborne market in the first quarter for major exporting nations on 4 continents. Peabody resumed production more quickly than many and lost less than 1 million tons of shipments in the first quarter. And while all of Australia lost approximately 25 million tons in the first quarter, we're still looking for Australia to increase overall exports in 2011. And that's certainly true for Peabody we were targeting an increase of as much as 50% in our Australian exports this year.
Peabody was pleased to advance record settlements first tally in coal we've priced some 3 million tons of metallurgical coal with quarterly contracts in line with the $330 a ton benchmark. And for thermal coal, we're in the process of pricing 4 million to 5 million tons in line with the benchmark of nearly $130 per ton. This demonstrates good earnings power for the remainder of 2011 and nearly all of our 2012 met and thermal seaborne volumes are leveraged to these strong markets.
The longer term landscape is equally bright as we move through the early stages of a long-term super cycle, coal is expected to fuel more incremental generation over the next decade than gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, geothermal and solar combined. In fact, more than 700 gigawatts of coal plants or plant are under construction, representing nearly 2.5 billion tons of coal use. Most of this growth is in Asia and Peabody has a unique access to this region from Australia, Asia itself and the U.S.
Now Peabody's growth initiatives were as active as the global energy markets in the first quarter. Among other actions, we announced that throughput agreement were up to 24 million metric tons per year of our PRB coal through at a planned export facility in Washington state to serve the large, low CV market in the Pacific Rim. We see this market expanding by some 75% within 5 years. We announced two agreements to pursue development of large open cut mine projects with partners in China. And we were named to the short list of companies for potential development of a major block in the plan to Togo coal mine in Mongolia in what most believe to be one of the best undeveloped metallurgical coal deposits in the world.
We increased our sourcing agreements from Indonesia producers to support our growing trade platform. And we made progress in our multiple expansion projects in Australia. We are extending the new slope in -- the equipment for metropolitan expansion. We're constructing the prep plant expansion at Wupinyang  [ph] and we're moving for the box cut entry for the Burton extension.
Now there's a simple reason we're targeting Australia and Asia. Our view is that the Western Hemisphere will be a much smaller factor in the global coal growth story of the next decade. We are a growth company, and we believe that the Australia, Asia region will constitute more than 80% of the world's seaborne supply demand growth over the next 5 years.
Peabody's blend of organic growth and business development activities gives as a significant global growth platform. We continue to focus on several key objectives, increasing seaborne exporters, developing metallurgical coal production and expanding at the low end of the cost curve.
It is clear to me that this approach will lead to considerable earnings growth and further that set us apart from competition. Peabody looks forward to increases in the second quarter and even stronger earnings in the second half of 2011.
With that the position in the lowest cost and fastest growth regions within the U.S., and we have significant catalyst for growth and avenues to increase shareholder value over the short, medium and long-term. So with that summary, we'd be happy to take your questions at this time."

So ultimately, we still see met coal coming of Australia being very, very strong this year, as well as seeing what's going to happen with thermal coal.

But there's some reasons for that price couple of things, supply disruptions in Indonesia and Australia impacted the ability for China to take imports and receive those. Second, there was a dislocation in the pricing. Australia and Indonesian pricing was above fair price of what Chinese market. What happened since then of course, the Chinese didn't buy a lot of coal in the first quarter. Their stock piles were down 20% to 50% in the regions, their generation's up 10 plus percent on the coal side. So now their stockpiles are short back into the market buying coal the government is recently increased that euro rate on what prices in 16 of the provinces to make sure they can afford to buy coal in the market and we've seen the Xinjiang coal price go up significantly and seen a lot of interest in pricing. So as we look forward, we think the rest of the year were imports into China should be a lot more like last year."

Burton, we've got one of our pits that the very lowest level coal, we're still pumping the water to uncover that and we expect that will occur this quarter.

For expert capabilities. Our stockpiles are recovering, the last of the rail issues for us was the Wilkie Creek line. It was reopened right at the end of March. We're going through a bit of a ramp-up period as they continue to finalize the track repairs but that should be behind us in the course of another month at the most. So when you look at Port capacity right now, and rail capacity, those are not an impediment, particularly out of Queensland, there is capacity both on rail and port. The issue is other producers are still having production problems. So we're trying to be opportunistic in terms of using some of that capacity.

One is the NCIG expansion and completion of Phase I and the development of Phase II. The biggest component of that is the dredging work that's going on within the ship channel in order to allow the full delivery and loading of cape side vessels. That'll occur through the next couple of quarters of this year for the shipping capacity. And then there's some additional expansions on the stockpile area and loading facilities that'll carry over for a period of time. There's also some significant amount of rail work that's being entertained or done in New South Wales to increase rail capacity. And then longer term, there are discussions about additional expansion at PWCS and then potentially another new terminal four for longer term capacity. In Queensland, the big activity right now is what they call GAPE, which is the Goonyella Abbott Point Extension. That rail line is being built, the port activities are taking place. And that initially will add about 50 million tons of export capacity out of Abbott's point. And in the meantime, work continues regularly on rail expansions into the Goonyella line. And then we've recently seen the announcements on -- now going to an expansion over a couple year period of time. So we've always said that the Australian infrastructure will continue to expand. That's the good news and market demand is continuing to expand faster, that's the better news. But we do see overall growth, both out of New South Wales and Queensland, in terms of buy-ins over the next several years."

Peabody turned in very solid results in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit and earnings per share all rose sharply over the prior year. Our operating cash flows expanded further, and our balance",1123,"Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. Peabody turned in very solid results in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit and earnings per share all rose sharply over the prior year. Our operating cash flows expanded further, and our balance sheet's extremely strong. And we expect to grow from here as we target higher results over the balance of 2011.
Let's review the quarter, beginning with our income statement. Sales volume rose 5% to 61 million tons led by higher demand in the Powder River and Illinois basins. Australia volumes were predictably lower given the record flooding that we discussed on our last call, coupled with continuing rains in Queensland throughout the quarter. 
Higher U.S. volumes and increased metallurgical and thermal coal pricing in Australia drove a 15% increase in revenues to $1.7 billion. Even with the rains, Australia was the primary driver of a 17% increase in EBITDA to $416 million. Operating profit expanded 22% while net income climbed 32% to $177 million.
Our effective tax rate was 25% in the quarter, excluding currency remeasurement. And we are targeting the upper 20% range for the full year. Income from continuing operations rose to $180 million. Excluding the non-cash remeasurement of income taxes, our adjusted income was $186 million with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67, both significantly above the prior-year level.
Now let's review the building blocks of EBITDA in more detail on the supplemental income statement. I'll first turn to Australia, where we expected a lighter quarter for shipments. The substantial weather events that continued in the first quarter led to a 10% volume decrease from the same period in 2010. I'm pleased to report that all of our Australia mines are producing and shipping coal with the rail line that serves our Wilkie thermal coal mine coming back on line at the end of March. We are also beginning to rebuild Australian inventories.
Australian revenues rose 30%, demonstrating Peabody's leverage to rising seaborne pricing. The average revenue per ton rose 43% over the prior year and exceeded $100 per short ton. And these will both move higher with the rising benchmark prices. 
We sold 2.1 million tons of met coal in the first quarter at an average price of $186 per short ton, which was more than 50% higher than last year based on the benchmark price set last December. We also shipped 2.1 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average of $83 per short ton. 
Weather-related production effects were the largest items that impacted cost for the quarter. Other factors included increasing sales-related royalties, as well as a higher mix of met coal shipments and unfavorable exchange rate movements. Peabody remains approximately 75% hedged for the remainder of 2011 at approximately $0.80 for the A-dollar. 
First quarter Australia margins still rose 70% over the prior year and would've been higher but for the impacts of flooding. We expect cost to be the same or a bit higher in the second quarter. In addition to a longwall move at a Queensland met coal mine, weather-related mine plan changes at a number of locations are temporarily impacting productivity and cost for overburden removal. We are targeting full year Australia cost per ton in the mid-60s range as our production increases and new capacity comes online. We look forward to ramping up with an Australia shipment run rate for the remainder of the year that should be 30% to 40% higher than the first quarter.
Turning to the U.S., strong demand drove an increase in shipments in the quarter. PRB, Illinois Basin, Colorado and the Southwest all saw shipment increases. Year-over-year, revenues were higher in the Midwest from contracts at the Bear Run and Wild Boar mines. Western revenues per ton eased on the combination of mix and some roll-off of higher-priced contracts signed before the recession. 
We held the line on costs in the Midwest, with western costs affected by the timing of repairs as well as a longwall move in Colorado.
Overall, EBITDA contributions from the U.S. operations rose 3% over the prior year, and we're looking for that trend to hold the full year. Australia operations saw a 55% increase in EBITDA, and our Trading and Brokerage activities rebounded from the fourth quarter, contributing more than $26 million. Overall, our operating profit per ton rose 16%. 
Reviewing the balance sheet, our results led to cash flow from operations of $221 million, a 28% increase over the prior year. Our cash and short-term investments stand at a healthy $1.4 billion. And you'll recall that our capital spending is targeted at $900 million to $950 million, with the majority slated for growth projects. We had a slower start to the year on capital given the weather challenges in Australia, but expect spending to ramp up over the next 3 quarters.
I'd like to conclude by turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we see improvements in volume, revenues and EBITDA led by Australia. We are targeting second quarter EBITDA of $525 million to $625 million, and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 to $1.10. Australian contributions will benefit from increased volumes, as well as record settlements for both metallurgical and thermal coal in Australia.
Our second quarter is likely to be impacted by residual effects of the Australia rains, as well as lower Colorado production related to geologic issues at Twentymile. Twentymile had a filler squeeze just last week on the longwall tailgate section. We had no incidents or injuries, but for safety reasons, we stopped production. Our technical teams are working with MSHA [U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration] on the best way to resume production. This involves a range of possibilities, from added support near the tailgate to relocating the longwall. We may have significantly reduced longwall production coming from Twentymile in the second quarter. The impacts of this could range from $25 million to $75 million between lost production and higher cost to relocate equipment.
For the year, we are targeting improvements in all major financial metrics, with EBITDA ranging from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect to tighten this range as the year proceeds. For now, our largest unknown relates to met coal pricing in the third and fourth quarters. I would also refer you to our Reg G [ph] schedule on the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A, taxes and other line items.
It is clear that we are looking at significant earnings increases year-over-year, from 15% to 40% for EBITDA over 2010 levels, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. 
So with that review of our quarterly results and expectations, I will now turn the call over to Greg."

Following a strong start to what is expected to be a very good year, I'd like to discuss the dramatic events shaping the global coal markets, along with the multiple growth initiative that Peabody has been advancing all over the world. 
Let's turn to one of the most active energy markets in recent memory. So far this year, heavy rains have limited shipments from most coal suppliers south of the equator. Australian met and thermal sediments have set new records. Oil prices have again surged, and questions have been raised about the future of nuclear power and the emissions profile of shale gas.
With oil prices again over $100 per barrel, some have cited political unrest or the weak dollar to suggest this is temporary. To us, it is more basic, and the answer lies in limited supplies, major emerging market demand and developed country economies that have begun to recover. 
Now the very unfortunate events in Japan have a number of implications for coal. We see modest near-term dislocations on Japanese coal imports; a shift in coal use for steel mills and power plants elsewhere as they run at higher rates; and added steel demand for the rebuilding effort. 
Longer-term, however, all nations are reviewing their nuclear programs, taking some nuclear plants off-line, and looking hard at license extension requests. Third-party reports indicate more than 600 gigawatts of nuclear power are currently under consideration. Now if coal satisfied half that increase, it would translate to approximately 1 billion tons of increased annual demand. 
China's March numbers show a nation that is rapidly accelerating with industrial production up 15%, thermal generation rising 13% and imports stronger than February. China's first quarter GDP once again beat the pundits and grew at almost 10% clip. India's thermal coal imports rose 33% in the past 12 months. European coal markets are strengthening as gas prices escalate and nuclear plants go off-line. And global steel production is up some 10% year-to-date, which over the course of the year, would require nearly 100 million tons of additional metallurgical coal. 
The supply side remains very tight. Heavy rains removed some 30 million tons from the seaborne market in the first quarter for major exporting nations on 4 continents. Peabody resumed production more quickly than many, and lost less than 1 million tons of shipments in the first quarter. And while all of Australia lost approximately 25 million tons in the first quarter, we're still looking for Australia to increase overall exports in 2011. And that's certainly true for Peabody, while we're targeting an increase of as much as 50% in our Australian exports this year.
Peabody was pleased to advance record settlements for Australian coal. We've priced some 3 million tons of metallurgical coal with quarterly contracts in line with the $330-a-ton benchmark. And for thermal coal, we're in the process of pricing 4 million to 5 million tons in line with the benchmark of nearly $130 per ton. This demonstrates good earnings power for the remainder of 2011, and nearly all of our 2012 met and thermal seaborne volumes are leveraged to these strong markets.
The longer-term landscape is equally bright. As we move through the early stages of a long-term super cycle, coal is expected to fuel more incremental generation over the next decade than gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, geothermal and solar combined. In fact, more than 700 gigawatts of coal plants are planned or under construction, representing nearly 2.5 billion tons of coal use. Most of this growth is in Asia, and Peabody has a unique access to this region from Australia, Asia itself and the U.S.
Now Peabody's growth initiatives were as active as the global energy markets in the first quarter. Among other actions, we announced a throughput agreement for up to 24 million metric tons per year of our PRB coal through at a planned export facility in Washington State to serve the large low-CV market in the Pacific Rim. We see this market expanding by some 75% within 5 years. 
We announced two agreements to pursue development of large open-cut mine projects with partners in China. And we were named to the short list of companies for potential development of a major block in the planned Tavan Tolgoi coal mine in Mongolia, in what most believe to be one of the best undeveloped metallurgical coal deposits in the world.
We increased our sourcing agreements from Indonesian producers to support our growing trade platform. And we made progress in our multiple expansion projects in Australia. We are extending the new slope and ordered the equipment for our Metropolitan expansion. We're constructing the prep plant expansion at Wilpinjong, and we're moving overburden for the box cut entry for the Burton extension.
Now there's a simple reason we're targeting Australia and Asia. Our view is that the Western Hemisphere will be a much smaller factor in the global coal growth story over the next decade. We are a growth company, and we believe that the Australia-Asia region will constitute more than 80% of the world's seaborne supply demand growth over the next 5 years.
Peabody's blend of organic growth and business development activities gives as a significant global growth platform. We continue to focus on several key objectives: Increasing seaborne exports, developing metallurgical coal production and expanding at the low end of the cost curve.
It is clear to me that this approach will lead to considerable earnings growth and further set us apart from competition. Peabody looks forward to increases in the second quarter and even stronger earnings in the second half of 2011. We've got the leading position in the lowest cost and fastest growth regions of the U.S., and we have significant catalyst for growth and avenues to increase shareholder value over the short, medium and long-term. 
So with that summary, we'd be happy to take your questions at this time."

As you look at Australia overall, as Greg said at the beginning of his remarks, we expect Australian exports to still be higher than last year. So ultimately, we still see met coal coming of Australia being very, very strong this year, as well as seeing what's going to happen with thermal coal.

But there's some reasons for that. Obviously, just price -- a couple of things, supply disruptions in Indonesia and Australia impacted the ability for China to take imports and receive those. Second, there was a dislocation in the pricing. Australian and Indonesian pricing was above fare repricing of the Chinese markets. What's happened since then, of course, is the Chinese didn't buy a lot of coal in the first quarter. Their stockpiles went down 20% to 50% in the regions, their generation's up 10-plus percent on the coal side. So now their stockpiles are short, they're back in the market buying coal. The government has recently increased the tariff rate on electricity prices in 16 of the provinces to make sure they can afford to buy coal in the open market. And we've seen the Xing Wan Dao [ph] coal price go up significantly, and seen a lot of interested pricing.

From our operating perspective, I mean, we've got all of our operations, except for Burton, are essentially up to full productive capacity. Burton, we've got one of our pits that the very lowest level coal seam, we're still pumping the water to uncover that, and we expect that will occur this quarter. But essentially, Burton is back into production from the upper seams, it's just hampering our full flexibility. So we see a strong shipping quarter this quarter, and then building through the back half of the year. For instance, our Wilpinjong expansion should provide additional tonnage in the fourth quarter of this year for export capabilities. Our stockpiles are recovering. The last of the rail issues for us was the Wilkie Creek line. It was reopened right at the end of March. We're going through a bit of a ramp-up period as they continue to finalize the track repairs, but that should be behind us in the course of another month at the most. So when you look at port capacity right now, and rail capacity, those are not an impediment. Particularly out of Queensland, there is capacity both on rail and port. The issue is other producers are still having production problems. So we're trying to be opportunistic in terms of using some of that capacity. New South Wales, I think right now most people are up and running. There's a couple of unique situations with a mine that had some underground water issues and another one that's got some underground fire issues.

Peabody turned in very solid results in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit and earnings per share all rose sharply over the prior year. Our operating cash flows expanded further, and our balance",1125,"Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. Peabody turned in very solid results in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit and earnings per share all rose sharply over the prior year. Our operating cash flows expanded further, and our balance sheet's extremely strong. And we expect to grow from here as we target higher results over the balance of 2011.
Let's review the quarter, beginning with our income statement. Sales volume rose 5% to 61 million tons led by higher demand in the Powder River and Illinois basins. Australia volumes were predictably lower given the record flooding that we discussed on our last call, coupled with continuing rains in Queensland throughout the quarter. 
Higher U.S. volumes and increased metallurgical and thermal coal pricing in Australia drove a 15% increase in revenues to $1.7 billion. Even with the rains, Australia was the primary driver of a 17% increase in EBITDA to $416 million. Operating profit expanded 22% while net income climbed 32% to $177 million.
Our effective tax rate was 25% in the quarter, excluding currency remeasurement. And we are targeting the upper 20% range for the full year. Income from continuing operations rose to $180 million. Excluding the non-cash remeasurement of income taxes, our adjusted income was $186 million with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67, both significantly above the prior-year level.
Now let's review the building blocks of EBITDA in more detail on the supplemental income statement. I'll first turn to Australia, where we expected a lighter quarter for shipments. The substantial weather events that continued in the first quarter led to a 10% volume decrease from the same period in 2010. I'm pleased to report that all of our Australia mines are producing and shipping coal with the rail line that serves our Wilkie Creek thermal coal mine coming back on line at the end of March. We are also beginning to rebuild Australian inventories.
Australian revenues rose 30%, demonstrating Peabody's leverage to rising seaborne pricing. The average revenue per ton rose 43% over the prior year and exceeded $100 per short ton. And these will both move higher with the rising benchmark prices. 
We sold 2.1 million tons of met coal in the first quarter at an average price of $186 per short ton, which was more than 50% higher than last year based on the benchmark price set last December. We also shipped 2.1 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average of $83 per short ton. 
Weather-related production effects were the largest items that impacted cost for the quarter. Other factors included increasing sales-related royalties, as well as a higher mix of met coal shipments and unfavorable exchange rate movements. Peabody remains approximately 75% hedged for the remainder of 2011 at approximately $0.80 for the A-dollar. 
First quarter Australia margins still rose 70% over the prior year and would have been higher but for the impacts of flooding. We expect cost to be the same or a bit higher in the second quarter. In addition to a longwall move at a Queensland met coal mine, weather-related mine plan changes at a number of locations are temporarily impacting productivity and cost for overburden removal. We are targeting full year Australia cost per ton in the mid-60s range as our production increases and new capacity comes online. We look forward to ramping up with an Australia shipment run rate for the remainder of the year that should be 30% to 40% higher than the first quarter.
Turning to the U.S., strong demand drove an increase in shipments in the quarter. PRB, Illinois Basin, Colorado and the Southwest all saw shipment increases. Year-over-year, revenues were higher in the Midwest from contracts at the Bear Run and Wild Boar mines. Western revenues per ton eased on the combination of mix and some roll-off of higher-priced contracts signed before the recession. 
We held the line on costs in the Midwest, with western costs affected by the timing of repairs as well as a longwall move in Colorado.
Overall, EBITDA contributions from the U.S. operations rose 3% over the prior year, and we're looking for that trend to hold the full year. Australia operations saw a 55% increase in EBITDA, and our Trading and Brokerage activities rebounded from the fourth quarter, contributing more than $26 million. Overall, our operating profit per ton rose 16%. 
Reviewing the balance sheet, our results led to cash flow from operations of $221 million, a 28% increase over the prior year. Our cash and short-term investments stand at a healthy $1.4 billion. And you'll recall that our capital spending is targeted at $900 million to $950 million, with the majority slated for growth projects. We had a slower start to the year on capital given the weather challenges in Australia but expect spending to ramp up over the next 3 quarters.
I'd like to conclude by turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we see improvements in volume, revenues and EBITDA led by Australia. We are targeting second quarter EBITDA of $525 million to $625 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 to $1.10. Australian contributions will benefit from increased volumes, as well as record settlements for both metallurgical and thermal coal in Australia.
Our second quarter is likely to be impacted by residual effects of the Australia rains, as well as lower Colorado production related to geologic issues at Twentymile. Twentymile mine had a filler squeeze just last week on the longwall tailgate section. We had no incidents or injuries, but for safety reasons, we stopped production. Our technical teams are working with MSHA [U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration] on the best way to resume production. This involves a range of possibilities, from added support near the tailgate to relocating the longwall. We may have significantly reduced longwall production coming from Twentymile in the second quarter. The impacts of this could range from $25 million to $75 million between lost production and higher cost to relocate equipment.
For the year, we are targeting improvements in all major financial metrics, with EBITDA ranging from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect to tighten this range as the year proceeds. For now, our largest unknown relates to met coal pricing in the third and fourth quarters. I would also refer you to our Reg G schedule in the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A, taxes and other line items.
It is clear that we are looking at significant earnings increases year-over-year, from 15% to 40% for EBITDA over 2010 levels, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. 
So with that review of our quarterly results and expectations, I will now turn the call over to Greg."

Following a strong start to what is expected to be a very good year, I'd like to discuss the dramatic events shaping the global coal markets, along with the multiple growth initiative that Peabody has been advancing all over the world. 
Let's turn to one of the most active energy markets in recent memory. So far this year, heavy rains have limited shipments from most coal suppliers south of the equator. Australian met and thermal sediments have set new records. Oil prices have again surged, and questions have been raised about the future of nuclear power and the emissions profile of shale gas.
With oil prices again over $100 per barrel, some have cited political unrest or the weak dollar to suggest this is temporary. To us, it is more basic, and the answer lies in limited supplies, major emerging market demand and developed country economies that have begun to recover. 
Now the very unfortunate events in Japan have a number of implications for coal. We see modest near-term dislocations on Japanese coal imports; a shift in coal use for steel mills and power plants elsewhere as they run at higher rates; and added steel demand for the rebuilding effort. 
Longer-term, however, all nations are reviewing their nuclear programs, taking some nuclear plants off-line, and looking hard at license extension requests. Third-party reports indicate more than 600 gigawatts of nuclear power are currently under consideration. Now if coal satisfied half that increase, it would translate to approximately 1 billion tons of increased annual demand. 
China's March numbers show a nation that is rapidly accelerating with industrial production up 15%, thermal generation rising 13% and imports stronger than February. China's first quarter GDP once again beat the pundits and grew at almost 10% clip. India's thermal coal imports rose 33% in the past 12 months. European coal markets are strengthening as gas prices escalate and nuclear plants go off-line. And global steel production is up some 10% year-to-date, which over the course of a year, would require nearly 100 million tons of additional metallurgical coal. 
The supply side remains very tight. Heavy rains removed some 30 million tons from the seaborne market in the first quarter for major exporting nations on 4 continents. Peabody resumed production more quickly than many and lost less than 1 million tons of shipments in the first quarter. And while all of Australia lost approximately 25 million tons in the first quarter, we're still looking for Australia to increase overall exports in 2011. And that's certainly true for Peabody, while we're targeting an increase of as much as 15% in our Australian exports this year.
Peabody was pleased to advance record settlements for Australian coal. We've priced some 3 million tons of metallurgical coal with quarterly contracts in line with the $330-a-ton benchmark. And for thermal coal, we're in the process of pricing 4 million to 5 million tons in line with the benchmark of nearly $130 per ton. This demonstrates good earnings power for the remainder of 2011, and nearly all of our 2012 met and thermal seaborne volumes are leveraged to these strong markets.
The longer-term landscape is equally bright. As we move through the early stages of a long-term super cycle, coal is expected to fuel more incremental generation over the next decade than gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, geothermal and solar combined. In fact, more than 700 gigawatts of coal plants are planned or under construction, representing nearly 2.5 billion tons of coal use. Most of this growth is in Asia, and Peabody has a unique access to this region from Australia, Asia itself and the U.S.
Now Peabody's growth initiatives were as active as the global energy markets in the first quarter. Among other actions, we announced a throughput agreement for up to 24 million metric tons per year of our PRB coal through a planned export facility in Washington State to serve the large low-CV market in the Pacific Rim. We see this market expanding by some 75% within 5 years. 
We announced 2 agreements to pursue development of large open-cut mine projects with partners in China. And we were named to the short list of companies for potential development of a major block in the planned Tavan Tolgoi coal mine in Mongolia, in what most believe to be one of the best undeveloped metallurgical coal deposits in the world.
We increased our sourcing agreements from Indonesian producers to support our growing trade platform. And we made progress in our multiple expansion projects in Australia. We are extending the new slope and ordered the equipment for our Metropolitan expansion. We're constructing the prep plant expansion at Wilpinjong, and we're moving overburden for the box cut entry for the Burton extension.
Now there's a simple reason we're targeting Australia and Asia. Our view is that the Western Hemisphere will be a much smaller factor in the global coal growth story over the next decade. We are a growth company, and we believe that the Australia-Asia region will constitute more than 80% of the world's seaborne supply demand growth over the next 5 years.
Peabody's blend of organic growth and business development activities gives us a significant global growth platform. We continue to focus on several key objectives: increasing seaborne exports, developing metallurgical coal production and expanding at the low end of the cost curve.
It is clear to me that this approach will lead to considerable earnings growth and further set us apart from the competition. Peabody looks forward to increases in the second quarter and even stronger earnings in the second half of 2011. We've got the leading position in the lowest cost and fastest growth regions of the U.S., and we have significant catalyst for growth and avenues to increase shareholder value over the short-, medium- and long-term. 
So with that summary, we'd be happy to take your questions at this time."

So there's capacity there. Steel prices have gone up and given you enough margin from the steel production to get that done. As you look at Australia overall, as Greg said at the beginning of his remarks, we expect Australian exports to still be higher than last year. So ultimately, we still see met coal coming out of Australia being very, very strong this year, as well as seeing what's going to happen with thermal coal. Having said that, there's obviously still companies that are still having mines that are force majeure, so a little bit that's left to be seen for the rest of the year."

But there's some reasons for that. Obviously, the price -- a couple of things, supply disruptions in Indonesia and Australia impacted the ability for China to take imports and receive those. Second, there was a dislocation in the pricing. Australian and Indonesian pricing was above fair repricing of the Chinese markets. What's happened since then, of course, is the Chinese didn't buy a lot of coal in the first quarter. Their stockpiles went down 20% to 50% in the regions, their generation's up 10-plus percent on the coal side. So now their stockpiles are short, they're back in the market buying coal. The government has recently increased the tariff rate on electricity prices in 16 of the provinces to make sure that they can afford to buy coal in the open market. And we've seen the Xing Wan Dao [ph] coal price go up significantly, and seen a lot of interested pricing.

If we're only down for 3 weeks or so, then that longwall move will still be in this year. So again, as we look at the guidance range for the full year, we have to take that into account. Not having an answer yet."

I don't have a sense, because we don't have the detailed knowledge in terms of all of our other competitors in Australia. From our operating perspective, I mean, we've got all of our operations, except for Burton, are essentially up to full productive capacity. Burton, we've got one of our pits that the very lowest level coal seam, we're still pumping the water to uncover that, and we expect that will occur this quarter. But essentially, Burton is back into production from the upper seams, it's just hampering our full flexibility. So we see a strong shipping quarter this quarter, and then building through the back half of the year. For instance, our Wilpinjong expansion should provide additional tonnage in the fourth quarter of this year for export capabilities. Our stockpiles are recovering. The last of the rail issues for us was the Wilkie Creek line. It was reopened right at the end of March. We're going through a bit of a ramp-up period as they continue to finalize the track repairs, but that should be behind us in the course of another month at the most. So when you look at port capacity right now, and rail capacity, those are not an impediment. Particularly out of Queensland, there is capacity both on rail and port. The issue is other producers are still having production problems. So we're trying to be opportunistic in terms of using some of that capacity. New South Wales, I think right now most people are up and running. There's a couple of unique situations with a mine that had some underground water issues and another one that's got some underground fire issues.

The operating profit income EPS are all up shortly over the prior year's. This performance comes in the face of a number external issues in the first half. So we were targeting even greater results in the last 6 months of 2011. And are on a clear path towards the best year in our history. Let's review our second quarter beginning with the income statement.
Peabody started a new mark for revenues exceeding $2 billion in the quarter revenues increased 21% and were higher across the board. U.S. mining, Australian mining and trading and brokerage, even with mining sales on par with last year. EBITDA increased 32% to $580 million, which includes a $25 million provision or $0.06 per share related to a pending resolution of outstanding litigation. 
Australia led the way, with 69% increase in EBITDA. Our Australia operations contributed more than 60% of Peabody's mining EBITDA in the second quarter. Higher EBITDA led to a 41% rise in operating profit of $458 million. And net income increased 36% to $292 million.
Excluding the non-cash remeasurement of income taxes, our adjusted income was $308 million, with a $1.11 in adjusted diluted EPS, that's a 61% increase of the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter excluding the effects of income tax remeasurement, and we are targeting the mid-20% range for the full year.
I'll now discuss some additional detail within the supplemental income statement. In Australia, our volumes rose 8% over the prior year while revenue per ton climbed 38% to more than $128 per ton, on increase realizations for both metallurgical and thermal coal. We sold 2.3 million tons of met coal in the second quarter in an average price of $246 per short ton, a 50% increase over the prior year.
We also shipped 3 million of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average of $97 per short ton, up 16% over last year. We have roughly $37 million in EBITDA impacts related to the Australia weather effects on the coal chain. Most of which resulted for co-shipper vessels. Those our way multiple producers to load before shipping. Regarding Australia's cost increase for the quarter, while we're largely hedged on currency, the Australian dollar rose 26% over the same period last year. Also, with higher coal prices increased royalties. These 2 factors combined to increase our Australian cost $9 per ton.
We're also impacted by the beginning of a longwall move in Queensland, as well as normal cost escalations. We were expecting full year per ton cost in the upper 60s, with costs rising somewhat on higher exchange rates while also benefiting the fourth quarter from our Wilpinjong expansion. Finally, Australia margins rose to nearly $55 per ton, representing a robust 43% EBITDA margin.
Turning to the U.S., volumes were constrained in the quarter, first by heavy rains in the Midwest and then by flooding across the Missouri River Valley that hampered western shipments, lowering EBITDA by a $36 million. We were down nearly 4 million tons from our PRB and Illinois Basin expectations. Higher revenues per ton in the Midwest helped to drive a 23% margin per ton expansion. In the West, cost were impacted by the reduced PRB shipments and the geology challenge at Twentymile we discussed last quarter. Through advance engineering and execution we were able to quickly resume longwall operations and limit the impact to $34 million.
Both Trading and Brokerage and Resource Management had solid quarters, posting a combined $74 million in EBITDA. Trading benefited from higher margins on a greater mix of export volumes. The combined benefit of all segments resulted in a 45% increase in operating profit per ton to $7.88.
We generated $395 million in cash flow from operations, a 35% increase over the prior year. We have $1.25 billion in cash, short-term investments and a combined $2.7 million in liquidity. And with the retirement of $218 million of bond in April, our total debt-to-cap ratio has declined to 32%. We continue to target capital spending for 2011 at $900 million to $950 million. We are also in an excellent position to implement our new growth initiatives, which Greg will address in a moment.
I'd like to close with a review of our outlook. For the third quarter, we are looking for continued higher results and target EBITDA of $575 million to $675 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 to $1.25 per share.
Our third quarter is likely to be impacted, as U.S. railroads recover from the flooding, as well as ongoing co-shipper risks in Australia. For the year, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS targets to $4.20 to $4.60 with EBITDA targets now ranging from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. I would also refer you to our Reg E schedule in the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A and other line items.
With that look at the quarter and our new targets, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

You have seen a start to 2011 better than any year ever and we're targeting of a second half EBITDA that could rise another 30% to 50%. Peabody also continues to add to a global platform that is the best in the business.
I'll review the market fundamentals and then discuss significant activity on the global growth initiatives that I believe will further differentiate Peabody as the world's premiere coal company. What strikes us about the global markets is how much our underlying thesis is proven from quarter-to-quarter. And how events change but the outlook stays the same. 
The world remains in the year of stages of a long period of major demand growth and so-called onetime events in the industry that constrained supply now occur each quarter. Global coal demand remains robust, world steel production is up 8% year-to-date. Globally, the world will use an additional 70 million to 80 million of metallurgical coal this year. Electricity generation is rising rapidly in developing countries. And coal is backfilling for nuclear power in Europe.
China remains a cornerstone of growth, first-half GDP grew 9.6%. Electricity generation increased 14% and steel output was up 10%. Last quarter, there was concern over an easing of China imports to get imports have now risen for 4 straight months and we believe we're on a pace for a stronger second half. 
India is now the world's fastest-growing importer, their thermal coal imports were up 45% year-to-date. Europe is increasing thermal coal imports as Germany closes its nuclear plants and coal displaces high price gas. An escalating demand growth continue to strangle supplies to the point where any external events take on magnified importance. Labor stoppages, rains, permitting challenges and transportation issues are common. Strong near-term fundamentals have kept international pricing near record levels for both met and thermal products, with recent settlements coming in higher than most expected.
Longer term, the world could need more than 500 million tonnes of additional met coal per year by 2020. And some 700 gigawatts of new coal fuel electricity generation is expected to be online by 2020 requiring well over 2 billion tonnes of additional thermal coal. Just consider this, China's 12 5-year plan targets $100 billion in and investments in generation transmission and subway construction activities by 2015.
Now in the United States slight economic growth in industrial output translate into weak demand overall. But there are encouraging signs. Powder River Basin and the base in to serve new plants and existing plants that are switching from Appalachia and coal. We are seeing new Illinois Basin customers from New York to Florida. And export demand continues to rise for all coal products. We are increasing our PRB shipments this year from the Gulf and West Coast, and we recently sold Illinois Basin coal to India.
On a supply-side, Mike noted that flooding is affecting the river market, as well as Western rail shipments coming East. This has led to significantly above average stock pile recently. With a tight supply demand fixturing and favorable long-term market outlook, Peabody is in the midst of the largest global growth program in the company's history. Our approach is to continue to expand our platform in the regions that serve the fastest-growing markets through organic growth, joint ventures and acquisitions.
And you have seen this plan demonstrated by progress in multiple fronts in recent days. Last week, we initiated a takeover proposal from Macarthur Coal through our joint venture with Arcellor Mittal. We like MacArthur asset base and leading longwall PCI position. And we believe our operating commercial and project management skills will be a good fit for MacArthur's active mines and growth potential. 
In addition to M&A, Peabody remains active in organic growth as we expand the current Australian platform to 35 million to 40 million tons by the 2014 to 2015 timeframe. The first expansion project will be completed in the fourth quarter this year at our Wilpinjong Mine. And we have additional increases in Australia production slated over each of the next several years.
Also in Australia we agreed to buy the remaining 5% of the Burton Mine giving us additional access to met coal sales. In Mongolia, Peabody was selected by the government as part of the consortium to develop the Western bloc of Tavan Tolgoi along with a Russian railway group and China and what it will be an equity partner in the project and are working on finalizing the structure and commercial terms, which then require government and parliament approval.
This process began with more than 20 companies, so we view this selection as confirmation of our rising global presence and high mining standards. In China, we announced that we're pursuing development of a $50 million-ton per year surface mine in partnership with the Jun Jang [ph] provincial government. Produced 100 million tons of coal last year yet is expected to reach 1 billion tons per year over time. That's equivalent to nearly the entire U.S. production base.
The government is very supportive and has committed to accelerate the allocation of coal resources for the project. In the U.S., we were named last week as the winning bidder on a $220 million-ton reserve block in the Powder River Basin. The PRB remains a cornerstone of Peabody's production mix. We feel this quality coal will be increasingly valuable as it backfills in the U.S. market while the product is increasingly exported to Asia. We also believe that low sulfur coals will be increasingly valuable given the most recently proposed EPA regulations.
And finally, we're expanding commercial discussions with Asian customers for the proposed Gateway Pacific terminal where we have a 24 million-ton per year throughput agreement. We've continued to be encouraged by the widespread support for the project.
So taken together, Peabody's growth initiatives will allow us to achieve our Asia 100 vision. They also represent the new shape of our company, one that has been building since we began our international focus in 2004. We've opened up offices and trade centers, put in place dedicated teams on multiple continents, developed deep financial reserves in capacity and have conducted exhaustive analysis of markets, geologies and companies. 
We are now taking this international activity to the logical next step. Even as we continue to deliver the results that earn us the right to grow. So that's a review of our results, the markets and our growth projects. At this time, Mike, Rick and I will be pleased to take your questions."

The preliminary numbers would indicate that surface operations have a much less impact than some of the deep gassy underground mines. The government is talking about assistance in transition packages for the deep gassy mines, which is in the process of being finalized. So those are mitigated over a period of time. So at the end of the day, as we look at the carbon tax, we have factored that into our activities in Australia. One of the main points that we look at is to the extent that those carbon taxes increase cost, that the best way to offset those is to consolidate and provide synergies or extract synergies that's part of the main initiatives relative to the Macarthur transaction. And as we continue to expand our brownfield expansions in Australia, it allows us to also extract lower cost because of increased volumes. At the end of the day, we as a company, and the coal association, are very strongly opposed to the carbon tax. We don't think it's the right policy framework to move forward with. But in terms of specific numbers, it's too early to really come out with any modeled impacts on a specific basis."

Basically, on the met side, we've seen the 2 highest prices in history in the last 2 quarters, the 330 and 315 settlement obviously some of that's driven by the fragile supply and demand. That goes forward some of that's because of the weather in Australia. We have seen customers try to get ahead of that I mean most of it's been based on quarterly pricing. But I think it was an easier settlement than most thought in the last quarter at 315 because there is shortage. And I think most people underestimated the time it was going to take for Australia to recover because of the flooding. And frankly, we're still recovering. We're not seeing a lot of other producers that still are not delivering the coal, which is causing shipment delays and other issues. So I think we still see a strong number coming up in the next quarter. And really, over time, we still continue to believe there's a structural shortage of metallurgical coal that's going to drive a strong pricing and high margins in that piece of business for a long time to come. As we look at the Powder River basin, what we've seen some of the fundamental as we've seen flooding that has begun to bring down the inventories of the PRB burners, we think probably by the end of the summer, that there will probably at the lowest point for stockpiles that they've been in 3 years. As a result of that, we've seen the forward pricing on PRB move up substantially look out about 2014, 2013, you're seeing numbers that's high as almost $18 per ton. So you see strong contangos, strong movement up as you these stockpiles are coming down. And that doesn't even factor in what we think would be the next move in PRB, which is the fact that if these new EPA rules go forward and they go into effect January of 2012, which they're supposed going to affect require significant rebalancing of burn towards low sulfur coal to meet the standards. And having ultra low sulfur coal PRB 0.5 type coal is going to be very strong. And we'll see a return to the premiums that you used to see several years ago for the differences between some of the PRB products. So we think the price is today are probably even understated because of the value they'll have going forward so we feel very strongly about PRB pricing looking forward."

Well, I appreciate the question because I think we need to provide a bit of clarity. If you look at the difference between the third quarter and fourth quarter, in the third quarter, as we've established our guidance, the things that we took into consideration is we've got 2 longwall moves in the third quarter. We've got a longwall move, we started at North Goonyella, which will go into the pits. It's going through the third quarter now. And then we will have a longwall move in our Metropolitan Mine. These are our 2 big met coal mines in Australia. So those will be completed in the third quarter. Those operations will be up and running in the fourth quarter. So obviously, there's a difference in volumes and revenue streams between the 2 quarters, just between those 2 operations alone. We also have our Wilpinjong expansion coming online in the fourth quarter so that will boost our volumes out of New South Wales into the thermal market, most of that expansion will be heavily weighted towards additional export coal. And in addition, we expect additional volumes in the fourth quarter out of our millennium project, versus what we are going to get in the third quarter. We anticipate getting all the final regulatory approvals late this quarter so that we can begin ramping that project up in the fourth quarter. So I'll net-net, those are some of the major differences between the Australian platform into the two quarters. Then you move to the U.S., we anticipate residual impacts in the Powder River Basin during the third quarter because of the railroad issues, both the UP and the BN still have significant parts to their system that are not fully operational. A lot of rerouting that's going on which is causing delays in the entire Western rail system so that everybody is below where they would anticipate being at this point in time. And we expect that's probably going to continue in variable form through August and some cases maybe in September. And that should be pretty well cleaned out in fourth quarter back to normal. In addition for us, Twentymile is just now starting to reach its full strides. We expect that to continue to perform at higher levels through this quarter and then fourth quarter get back to its very high productivity levels as we get into a different geologic zones in that panel. So you start adding those differences up and you can see why we have our third quarter estimates where they're at, but a much significantly improved fourth quarter."

Some of that will be mitigated by what we expect to be higher or even if keep stable exchange rates with our hedge position a bit lower as you move further out beyond the 6 to 12 month period.

And the ports have had capacity, certainly out of Queensland. So overall, we're expecting to get at least from our platform closer to normalized levels. The biggest risk that we face is what we call co-shipper risk in Australia where particularly in the met coal side of the business, these vessels that get loaded have in some cases 2 or 3 different producers loaded into the vessel to the extent that other producers are still struggling that can delay the timing of those vessels.

So as we look at how do you continue to sustain the level of production, I mean, really, when you're producing 140 million to 150 million tons a year of PRB coal, you have to continue to replace that reserve base. So it isn't any surprise, shouldn't be any surprise that for any lease sale out there, we're going to actively look at those reserves, look at their proximity to our operations, how they could be integrated into our operations in order to not only provide longevity but also the potential to expand as the economy here in this country recovers and exports become a much bigger component of PRB in the longer term."

When you look at the last 4 months of Chinese imports, they are strong as they were at the end of last year and we anticipate they will continue to strengthen through the back half of this year. China is still talking about having rolling blackouts over the next several months because of a lack of coal and continue to import coal. The first couple of months in the year in terms of the import was really an issue about pricing of electricity in China. And the availability of coal because of issues out of Australia and Indonesia in terms of shipping locations. So I would tell you that our view is that it's going to be a strong back half. It's going to continue to be strong. And China's going to continue to grow their imports as part of their coal sourcing strategies over the future time period. So at the end of the day, we feel very strongly about what's happening there. The infrastructure issues in China, let's just take for a minute talk about the project that we just signed this past week in Xinjiang province. We're talking about a 50 million-ton a year operation of thermal coal. And it's a bit of a domino effect. All of that goal is going to go to the central provinces and the central provinces will then be able to ship a bit more to their coast that will help a little bit to balance the demand that's growing in China for electricity across the southern provinces. But rail lines have to be built, power lines for moving coal by wire have to be built. So the infrastructure issues in China, the demand for energy in China are just Herculean tasks to try and meet. So we don't see where that's going to be overnight in fact that's part of their issues. Lastly, just coming back to the imports for a minute, the VAT tax that they've had an imports is something to watch because they are doing everything they can to incentivize additional imports to keep from having the kind of power outages that we're seeing."

Once again, Peabody turned in a quarter with significant increases in all key income statement measures. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit, income, EPS are all up sharply over the prior year. This performance come",864,"Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. Once again, Peabody turned in a quarter with significant increases in all key income statement measures. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit, income, EPS are all up sharply over the prior year. This performance comes in the face of a number of external issues in the first half, so we were targeting even greater results in the last 6 months of 2011, and are on a [ph] clear path toward the best year in our history. Let's review our second quarter beginning with the income statement.
Peabody set a new mark for revenues exceeding $2 billion in the quarter. Revenues increased 21% and were higher across the board: U.S. mining, Australian mining and trading and brokerage, even  with mining sales volume [ph] on par with last year. EBITDA increased 32% to $580 million, which includes a $25 million provision or $0.06 per share related to a pending resolution of outstanding litigation. 
Australia led the way, with a 69% increase in EBITDA. Our Australia operations contributed more than 60% of Peabody's mining EBITDA in the second quarter. Higher EBITDA led to a 41% rise in operating profit of $458 million, and net income increased 36% to $292 million.
Excluding the non-cash remeasurement of income taxes, our adjusted income was $308 million, with a $1.11 in adjusted diluted EPS. That's a 61% increase over the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter excluding the effects of income tax remeasurement, and we are targeting the mid-20% range for the full year.
I'll now discuss some additional detail within the supplemental income statement. In Australia, our volumes rose 8% over the prior year, while revenue per ton climbed 38% to more than $128 per ton on increased realizations for both metallurgical and thermal coal. We sold 2.3 million tons of met coal in the second quarter in an average price of $246 per short ton, a 50% increase over the prior year. We also shipped 3 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average of $97 per short ton, up 16% over last year.
We have roughly $37 million in EBITDA impacts related to the Australia weather effects on the coal chain, most of which resulted from co-shipper vessels, those that weigh on [ph] multiple producers to load before shipping. Regarding Australia's cost increase for the quarter, while we're largely hedged on currency, the Australian dollar rose 26% over the same period last year. Also, with higher coal prices come increased royalties. These 2 factors combined to increase our Australian cost $9 per ton.
Costs were also impacted by the beginning of a longwall move in Queensland, as well as normal cost escalations. We were expecting full year per ton cost in the upper 60s with costs rising somewhat on higher exchange rates, while also benefiting in the fourth quarter from our Wilpinjong expansion. Finally, Australia margins rose to nearly $55 per ton, representing a robust 43% EBITDA margin.
Turning to the U.S., volumes were constrained in the quarter, first by heavy rains in the Midwest and then by flooding across the Missouri River Valley that hampered Western shipments, lowering EBITDA by $36 million. We were down nearly 4 million tons from our PRB and Illinois Basin expectations. Higher revenues per ton in the Midwest helped to drive a 23% margin per ton expansion. In the West, costs were impacted by the reduced PRB shipments and the geology challenge at Twentymile we discussed last quarter. Through advanced engineering and execution, we were able to quickly resume longwall operations and limit the impact to $34 million.
Both Trading and Brokerage and Resource Management had solid quarters, posting a combined $74 million in EBITDA. Trading benefited from higher margins on a greater mix of export volumes. The combined benefit of all segments resulted in a 45% increase in operating profit per ton to $7.88.
We generated $395 million in cash flow from operations, a 35% increase over the prior year. We have $1.25 billion in cash, short-term investments, and a combined $2.7 million in liquidity. And with the retirement of $218 million of bond in April, our total debt-to-cap ratio has declined to 32%. We continue to target capital spending for 2011 at $900 million to $950 million. We are also in an excellent position to implement our new growth initiatives, which Greg will address in a moment.
I'd like to close on the review of our outlook. For the third quarter, we are looking for continued higher results and target EBITDA of $575 million to $675 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 to $1.25 per share.
Our third quarter is likely to be impacted as U.S. railroads recover from the flooding, as well as ongoing co-shipper risks in Australia. For the year, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS targets to $4.20 to $4.60, with EBITDA targets now ranging from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. I would also refer you, our Reg E schedule is in [ph] release regarding our target ranges for DD&A and other line items.
With that look at the quarter and our new targets, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

You have seen a start -- 2011's better than any year ever, and we're targeting our second half EBITDA that could rise another 30% to 50%. Peabody also continues to add to a global platform that is the best in the business.
I'll review the market fundamentals and then discuss significant activity on the global growth initiatives that I believe will further differentiate Peabody as the world's premiere coal company. What strikes us about the global markets is how much our underlying thesis is proven from quarter-to-quarter and how events change, but the outlook stays the same. 
The world remains in the early stages of a long period of major demand growth, and so-called one-time events in the industry that constrain supply now occur each quarter. Global coal demand remains robust, world steel production is up 8% year-to-date. Globally, the world will use an additional 70 million to 80 million tons of metallurgical coal this year. Electricity generation is rising rapidly in developing countries, and coal is backfilling for nuclear power in Europe.
China remains a cornerstone of growth. First-half GDP grew 9.6%, electricity generation increased 14%, and steel output was up 10%. Last quarter, there was concern over an easing of China imports, yet imports have now risen for 4 straight months, and we believe we're on a pace for a stronger second half. 
India is now the world's fastest-growing importer. Their thermal coal imports were up 45% year-to-date. Europe is increasing thermal coal imports as Germany closes its nuclear plants and coal displaces high-priced gas. An escalating demand growth continue to strangle supplies to the point where any external events take on magnified importance. Labor stoppages, rains, permitting challenges and transportation issues are common. Strong near-term fundamentals have kept international pricing near record levels for both met and thermal products, with the recent settlements coming in higher than most expected.
Longer term, the world could need more than 500 million tons of additional met coal per year by 2020, and some 700 gigawatts of new coalfield electricity generation is expected to be online by 2020, requiring well over 2 billion tons of additional thermal coal. Just consider this: China's 12 -- 5-year plan targets $100 billion in investments in generation, transmission and subway construction activities by 2015.
Now in the United States, slight economic growth and industrial output translate into weak demand overall. But there are encouraging signs. Powder River Basin and Illinois Basin use [ph] is rising to serve new plants and existing plants that are switching from Appalachian coal. We are seeing new Illinois Basin customers from New York to Florida, and export demand continues to rise for all coal products. We are increasing our PRB shipments this year from the Gulf and West Coast, and we recently sold Illinois Basin coal to India.
On a supply-side, Mike noted that flooding is affecting the river markets, as well as Western rail shipments coming East. This has led to significantly above-average stockpile draws [ph] recently. With a tight supply-demand fixture and favorable long-term market outlook, Peabody is in the midst of the largest global growth program in the company's history. Our approach is to continue to expand our platform in the regions that serve the fastest-growing markets through organic growth, joint ventures and acquisitions.
And you have seen this plan demonstrated by progress on multiple fronts in recent days. Last week, we initiated a takeover proposal from Macarthur Coal through our joint venture with Arcelor Mittal. We like Macarthur's asset base and leading longwall PCI position, and we believe our operating, commercial and project management skills will be a good fit for Macarthur's active mines and growth potential. 
In addition to M&A, Peabody remains active in organic growth as we expand the current Australian platform to 35 million to 40 million tons by the 2014 to 2015 time frame. The first expansion project will be completed in the fourth quarter this year at our Wilpinjong Mine, and we have additional increases in Australian production slated over each of the next several years.
Also in Australia we agreed to buy the remaining 5% of the Burton Mine, giving us additional access to met coal sales. In Mongolia, Peabody was selected by the government as part of the consortium to develop the Western bloc of Tavan Tolgoi, along with a Russian railway group and China's Shenhua. We would be an equity partner in the project and are working on finalizing the structure in commercial terms, which then require government and parliament approval.
This process began with more than 20 companies, so we view this selection as confirmation of our rising global presence and high mining standards. In China, we announced that we're pursuing development of a $50 million-ton per year surface mine in partnership with the Xinjiang Uyghur provincial government. Xinjiang produced 100 million tons of coal last year, yet is expected to reach 1 billion tons per year over time. That's equivalent to nearly the entire U.S. production base.
The government is very supportive and has committed to accelerate the allocation of coal resources for the project. In the U.S., we were named last week as the winning bidder on a $220 million-ton reserve block in the Powder River Basin. The PRB remains a cornerstone of Peabody's production base. We feel this quality coal will be increasingly valuable as that backfills in the U.S. markets, while the [indiscernible] product is increasingly exported to Asia. We also believe that low sulfur coals will be increasingly valuable given the most recently proposed EPA regulations.
And finally, we're expanding commercial discussions with Asian customers for the proposed Gateway Pacific terminal, where we have a 24 million-ton per year throughput agreement. We've continued to be encouraged by the widespread support for the project.
So taken together, Peabody's growth initiatives will allow us to achieve our Asia 100 vision. They also represent the new shape of our company, one that has been building since we began our international focus in 2004. We've opened offices and trading centers, put in place dedicated teams on multiple continents, developed deep financial reserves and capacity, and have conducted exhaustive analyses of markets, geologies and companies. 
We are now taking these international activities to the logical next step, even as we continue to deliver the results that earn us the right to grow. So that's a review of our results, the markets and our growth projects. At this time, Mike, Rick and I would be pleased to take your questions."

So you start adding up all of those multiple components of their vision for full development and the numbers can get high, but for the mining component itself, that's going to be something that's going to be within the range of international standards on a per ton of development."

The preliminary numbers would indicate that surface operations have a much less impact than some of the deep gassy underground mines. The government is talking about assistance in transition packages for the deep gassy mines, which is in the process of being finalized. So those are being mitigated over a period of time, so at the end of the day, as we look at the carbon tax, we have factored that into our activities in Australia. One of the main points that we look at is, to the extent that those carbon taxes increase cost, then the best way to offset those is to consolidate and provide synergies or extract synergies that's part of the main initiatives relative to the Macarthur transaction. And as we continue to expand our brownfield expansions in Australia, it allows us to also extract lower costs because of increased volumes. At the end of the day, we as a company, and the coal association, are very strongly opposed to the carbon tax. We don't think it's the right policy framework to move forward with. But in terms of specific numbers, it's too early to really come out with any modeled impacts on a specific basis."

So let me start with the met market here [indiscernible] and basically, on the met side, we've seen, set the 2 highest prices in history in the last 2 quarters, with the 330 and 315 settlement. Obviously some of that's driven by the fragile supply and demand. We think that that goes forward. Some of that's because of the weather in Australia. We have seen customers actually [ph] try to get ahead of that. I mean, most of it's been based on quarterly pricing, but I think they were very -- it was an easier settlement than most thought in the last quarter at 315 because there is really [ph] shortage, and I think most people underestimated the time it was going to take for Australia to recover because of the flooding. And frankly, we're still recovering. We're not -- we're seeing a lot of other producers that are still not delivering the coal, which is causing shipment delays and other issues. So I think we still see a strong number coming up in the next quarter, and really, over time, we still continue to believe there's a structural shortage of metallurgical coal that's going to drive a strong pricing and high margins in that piece of the business for a long time to come. As we look at the Powder River basin, what we've seen -- some of the fundamentals. So [ph] we've seen flooding that has begun to bring down the inventories of the PRB burners [ph]. We think probably by the end of the summer that they'll probably be at the lowest point for stockpiles that they've been in 3 years. As a result of that, we've seen the forward pricing on PRB move up substantially. Look out about 2014, 2013, you're seeing numbers as high as almost $18 per ton. So you see strong contangos, you see a strong movement up as the stockpiles are coming down, and that doesn't even factor in what we think will be the next move in PRB, which is the fact that if these new EPA rules go forward and they go into effect January of 2012, which they're supposed to go into effect, they [ph] require significant rebalancing of burn towards low sulfur coal to meet the standards. And having ultra low sulfur coal, PRB 0.5 type coal is going to be very strong. And we'll see a return to the premiums that you used to see several years ago for the differences between some of the PRB products. So we think that the prices today are probably even understated because of the value they'll have going forward so we feel very strongly about PRB pricing moving forward."

Well, I appreciate the question because I think it's -- we need to provide a bit of clarity. Let's -- If you look at the difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, in the third quarter, as we've established our guidance, the things that we took into consideration is we've got 2 longwall moves in the third quarter. We've got a longwall move, we've started at North Goonyella, which will go into the pits. It's going through the third quarter now. And then we will be -- have a longwall move in our Metropolitan Mine. Now these are our 2 big met coal mines in Australia. So those will be completed in the third quarter. Those operations will be up and running in the fourth quarter, so obviously there's a difference in volumes and revenue streams between the 2 quarters, just between those 2 operations alone. We also have our Wilpinjong expansion coming online in the fourth quarter so that will boost our volumes out of New South Wales into the thermal market. Most of those -- most of that expansion will be heavily weighted towards additional export coal. And in addition, we expect additional volumes in the fourth quarter out of our millennium project versus what we are going to get in the third quarter. We anticipate getting all the final regulatory approvals late this quarter so that we can begin ramping that project up in the fourth quarter. So I'll -- net-net, those are some of the major differences between the Australian platform between the two quarters. Then you move to the U.S., we anticipate residual impacts in the Powder River Basin during the third quarter because of the railroad issues. Both the UP and the BN still have significant parts to their system that are not fully operational, a lot of rerouting that's going on which is causing delays in the entire Western rail system so that everybody is below where they would anticipate being at this point in time, and we expect that's probably going to continue in variable form through August and in some cases maybe into September. And that should be pretty well cleaned up and fourth quarter back to normal. In addition for us, Twentymile is just now starting to reach its full strides. We expect it to continue to perform at higher levels through this quarter, and then fourth quarter get back to its very high productivity levels as we get into different geologic zones in that panel. So you start adding those differences up and you can see why we have our third quarter estimates where they're at, but a much significantly improved fourth quarter."

So overall, we're expecting to get at least from our platform closer to normalized levels. The biggest risk that we face is what we call co-shipper risk in Australia, where, particularly in the met coal side of the business, these vessels that get loaded have, in some cases, 2 or 3 different producers loaded into the vessel to the extent that other producers are still struggling.

So there's been a little bit of a spread on the lower quality coals, obviously leading to the higher-priced and the high-quality coking coal. So you'll see a little bit of movement there, nothing too significant. As it relates to the co-shipper issue, as Greg said earlier, our mines are up and operating. We've got coal available, but it gets difficult to [indiscernible] that they will come pick your coal but if you don't have the other coal available for the ships.

We see the long-term export potential, particularly with the developments at the Gateway Pacific terminal, and the increasing environmental rules in the U.S. as to once again provide potential uplift for PRB in terms of volumes and margins. So as we look at how do you continue to sustain the level of production, I mean, really, when you're producing 140 million to 150 million tons a year of PRB coal, you have to continue to replace that reserve base. So it isn't any surprise, shouldn't be any surprise that for any lease sale out there, we're going to actively look at those reserves, look at their proximity to our operations, how they could be integrated into our operations in order to not only provide longevity but also the potential to expand as the economy here in this country recovers and exports become a much bigger component of PRB in the longer term."

A couple of things. I guess, one, is there -- with this rise that we've seen in the forward outlook for pricing, has that changed your outlook on the timing of School Creek and can you remind us again how big of a project School Creek is? And maybe as a follow-up to that, Caballo, you made a big commitment to Caballo in 2006. That was a 33 million-ton per year mine. Last year it was about 23.5 million. Can we expect that Caballo will go back to those peak levels or even potentially beyond that, given the right market?
Yes, I think, Paul, for both of those operations, given the market demand and level of demand in the marketplace, we have capacity. Caballo used to ride around that 33 million, 34 million-ton a year level, so the infrastructure at site could support that. Now we'd have to go and replace a lot of mining equipment, which we have moved away from Caballo over the last number of years as it went down to that 24 million-ton rates. So in order to replace that mining equipment, you're probably looking at a buildup of 12 of 18 months if the market demand was there. And in the case of School Creek, that operation wanted it [ph] shut down and its previous life was running at around 25 million tons a year. The infrastructure there, we think could be upgraded and get that operation up into the mid-30 million range. So as you look at both of those, we think that provides us the ability to grow with the market, to grow to meet these export commitments that we're looking at making as that Gateway Terminal comes online and then meet the increased demand in the U.S. as these environmental regulations continue to kick in over the next 2- to 5-year period of time."

I know I wouldn't agree with the use of an anemic term. When you look at the last 4 months of Chinese imports, they are as strong as they were at the end of last year and we anticipate they'll continue to strengthen through the back half of this year. China is still talking about having rolling blackouts over the next several months because of a lack of coal and continue to import coal. The first couple of months in the year in terms of the import was really an issue about pricing of electricity in China, and the availability of coal because of issues out of Australia and Indonesia in terms of shipping locations. So I would tell you that our view is that it's going to be a strong back half, it's going to continue to be strong, and China's going to continue to grow their imports as part of their coal-sourcing strategies over the future time period. So at the end of the day, we feel very strongly about what's happening there. The infrastructure issues in China, let's just take it for a minute and talk about the project that we just signed this past week in Xinjiang province. We're talking about a 50 million-ton a year operation of thermal coal, and it's a bit of a domino effect. All of that coal is going to go to the central provinces, and the central provinces will then be able to ship a bit more to their coast that will help a little bit to balance the demand that's growing in China for electricity across the southern provinces. But rail lines have to be built, power lines for moving coal by wire have to be built. So the infrastructure issues in China, the demand for energy in China are just Herculean tasks to try and meet, so we don't see where that's going to be sold [ph] overnight. In fact, that's part of their -- the issues.

Once again, Peabody turned in a quarter with significant increases in all key income statement measures. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit, income, EPS are all up sharply over the prior year. This performance come",859,"Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. Once again, Peabody turned in a quarter with significant increases in all key income statement measures. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit, income, EPS are all up sharply over the prior year. This performance comes in the face of a number of external issues in the first half, so we are targeting even greater results in the last 6 months of 2011 and have a clear path toward the best year in our history.
Let's review our second quarter beginning with the income statement.
Peabody set a new mark for revenues, exceeding $2 billion in the quarter. Revenues increased 21% and were higher across the board: U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage, even with mining sales volume on par with last year. EBITDA increased 32% to $580 million, which includes a $25 million provision or $0.06 per share related to the pending resolution of outstanding litigation. 
Australia led the way, with a 69% increase in EBITDA. Our Australia operations contributed more than 60% of Peabody's mining EBITDA in the second quarter. Higher EBITDA led to a 41% rise in operating profit to $458 million, and net income increased 36% to $292 million.
Excluding the non-cash remeasurement of income taxes, our adjusted income was $308 million, with $1.11 in adjusted diluted EPS. That's a 61% increase over the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter excluding the effects of income tax remeasurement, and we are targeting the mid-20% range for the full year.
I'll now discuss some additional detail within the supplemental income statement. In Australia, our volumes rose 8% over the prior year, while revenue per ton climbed 38% to more than $128 per ton on increased realizations for both metallurgical and thermal coal. We sold 2.3 million tons of met coal in the second quarter at an average price of $246 per short ton, a 50% increase over the prior year. We also shipped 3 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average of $97 per short ton, up 16% over last year.
We had roughly $37 million in EBITDA impacts related to the Australia weather effects on the coal chain, most of which resulted from co-shipper vessels, those that wait on multiple producers to load before shipping. Regarding Australia's cost increase for the quarter, while we're largely hedged on currency, the Australian dollar rose 26% over the same period last year. Also, with higher coal prices come increased royalties. These 2 factors combined to increase our Australian cost $9 per ton.
Costs were also impacted by the beginning of a longwall move in Queensland, as well as normal cost escalations. We were expecting ""full year per ton"" cost in the upper 60s with costs rising somewhat on higher exchange rates, while also benefiting in the fourth quarter from our Wilpinjong expansion. Finally, Australia margins rose to nearly $55 per ton, representing a robust 43% EBITDA margin.
Turning to the U.S., volumes were constrained in the quarter, first by heavy rains in the Midwest and then by flooding across the Missouri River Valley that hampered Western shipments, lowering EBITDA by $36 million. We were down nearly 4 million tons from our PRB and Illinois Basin expectations. Higher revenues per ton in the Midwest helped to drive a 23% margin per ton expansion. In the West, costs were impacted by the reduced PRB shipments and the geology challenge at Twentymile we discussed last quarter. Through advanced engineering and execution, we were able to quickly resume longwall operations and limit the impact to $34 million.
Both Trading and Brokerage and Resource Management had solid quarters, posting a combined $74 million in EBITDA. Trading benefited from higher margins on a greater mix of export volumes. The combined benefit of all segments resulted in a 45% increase in operating profit per ton to $7.88.
We generated $395 million in cash flow from operations, a 35% increase over the prior year. We have $1.25 billion in cash, short-term investments, and a combined $2.7 million in liquidity. And with the retirement of $218 million of bonds in April, our total debt-to-cap ratio has declined to 32%. We continue to target capital spending for 2011 at $900 million to $950 million. We are also in an excellent position to implement our new growth initiatives, which Greg will address in a moment.
I'd like to close with a review of our outlook. For the third quarter, we are looking for continued higher results and target EBITDA of $575 million to $675 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 to $1.25 per share.
Our third quarter is likely to be impacted as U.S. railroads recover from the flooding, as well as ongoing co-shipper risks in Australia. For the year, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS targets to $4.20 to $4.60, with EBITDA targets now ranging from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. I would also refer you to our Reg G schedule in the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A and other line items.
With that look at the quarter and our new targets, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

You have seen us start 2011 better than any year ever, and we're targeting our second half EBITDA that could rise another 30% to 50%. Peabody also continues to add to a global platform that is the best in the business.
I'll review the market fundamentals and then discuss significant activity on the global growth initiatives that I believe will further differentiate Peabody as the world's premiere coal company. What strikes us about the global markets is how much our underlying thesis is proven from quarter to quarter and how events change, but the outlook stays the same.
The world remains in the early stages of a long period of major demand growth, and so-called onetime events in the industry that constrain supply now occur each quarter. Global coal demand remains robust. World steel production is up 8% year-to-date. Globally, the world will use an additional 70 million to 80 million tons of metallurgical coal this year. Electricity generation is rising rapidly in developing countries, and coal is backfilling for nuclear power in Europe.
China remains a cornerstone of growth. First-half GDP grew 9.6%, electricity generation increased 14%, and steel output was up 10%. Last quarter, there was concern over an easing of China imports, yet imports have now risen for 4 straight months, and we believe we're on a pace for a stronger second half. 
India is now the world's fastest-growing importer. Their thermal coal imports were up 45% year-to-date. Europe is increasing thermal coal imports as Germany closes its nuclear plants and coal displaces high-priced gas. And escalating demand growth continues to strain global supplies to the point where any external events take on magnified importance. Labor stoppages, rains, permitting challenges and transportation issues are common. Strong near-term fundamentals have kept international pricing near record levels for both met and thermal products, with recent settlements coming in higher than most expected.
Longer term, the world could need more than 500 million tons of additional met coal per year by 2020, and some 700 gigawatts of new coalfield electricity generation is expected to be online by 2020, requiring well over 2 billion tons of additional thermal coal. Just consider this: China's 12th 5-year plan targets $100 billion in investments in generation, transmission and subway construction activities by 2015.
Now in the United States, light economic growth and industrial output translate into weak demand overall, but there are encouraging signs. Powder River Basin and Illinois Basin use is rising to serve new plants and existing plants that are switching from Appalachian coal. We are seeing new Illinois Basin customers from New York to Florida, and export demand continues to rise for all coal products. We are increasing our PRB shipments this year from the Gulf and West Coast, and we recently sold Illinois Basin coal to India.
On a supply-side, Mike noted that flooding is affecting the river markets, as well as Western rail shipments coming east. This has led to significantly above-average stockpile draws recently. With a tight supply-demand fixture and favorable long-term market outlook, Peabody is in the midst of the largest global growth program in the company's history. Our approach is to continue to expand our platform in the regions that serve the fastest-growing markets through organic growth, joint ventures and acquisitions.
And you have seen this plan demonstrated by progress on multiple fronts in recent days. Last week, we initiated a takeover proposal for Macarthur Coal through a joint venture with ArcelorMittal. We like Macarthur's asset base and leading low vol PCI position, and we believe our operating, commercial and project-management skills will be a good fit for Macarthur's active mines and growth potential. 
In addition to M&A, Peabody remains active in organic growth as we expand the current Australian platform to 35 million to 40 million tons by the 2014/2015 time frame. The first expansion project will be completed in the fourth quarter this year at our Wilpinjong Mine, and we have additional increases in Australian production slated over each of the next several years.
Also in Australia we agreed to buy the remaining 5% of the Burton Mine, giving us additional access to met coal sales. In Mongolia, Peabody was selected by the government as part of the consortium to develop the western bloc of Tavan Tolgoi, along with a Russian railway group and China's Shenhua. We would be an equity partner in the project and are working on finalizing the structure in commercial terms, which then require government and parliament approval.
This process began with more than 20 companies, so we view this selection as confirmation of our rising global presence and high mining standards. In China, we announced that we're pursuing development of a ""$50 million ton per year"" surface mine in partnership with the Xinjiang Uyghur provincial government. Xinjiang produced 100 million tons of coal last year, yet is expected to reach 1 billion tons per year over time. That's equivalent to nearly the entire U.S. production base. The government is very supportive and has committed to accelerate the allocation of coal resources for the project.
In the U.S., we were named last week as the winning bidder on a $220-million-ton reserve block in the Powder River Basin. The PRB remains a cornerstone of Peabody's production base. We feel this quality coal will be increasingly valuable as that backfills into U.S. markets, while the 8800 product is increasingly exported to Asia. We also believe that low-sulfur coals will be increasingly valuable given the most recently proposed EPA regulations.
And finally, we're expanding commercial discussions with Asian customers for the proposed Gateway Pacific terminal, where we have a ""24 million ton per year"" throughput agreement. We continue to be encouraged by the widespread support for the project.
So taken together, Peabody's growth initiatives will allow us to achieve our Asia 100 vision. They also represent the new shape of our company, one that has been building since we began our international focus in 2004. We've opened offices and trading centers, put in place dedicated teams on multiple continents, developed deep financial reserves and capacity, and have conducted exhaustive analyses of markets, geologies and companies.
We are now taking these international activities to the logical next step, even as we continue to deliver the results that earn us the right to grow. So that's a review of our results, the markets and our growth projects. At this time, Mike, Rick and I would be pleased to take your questions."

We only need to get 50% of the shareholders to take control of Macarthur, and we start with 16%, meaning we really have to get another 34%, which is about 60% of the free float that's available. So it's a strong partnership for us."

The preliminary numbers would indicate that surface operations have much less impact than some of the deep, gassy, underground mines. The government is talking about assistance in transition packages for the deep, gassy mines, which is in the process of being finalized. So those will be mitigated over a period of time, so at the end of the day, as we look at the carbon tax, we have factored that into our activities in Australia. One of the main points that we look at is, to the extent that those carbon taxes increase costs, then the best way to offset those is to consolidate and provide synergies -- or extract synergies. That's part of the main initiatives relative to the Macarthur transaction. And as we continue to expand our brownfield expansions in Australia, it allows us to also extract lower costs because of increased volumes. At the end of the day, we as a company and the coal association are very strongly opposed to the carbon tax. We don't think it's the right policy framework to move forward with. But in terms of specific numbers, it's too early to really come out with any modeled impacts on a specific basis."

And basically, on the met side, we've seen it set the 2 highest prices in history in the last 2 quarters, with the $330 and $315 settlement. Obviously some of that's driven by the fragile supply and demand. We think that, that goes forward. Some of that's because of the weather in Australia. We haven't seen customers necessarily try to get ahead of that. I mean, most of it's been based on quarterly pricing, but I think they were very -- it was an easier settlement than most thought in the last quarter at $315 because there is truly a shortage, and I think most people underestimated the time it was going to take for Australia to recover because of the flooding. And frankly, we're still recovering. We're not -- we're seeing a lot of other producers that are still not delivering the coal, which is causing shipment delays and other issues. So I think we still see a strong number coming up in the next quarter, and really, over time, we still continue to believe there's a structural shortage of metallurgical coal that's going to drive a strong pricing and high margins in that piece of the business for a long time to come. As we look at the Powder River Basin, what we've seen -- some of the fundamentals. Obviously, we've seen flooding. That has begun to bring down the inventories of the PRB burners. We think probably by the end of the summer that they'll probably be at the lowest point for stockpiles that they've been in 3 years. As a result of that, we've seen the forward pricing on PRB move up substantially. You look out about 2014, 2013, you're seeing numbers as high as almost $18 per ton. So you see strong contangos. You see a strong movement up as these stockpiles are coming down, and that doesn't even factor in what we think will be the next move in PRB, which is the fact that if these new EPA rules go forward and they go into effect January of 2012, which they're supposed to go into effect, they're to require significant rebalancing of burn towards low-sulfur coal to meet the standards. And having ultra-low-sulfur coal, PRB 0.5 type coal is going to be very strong. And we'll see a return to the premiums that you used to see several years ago for the differences between some of the PRB products. So we think that the prices today are probably even understated because of the value that they'll have going forward, so we feel very strongly about PRB pricing moving forward."

Well, I appreciate the question because I think it's -- we need to provide a bit of clarity. Let's -- if you look at the difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, in the third quarter, as we've established our guidance, the things that we took into consideration is we've got 2 longwall moves in the third quarter. We've got a longwall move we've started at North Goonyella, which will go into the pits. It's going through the third quarter now. And then we will be -- have a longwall move in our Metropolitan Mine. Now these are our 2 big met coal mines in Australia. So those will be completed in the third quarter. Those operations will be up and running in the fourth quarter, so obviously there's a difference in volumes and revenue streams between the 2 quarters, just between those 2 operations alone. We also have our Wilpinjong expansion coming online in the fourth quarter, so that will boost our volumes out of New South Wales into the thermal market. Most of those -- most of that expansion will be heavily weighted towards additional export coal. And in addition, we expect additional volumes in the fourth quarter out of our Millennium project versus what we are going to get in the third quarter. We anticipate getting all the final regulatory approvals late this quarter so that we can begin ramping that project up in the fourth quarter. So I'll -- net-net, those are some of the major differences between the Australian platform between the 2 quarters. Then you move to the U.S. We anticipate residual impacts in the Powder River Basin during the third quarter because of the railroad issues. Both the UP and the BN still have significant parts of their system that are not fully operational. A lot of rerouting that's going on which is causing delays in the entire Western rail system, so that everybody is below where they would anticipate being at this point in time, and we expect that's probably going to continue in variable form through August and in some cases maybe into September. And that should be pretty well cleaned up and fourth quarter back to normal. In addition for us, Twentymile is just now starting to reach its full strides. We expect it to continue to perform at higher levels through this quarter, and then fourth quarter get back to its very high productivity levels as we get into different geologic zones in that panel. So you start adding those differences up and you can see why we have third quarter estimates where they're at, but a much significantly improved fourth quarter."

So we're going to have to work through the budget process and really figure out where we come out in '12 in terms of the mix of tons. You're correct that as the volumes come up, that puts downward pressure on our overall cost. Some of that will be mitigated by what we expect to be higher -- or even if it keeps with stable exchange rates with our hedged positions. As they're a bit lower, as you move further out beyond the 6- to 12-month period, that'll have an upward impact on pricing.

In terms of the infrastructure system in Australia, because other producers are still having issues, it really hasn't been tested. The rail system, the projects that they had are moving along and the ports have had capacity, certainly out of Queensland. So overall, we're expecting to get, at least from our platform, closer to normalized levels. The biggest risk that we face is what we call co-shipper risk in Australia, where, particularly in the met coal side of the business, these vessels that get loaded have, in some cases, 2 or 3 different producers loaded into the vessel. To the extent that other producers are still struggling, that can delay the timing of those vessels. But that's probably the biggest risk that we have right now."

I think in the last settlement, it was about -- up to 80% to 82% correlation. Now it's down in the 70s. So there's been a little bit of a spread on the lower-quality coals, obviously leading to the higher price on the high-quality coking coal. So we've seen a little bit of movement there, nothing too significant. As it relates to the co-shipper issue, as Greg said earlier, our mines are up and operating. We've got coal available, but it gets difficult at times. They won't come pick your coal up if you don't have the other coal available for the ship. So the rail may not even come pick up your coal if the other party doesn't have their coal available. So it's a balancing act and we try to -- we work as hard as we can at it every quarter to try to make sure we get our shipments out, something I think we do pretty well. But it is an issue when others -- or when you rely on others to get their production up the line."

I mean, the PRB has been the cornerstone of our production platform for a number of years, and we've been active in PRB lease sales over a long period of time. As we look at the PRB, you're correct. We see the long-term export potential, particularly with the developments at the Gateway Pacific terminal and the increasing environmental rules in the U.S. as to once again provide potential uplift for PRB in terms of volumes and margins. So as we look at, how do you continue to sustain the level of production? I mean, when you're producing 140 million to 150 million tons a year of PRB coal, you have to continue to replace that reserve base. So it isn't any surprise -- shouldn't be any surprise that for any lease sale out there, we're going to actively look at those reserves, look at their proximity to our operations, how they could be integrated into our operations in order to not only provide longevity, but also the potential to expand as the economy here in this country recovers and exports become a much bigger component of PRB in the longer term."

Caballo used to ride around that ""33 million, 34 million ton a year"" level, so the infrastructure at site could support that. Now we'd have to go and replace a lot of mining equipment, which we have moved away from Caballo over the last number of years as it went down to that 24-million-ton rate. So in order to replace that mining equipment, you're probably looking at a buildup of 12 or 18 months if the market demand was there. And in the case of School Creek, that operation, when it shut down and its previous life, was running at around 25 million tons a year. The infrastructure there, we think, could be upgraded and get that operation up into the mid-30-million range. So as you look at both of those, we think that provides us the ability to grow with the market, to grow to meet these export commitments that we're looking at making as that Gateway Terminal comes online, and then meet the increased demand in the U.S. as these environmental regulations continue to kick in over the next 2- to 5-year period of time."

I know I wouldn't agree with the use of an ""anemic"" term. When you look at the last 4 months of Chinese imports, they are as strong as they were at the end of last year, and we anticipate they'll continue to strengthen through the back half of this year. China is still talking about having rolling blackouts over the next several months because of a lack of coal, and continue to import coal. The first couple of months in the year, in terms of the import, was really an issue about pricing of electricity in China and the availability of coal because of issues out of Australia and Indonesia in terms of shipping locations. So I would tell you that our view is that it's going to be a strong back half. It's going to continue to be strong, and China's going to continue to grow their imports as part of their coal-sourcing strategies over the future time period. So at the end of the day, we feel very strongly about what's happening there. The infrastructure issues in China, let's just take it for a minute and talk about the project that we just signed this past week in Xinjiang province. We're talking about a ""50 million ton a year"" operation of thermal coal, and it's a bit of a domino effect. All of that coal is going to go to the central provinces, and the central provinces will then be able to ship a bit more to the coast. That will help a little bit to balance the demand that's growing in China for electricity across the southern provinces. But rail lines have to be built. Power lines for moving coal by wire have to be built. So the infrastructure issues in China, the demand for energy in China are just -- are Herculean tasks to try and meet, so we don't see where that's going to be solved overnight. In fact, that's part of their -- the issues. Lastly, just coming back to the imports for a minute, the VAT tax that they've had on imports is something to watch, because they are doing everything they can to incentivize additional imports to keep from having the kind of power outages that we're seeing."

This quarter, Peabody posted record revenues for the second quarter in the row, increased contributions from U.S. and trading and brokerage operations and generated substantial cash flow. Even with a significant event in Australia, Peabody turned in a solid quarter and we're looking to finish 2011 with our best quarter of the year. We continue to benefit from a diverse portfolio that can mitigate downside and access the best markets. I'll discuss our third quarter results beginning with the income statement.
We delivered revenues of $2.04 billion, rising 9% over the prior year. This was driven by higher volumes in the U.S., improved realizations across the platform and increased Trading and Brokerage results. EBITDA U.S. Mining operations and would have increased year-over-year in Australia but for the roof fall of our Goonyella mine that we just announced. The EBITDA increase in the fall in longwall start-up was approximately $120 million for the quarter in line with our prior estimates. 
EBITDA also benefited from a 30% improvement in Trading and Brokerage contributions on both higher pricing and increased experts. All in, consolidated EBITDA for the quarter totaled $504 million and included $9 million of transaction costs related to the Macarthur track acquisition.
We also incurred approximately $13 million in interest expense through secure bridge financing. In total, these items reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $1.01 compared with $0.83 last year. Excluding the noncash measurement of income taxes, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.87. Our effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter, excluding the effects of income tax remeasurement, and we continue to target a mid-20% range for the full year.
Turning now to the additional detail within our supplemental income statement. In the U.S., our volumes increased 8% in the Midwest and 4% in the West over the prior year. While flooding remained an issue, both regions recovered well in the second quarter and boosted output, and the West benefited from resumed shipments of Twentymile. Revenues also rose in both U.S. regions. Cost increases were driven primarily by the timing of repairs and higher fuel expenses, along with increased compliance cost in the Midwest and sales-related expenses in the West. Average revenues were up 7%, and gross margins per ton increased 5% in the U.S.
In Australia, volumes of 6.6 million tons were below the prior year, primarily due to 550,000 tons of lost shipments related to North Goonyella and related blending. Revenue per ton rose 15% to $115 per short ton on higher realizations. During the quarter, we shipped 1.6 million tons of met coal at an average price of $251 per short ton. We also sold 3.5 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average price of $99 per short ton. 
Regarding Australia cost increases, more than $8 per ton was driven by higher currency rates. The roof fall at North Goonyella and 2 longwall moves also contributed $8 per ton. And higher royalties due to increased pricing added another $2 per ton. We are now targeting full year Australia cost in the low $70 per ton range.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $1.4 billion in cash, driven by a 34% increase in cash flow from operations, which totaled $575 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio has declined to 32%. And we continue to target full year capital spending for 2011 at $900 million and $950 million, excluding acquisitions.
I'd like to close with a review of our outlook. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see improving reduction from Australia, which will be partially offset by impacts from North Goonyella, which is still ramping up following the roof fall. We still expect to be within our original guidance of up to $175 million in EBITDA impact for the year from the roof fall. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to target EBITDA of $2.125 billion to $2.325 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.70 to $4.15. These targets exclude additional acquisition cost, as well as Macarthur's consolidated results. I would also to refer you to our Reg E schedule in the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A, taxes and other line items.
That's a brief review of our quarter and our outlook. For a further discussion of the coal markets, Peabody's position and initiatives, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

I plan to make brief remarks about the markets and Peabody's project activities, and then we'll spend some time reviewing the Macarthur acquisition and next steps. Now in a time when one can receive mixed signals",907,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I plan to make brief remarks about the markets and Peabody's project activities, and then we'll spend some time reviewing the Macarthur acquisition and next steps. Now in a time when one can receive mixed signals from the equity and asset markets, I'm pleased to report that our business is not only sound but set for significant growth with our organic platform and a successful acquisition of Macarthur Coal. Peabody's on track for record revenues and EBITDA this year. Demand and pricing for our products is favorable, our pipeline of projects is strong and for every caution like we see in macroeconomic data, there are multiple favorable signals at the coal market level. 
So if you consider these following data points in the global markets, global GDP is still expected to come in at more than 3% growth in 2011. Global scale production is up 9% year-to-date, and projections continue to call for more than 5% growth in steel production for 2012, equal in a rise of 50 million tons of met coal used just next year. China met coal imports just hit an all-time high in September, and net imports ran at nearly 50 million tons for the third quarter. And China thermal generation in September increased nearly 20% over 2010. 
South Korea's coal imports also have set records recently, and India's thermal coal imports are up more than 40% year-to-date. Coal generation has risen 8% in India and 6% in South Korea year-to-date. And even in Europe, September coal generation was up 5% over the prior year due to high gas prices and falling nuclear generation.
Coal prices remain favorable. Met coal prices settled at $285 per metric ton for the benchmark, and lowball PCI sells at $208 per metric ton, and the Newcastle thermal coal recently settled for 1-year contracts at $126.50 per metric ton, some 30% above prior year levels.
Now on the United States, the coal supply-demand equation has been balanced despite a dormant economy that has resulted in reduced electricity generation from gas, nuclear and coal. With a very strong summer burn, increasing U.S. export demand and reduced Western shipments due to rail flooding issues, coal inventories have declined the most since 1993. And PRB stockpiles are currently at target levels. So while such our Appalachia prices have declined since the start of the year, coal pricing in the PRB and Illinois Basin have continued to increase. Tightening standards on SO2 from the so-called Casper rules are also in flux, but are likely to further shift towards PRB coal and the ultralow sulphur coal from our North Antelope Rochelle mine. This mine accounts for more than half our U.S. output and has a sulfur content 40% below the benchmark product. This ultralow sulfur content can translate to a several dollar premium over the benchmark.
So in this mixed economic environment, coal should continue to do well in the near term. I say this for several reasons. Globally, the baseload nature of power generation insulates coal from the severity of downdrafts and other commodity. Coal also has a cost advantage to sources such as LNG into Asia and Europe and is a logical backfill for declining nuclear use in Germany and Japan. And, of course, Peabody's positioned in the fastest-growing coal regions through Australia, the PRB and the Illinois Basin. 
Now in the longer term, global electricity and steel demand from China, India, Brazil and other developing countries will ensure that coal fundamentals with will be strong for decades. Now let me mention several of our developments to serve long-term demand growth.
I'll review the Macarthur Coal takeover in a moment, given the significance in reshaping our operations and growth portfolio. But we're also reaching several milestones in our Australian mine expansion. We have first coal coming from our expanded Wilpinjong, Millennium and Wambo open cut mines in the fourth quarter, bringing us added met and thermal coal for 2012 from these operations. And we're continuing to work with the Shenzhen government on the reserve allocation regarding our planned 50 million ton per year surface mine in the province. 
So in summary and contrast to broader commodity and equity movements, coal fundamentals remain solid. In the U.S. and Europe, Peabody is well insulated against economic uncertainties with a large price position and low-cost production. And in Asia and Australia, where markets are strongest, Peabody continues to invest in development projects to satisfy significant long-term demand growth. 
So I'd now like to turn my attention to our acquisition of Macarthur Coal and the many favorable implications that has for Peabody. And today, we will be discussing the MacArthur presentation that's available from the homepage of peabodyenergy.com. Just a few housekeeping notes. To the extent we have forward-looking statements, we'd refer you to our SEC filed documents. We also note that MacArthur data and forward-looking statements are based on representations made by Macarthur prior to Peabody's acquisition. We will form our own view over time, of course, and actual results may differ. There are several translations to be mindful of. Reserve data from Macarthur is based on York standards whereas Peabody reports using SEC standards. Macarthur also reports in Australian dollars, of course, as well as metric tons and where possible in the presentation, we've converted those into short tons. 
Now with that, Greg, I'll turn the call back to you beginning on Slide 3 of the presentation."

We'll briefly take you through an overview of the transaction looking at markets, Macarthur's profile, the new Australian platform, financing arrangements and planned next steps. So turning to Slide 4 and looking at the Macarthur acquisition at the highest level.
We have offered to purchase up to 100% of Macarthur Coal. Control has now been achieved as we've now obtained an interest of more than 60% of MacArthur shares. The offer is still open and have been declared unconditional. The price is AUD $16 per share and would rise to AUD $16.25  per share should we achieve a 90% relevant interest by November 11. Peabody has been notified by ArcelorMittal that it is exercising its option to share its shares and joint venture interest to Peabody. This is good news for Peabody. We partnered with ArcelorMittal to increase the likelihood of achieving control of Macarthur. We always preferred increased ownership of Macarthur. We believe Arcelor's decision will accelerate our ability to realize synergies, to integrate the operations and to realize the benefits of the acquisition. We intend to finance our interest through a combination of cash and debt, and Mike will review our financing plan in a moment. 
Now looking at Slide 5. Macarthur is the world's largest seaborne producer of lowball PCI coal. For Peabody, this transaction accomplishes a number of objectives. It creates synergies with our existing base, expand our Australian platform to serve high growth regions, adds benchmark, lowball PCI to our product mix, significantly expands our pipeline of growth opportunities and extends our resource base to provide years of future development projects. We are targeting the transaction to be accretive within a year. 
Now as you'll see on Slide 6, this acquisition is valued very competitively with comparable Australian transactions involving producing and development companies, either on the basis of enterprise value per ton of resource or EBITDA ratios.
Slide 7. Turning to the markets, we see global steel demand growing some 60% by 2020, requiring a proportionate increase in metallurgical coal. Much of the new steelmaking capacity accommodates PCI-type coal, which we see growing at a 5% annual compound rate.
Slide 8. PCI has been growing demand for global steel producers as a lower cost replacement. Low-ball PCI is typically priced at 70% to 80% of high quality coking coal. As I mentioned earlier, recent settlements of $280 -- $208 per metric ton. 
Now looking at Macarthur's assets on Slide 9, you see an active production base and a major growth pipeline. From approximately 4 million tons of production, there is strong long-term growth potential. Macarthur has 260 million tons of reserves and 2.6 billion tons of resources.
Slide 10 indicates Macarthur owns 73% of Coppabella and Marbella, 2 active surface mines. Macarthur also has a 50% owner of Middlemount, which ramps up to the full-scale production beginning in January. The company has targeted sales for its 2012 fiscal year of 5.5 million to 5.8 million tons from these 3 operations.
Turning to Slide 11. Macarthur expands Peabody's Australian reserve base, bringing pro forma Australian reserves to nearly 1.4 billion tons. This represents a significant base to enable growth within our project portfolios, as well as future development capabilities.
On Slide 12, looking at production, Peabody's pro forma 2010 production with Macarthur represents 32 million tons, growing to 45 million to 50 million tons by 2014 to 2015. Should those pro forma volumes be in place today, Peabody would be the second-largest metallurgical coal producer in Australia and in the top tier of global met coal producers.
Slides 13 and 14 show the significant development pipeline the Macarthur has identified. It includes, which has been selected as the company's fourth mine and is expected to come online by 2014. As you'll see a number of other projects that are at exploration and pre-feasibility stage. For Peabody, this acquisition echoes our experience with Excel Coal in 2006. Excel is a company with several active mines and multiple expansion and development. Since our purchase in 2006, we have driven a 62% improvement in safety, a sixfold increase in volumes, 7% improvement in operating cost and a fivefold increase in related EBITDA. 
So Mike, would you take a minute to walk us through Slide 15 regarding our financing plan?"

We have consistently said that our target leverage ratio was 40% to 60%. Today, we're at 32%. But we're able to secure 100% ownership of Macarthur, our debt-to-cap ratio is expected to be in the mid-50% range and at or below the level we were at when we purchased Excel Coal in 2006 when coal markets were far less robust than today. So bottom line, we have sufficient cash and financing capacity to fund the Macarthur acquisition."

We will finalize the acceptance of share with the goal of achieving 100% ownership and privatization. As we take control of Macarthur operations and complete the acquisition, we are implementing a detailed transition plan. We will look to achieve synergies over time in areas such as operational performance, supply chain management, marketing and blending. We will work to improve the mining plan and equipment efficiency at Coppabella where Macarthur has acknowledged it is working on ongoing issues from the global financial crisis in 2008 and flooding earlier this year. And of course, we will further evaluate the growth projects now that control has been established.
Slide 17, in summary, the Macarthur acquisition expands Peabody's presence with quality met products that target a high-growth region. It provides major growth opportunities, a large reserve base and significant potential synergies. And it continues a global buildout and expanded earnings contribution from our international assets. 
So that's a brief overview of the Macarthur transaction.

I mean, when we did the Excel acquisition, it was the largest acquisition we had done at that point in time. Obviously, we're a smaller company. Excel had a platform of reserves and resources that was under utilized. They were just beginning production at a couple of properties, and they had major development and expansion programs in a number of others. So we bought into that program, bringing all of our skills to deliver projects and to optimize those operations and ramp those up into the marketplace. And you've seen a significant growth in the volumes that we have from our Excel properties that we purchased at that point in time. This is very much the same situation. We've got a very large reserve base and an even larger resource base. You've got emerging production from 2 operations today, growing to third and fourth with a pipeline of projects right behind it. So as we look at the ability to kind of work the magic we did with the Excel assets with the Macarthur assets, integrate those into our platform, which is already much bigger than Australia than it was at the time that we bought Excel, we feel very good about bringing this acquisition in. It's a large acquisition, but given the size of the company, it fits right within our ballpark."

This quarter, Peabody posted record revenues for the second quarter in a row, increased contributions from U.S. and Trading and Brokerage operations and generated substantial cash flow. Even with a significant even",737,"Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, Peabody posted record revenues for the second quarter in a row, increased contributions from U.S. and Trading and Brokerage operations and generated substantial cash flow. Even with a significant event in Australia, Peabody turned in a solid quarter and we're looking to finish 2011 with our best quarter of the year. We continue to benefit from a diverse portfolio that can mitigate downside and access the best markets. I'll discuss our third quarter results beginning with the income statement.
We delivered revenues of $2.04 billion, rising 9% over the prior year. This was driven by higher volumes in the U.S., improved realizations across the platform and increased Trading and Brokerage results. EBITDA rose 10% at U.S. Mining operations and would have increased year-over-year in Australia, but for the roof fall of our North Goonyella Mine that we previously announced. The EBITDA impact of the fall and longwall startup was approximately $120 million for the quarter in line with our prior estimates. 
EBITDA also benefited from a 30% improvement in Trading and Brokerage contributions on both higher pricing and increased exports. All in, consolidated EBITDA for the quarter totaled $504 million and included $9 million of transaction costs related to the Macarthur track acquisition.
We also incurred approximately $13 million in interest expense to secure bridge financing. In total, these items reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $1.01 compared with $0.83 last year. Excluding the noncash measurement of income taxes, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.87. Our effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter, excluding the effects of income tax remeasurement, and we continue to target a mid-20% range for the full year.
Turning now to the additional detail within our supplemental income statement. In the U.S., our volumes increased 8% in the Midwest and 4% in the West over the prior year. While flooding remained an issue, both regions recovered well from the second quarter and boosted output, and the West benefited from resumed shipments of Twentymile. Revenues also rose in both U.S. regions. Cost increases were driven primarily by the timing of repairs and higher fuel expenses, along with increased compliance cost in the Midwest and sales-related expenses in the West. Average revenues were up 7% and gross margins per ton increased 5% in the U.S.
In Australia, volumes of 6.6 million tons were below the prior year, primarily due to 550,000 tons of lost shipments related to North Goonyella and related blending. Revenue per ton rose 15% to $115 per short ton on higher realizations. During the quarter, we shipped 1.6 million tons of met coal at an average price of $251 per short ton. We also sold 3.4 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average price of $99 per short ton. 
Regarding Australia cost increases, more than $8 per ton was driven by higher currency rates. The roof fall at North Goonyella and 2 longwall moves also contributed $8 per ton. And higher royalties due to increased pricing added another $2 per ton. We are now targeting full year Australia cost in the low $70 per ton range.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $1.4 billion in cash, driven by a 34% increase in cash flow from operations, which totaled $575 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio has declined to 32%. And we continue to target full year capital spending for 2011 at $900 million and $950 million, excluding acquisitions.
I'd like to close with a review of our outlook. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see improving production from Australia, which will be partly offset by impacts from North Goonyella, which is still ramping up following the roof fall. We still expect to be within our original guidance of up to $175 million in EBITDA impact for the year from the roof fall. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to target EBITDA of $2.125 billion to $2.325 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.70 to $4.15. These targets exclude additional acquisition cost, as well as Macarthur's consolidated results. I would also to refer you to our Reg G schedule in the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A, taxes and other line items.
That's a brief review of our quarter and outlook. For a further discussion of the coal markets, Peabody's position and initiatives, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

I plan to make brief remarks about the markets and Peabody's project activities, and then we'll spend some time reviewing the Macarthur acquisition and next steps. Now in a time when one can receive mixed signals",769,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I plan to make brief remarks about the markets and Peabody's project activities, and then we'll spend some time reviewing the Macarthur acquisition and next steps. Now in a time when one can receive mixed signals from the equity and asset markets, I'm pleased to report that our business is not only sound but set for significant growth with our organic platform and the successful acquisition of Macarthur Coal. Peabody's on track for record revenues and EBITDA this year. Demand and pricing for our products is favorable, our pipeline of projects is strong and for every caution light we see in macroeconomic data, there are multiple favorable signals at the coal market level. 
So if you consider these following data points in the global markets, global GDP is still expected to come in at more than 3% growth in 2011. Global scale production is up 9% year-to-date, and projections continue to call for more than 5% growth in steel production for 2012, equaling a rise of 50 million tons of met coal use just next year. China net coal imports just hit an all-time high in September, and net imports ran at nearly 50 million tons for the third quarter. And China thermal generation in September increased nearly 20% over 2010. 
South Korea's coal imports also have set records recently, and India's thermal coal imports are up more than 40% year-to-date. Coal generation has risen 8% in India and 6% in South Korea year-to-date. And even in Europe, September coal generation was up 5% over the prior year due to high gas prices and following nuclear generation.
Coal prices remain favorable. Met coal prices settled at $285 per metric ton for the benchmark, and low-vol PCI sells at $208 per metric ton, and the Newcastle Thermal Coal recently settled for one-year contracts at $126.50 per metric ton, some 30% above prior year levels.
Now in the United States, the coal supply-demand equation has been balanced despite a dormant economy that has resulted in reduced electricity generation from gas, nuclear and coal. With a very strong summer burn, increasing U.S. export demand and reduced western shipments due to rail flooding issues, coal inventories have declined the most since 1993. And PRB stockpiles are currently at target levels. So while such our Appalachia prices have declined since the start of the year, coal pricing in the PRB and Illinois Basin have continued to increase. Tightening standards on SO2 from the so-called Casper rules are also in flux, but are likely to further the shift toward PRB coal and the ultralow sulphur coal from our North Antelope Rochelle mine. This mine accounts for more than half our U.S. output and has a sulfur content 40% below the benchmark product. This ultralow sulfur content can translate to a several dollar premium over the benchmark.
So in this mixed economic environment, coal should continue to do well in the near term. I say this for several reasons. Globally, the baseload nature of power generation insulates coal from the severity of downdrafts and other commodities. Coal also has a cost advantage to sources such as LNG into Asia and Europe and is a logical backfill for declining nuclear use in Germany and Japan. And, of course, Peabody's positioned in the fastest-growing coal regions through Australia, the PRB and the Illinois Basin. 
Now in the longer term, global electricity and steel demand from China, India, Brazil and other developing countries will ensure that coal fundamentals will be strong for decades. Now let me mention several of our developments to serve long-term demand growth.
I'll review the Macarthur Coal takeover in a moment, given the significance in reshaping our operations and growth portfolio. But we're also reaching several milestones in our Australian mine expansion. We have first coal coming from our expanded Wilpinjong, Millennium and Wambo open cut mines in the fourth quarter, bringing us added met and thermal coal for 2012 from these operations. And we're continuing to work with the Xinjiang government on the reserve allocation regarding our planned 50 million ton per year surface mine in the province. 
So in summary and contrast to broader commodity and equity movements, coal fundamentals remain solid. In the U.S. and Europe, Peabody is well insulated against economic uncertainties with a large price position and low-cost production. And in Asia and Australia where markets are strongest, Peabody continues to invest in development projects to satisfy significant long-term demand growth. 
So I'd now like to turn my attention to our acquisition of Macarthur Coal and the many favorable implications that has for Peabody."

We'll briefly take you through an overview of the transaction looking at markets, Macarthur's profile, the new Australian platform, financing arrangements and planned next steps. So turning to Slide 4 and looking at the Macarthur acquisition",713,"Thanks, Vic. We'll briefly take you through an overview of the transaction looking at markets, Macarthur's profile, the new Australian platform, financing arrangements and planned next steps. So turning to Slide 4 and looking at the Macarthur acquisition at the highest level.
We have offered to purchase up to 100% of Macarthur Coal. Control has now been achieved as we've now obtained an interest in more than 60% of MacArthur shares. The offer is still open and has been declared unconditional. The price is AUD $16 per share and would rise to AUD $16.25 per share should we achieve a 90% relevant interest by November 11. Peabody has been notified by ArcelorMittal that it's exercising its option to sell its shares and joint venture interest to Peabody. This is good news for Peabody. We partnered with ArcelorMittal to increase the likelihood of achieving control of Macarthur. We always preferred increased ownership of Macarthur. We believe Arcelor's decision will accelerate our ability to realize synergies, to integrate the operations and to realize the benefits of the acquisition. We intend to finance our interest through a combination of cash and debt, and Mike will review our financing plan in a moment. 
Now looking at Slide 5. Macarthur is the world's largest seaborne producer of low-vol PCI coal. For Peabody, this transaction accomplishes a number of objectives. It creates synergies with our existing base, expands our Australian platform to serve high-growth regions, adds benchmark low-vol PCI supply to our product mix, significantly expands our pipeline of growth opportunities and extends our resource base to provide years of future development projects. We are targeting the transaction to be accretive within a year. 
Now as you'll see on Slide 6, this acquisition is valued very competitively with comparable Australian transactions involving producing and development companies, either on the basis of enterprise value per ton of resource or EBITDA ratios.
Slide 7. Turning to the markets, we see global steel demand growing some 60% by 2020, requiring a proportionate increase in metallurgical coal. Much of the new steelmaking capacity accommodates PCI-type coal, which we see growing at a 5% annual compound rate.
Slide 8. PCI is in growing demand from global steel producers as a lower cost coke replacement. Low-vol PCI is typically priced at 70% to 80% of high-quality hard coking coal. As I mentioned earlier, recent settlements of $280 -- $208 per metric ton. 
Now looking at Macarthur's assets on Slide 9, you see an active production base and a major growth pipeline. From approximately 4 million tons of production, there is strong long-term growth potential. Macarthur has 260 million tons of reserves and 2.6 billion tons of resources.
Slide 10 indicates Macarthur owns 73% of Coppabella and Moorvale, 2 active surface mines. Macarthur also is a 50% owner of Middlemount, which ramps up to full-scale production beginning in January. The company has targeted sales for its 2012 fiscal year of 5.5 million to 5.8 million tons from these 3 operations.
Turning to Slide 11. Macarthur expands Peabody's Australian reserve base, bringing pro forma Australian reserves to nearly 1.4 billion tons. This represents a significant base to enable growth within our project portfolios, as well as future development capabilities.
And Slide 12, looking at production, Peabody's pro forma 2010 production with Macarthur represents 32 million tons, growing to 45 million to 50 million tons by 2014 to 2015. Should those pro forma volumes be in place today, Peabody would be the second-largest metallurgical coal producer in Australia and in the top tier of global met coal producers.
Slides 13 and 14 show the significant development pipeline the Macarthur has identified. It includes  Codrilla, which has been selected as the company's fourth mine and is expected to come online by 2014. And you'll see a number of other projects that are at exploration and pre-feasibility stage. For Peabody, this acquisition echoes our experience with Excel Coal in 2006. Excel is a company with several active mines and multiple expansions and development. Since our purchase in 2006, we have driven a 62% improvement in safety, a sixfold increase in volumes, 7% improvement in operating cost and a fivefold increase in related EBITDA. 
So Mike, would you take a minute to walk us through Slide 15 regarding our financing plans?"

We have a current revolver with $1.5 billion of capacity. We have a bridge loan in place and a $1 billion term loan being finalized. And we have access to the debt markets for permanent financing. 
We have consistently said that our target leverage ratio was 40% to 60%. Today, we're at 32%. If we're able to secure 100% ownership of Macarthur, our debt-to-cap ratio is expected to be in the mid-50% range and at or below the level we were at when we purchased Excel Coal in 2006 when coal markets were far less robust than today. So bottom line, we have sufficient cash and financing capacity to fund the Macarthur acquisition."

We will finalize the acceptances of shares with the goal of achieving 100% ownership and privatization. As we take control of Macarthur operations and complete the acquisition, we are implementing a detailed transition plan. We will look to achieve synergies over time in areas such as operational performance, supply-chain management, marketing and blending. We will work to improve the mining plan and equipment efficiency at Coppabella where Macarthur has acknowledged it is working through ongoing issues from the global financial crisis in 2008 and flooding earlier this year. And, of course, we will further evaluate the growth projects now that control has been established.
Slide 17, in summary, the Macarthur acquisition expands Peabody's presence with quality met products that target a high-growth region. It provides major growth opportunities, a large reserve base and significant potential synergies. And it continues a global buildout and expanded earnings contribution from our international assets. 
So that's a brief overview of the Macarthur transaction. We look forward to providing more information once the transaction closes, and we further evaluate Macarthur's operations and development projects. So following that review, as well as a look at our third quarter earnings, we'd be pleased to take your questions."

And if we look forward, we see probably a 50-million ton growth each year in met coal demand, and PCI will be a component of that, probably still in the 5% to 6% compound annual growth rate.

They were just beginning production at a couple of properties, and they had major development and expansion programs in a number of others. So we bought into that program, bringing all of our skills to deliver projects and to optimize those operations and ramp those up into the marketplace. And you've seen a significant growth in the volumes that we have from our Excel properties that we purchased at that point in time. This is very much the same situation. You've got a very large reserve base and an even larger resource base. You've got emerging production from 2 operations today, growing to third and fourth with a pipeline of projects right behind it.

So at this point, once we fully get in and control Macarthur, we'll obviously do a full evaluation of their projects, we'll be able to rank our capital allocations, respectively, to our platform, their platform, as well as other opportunities, and we'll make the logical decisions for the high-value projects going forward."

That's what allows us to have the opportunities to make these kinds of large acquisitions and bring them into the portfolio. So I thank them for all of their efforts and activities. And, obviously, our next quarterly call will be a lot of new information. So we look forward to updating you on our progress and where we're at with Macarthur and our platform at that point in time. Thank you, all."

This quarter, Peabody posted record revenues for the second quarter in a row, increased contributions from U.S. and Trading and Brokerage operations and generated substantial cash flow. Even with a significant even",736,"Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, Peabody posted record revenues for the second quarter in a row, increased contributions from U.S. and Trading and Brokerage operations and generated substantial cash flow. Even with a significant event in Australia, Peabody turned in a solid quarter and we're looking to finish 2011 with our best quarter of the year. We continue to benefit from a diverse portfolio that can mitigate downside and access the best markets. I'll discuss our third quarter results beginning with the income statement.
We delivered revenues of $2.04 billion, rising 9% over the prior year. This was driven by higher volumes in the U.S., improved realizations across the platform and increased Trading and Brokerage results. EBITDA rose 10% at U.S. Mining operations and would have increased year-over-year in Australia, but for the roof fall of our North Goonyella Mine that we previously announced. The EBITDA impact of the fall and longwall startup was approximately $120 million for the quarter, in line with our prior estimates. 
EBITDA also benefited from a 30% improvement in Trading and Brokerage contributions on both higher pricing and increased exports. All in, consolidated EBITDA for the quarter totaled $504 million and included $9 million of transaction costs related to the Macarthur track acquisition.
We also incurred approximately $13 million in interest expense to secure bridge financing. In total, these items reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $1.01 compared with $0.83 last year. Excluding the noncash measurement of income taxes, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.87. Our effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter, excluding the effects of income tax remeasurement and we continue to target a mid-20% range for the full year.
Turning now to the additional detail within our supplemental income statement. In the U.S., our volumes increased 8% in the Midwest and 4% in the West over the prior year. While flooding remained an issue, both regions recovered well from the second quarter and boosted output, and the West benefited from resumed shipments of Twentymile. Revenues also rose in both U.S. regions. Cost increases were driven primarily by the timing of repairs and higher fuel expenses, along with increased compliance cost in the Midwest and sales-related expenses in the West. Average revenues were up 7% and gross margins per ton increased 5% in the U.S.
In Australia, volumes of 6.6 million tons were below the prior year, primarily due to 550,000 tons of lost shipments related to North Goonyella and related blending. Revenue per ton rose 15% to $115 per short ton on higher realizations. During the quarter, we shipped 1.6 million tons of met coal at an average price of $251 per short ton. We also sold 3.4 million tons of seaborne thermal coal at a realized average price of $99 per short ton. 
Regarding Australia cost increases, more than $8 per ton was driven by higher currency rates. The roof fall at North Goonyella and 2 longwall moves also contributed $8 per ton. And higher royalties due to increased pricing added another $2 per ton. We are now targeting full year Australia cost in the low $70 per ton range.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $1.4 billion in cash driven by a 34% increase in cash flow from operations, which totaled $575 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio has declined to 32%. And we continue to target full year capital spending for 2011 at $900 million to $950 million, excluding acquisitions.
I'd like to close with a review of our outlook. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see improving production from Australia, which will be partly offset by impacts from North Goonyella, which is still ramping up following the roof fall. We still expect to be within our original guidance of up to $175 million in EBITDA impact for the year from the roof fall. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to target EBITDA of $2.125 billion to $2.325 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.70 to $4.15. These targets exclude additional acquisition cost, as well as Macarthur's consolidated results. I would also refer you to our Reg G schedule in the release regarding our target ranges for DD&A, taxes and other line items.
That's a brief review of our quarter and outlook. For a further discussion of the coal markets, Peabody's position and initiatives, I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

I plan to make brief remarks about the markets and Peabody's project activities, and then we'll spend some time reviewing the Macarthur acquisition and next steps. Now in a time when one can receive mixed signals",769,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I plan to make brief remarks about the markets and Peabody's project activities, and then we'll spend some time reviewing the Macarthur acquisition and next steps. Now in a time when one can receive mixed signals from the equity and asset markets, I'm pleased to report that our business is not only sound but set for significant growth with our organic platform and the successful acquisition of Macarthur Coal. Peabody's on track for record revenues and EBITDA this year. Demand and pricing for our products is favorable, our pipeline of projects is strong and for every caution light we see in macroeconomic data, there are multiple favorable signals at the coal market level. 
So if you consider these following data points in the global markets, global GDP is still expected to come in at more than 3% growth in 2011. Global scale production is up 9% year-to-date, and projections continue to call for more than 5% growth in steel production for 2012, equaling a rise of 50 million tons of met coal use just next year. China net coal imports just hit an all-time high in September, and net imports ran at nearly 50 million tons for the third quarter. And China thermal generation in September increased nearly 20% over 2010. 
South Korea's coal imports also have set records recently, and India's thermal coal imports are up more than 40% year-to-date. Coal generation has risen 8% in India and 6% in South Korea year-to-date. And even in Europe, September coal generation was up 5% over the prior year due to high gas prices and following nuclear generation.
Coal prices remain favorable. Met coal prices settled at $285 per metric ton for the benchmark, and low-vol PCI sells at $208 per metric ton and the Newcastle Thermal Coal recently settled for one-year contracts at $126.50 per metric ton, some 30% above prior year levels.
Now in the United States, the coal supply-demand equation has been balanced despite a dormant economy that has resulted in reduced electricity generation from gas, nuclear and coal. With a very strong summer burn, increasing U.S. export demand and reduced western shipments due to rail flooding issues, coal inventories have declined the most since 1993. And PRB stockpiles are currently at target levels. So while such our Appalachia prices have declined since the start of the year, coal pricing in the PRB and Illinois Basin have continued to increase. Tightening standards on SO2 from the so-called Casper rules are also in flux, but are likely to further the shift toward PRB coal and the ultralow sulphur coal from our North Antelope Rochelle mine. This mine accounts for more than half our U.S. output and has a sulfur content 40% below the benchmark product. This ultralow sulfur content can translate to a several dollar premium over the benchmark.
So in this mixed economic environment, coal should continue to do well in the near term. I say this for several reasons. Globally, the baseload nature of power generation insulates coal from the severity of downdrafts and other commodities. Coal also has a cost advantage to sources such as LNG into Asia and Europe and is a logical backfill for declining nuclear use in Germany and Japan. And of course, Peabody's positioned in the fastest-growing coal regions through Australia, the PRB and the Illinois Basin. 
Now in the longer term, global electricity and steel demand from China, India, Brazil and other developing countries will ensure that coal fundamentals will be strong for decades. Now let me mention several of our developments to serve long-term demand growth.
I'll review the Macarthur Coal takeover in a moment, given the significance in reshaping our operations and growth portfolio. But we're also reaching several milestones in our Australian mine expansion. We have first coal coming from our expanded Wilpinjong, Millennium and Wambo open cut mines in the fourth quarter, bringing us added met and thermal coal for 2012 from these operations. And we're continuing to work with the Xinjiang government on the reserve allocation regarding our planned 50 million ton per year surface mine in the province. 
So in summary and contrast to broader commodity and equity movements, coal fundamentals remain solid. In the U.S. and Europe, Peabody is well insulated against economic uncertainties with a large price position and low-cost production. And in Asia and Australia where markets are strongest, Peabody continues to invest in development projects to satisfy significant long-term demand growth. 
So I'd now like to turn my attention to our acquisition of Macarthur Coal and the many favorable implications that has for Peabody."

32792,141519499,177498,"Peabody Energy Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Peabody Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vic. We'll briefly take you through an overview of the transaction looking at markets, Macarthur's profile, the new Australian platform, financing arrangements and planned next steps. So turning to Slide 4 and looking at the Macarthur acquisition",713,"Thanks, Vic. We'll briefly take you through an overview of the transaction looking at markets, Macarthur's profile, the new Australian platform, financing arrangements and planned next steps. So turning to Slide 4 and looking at the Macarthur acquisition at the highest level.
We have offered to purchase up to 100% of Macarthur Coal. Control has now been achieved as we've now obtained an interest in more than 60% of MacArthur shares. The offer is still open and has been declared unconditional. The price is AUD $16 per share and would rise to AUD $16.25 per share should we achieve a 90% relevant interest by November 11. Peabody has been notified by ArcelorMittal that it's exercising its option to sell its shares and joint venture interest to Peabody. This is good news for Peabody. We partnered with ArcelorMittal to increase the likelihood of achieving control of Macarthur. We always preferred increased ownership of Macarthur. We believe Arcelor's decision will accelerate our ability to realize synergies, to integrate the operations and to realize the benefits of the acquisition. We intend to finance our interest through a combination of cash and debt, and Mike will review our financing plan in a moment. 
Now looking at Slide 5. Macarthur is the world's largest seaborne producer of low-vol PCI coal. For Peabody, this transaction accomplishes a number of objectives. It creates synergies with our existing base, expands our Australian platform to serve high-growth regions, adds benchmark low-vol PCI supply to our product mix, significantly expands our pipeline of growth opportunities and extends our resource base to provide years of future development projects. We are targeting the transaction to be accretive within a year. 
Now as you'll see on Slide 6, this acquisition is valued very competitively with comparable Australian transactions involving producing and development companies, either on the basis of enterprise value per ton of resource or EBITDA ratios.
Slide 7. Turning to the markets, we see global steel demand growing some 60% by 2020, requiring a proportionate increase in metallurgical coal. Much of the new steelmaking capacity accommodates PCI-type coal, which we see growing at a 5% annual compound rate.
Slide 8. PCI is in growing demand from global steel producers as a lower cost coke replacement. Low-vol PCI is typically priced at 70% to 80% of high-quality hard coking coal. As I mentioned earlier, recent settlements of $280 -- $208 per metric ton. 
Now looking at Macarthur's assets on Slide 9, you see an active production base and a major growth pipeline. From approximately 4 million tons of production, there is strong long-term growth potential. Macarthur has 260 million tons of reserves and 2.6 billion tons of resources.
Slide 10 indicates Macarthur owns 73% of Coppabella and Moorvale, 2 active surface mines. Macarthur also is a 50% owner of Middlemount, which ramps up to full-scale production beginning in January. The company has targeted sales for its 2012 fiscal year of 5.5 million to 5.8 million tons from these 3 operations.
Turning to Slide 11. Macarthur expands Peabody's Australian reserve base, bringing pro forma Australian reserves to nearly 1.4 billion tons. This represents a significant base to enable growth within our project portfolios, as well as future development capabilities.
And Slide 12, looking at production, Peabody's pro forma 2010 production with Macarthur represents 32 million tons, growing to 45 million to 50 million tons by 2014 to 2015. Should those pro forma volumes be in place today, Peabody would be the second-largest metallurgical coal producer in Australia and in the top tier of global met coal producers.
Slides 13 and 14 show the significant development pipeline the Macarthur has identified. It includes Codrilla, which has been selected as the company's fourth mine and is expected to come online by 2014. And you'll see a number of other projects that are at exploration and pre-feasibility stage. For Peabody, this acquisition echoes our experience with Excel Coal in 2006. Excel is a company with several active mines and multiple expansions and development. Since our purchase in 2006, we have driven a 62% improvement in safety, a six-fold increase in volumes, 7% improvement in operating cost and a fivefold increase in related EBITDA. 
So Mike, would you take a minute to walk us through Slide 15 regarding our financing plans?"

We have a current revolver with $1.5 billion of capacity. We have a bridge loan in place and a $1 billion term loan being finalized. And we have access to the debt markets for permanent financing. 
We have consistently said that our target leverage ratio was 40% to 60%. Today we're at 32%. If we're able to secure 100% ownership of Macarthur, our debt-to-cap ratio is expected to be in the mid-50% range and at or below the level we were at when we purchased Excel Coal in 2006 when coal markets were far less robust than today. So bottom line, we have sufficient cash and financing capacity to fund the Macarthur acquisition."

We will finalize the acceptances of shares with the goal of achieving 100% ownership and privatization. As we take control of Macarthur operations and complete the acquisition, we are implementing a detailed transition plan. We will look to achieve synergies over time in areas such as operational performance, supply-chain management, marketing and blending. We will work to improve the mining plan and equipment efficiency at Coppabella where Macarthur has acknowledged it is working through ongoing issues from the global financial crisis in 2008 and flooding earlier this year. And of course, we will further evaluate the growth projects now that control has been established.
Slide 17, in summary, the Macarthur acquisition expands Peabody's presence with quality met products that target a high-growth region. It provides major growth opportunities, a large reserve base and significant potential synergies. And it continues a global buildout and expanded earnings contribution from our international assets. 
So that's a brief overview of the Macarthur transaction. We look forward to providing more information once the transaction closes and we further evaluate Macarthur's operations and development projects.

So we bought into that program, bringing all of our skills to deliver projects and to optimize those operations and ramp those up into the marketplace. And you've seen a significant growth in the volumes that we have from our Excel properties that we purchased at that point in time. This is very much the same situation. You've got a very large reserve base and an even larger resource base. You've got emerging production from 2 operations today, growing to third and fourth with a pipeline of projects right behind it.

We are starting the marketing, North Antelope Rochelle product, which is a part of the reserve base from North Antelope Rochelle and part beginnings of opening up the reserve at School Creek. In order to optimize our ability to use infrastructure that we own, we will be shipping that product out of the School Creek facilities. We're not, in essence, starting up School Creek. We're beginning to market a North Antelope product and optimize our ability to shift all of that North Antelope Rochelle production between 2 rail load-out facilities. So you're going to see that as we go forward."

And as we've seen that, it has had an impact on the forward curves. Obviously, it's substantially pulling up the steeper contango on the forward pricing in the PRB. We've been able to capture some of that. I would tell you today that I'm not sure that they've been fully valued as to how high the value might be for the differentiation between North Antelope Rochelle product in a 0.5 versus the benchmark 0.8. It could be as high as $1 to $4 depending upon the price of the credits going forward. So while we're excited about that, we're not excited about the enhanced regulations on U.S. coal fleet, but it is -- something does have an impact on the pricing for PRB products."

How do we fully assess and bring across to finish line. The timing as to how quickly we can capture those will be somewhat related to the ultimate ownership of -- and where Macarthur stands vis-à-vis the public listing versus going to privatization. Clearly, one of the benefits of ArcelorMittal's decision is that it certainly simplifies the process that we had in place as part of that joint venture agreement with ArcelorMittal.

Looks like it's going to happen hopefully before year end, so we'll get some clarity. And until it's passed in final form, it's hard to really provide and we're reluctant to provide any ranges of numbers. Suffice it to say the way it's structured now, as Mike indicated, while it's a -- while it's a resource tax, it also recognizes that you can only have future taxes if you have robust investment in the industry. So it provides significant benefits to people that are growing their platform and investing in new projects. So in terms of the near-term or medium-term impacts to either our current platform or Macarthur platform, they're anticipated to be extremely muted because of the structure of the tax. We'll see if that holds when it gets to final passage, but that's currently the plan."

The PCI-type coals seem to have done reasonably well relative to that spread. The very lower quality coking coals have been -- that spread has widened even greater over the last several quarters, I would say. And I think that's just a reflection of -- there are parts of the steel sector that are very strong. China remains strong. India remains strong. Turkey, Brazil, there are parts of the steel sector like Europe that are down somewhat. So I think our view going forward is we may see the spread for a little while until we start to see that spread get back to more historic norms."

I'd just point out the quarter was a sound quarter for us even with some of the moving parts that we had with the North Goonyella issues. The coal markets we serve, the fundamentals remain good. Our project pipeline is extremely robust; I would argue the best in the industry. The Macarthur transaction is moving rapidly to completion and offers a great potential for growth and value creation and addition to our portfolio. I would say all of this happens because of the employee base that we have. We've got a phrase we use around here, ""you earn your right to grow,"" and we continue to deliver quarter after quarter. That's what allows us to have the opportunities to make these kinds of large acquisitions and bring them into the portfolio. So I thank them for all of their efforts and activities. And obviously, our next quarterly call will be a lot of new information. So we look forward to updating you on our progress and where we're at with Macarthur and our platform at that point in time.
