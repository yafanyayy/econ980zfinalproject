270586,118137307,94645,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full year, we",1180,"Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full year, we earned record adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $4.30 per share.
Even though last year was one of the most challenging business environment we've ever faced, NextEra Energy was able to grow adjusted earnings per share by 6% right at the midpoint of our long-term adjusted EPS growth expectation of 5% to 7% per year on average through 2014 starting from the 2009 base. In addition when measured over the long term, we continue to provide a strong track record of outperformance when compared with our peers in the overall market. For the five years ending on December 31, 2010, we delivered a total shareholder return of 48%, easily outpacing both the S&P 500's 12% and the S&P Electric Utilities' 20%. 
Over 10 years, our performance is even more impressive with a total return of 107% compared to 50% for the S&P 500 and 57% for the S&P Electric Utilities. 
Now one of the key to our success for the long term has been our commitment to financial strength. This commitment allowed us to raise $3.7 billion in debt, of which $1.2 billion is project debt at attractive rates in 2010. We also issued $711 million in equity and equity units to support our stronger position and enable us to invest wisely in the future.
You've often heard me say that one of features that sets NextEra Energy apart is the fact that we have two great businesses under one roof. The wisdom of the strategy was clearly evident last year. In 2010 as challenging market conditions limited the growth of Energy Resources' adjusted earnings, FPL once again became the largest driver of NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings growth, something that we expect to continue through at least 2014.
The resettlement approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in December will effectively freeze base rate through 2012, provide cash recovery for a new combined cycle natural gas unit at FPL's West County Energy Center and provide the company with an allowed retail regulatory return on equity or ROE of 9% to 11%. The settlement agreement provides financial certainty to customers and regulatory certainty to FPL. And we appreciate the willingness of those who represent Florida's electric consumers to work with us on a constructive outcome. We believe FPL's retail regulatory ROE will be at or near 11% in 2011 and 2012.
Over the four-year period from 2011 to 2014, FPL plans to bring into service major capital projects that cost approximately $6.4 billion from combined cycle natural gas plants to nuclear to smart grid. Not only do we expect our overall retail base rate to expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5% through 2014 from a 2009 base, but we also expect to earn an appropriate return on our investment over time while continuing to provide great value to our customers.
In December, we brought online a 75-megawatt solar thermal array that is fully integrated with and augments the steam produced by our combined cycle gas unit in Martin County. This represents the last of the original 110 megawatts of solar projects approved for cost recovery in 2008 by the Florida Public Service Commission. As with all of the projects in our pipeline over the past few years, we completed the Martin solar thermal array on schedule and under budget.
NextEra Energy's strong financial performance is matched by the company's ability to consistently achieve high levels of operational performance. In 2010, FPL's fossil fuel fleet set another record for efficiency, bringing the system-wide heat rate to 8,043 British thermal units per kilowatt hour. The average rate for the industry was 10,060 British thermal units per kilowatt hour for 2009, the most recent year for which data are available. 
In 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 17%. And in 2010 alone, we saved customers more than $600 million in fuel costs as a result. Just as important have been our efforts to prudently manage costs. For all of 2010, FPL's non-fuel O&M expenses were $0.015 per kilowatt hour compared with the 2009 industry average of $0.022 per kilowatt hour. On service reliability, the company's system average interruption duration index of 80 was again top quartile in the industry. 
At Energy Resources, we added 754 megawatts of wind capacity in North America in 2010 including 70 megawatts from acquisitions. At the end of the year, we owned 8,298 megawatts of wind power. Not only are the leading wind energy owner in the United States, but we are now the fourth largest wind energy in Canada. 
We also made considerable progress in 2010 signing power purchase agreements for the production of our wind fleet. Also, we secured long-term contracts on approximately 1,238 megawatts of wind power during the year. And although not all of these contracts were for 2010 construction projects, we're happy with the progress in this area.
On the solar front, the PPA for our Genesis project was approved by the California Public Utility Commission Bureau of Land Management and the California Energy Commission in 2010. Site works started this month. And we plan for the project's twin 125-megawatt array to qualify for the convertible investment tax credit or CITC in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 
Our Spain solar project also made progress in 2010. In December, the Spanish government published its revised tariff. As we had expected, the net effect of the change is contained in the revised Royal Decree were roughly neutral to our project and we remain interested in moving forward. 
Energy Resources now has a talented team in place to work with the banks, government officials and other parties to manage our interests. Armando will provide a more detailed update on Spain in a couple of minutes. Combined, the full construction of Genesis and Spain solar projects would represent an approximately $2.3 billion investment in solar. And we expect them to be significant earnings drivers for the company starting in the 2013-2014 time frame.
From an operational standpoint, Energy Resources repower generating assets performed exceptionally well during 2010, setting a high mark with its lowest forced outage rate on record. In addition to grow FPL and Energy Resources, we expect to grow earnings through Lone Star transmission, our regulated utility in Texas. Lone Star received approval in late 2010 to build a roughly 320-mile, approximately $800 million transmission line. The company is eligible to earn an allowance for funds during construction in 2011, and the project is expected to be in service in 2013.
Record adjusted earnings, solid earnings growth, strong operational performance and the continued development of pipeline of capital projects. This was NextEra Energy's story in 2010, and we expect it will be our story going forward as well. 
On that note, let me turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before I return for a few final remarks. Armando?"
270586,118137307,94645,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew, and good morning to everyone. In the fourth quarter 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $263 million or $0.63 per share.

In the fourth quarter 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $263 million or $0.63 per share. NextEra Energy's 2010  fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $332 million and $0.80, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the full year 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $2 billion or $4.74 per share. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 earnings and EPS were $1.8 billion and $4.30, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Florida Power & Light had net income of $181 million or $0.43 per share. For the full year 2010, FPL's net income was $945 million or $2.29 per share. The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for FPL for the just completed quarter as well as for the full year 2010. In total, quarterly earnings decreased by $0.02 per share. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of weather and increased O&M expenses. These drivers were partially offset by the impact of FPL's base rate increase and increased results from clauses including the shifting of certain capacity charges from base rates in the capacity costs. Full year 2010 results were driven by the addition of West County units 1 and 2 and the impact of FPL's base rate revenue increases in cause results, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation expenses as a result of the settlement agreement and AFUDC.
We are continuing to see improvement in some of our key customer metrics, although they are not yet all trending positively. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall retail kilowatt hour sales fell by 3.5%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth. Although many of you are aware that we experienced a far colder than normal month in December, the weather for the quarter as a whole particularly cool in degree days, was mild relative to normal and well below the favorable weather realized in the fourth quarter of 2009. Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.9%. Although some of this decrease continues to be due to mandated energy efficiency measures, I think that some is related to the impact of empty home that I will discuss in a moment, at some is also related to the effects of extreme weather that are not precisely covered in our models.
Over the last 60 years, December 2010 was the coldest December on record and the fifth coldest winter month overall for our service territory. And again, our total system performed admirably during this last cold weather event, just as it did during last January's record cold temperatures. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we had approximately 28,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. This is the fourth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior comparable period, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning.
The graph on the bottom left shows our monthly year-over-year customer additions in percentage terms, broken down by residential and commercial customers. As you can see, residential customers additions accelerated at the beginning of 2010, and the growth roughly through the balance of the year. Trends in commercial customer growth appear to lag that of the residential customers. And it was not until the summer months of 2010 that commercial growth accelerated. The coming year will be important for the economy, and we will continue to monitor customer trends carefully in the next couple of months.
The graph on the bottom right of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depict a level of empty homes in our service territory. In December 2010, the decline in residential inactive meters accelerated, while the ratio of inactive meters to total accounts experienced its largest drop since February 2010. However, despite the decline in inactive meters, low usage customers increased slightly. While we cannot be certain, we believe it is possible that a certain number of inactive accounts are turning into low usage accounts. 
So my earlier comments on sales growth. Some of the customer growth we are experiencing may not yet be producing sales, and in our analysis, may be contributing to the negative underlying usage. The current environment might be viewed as a transition period, as Florida's working through the effects of the real estate market downturn over the last couple of years. On the positive side, homes in FPL markets are becoming more affordable. For example, the current housing affordability index for Miami is now at 66% versus 72% for the U.S. and compared to 11% at the peak of the boom in late 2006.
Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages. And we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move. Because of the impact of the base rate agreement will have on FPL's earnings over the couple of years, I would like to spend a couple of minutes reviewing the details of the agreement in general and the amortization of surplus depreciation in particular. 
Under the terms of the agreement, retail base rates will remain effectively frozen through the end of 2012. And through the capacity clause, FPL is permitted to recover the costs including return for its new combined cycle natural gas unites at West County Energy Center up to the projected fuel savings for customers attributed to the new unit. This allows for current cash recovery without a corresponding increase in customers' total bill. The estimated 2011 fuel savings is approximately $96 million, which is roughly equal to the nonfuel revenue requirements for the plant at a 10% ROE.
The authorized retail regulatory ROE remains within the range of 9% to 11% and is measured in actual non-weather-adjusted basis. I will refer to the actual non-weather adjusted retail regulatory ROE in this discussion as just retail regulatory ROE. As you recall, as part of the rate order issued in March 2010, the Commission determined that FPL had $895 million in net surplus depreciation in order for FPL to amortize depreciation ratably over a four-year period starting in 2010. Under the agreement, FPL had the flexibility to vary the quarterly and annual amount of surplus depreciation, amortization that it records. The surplus depreciation will be amortized to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of up to 11%, subject to certain annual and total caps. 
A $267 million annual cap on the amortization surplus depreciation applies to each year of the agreement. However to the extent that our amortization surplus in any given year is less than the $267 million cap, it can be carried forward and will be available for use in subsequent years. In essence, rasing subsequent years' caps. No more than $776 million of the surplus depreciation can be amortization during the term of the agreement, unless more up to the entire amount of the initial $895 million of surplus depreciation then remaining is required to avoid a filing with the PSC showing a retail regulatory ROE of less than 9%. In any year of the agreement, the company must amortize enough of the surplus depreciation to maintain at least 9% retail regulatory ROE but may not amortize any surplus depreciation if the amortization would result in FPL earning above an 11% retail regulatory ROE.
We have prepared this summary to assist you in understanding of the surplus depreciation might be amortized over the term of the agreement. As a result of favorable weather during 2010, we amortized approximately $4 million of the allowed $267 million for the year. The amount below the annual cap that we did not amortize in 2010, or $263 million, will be available for use in 2011, bringing the total allowed amortization surplus depreciation in 2011 to be approximately $530 million. Based on current estimates and making certain assumptions including normal weather and operating conditions, we believe we will amortize between $245 million and $265 million of surplus depreciation in 2011. Assuming those estimates are correct, that would be between $507 million and $527 million of surplus depreciation available to be amortized in 2012 in order to achieve a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11%.
Based on current estimates, we expect FPL will earn a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% in both 2011 and 2012. On a book basis, the overall FPL ROE would be less than 11% because there are some expenses not recoverable to rates and some clause investments that earn a 10% ROE. As Lew mentioned, we expect FPL's retail rate base to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5%, from a 2009 base through 2014. This growth is being driven by approximately $6.4 billion of major capital projects including modernizations and nuclear upgrades expected to be brought into service between 2011 and 2014, all of which have been approved by the Commission and several of which will receive costs recovery.
As you recall, we manage our equity ratio on a GAAP basis to approximately 59%, which currently translates to a regulatory equity ratio of roughly 48%. It is strong rate base growth, coupled with a fair and appropriate return on these investments, which we expect to be a significant driver of NextEra Energy's overall growth. As many of you know, last year the Florida legislature considered legislation that would have given utilities the voluntary opportunity to build renewable generation in the state and would have provided cost recovery for a clause mechanism. If legislation is enacted in the future, FPL would have the opportunity to build incremental renewable generation that is not in our current plans.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. During 2010, we successfully added 754 megawatts of incremental wind capacity to our portfolio, including 70 megawatts of existing wind generation that we acquired during the fourth quarter. Of note, our 82 megawatt Canada wind project was the largest wind generation facility brought into service in 2010 in Canada. And we now own and operate approximately 220 megawatts of wind generation in the country. We are pleased that in the fourth quarter, we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind purchased power agreements or PPAs. This figure includes 78 megawatts related to a PPA we signed for a repowering project in California. We'll talk more about the current wind generation contracting environment in a couple of minutes.
During the course of 2010, we elected to receive CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation. During the calendar year of 2010, we received approximately $430 million in cash related to the program. And we expect receive roughly $400 million in cash in 2011. As we initially indicated on the third quarter earnings conference call, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on 400 to 550 megawatts of new wind generation in 2011.
Turning to our solar initiatives. We have also continued to make significant progress in our solar development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we acquired appropriately 40 megawatts of solar projects currently in development in Ontario, Canada. Construction on the project is expected to begin in early 2011 and commercial operations are expected by the end of 2011. The projects, when completed, will self power under long-term contract to the Ontario Power Authority. We also commissioned the 5-megawatt Paradise solar PV project in New Jersey. The Paradise project generates New Jersey's solar renewable energy credits. 
In November, the Genesis solar thermal project received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the last major approval of the project needed before site work began this month. And although we do not have anything to announce at this time, we are optimistic about our ability to signing incremental PPA in California and adjacent states for large-scale solar generation. 
We are pleased to highlight that our Arnold Energy Center received a 20-year license extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC. The energy approval comes just after two years after NextEra Energy Duane Arnold and its joint owners entered the extremely rigorous and comprehensive licensed extension process managed by the NRC. 
Finally, we have two financing transactions we would like to highlight. First, during the fourth quarter we entered into two CAD $150 million variable-rate revolving credit facilities that expire at the end of 2013. These facilities are particularly attractive because they are in Canadian dollars, which align well with investments we're making in the country.
Second, in December, we successfully financed our 507-megawatt gas fired facility located in Blythe, California. We were able to secure a $231 million limited recourse loan as a result of proactively seeking a long-term power sales agreement for the output of the plant. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $73 million or $0.17 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $143 million or $0.34 per share. For the full year 2010, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $980 million or $2.37 per share. Adjusted earnings were $800 million or $1.93 per share. As we mentioned in the first quarter of 2010, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates. And the historical figures on this slide have been adjusted to reflect that change.
Energy Resources fourth quarter adjusted EPS increased $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were relatively flat due to the $0.04 lower contribution from CITCs. This was largely offset by the $0.03 contribution from assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2009 that were available for a full quarter in 2010.
We elected to take CITCs on 603 megawatts on new wind generation placed in service in 2010 compared with 850 megawatts in 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.15 relative to the prior year. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.04 per share as compared to the year-ago period, which was largely due to an improved wind resource.
The wind resource was approximately 92% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior year's quarter of 81%. Within our existing merchant assets, the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility in 2010  fourth quarter contributed $0.16. This was partially offset by weak market conditions affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, which resulted in $0.03 lower adjusted earnings per share. 
Within our contracted assets, a positive $0.02 contribution from the lack of a refueling outage at our Point Beach facility in 2010, was substantially offset by a negative $0.02 contribution from markets of, which was largely due to unfavorable market conditions and a scheduled outage. Contributions from the Customer Supply business declined $0.02. Contributions from proprietary trading declined by $0.03 per share. As we've indicated before, results from customer supply and trading will often be higher or lower than we expect based on a number of factors, including market volatility and opportunities. As we noted in last year's fourth quarter earnings report, market conditions were particularly favorable in both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. 
Restructuring and asset sales contributed a negative $0.01 compared to last year, due to the absence of the gain recorded last year.
During the quarter, we wrote down the value of certain assets associated with our plants that repower two wind facilities. The write-offs negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03. Although we have included the impact of the write-offs in adjusted earnings, we wanted to highlight them separate, so investors understand these are not part of ongoing operations. All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense.
For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01. New wind and solar additions contributed $0.11, which was driven primarily by the full year adjusted earnings impact from 2009 wind additions and the benefit of state income tax credits partially offset by the impact of lower CITC elections in 2010 relative to 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.13 relative to the prior year. For the full year, the contribution from existing wind assets declined $0.02 due to unfavorable pricing and a lack of certain state tax credits in 2010, which were substantially offset by lower curtailments and an increased wind resource.
Performance from our existing merchant NEPOOL assets was higher by $0.20, driven primarily by the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility. Contributions from our merchant gas assets in Texas were lower by $0.07 due to unfavorable market conditions. Gas infrastructure contributions were up $0.06 relative to the prior year, largely due to the closing out of certain hedges in the third quarter. 
The Customer Supply business contributed $0.10 due to a strong Full Requirements business as well as in retail in mid-marketing origination contribution. Within full requirements, the sale of power supply contract in the first quarter, new contracts and favorable market conditions contributed to the strong results for the year. The proprietary Power and Gas Trading business contributed a negative $0.16 due to unfavorable market conditions relative to last year's very favorable market conditions. Asset sales contributed a positive $0.02, while the write-offs taken in the fourth quarter related to the California wind assets contributed a negative $0.03. All other factors contributed $0.24, of which $0.13 was from higher interest expense in share dilution, and the balance is largely related to the lack of favorable tax benefits in 2010 relative to 2009.
We remain interested in developing or acquiring new wind generation projects and believe that our economy and our environment will benefit from continued investments including generation. We're also committed to maintaining our financial discipline. Therefore the amount of new wind we ultimately add to our portfolio will largely depend on our ability to secure attractive long-term PPAs. 
As Lew mentioned a couple of minutes ago, during the fourth quarter we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind PPAs, bringing our total PPAs signed in 2010 to 1,238 megawatts. As of year-end 2010, we have 612 megawatts of wind capacity that is built and we intend to contract, but currently do not have a signed long-term agreement in hand. Contracting these megawatts continues to be a high priority for us, and I am comfortable with the progress that we are making. 
As noted in the chart on the right, of the total 1,238 megawatts of PPAs secured in 2010, 553 megawatts are for projects we expect to be commissioned in 2011. As always, some of these projects could slip into 2012 due to normal development and construction timing issues. In addition to the 553 megawatts of secured contracts, we have another 400 to 500 megawatts of projects currently in development but without contracts that could be commissioned in 2011. This level of certainty regarding contracts for the pipeline is particularly positive, given the challenging conditions we continue to encounter in the market.
One way that we plan to add incremental value to the business in the next couple of years is to begin to repower some of our older wind facilities. We can deploy fewer wind turbines with an increase capacity factor and also take advantage of elections, the production tax credits or PTCs or the CITC. In fact during in the fourth quarter, we signed a PPA with an existing California facilities off-taker to repower that facility. We believe we may have the opportunity to repower approximately 300 to 400 megawatts of wind capacity over the next four years.
As we have indicated to you many times and our track record should show, we are as interested in acquiring new and existing wind and solar assets as we are in building them ourselves. In fact, we have acquired approximately 343 megawatts of renewable generation assets since 2008. This does not include 190 megawatts of wind and solar projects purchased or contracted to purchase in the fourth quarter of 2010 that are expected to come online in mid-2011.
As we have indicated over the past 12 to 18 months, we have expected a number of assets to change hands. But the executed transactions have been fewer than we had predicted. You should expect that when large assets or portions of assets come into the market, we will take a look at most, if not all, of these opportunities and pursue the ones that fit into our portfolio and our strategic plans.
As Lew mentioned in December, the changes to the Royal Decree that we first mentioned during the second quarter earnings conference call were officially proved and incorporated into a revised Royal Decree. As a reminder, the Spain project consists of two 49.9 megawatts solar thermal projects with storage. Under the current tariff, the projects will receive a government guaranteed premium tariff rate over their operating lives, which we estimate will be approximately 30 years. 
We are now working to finalize the financing for the project that should provide the bulk of the funding for construction through the projects' commercial operations. While the financing has not been finalized, we're currently engaged with several European banks in a financing package that will provide the bulk of the necessary cash flows for construction and limit our exposure in the event of a change in the tariff to the amount of our equity investment. 
We began site work in January and expect the two units to reach commercial operations in 2013. The projects in Spain are a high priority for our development team and are the only significant development or acquisition opportunity we are pursuing outside North America. We continue to believe the risk-adjusted returns are attractive and the projects represent a strategic opportunity for us to further build our skills in solar and expand our Solar Generation portfolio.  We have a team permanently on the ground in Spain that is monitoring and managing all the developments that affect our project. We monitor carefully the financial, economic and political developments in the country. And our team has engaged with the banks, local industry, government officials and other interested parties to manage and support our interest.
Our overall energy resources projects gross margin and EBITDA expectations for 2011 and 2012 have not changed significantly since we reviewed them with you last quarter. The full gross margin hedged slides can be found in the appendix of this presentation, which is posted to our website. 
In 2011, the average hedge price for our non-spark spread merchant assets in terms of dollars per MMBtu of natural gas is $6.97, and the average hedge price in 2012 is $6.36. These prices are clearly above current market prices and highlight the effectiveness of our hedging program. In addition to incremental detail about 2011 and 2012, we wanted to give you a little perspective on the stability we have on Energy Resources business in 2014, predominantly as a result of our portfolio of long-term contracted assets. Approximately 69% of our existing power assets expected gross margin is currently hedged in 2014. 
Regarding earnings sensitivities, the adjusted EPS sensitivity to changes in natural gas prices on our 2011 open position is relatively modest. For every $1 change in gas prices, the annualized impact is approximately $0.03 per share on an adjusted earnings basis at NextEra Energy Inc. For 2012, the equivalent adjusted earnings sensitivity is $0.06 per share.
We also want to update the sensitivity regarding the wind resource for assets in service as of January 1, 2011. For every 1% change in the wind resource on an annual basis, adjusted EPS at NextEra Energy Inc. would be impacted approximate $0.02 per share. 
To summarize's 2010's fourth quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.43, Energy Resources contributed $0.34 and din Corporate and Other was a positive $0.03 contribution. That is a total of $0.80 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 or a 1% increase year-over-year. On an adjusted basis for the full year 2010, FPL contributed $2.29 per share, Energy Resources contributed $1.93 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.08. That's a total of $4.30 compared to $4.05 per share in 2009 or a 6% increase year-over-year. 
Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend just a minute discussing our long-term adjusted earnings per share guidance. Back at our May 2010 Investor Conference when we first discussed our longer-term expectations, I indicated that primarily because of the significance of our current construction cycle at FPL, adjusted earnings growth through 2014 would be driven largely by FPL investments. That continues to remain true and we should not forget about the value that our investments are bringing to our Florida customers. Our typical residential electric bill remains the lowest in Florida and 24% below the national average. And we estimate that by 2014, our continuing investments and more efficient generation will save our customers roughly $1 billion per year relative to a 2001 base. We continue to believe that our laser sharp focus on doing what is best for customers will result in positive outcomes for our shareholders as well. 
And so by 2014, our expectations are that a majority of our consolidated adjusted earnings will be from the regulated side of our, business including our investments in Lone Star transmission. We believe that not only will our regulated adjusted earnings per share make up roughly 60% of our consolidated adjusted earnings, but that on an EBITDA basis, roughly 80% of our forecasted adjusted EBITDA will be from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted. For 2010, that percentage is approximately 74%. 
Of course, that assumes that new renewable investment in our plan through 2014 are long-term contracted. But that is a proper assumption as we are committed to invest in that side of our business only when we expect longer-term certainty in the cash flows from those investments. That should give you some additional insight regarding the make-up of our expectations for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings growth per year through 2014 from a 2009 base. In 2011, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS within the range of $4.25 and $4.55 is a reasonable expectation. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew."

I want to close by providing some perspective on why we think NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. On the regulated side of our business, we are in the midst of a substantial capital spending program and expect to bring in",449,"Thanks, Armando. I want to close by providing some perspective on why we think NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. 
On the regulated side of our business, we are in the midst of a substantial capital spending program and expect to bring into service projects that cost approximate $7.2 billion between FPL and Lone Star transmission between now and 2014. Importantly, we will be building new combined cycle plants, pursuing more than 400 megawatts of added capacity to our nuclear units and continuing the deploying of our Smart Grid program. We plan to spend an approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion on the nuclear upgrades, all of which is comparable. We expect to earn an appropriate return in all of these projects, each of which have produced tangible benefits for customers in the form of improved long-term power affordability and reliability.
In Texas, our Lone Star transmission business became a utility in October 2010. We will earn regulated returns on our roughly 320-mile transmission line, even as we help set the stage for a dramatic expansion of wind power in the state. 
Energy Resources has a strong pipeline of renewable energy products that should fuel profitable growth. We remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts through 2014 from the 754 megawatts we added in 2010 were an excellent start. 
Equally impressive was the progress we've made on our solar strategy. Of the $3 billion to $4 billion we expect to invest in solar projects between 2010 and 2014, we already have approximately $2.3 billion of projects under contract and initial site work is under way. We also have a robust pipeline of additional opportunities. 
And of course whenever assets come up for sale, we will be taking a careful look to see if they make sense for us. With our track record of superior execution, we have every confidence that we will be able to bring these planned projects to successful completion. That's why we remain very comfortable with our view that the business can generate a 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 on a 2009 base, even as the overall level of risk in our portfolio declines. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of NextEra Energy's EBITDA will come from regulated or long-term contracted assets.
In closing, I want to thank NextEra's 15,000 employees for their talent and hard work, which allowed us to deliver superior value to customers shareholders alike in 2010. And we'll continue to do so in the years ahead. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for any questions you might have."

And I do believe that, that is one of the reasons -- I talked about this in the script and I've talked about it before, I think that is one of the reasons why we and others haven't seen as much activity as we have expected 12 to 18 months ago. I think there's still some hesitation on the other side, on the solar side, to potentially let go these assets, so that the buyers are able to gain the returns that they expect and that make economic sense for them. But on the self build and acquisition front, just to make very clear today in the prepared remarks, that we see both opportunity in a pari passu. Our investment dollars will be allocated to those projects that we believe have the strongest long-term returns."

And now the folks in Washington that are responsible for actually interpreting that legislation appear to be having difficulty with pieces of it. And so I would first start out by saying that there is more to this bonus depreciation that should be coming out, I would hope in the next couple of months. And the interpretations that would be particularly important for the industry and for us are interpretations regarding self build or self constructed assets. I'm not going to get into details on this call. But I will tell you that those interpretations are still up in the air and would make the difference between some of our assets receiving 100% bonus depreciation and some of our assets receiving 50% bonus depreciation. But the additional cash that's coming in on both sides of the business is not that significant for us overall. But that's because we have a significant amount of production tax credits that we're going to offset future taxable income, and we have talked about that before. So it's really an allocation of cash flows between the companies. But on a corporate level, at least for us, based on what I'm seeing today, I wouldn't expect the cash flows to be significantly different from our forecast of 2014."

We've consistently been growing this business at a rate that's in the, off the top of my head, top quartile in the industry over the last decade. I've talked a lot about the growth that we have going forward. I continue to be very bullish on the Florida market long term. I've always thought that this industry, it was a real original thought on my part that this industry should consolidate. That's a joke. People have talked about that for years and years and years. And yet when I look at the growth that we achieved in many ways, we effectively added the equivalent of several medium-sized utilities over the years. So we try to do this before. We realize that is a lot of challenges and distraction associated on the M&A side. Having said that, we are always good to be opportunistic about it. We have a pretty share responsibility to look at that things are obeyed and our criteria for M&A hasn't changed and we always look at M&A from a standpoint economy going attractive, is it feasible from a regulatory perspective and is it socially to a bold? Those have proven to be top set of barriers over the years forgetting transactions done. So I'm not sure that it's a very clear answer for you, Steve, but maybe intentionally so I guess, the bottom line is that we're always open to it but our focus is on growing our business and building shareholder value that way."

In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full ye",1201,"Okay. Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full year, we earned record adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $4.30 per share.
Even though last year was one of the most challenging business environment we've ever faced, NextEra Energy was able to grow adjusted earnings per share by 6% right at the midpoint of our long-term adjusted EPS growth expectations of 5% to 7% per year on average through 2014, starting from a 2009 base. In addition, when measured over the long term, we continue to provide a strong track record of outperformance when compared with our peers in the overall market. For the five years ending on December 31, 2010, we delivered a total shareholder return of 48%, easily outpacing both the S&P 500's 12% and the S&P Electric Utilities' 20%. 
Over 10 years, our performance is even more impressive with a total return of 107% compared to 15% for the S&P 500 and 57% for the S&P Electric Utilities. 
Now one of the keys to our success over the long term has been our commitment to financial strength. This commitment allowed us to raise $3.7 billion in debt, of which $1.2 billion is project debt at attractive rates in 2010. We also issued $711 million in equity and equity units to support our strong credit position and to enable us to invest wisely in the future.
You've often heard me say that one of the features that sets NextEra Energy apart is the fact that we have two great businesses under one roof. The wisdom of the strategy was clearly evident last year. In 2010 as challenging market conditions limited the growth of Energy Resources' adjusted earnings, FPL once again became the largest driver of NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings growth, something that we expect to continue through at least 2014.
The rate settlement approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in December will effectively freeze base rates through 2012, provide cash recovery for our new combined-cycle natural gas unit at FPL's West County Energy Center and provide the company with an allowed retail regulatory return on equity or ROE of 9% to 11%. The settlement agreement provides financial certainty to customers and regulatory certainty to FPL. And we appreciate the willingness of those who represent Florida's electric consumers to work with us on a constructive outcome. We believe FPL's retail regulatory ROE will be at or near 11% in 2011 and 2012.
Over the four-year period from 2011 through 2014, FPL plans to bring into service major capital projects that cost approximately $6.4 billion from combined-cycle natural gas plants to nuclear upgrades to smart grid. Not only do we expect our overall retail base rate to expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5% through 2014 from a 2009 base, but we also expect to earn an appropriate return on our investments over time while continuing to provide great value to our customers.
In December, we brought online a 75-megawatt solar thermal array that is fully integrated with and augments the steam produced by our combined-cycle gas unit in Martin County. This represents the last of the original 110 megawatts of solar projects approved for cost recovery in 2008 by the Florida Public Service Commission. As with all of the projects in our Florida pipeline over the past few years, we completed the Martin solar thermal array on schedule and under budget.
NextEra Energy's strong financial performance is matched by the company's ability to consistently achieve high levels of operational performance. In 2010, FPL's fossil fuel fleet set another record for its efficiency, bringing the system-wide heat rate down to 8,043 British thermal units per kilowatt hour. The average heat rate for the industry was 10,060 British thermal units per kilowatt hour for 2009, the most recent year for which data are available. 
In 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 17%. And in 2010 alone, we saved customers more than $600 million in fuel costs as a result. Just as important have been our efforts to prudently manage costs. For all of 2010, FPL's non-fuel O&M expenses were $0.015 per kilowatt hour compared with the 2009 industry average of $0.022 per kilowatt hour. On service reliability, the company's System Average Interruption Duration Index or SAIDI was again top quartile in the industry. 
At Energy Resources, we added 754 megawatts of wind capacity in North America in 2010, including 70 megawatts from acquisitions. At the end of the year, we owned 8,298 megawatts of wind power. Not only are we the leading wind energy owner in the United States, but we are now the fourth largest wind energy owner in Canada. 
We also made considerable progress in 2010 signing power purchase agreements for the production of our wind fleet. Also we secured long-term contracts on approximately 1,238 megawatts of wind power during the year. And although not all of these contracts were for 2010 construction projects, we're happy with the progress in this area.
On the solar front, the PPA for our Genesis project was approved by the California Public Utility Commission, Bureau of Land Management and the California Energy Commission in 2010. Site works started this month. And we plan for the project twin 125-megawatt array to qualify for the convertible investment tax credit or CITC in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 
Our Spain solar project also made progress in 2010. In December, the Spanish government published its revised feed-in tariff. As we had expected, the net effect of the change is contained in the revised Royal Decree were roughly neutral to our project, and we remain interested in moving forward. 
Energy Resources now has a talented team in place on the ground to work with the banks, government officials and other parties to manage our interests. Armando will provide a more detailed update on Spain in a couple of minutes. Combined, the full construction of the Genesis and Spain solar projects would represent an approximately $2.3 billion investment in solar. And we expect them to be significant earnings drivers for the company starting in the 2013-2014 time frame.
From an operational standpoint, Energy Resources' fleet of power generating assets performed exceptionally well during 2010, setting a high mark with its lowest forced outage rate on record. In addition to growth at FPL and Energy Resources, we expect to grow earnings through Lone Star Transmission, our regulated utility in Texas. Lone Star received approval in late 2010 to build a roughly 320 mile, approximately $800 million transmission line. The company is eligible to earn an allowance for funds used during construction in 2011, and the project is expected to be in service in 2013.
Record adjusted earnings, solid earnings growth, strong operational performance and the continued development of an attractive pipeline of capital projects, this was NextEra Energy's story in 2010, and we expect it will be our story going forward as well. On that note, let me turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before I return for a few final remarks. Armando?"

In the fourth quarter 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $263 million or $0.63 per share. NextEra Energy's 2010 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $332 million and $0.80, respectively",4450,"Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $263 million or $0.63 per share. NextEra Energy's 2010 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $332 million and $0.80, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the full year 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $2 billion or $4.74 per share. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 earnings and EPS were $1.8 billion and $4.30, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Florida Power & Light had net income of $181 million or $0.43 per share. For the full year 2010, FPL's net income was $945 million or $2.29 per share. The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for FPL for the just completed quarter as well as for the full year 2010. In total, quarterly earnings decreased by $0.02 per share. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of weather and increased O&M expenses. These drivers were partially offset by the impact of FPL's base rate increase and increased results from clauses, including the shifting of certain capacity charges from base rates into capacity costs. Full year 2010 results were driven by the addition of West County units 1 and 2 and the impact of FPL's base rate revenue increases in clause results, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation expense as a result of the settlement agreement and AFUDC.
We are continuing to see improvement in some of our key customer metrics, although they are not yet all trending positively. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales fell by 3.5%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth. Although many of you are aware that we experienced a far colder-than-normal month in December, the weather for the quarter as a whole, particularly cooling degree days, was mild relative to normal and well below the favorable weather realized in the fourth quarter of 2009. Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.9%. Although some of this decrease continues to be due to mandated energy efficiency measures, I think that some is related to the impact of empty home that I will discuss in a moment, and some is also related to the effects of extreme weather that are not precisely covered in our models.
Over the last 60 years, December 2010 was the coldest December on record and the fifth coldest winter month overall for our service territory. And again, our total system performed admirably during this last cold weather event just as it did during last January's record cold temperatures. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we had approximately 28,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. This is the fourth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior comparable period, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning.
The graph on the bottom left shows our monthly year-over-year customer additions in percentage terms, broken down by residential and commercial customers. As you can see, residential customer additions accelerated at the beginning of 2010, then the growth held roughly steady through the balance of the year. Trends in commercial customer growth appear to lag that of the residential customers, and it was not until the summer months of 2010 that commercial growth accelerated. The coming year will be important for the Florida economy, and we will continue to monitor customer trends carefully in the next couple of months.
The graph on the bottom right of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe depict the level of empty homes in our service territory. In December 2010, the decline in residential inactive meters accelerated, while the ratio of inactive meters to total accounts experienced its largest drop since February 2010. However, despite the decline in inactive meters, low-usage customers increased slightly. While we cannot be certain, we believe it is possible that a certain number of inactive accounts are turning into low-usage accounts. 
So my earlier comments on sales growth, some of the customer growth we are experiencing may not yet be producing sales, and in our analysis, may be contributing to the negative underlying usage. The current environment might be viewed as a transition period as Florida is working through the effects of the real estate market downturn over the last couple of years. On the positive side, homes in FPL markets are becoming more affordable. For example, the current housing affordability index for Miami is now at 66% versus 72% for the U.S. and compared to 11% at the peak of the boom in late 2006.
Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages. And we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move. Because of the impact of the base rate agreement will have on FPL's earnings over the next couple of years, I would like to spend a couple of minutes reviewing the details of the agreement in general and the amortization of surplus depreciation in particular. 
Under the terms of the agreement, retail base rates will remain effectively frozen through the end of 2012. And through the capacity clause, FPL is permitted to recover the costs including return for its new combined-cycle natural gas unit at West County Energy Center up to the projected fuel savings for customers attributed to the new unit. This allows for current cash recovery without a corresponding increase in customers' total bill. The estimated 2011 fuel savings is approximately $96 million, which is roughly equal to the non-fuel revenue requirements for the plant at a 10% ROE.
The authorized retail regulatory ROE remains within the range of 9% to 11%, and is measured in actual non-weather-adjusted basis. I will refer to the actual non-weather adjusted retail regulatory ROE in this discussion as just retail regulatory ROE. As you recall, as part of the rate order issued in March 2010, the Commission determined that FPL had $895 million in net surplus depreciation and ordered FPL to amortize its surplus depreciation ratably over a four-year period starting in 2010. Under the agreement, FPL has the flexibility to vary the quarterly and annual amount of surplus depreciation, amortization that it records. The surplus depreciation will be amortized to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of up to 11%, subject to certain annual and total caps. 
A $267 million annual cap on the amortization surplus depreciation applies to each year of the agreement. However, to the extent that our amortization surplus in any given year is less than the $267 million cap, it can be carried forward and will be available for use in subsequent years. In essence, raising subsequent years' caps. No more than $776 million of the surplus depreciation can be amortized during the term of the agreement, unless more up to the entire amount of the initial $895 million of surplus depreciation then remaining is required to avoid a filing with the PSC showing a retail regulatory ROE of less than 9%. In any year of the agreement, the company must amortize enough of the surplus depreciation to maintain at least 9% retail regulatory ROE, but may not amortize any surplus depreciation if the amortization would result in FPL earning above an 11% retail regulatory ROE.
We have prepared this summary to assist you in understanding how the surplus depreciation might be amortized over the term of the agreement. As a result of favorable weather during 2010, we amortized approximately $4 million of the allowed $267 million for the year. The amount below the annual cap that we did not amortize in 2010 or $263 million will be available for use in 2011, bringing the total allowed amortization surplus depreciation in 2011 to be approximately $530 million. Based on current estimates and making certain assumptions, including normal weather and operating conditions, we believe we will amortize between $245 million and $265 million of surplus depreciation in 2011. Assuming those estimates are correct, that would leave between $507 million and $527 million of surplus depreciation available to be amortized in 2012 in order to achieve a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11%.
Based on current estimates, we expect FPL will earn a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% in both 2011 and 2012. On a book basis, the overall FPL ROE would be less than 11% because there are some expenses not recoverable through rates and some clause investments that earn a 10% ROE. As Lew mentioned, we expect FPL's retail rate base to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5%, from a 2009 base through 2014. This growth is being driven by approximately $6.4 billion of major capital projects, including modernizations and nuclear upgrades, expected to be brought into service between 2011 and 2014, all of which have been approved by the Commission and several of which will receive costs recovery.
As you recall, we manage our equity ratio on a GAAP basis to approximately 59%, which currently translates to a regulatory equity ratio of roughly 48%. It is strong rate base growth, coupled with a fair and appropriate return on these investments, which we expect to be a significant driver of NextEra Energy's overall growth. 
As many of you know, last year the Florida legislature considered legislation that would have given utilities the voluntary opportunity to build renewable generation in the state and would have provided cost recovery through a clause mechanism. If a legislation is enacted in the future, FPL would have the opportunity to build incremental renewable generation that is not in our current plans.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. During 2010, we successfully added 754 megawatts of incremental wind capacity to our portfolio, including 70 megawatts of existing wind generation that we acquired during the fourth quarter. Of note, our 82 megawatt Ghost Pine Canada wind project was the largest wind generation facility brought into service in 2010 in Canada. And we now own and operate approximately 220 megawatts of wind generation in the country. We are pleased that in the fourth quarter, we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind purchased power agreements or PPAs. This figure includes 78 megawatts related to a PPA we signed for a repowering project in California. We will talk more about the current wind generation contracting environment in a couple of minutes.
During the course of 2010, we elected to receive CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation. During the calendar year of 2010, we received approximately $430 million in cash related to the program, and we expect to receive roughly $400 million in cash in 2011. As we initially indicated on the third quarter earnings conference call, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on 400 to 550 megawatts of new wind generation in 2011.
Turning to our solar initiatives. We have also continued to make significant progress on our solar development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we acquired appropriately 40 megawatts of solar projects currently in development in Ontario, Canada. Construction on the project is expected to begin in early 2011, and commercial operations are expected by the end of 2011. The projects, when completed, will sell power under long-term contract to the Ontario Power Authority. We also commissioned the 5-megawatt Paradise solar PV project in New Jersey. The Paradise project generates New Jersey's solar renewable energy credits. 
In November, the Genesis solar thermal project received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the last major approval the project needed before site work began this month. And although we do not have anything to announce at this time, we are optimistic about our ability to sign incremental PPAs in California and adjacent states for large-scale solar generation. 
We are pleased to highlight that our Duane Arnold Energy Center received a 20-year license extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC. The NRC approval comes just after two years after NextEra Energy Duane Arnold and its joint owners entered the extremely rigorous and comprehensive license extension process managed by the NRC. 
Finally, we have two financing transactions we would like to highlight. First, during the fourth quarter, we entered into two CAD $150 million three-year variable rate revolving credit facilities that expire at the end of 2013. These facilities are particularly attractive because they are in Canadian dollars, which align well with investments we are making in the country. Second, in December, we successfully financed our 507-megawatt gas-fired facility located in Blythe, California. We were able to secure a $231 million limited recourse loan as a result of proactively seeking a long-term power sales agreement for the output of the plant. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $73 million or $0.17 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $143 million or $0.34 per share. For the full year 2010, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $980 million or $2.37 per share. Adjusted earnings were $800 million or $1.93 per share. As we mentioned in the first quarter of 2010, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates. And the historical figures on this slide have been adjusted to reflect that change.
Energy Resources' fourth quarter adjusted EPS increased $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were relatively flat due to the $0.04 lower contribution from CITCs. This was largely offset by the $0.03 contribution from assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2009 that were available for a full quarter in 2010.
We elected to take CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation placed in service in 2010 compared with 815 megawatts in 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.15 relative to the prior year. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.04 per share as compared to the year-ago period, which was largely due to an improved wind resource.
The wind resource was approximately 92% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior year's quarter of 81%. Within our existing merchant assets, the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility in 2010  fourth quarter contributed $0.16. This was partially offset by weak market conditions affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, which resulted in $0.03 lower adjusted earnings per share. 
Within our contracted assets, a positive $0.02 contribution from the lack of a refueling outage at our Point Beach facility in 2010 was substantially offset by a negative $0.02 contribution from Marcus Hook 750, which was largely due to unfavorable market conditions and a scheduled outage. 
Contributions from the Customer Supply business declined $0.02. Contributions from proprietary trading declined by $0.03 per share. As we've indicated before, results from customer supply and trading will often be higher or lower than we expect based on a number of factors, including market volatility and opportunities. As we noted in last year's fourth quarter earnings report, market conditions were particularly favorable in both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Restructuring and asset sales contributed a negative $0.01 compared to last year due to the absence of the gain recorded last year.
During the quarter, we wrote down the value of certain assets associated with our plants that repowered two wind facilities. The write-offs negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03. Although we have included the impact of the write-offs in adjusted earnings, we wanted to highlight them separately so investors understand these are not part of ongoing operations. All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense.
For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01. New wind and solar additions contributed $0.11, which was driven primarily by the full year adjusted earnings impact from 2009 wind additions and the benefit of state income tax credits, partially offset by the impact of lower CITC elections in 2010 relative to 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.13 relative to the prior year. For the full year, the contribution from existing wind assets declined $0.02 due to unfavorable pricing of [indiscernible] wind and the lack of certain state tax credits in 2010, which were substantially offset by lower curtailment and an increased wind resource.
Performance from our existing merchant NEPOOL assets was higher by $0.20, driven primarily by the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility. Contributions from our merchant gas assets in Texas were lower by $0.07 due to unfavorable market conditions. Gas infrastructure contributions were up $0.06 relative to the prior year, largely due to the closing out of certain hedges in the third quarter. 
The Customer Supply business contributed $0.10 due to a strong Full Requirements business as well as GEXA retail and mid-marketing origination contributions. Within Full Requirements, the sale of a power supply contract in the first quarter, new contracts and favorable market conditions contributed to the strong results for the year. The proprietary Power and Gas Trading business contributed a negative $0.16 due to unfavorable market conditions relative to last year's very favorable market conditions. Asset sales contributed a positive $0.02, while the write-offs taken in the fourth quarter related to the California wind assets contributed a negative $0.03. All other factors contributed a negative $0.24, of which $0.13 was from higher interest expense and share dilution, and the balance is largely related to the lack of favorable tax benefits in 2010 relative to 2009.
We remain interested in developing or acquiring new wind generation projects and believe that our economy and our environment will benefit from continued investments including generation. We're also committed to maintaining our financial discipline. Therefore, the amount of new wind we ultimately add to our portfolio will largely depend on our ability to secure attractive long-term PPAs. 
As Lew mentioned a couple of minutes ago, during the fourth quarter we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind PPAs, bringing our total wind PPAs signed in 2010 to 1,238 megawatts. As of year-end 2010, we have 612 megawatts of wind capacity that is built and we intend to contract, but currently do not have a signed long-term agreement in hand. Contracting these megawatts continues to be a high priority for us, and I am comfortable with the progress that we are making. 
As noted in the chart on the right, of the total 1,238 megawatts of PPAs secured in 2010, 553 megawatts are for projects we expect to be commissioned in 2011. As always, some of these projects could slip into 2012 due to normal development and construction timing issues. In addition to the 553 megawatts of secured contracts, we have another 400 to 500 megawatts of projects currently in development but without contracts that could be commissioned in 2011. This level of certainty regarding contracts for the pipeline is particularly positive, given the challenging conditions we continue to encounter in the market.
One way that we plan to add incremental value to the business in the next couple of years is to begin to repower some of our older wind facilities. We can deploy fewer wind turbines with an increased net capacity factor and also take advantage of new elections of either the production tax credit or PTCs or the CITC. In fact during in the fourth quarter, we signed a PPA with an existing California facilities off-taker to repower that facility. We believe we may have the opportunity to repower approximately 300 to 400 megawatts of wind capacity over the next four years.
As we have indicated to you many times and our track record should show, we are as interested in acquiring new and existing wind and solar assets as we are in building them ourselves. In fact, we have acquired approximately 343 megawatts of renewable generation assets since 2008. This does not include 190 megawatts of wind and solar projects purchased or contracted to purchase in the fourth quarter of 2010 that are expected to come online in mid-2011.
As we have indicated over the past 12 to 18 months, we have expected a number of assets to change hands, but the executed transactions have been fewer than we have predicted. You should expect that when large assets or portions of assets come into the market, we will take a look at most if not all of these opportunities and pursue the ones that fit into our portfolio and our strategic plans.
As Lew mentioned in December, the changes to the Royal Decree that we first mentioned during the second quarter earnings conference call were officially approved and incorporated into a revised Royal Decree. As a reminder, the Spain projects consist of two 49.9 megawatts solar thermal projects with molten salt storage. Under the current tariff, the projects will receive a government guaranteed premium tariff rate over their operating lives, which we estimate will be approximately 30 years. 
We are now working to finalize the financing for the projects that should provide the bulk of the funding for construction through the projects' commercial operations. While the financing has not been finalized, we are currently engaged with several European banks in a financing package that would provide the bulk of the necessary cash flows for construction and limit our exposure in the event of a change in the tariff to the amount of our equity investment. 
We began site work in January and expect the two units to reach commercial operations in 2013. The projects in Spain are a high priority for our development team, and are the only significant development or acquisition opportunity we are pursuing outside North America. We continue to believe the risk-adjusted returns are attractive and the projects represent a strategic opportunity for us to further build our skills in solar and expand our Solar Generation portfolio. We have a team permanently on the ground in Spain that is monitoring and managing all the developments that affect our projects. We monitor carefully the financial, economic and political developments in the country. And our team has engaged with the banks, local industry, government officials and other interested parties to manage and support our interest.
Our overall energy resources projects gross margin and EBITDA expectations for 2011 and 2012 have not changed significantly since we reviewed them with you last quarter. The full gross margin hedged slides can be found in the appendix of this presentation, which is posted to our website. 
In 2011, the average hedge price for our non-spark spread merchant assets in terms of dollars per MMBtu of natural gas is $6.97, and the average hedge price in 2012 is $6.36. These prices are clearly above current market prices and highlight the effectiveness of our hedging program. In addition to incremental detail about 2011 and 2012, we wanted to give you a little perspective on the visibility we have on Energy Resources business in 2014. Predominantly, as a result of our portfolio of long-term contracted assets, approximately 69% of our existing power assets' expected gross margin is currently hedged in 2014. 
Regarding earnings sensitivities, the adjusted EPS sensitivity to changes in natural gas prices on our 2011 open positions is relatively modest. For every $1 MMBtu change in gas prices, the annualized impact is approximately $0.03 per share on an adjusted earnings basis at NextEra Energy, Inc. For 2012, the equivalent adjusted earnings sensitivity is $0.06 per share.
We also want to update the sensitivity regarding the wind resource for assets and service as of January 1, 2011. For every 1% change in the wind resource on an annual basis, adjusted EPS at NextEra Energy, Inc. would be impacted approximately $0.02 per share. 
To summarize 2010's fourth quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.43, Energy Resources contributed $0.34 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.03 contribution. That is a total of $0.80 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 or a 1% increase year-over-year. On an adjusted basis for the full year 2010, FPL contributed $2.29 per share, Energy Resources contributed $1.93 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.08. That's a total of $4.30 compared to $4.05 per share in 2009 or a 6% increase year-over-year. 
Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend just a minute discussing our long-term adjusted earnings per share guidance. Back at our May 2010 Investor Conference when we first discussed our longer-term expectations, I indicated that primarily because of the significance of our current construction cycle at FPL, adjusted earnings per share growth through 2014 would be driven largely by FPL investments. That continues to remain true, and we should not forget about the value that our investments are bringing to our Florida customers. Our typical residential electric bill remains the lowest in Florida, and 24% below the national average. And we estimate that by 2014, our continuing investments and more efficient generation will save our customers roughly $1 billion per year relative to a 2001 base. We continue to believe that a laser-sharp focus on doing what is best for our customers will result in positive outcomes for our shareholders as well. 
And so by 2014, our expectations are that a majority of our consolidated adjusted earnings will be from the regulated side of our business, including our investments in Lone Star Transmission. We believe that not only will our regulated adjusted earnings per share make up roughly 60% of our consolidated adjusted earnings, but that on an EBITDA basis, roughly 80% of our forecasted adjusted EBITDA will be from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted. For 2010, that percentage is approximately 74%. 
Of course, that assumes that new renewable investments in our plan through 2014 are long-term contracted. But that is a proper assumption since we are committed to invest in that side of our business only when we expect longer-term certainty in the cash flows from those investments. So that should give you some additional insight regarding the make-up of our expectations for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share growth per year through 2014 from a 2009 base. In 2011, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS within the range of $4.25 and $4.55 is a reasonable expectation. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew."

I want to close by providing some perspective on why we think NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. 
On the regulated side of our business, we are in the midst of a substantial capital spending program and expect to bring into service projects that cost approximate $7.2 billion between FPL and Lone Star Transmission between now and 2014. Importantly, we will be building new combined-cycle plants, pursuing more than 400 megawatts of added capacity to our nuclear units and continuing the deployment of our Smart Grid program. We plan to spend an approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion on the nuclear upgrades, all of which is clause recoverable. We expect to earn an appropriate return on all of these projects, each of which have produced tangible benefits for customers in the form of improved long-term power affordability and reliability.
In Texas, our Lone Star Transmission business became a utility in October 2010. We will earn regulated returns on our roughly 320-mile transmission line, even as we help set the stage for a dramatic expansion of wind power in the state. 
Energy Resources has a strong pipeline of renewable energy projects that should fuel profitable growth. We remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts through 2014. And the 754 megawatts we added in 2010 were an excellent start. 
Equally impressive is the progress we've made on our solar strategy. Of the $3 billion to $4 billion we expect to invest in solar projects between 2010 and 2014, we already have approximately $2.3 billion of projects under contract, and initial site work is under way. We also have a robust pipeline of additional opportunities. 
And of course, whenever assets come up for sale, we will be taking a careful look to see if they make sense for us. With our track record of superior execution, we have every confidence that we will be able to bring these planned projects to a successful completion. That's why we remain very comfortable with our view that the business can generate a 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base, even as the overall level of risk in our portfolio declines. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of NextEra Energy's EBITDA will come from regulated or long-term contracted assets.
In closing, I want to thank NextEra Energy's 15,000 employees for their talent and hard work, which allowed us to deliver superior value for customers and shareholders alike in 2010, and we'll continue to do so in the years ahead. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for any questions you might have. Thank you."

And the interpretations that would be particularly important for the industry and for us are interpretations regarding self-build or self-constructed assets. I'm not going to get into details on this call, but I will tell you that those interpretations are still up in the air and would make the difference between some of our assets receiving 100% bonus depreciation and some of our assets receiving 50% bonus depreciation. But the additional cash that's coming in on both sides of the business is not that significant for us overall. But that's because we had a significant amount of production tax credits that were going to offset future taxable income. And we have talked about that before. So it's really an allocation of cash flows between the companies. But on a corporate level at least for us, based on what I'm seeing today, I wouldn't expect the cash flows to be significantly different from our forecast of 2014."

We've talked about wind resource quite a bit over the last 12 to 18 months. I've spent, what I would say, large amounts of earnings calls really discussing what we do, with how we do it in our estimates, and we continue to feel comfortable in the way that we're forecasting wind. Clearly the work that we've done up to this point show that the wind resource for 2009 and for 2010 were very low based on historical standards. A couple of times in the last year, I've mentioned this is the worst quarter in the last 30 years and so we should assume that that's not going to continue long term. We certainly don't see any indication that wind resource would be less than our P50 estimates longer term."

We've consistently been growing this business at a rate that's, off the top of my head, I think top quartile in the industry over the last decade. I've talked a lot about the growth that we have going forward. I continue to be very bullish on the Florida market long term. I've always thought that this industry -- it was a real original thought on my part that this industry should consolidate. That's a joke. People have talked about that for years and years and years. And yet when I look at sort of the growth that we've achieved in many ways, we effectively added the equivalent of several medium-sized utilities over the years. So we've tried to do this before. We realized that there's a lot of challenges and distractions associated on the M&A side. Having said that, we are always going to be opportunistic about it. We have a fiduciary responsibility to look at the things that come our way. And our criteria for M&A hasn't changed, and we always look at M&A from a standpoint. Is it economically attractive? Is it feasible from a regulatory perspective? And is it socially doable? Those have proven to be the top set of barriers over the years for getting transactions done. So I'm not sure that's a very clear answer for you, Steve, but maybe intentionally so. I guess the bottom line is that we're always open to it, but our focus is on growing our business and building shareholder value that way."

In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full ye",1201,"Okay. Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full year, we earned record adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $4.30 per share.
Even though last year was one of the most challenging business environments we've ever faced, NextEra Energy was able to grow adjusted earnings per share by 6%, right at the midpoint of our long-term adjusted EPS growth expectations of 5% to 7% per year on average through 2014, starting from a 2009 base. In addition, when measured over the long term, we continue to provide a strong track record of outperformance when compared with our peers in the overall market. For the five years ending on December 31, 2010, we delivered a total shareholder return of 48%, easily outpacing both the S&P 500's 12% and the S&P Electric Utilities' 20%. 
Over 10 years, our performance is even more impressive with a total return of 107% compared to 15% for the S&P 500 and 57% for the S&P Electric Utilities. 
Now one of the keys to our success over the long term has been our commitment to financial strength. This commitment allowed us to raise $3.7 billion in debt, of which $1.2 billion is project debt, at attractive rates in 2010. We also issued $711 million in equity and equity units to support our strong credit position and to enable us to invest wisely in the future.
You've often heard me say that one of the features that sets NextEra Energy apart is the fact that we have two great businesses under one roof. The wisdom of that strategy was clearly evident last year. In 2010, as challenging market conditions limited the growth of Energy Resources' adjusted earnings, FPL once again became the largest driver of NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings growth. Something that we expect to continue through at least 2014.
The rate settlement approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in December will effectively freeze base rates through 2012, provide cash recovery for our new combined-cycle natural gas unit at FPL's West County Energy Center and provide the company with an allowed retail regulatory return on equity or ROE of 9% to 11%. The settlement agreement provides financial certainty to customers and regulatory certainty to FPL. And we appreciate the willingness of those who represent Florida's electric consumers to work with us on a constructive outcome. We believe FPL's retail regulatory ROE will be at or near 11% in 2011 and 2012.
Over the four-year period from 2011 through 2014, FPL plans to bring into service major capital projects that cost approximately $6.4 billion, from combined-cycle natural gas plants to nuclear uprates to the Smart Grid. Not only do we expect our overall retail base rate to expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5% through 2014 from a 2009 base, but we also expect to earn an appropriate return on our investments over time while continuing to provide great value to our customers.
In December, we brought online a 75-megawatt solar thermal array that is fully integrated with and augments the steam produced by our combined-cycle gas unit in Martin County. This represents the last of the original 110 megawatts of solar projects approved for clause recovery in 2008 by the Florida Public Service Commission. As with all of the projects in our Florida pipeline over the past few years, we completed the Martin solar thermal array on schedule and under budget.
NextEra Energy's strong financial performance is matched by the company's ability to consistently achieve high levels of operational performance. In 2010, FPL's fossil fuel fleet set another record for its efficiency, bringing the system-wide heat rate down to 8,043 British thermal units per kilowatt hour. The average heat rate for the industry was 10,060 British thermal units per kilowatt hour for 2009, the most recent year for which data are available.  Since 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 17%. And in 2010 alone, we saved customers more than $600 million in fuel costs as a result. 
Just as important have been our efforts to prudently manage costs. For all of 2010, FPL's non-fuel O&M expenses were $0.015 per kilowatt hour compared with the 2009 industry average of $0.022 per kilowatt hour. On service reliability, the company's System Average Interruption Duration Index or SAIDI was again top quartile in the industry. 
At Energy Resources, we added 754 megawatts of wind capacity in North America in 2010, including 70 megawatts from acquisitions. At the end of the year, we owned 8,298 megawatts of wind power. Not only are we the leading wind energy owner in the United States, but we are now the fourth largest wind energy owner in Canada. 
We also made considerable progress in 2010 signing power purchase agreements for the production of our wind fleet. All told, we secured long-term contracts on approximately 1,238 megawatts of wind power during the year. And although not all of these contracts were for 2010 construction projects, we're happy with the progress in this area.
On the solar front, the PPA for our Genesis project was approved by the California Public Utility Commission, Bureau of Land Management and the California Energy Commission in 2010. Site work started this month. And we plan for the project's twin 125-megawatt arrays to qualify for the convertible investment tax credit or CITC in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 
Our Spain solar project also made progress in 2010. In December, the Spanish government published its revised feed-in tariff. As we had expected, the net effect of the changes contained in the revised Royal Decree were roughly neutral to our project, and we remain interested in moving forward. 
Energy Resources now has a talented team in place on the ground to work with the banks, government officials and other parties to manage our interests. Armando will provide a more detailed update on Spain in a couple of minutes. Combined, the full construction of the Genesis and Spain solar projects would represent an approximately $2.3 billion investment in solar. And we expect them to be significant earnings drivers for the company starting in the 2013-2014 time frame.
From an operational standpoint, Energy Resources' fleet of power generating assets performed exceptionally well during 2010, setting a high mark with its lowest forced outage rate on record. In addition to growth at FPL and Energy Resources, we expect to grow earnings through Lone Star Transmission, our regulated utility in Texas. Lone Star received approval in late 2010 to build a roughly 320-mile, approximately $800 million transmission line. The company is eligible to earn an allowance for funds used during construction in 2011, and the project is expected to be in service in 2013.
Record adjusted earnings, solid earnings growth, strong operational performance and the continued development of an attractive pipeline of capital projects, this was NextEra Energy's story in 2010, and we expect it will be our story going forward as well. On that note, let me turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before I return for a few final remarks. Armando?"

NextEra Energy's 2010 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $332 million and $0.80, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the full year 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $2 billion or $4.74 per share. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 earnings and EPS were $1.8 billion and $4.30, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Florida Power & Light had net income of $181 million or $0.43 per share. For the full year 2010, FPL's net income was $945 million or $2.29 per share. The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for FPL for the just completed quarter as well as for the full year 2010. In total, quarterly earnings decreased by $0.02 per share. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of weather and increased O&M expenses. These drivers were partially offset by the impact of FPL's base rate increase and increased results from clauses, including the shifting of certain capacity charges from base rates in the capacity clause. Full year 2010 results were driven by the addition of West County units 1 and 2 and the impact of FPL's base rate revenue increases in clause results, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation expense as a result of the settlement agreement and AFUDC.
We are continuing to see improvement in some of our key customer metrics, although they are not yet all trending positively. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales fell by 3.5%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth.  Although many of you are aware that we experienced a far colder-than-normal month in December, the weather for the quarter as a whole, particularly cooling degree days, was mild relative to normal and well below the favorable weather realized in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.9%. Although some of this decrease continues to be due to mandated energy efficiency measures, I think that some is related to the impact of empty home that I will discuss in a moment, and some is also related to the effects of extreme weather that are not precisely covered in our models.
Over the last 60 years, December 2010 was the coldest December on record and the fifth coldest winter month overall for our service territory. And again, our total system performed admirably during this last cold weather event, just as it did during last January's record cold temperatures. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we had approximately 28,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. This is the fourth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior comparable period, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning.
The graph on the bottom left shows our monthly year-over-year customer additions in percentage terms, broken down by residential and commercial customers. As you can see, residential customer additions accelerated at the beginning of 2010, then the growth held roughly steady through the balance of the year. Trends in commercial customer growth appear to lag that of the residential customers, and it was not until the summer months of 2010 that commercial growth accelerated. The coming year will be important for the Florida economy, and we will continue to monitor customer trends carefully in the next couple of months.
The graph on the bottom right of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe depict the level of empty homes in our service territory. In December 2010, the decline in residential inactive meters accelerated, while the ratio of inactive meters to total accounts experienced its largest drop since February 2010. However, despite the decline in inactive meters, low-usage customers increased slightly. While we cannot be certain, we believe it is possible that a certain number of inactive accounts are turning into low-usage accounts. 
To my earlier comments on sales growth, some of the customer growth we are experiencing may not yet be producing sales and, in our analysis, may be contributing to the negative underlying usage. The current environment might be viewed as a transition period as Florida is working through the effects of the real estate market downturn over the last couple of years.  On the positive side, homes in FPL markets are becoming more affordable. For example, the current housing affordability index for Miami is now 66% versus 72% for the U.S. and compared to 11% at the peak of the boom in late 2006.
Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages. And we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move. 
Because of the impact of -- the base rate agreement will have on FPL's earnings over the next couple of years, I would like to spend a couple of minutes reviewing the details of the agreement in general and the amortization of surplus depreciation in particular. 
Under the terms of the agreement, retail base rates will remain effectively frozen through the end of 2012. And through the capacity clause, FPL is permitted to recover the costs, including return, for its new combined-cycle natural gas unit at West County Energy Center up to the projected fuel savings for customers attributed to the new unit. This allows for current cash recovery without a corresponding increase in customers' total bill. The estimated 2011 fuel savings is approximately $96 million, which is roughly equal to the non-fuel revenue requirements for the plant at a 10% ROE.
The authorized retail regulatory ROE remains within the range of 9% to 11%, and is measured on an actual non-weather-adjusted basis. I will refer to the actual non-weather adjusted retail regulatory ROE in this discussion as just retail regulatory ROE. As you recall, as part of the rate order issued in March 2010, the Commission determined that FPL had $895 million in net surplus depreciation and ordered FPL to amortize its surplus depreciation ratably over a four-year period starting in 2010. 
Under the agreement, FPL has the flexibility to vary the quarterly and annual amount of surplus depreciation amortization that it records. The surplus depreciation will be amortized to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of up to 11%, subject to certain annual and total caps. 
A $267 million annual cap on the amortization of surplus depreciation applies to each year of the agreement. However, to the extent that our amortization of surplus in any given year is less than the $267 million cap, it can be carried forward and will be available for use in subsequent years. In essence, raising subsequent years' caps. No more than $776 million of the surplus depreciation can be amortized during the term of the agreement, unless more, up to the entire amount of the initial $895 million of surplus depreciation then remaining, is required to avoid a filing with the PSC showing a retail regulatory ROE of less than 9%. In any year of the agreement, the company must amortize enough of the surplus depreciation to maintain at least 9% retail regulatory ROE, but may not amortize any surplus depreciation if the amortization would result in FPL earning above an 11% retail regulatory ROE.
We have prepared this summary to assist you in understanding how the surplus depreciation might be amortized over the term of the agreement. As a result of favorable weather during 2010, we amortized approximately $4 million of the allowed $267 million for the year. The amount below the annual cap that we did not amortize in 2010, or $263 million, will be available for use in 2011, bringing the total allowed amortization of surplus depreciation in 2011 to be approximately $530 million. 
Based on current estimates and making certain assumptions, including normal weather and operating conditions, we believe we will amortize between $245 million and $265 million of surplus depreciation in 2011. Assuming those estimates are correct, that would leave between $507 million and $527 million of surplus depreciation available to be amortized in 2012 in order to achieve a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11%.
Based on current estimates, we expect FPL will earn a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% in both 2011 and 2012. On a book basis, the overall FPL ROE would be less than 11% because there are some expenses not recoverable through rates and some clause investments that earn a 10% ROE. 
As Lew mentioned, we expect FPL's retail rate base to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5%, from a 2009 base through 2014. This growth is being driven by approximately $6.4 billion of major capital projects, including modernizations and nuclear uprates, expected to be brought into service between 2011 and 2014. All of which have been approved by the Commission and several of which will receive clause recovery.
As you recall, we manage our equity ratio on a GAAP basis to approximately 59%, which currently translates to a regulatory equity ratio of roughly 48%. It is strong rate-based growth, coupled with a fair and appropriate return on these investments, which we expect to be the significant driver of NextEra Energy's overall growth. 
As many of you know, last year the Florida legislature considered legislation that would have given utilities the voluntary opportunity to build renewable generation in the state and would have provided costs recovery through a clause mechanism. If legislation is enacted in the future, FPL would have the opportunity to build incremental renewable generation that is not in our current plans.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. During 2010, we successfully added 754 megawatts of incremental wind capacity to our portfolio, including 70 megawatts of existing wind generation that we acquired during the fourth quarter. Of note, our 82 megawatt Ghost Pine Canada wind project was the largest wind generation facility brought into service in 2010 in Canada. And we now own and operate approximately 220 megawatts of wind generation in the country. We are pleased that in the fourth quarter, we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind purchase power agreements or PPAs. This figure includes 78 megawatts related to a PPA we signed for a repowering project in California. We will talk more about the current wind generation contracting environment in a couple of minutes.
During the course of 2010, we elected to receive CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation. During the calendar year of 2010, we received approximately $430 million in cash related to the program, and we expect to receive roughly $400 million in cash in 2011. As we initially indicated on the third quarter earnings conference call, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on 400 to 550 megawatts of new wind generation in 2011.
Turning to our solar initiatives. We have also continued to make significant progress on our solar development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we acquired appropriately 40 megawatts of solar projects currently in development in Ontario, Canada. Construction on the projects is expected to begin in early 2011, and commercial operations are expected by the end of 2011. The projects, when completed, will sell power under a long-term contract to the Ontario Power Authority. We also commissioned the 5-megawatt Paradise solar PV project in New Jersey. The Paradise project generates New Jersey's solar renewable energy credits. 
In November, the Genesis solar thermal project received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the last major approval the project needed before site work began this month. And although we do not have anything to announce at this time, we are optimistic about our ability to sign incremental PPAs in California and adjacent states for large-scale solar generation. 
We are pleased to highlight that our Duane Arnold Energy Center received a 20-year license extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC. The NRC approval comes just after two years after NextEra Energy Duane Arnold and its joint owners entered the extremely rigorous and comprehensive license extension process managed by the NRC. 
Finally, we have two financing transactions we would like to highlight. First, during the fourth quarter, we entered into two CAD $150 million three-year variable rate revolving credit facilities that expire at the end of 2013. These facilities are particularly attractive because they are in Canadian dollars, which align well with investments we are making in the country. Second, in December, we successfully financed our 507-megawatt gas-fired facility located in Blythe, California. We were able to secure a $231 million limited recourse loan as a result of proactively seeking a long-term power sales agreement for the output of the plant. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $73 million or $0.17 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $143 million or $0.34 per share. For the full year 2010, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $980 million or $2.37 per share. Adjusted earnings were $800 million or $1.93 per share. 
As we mentioned in the first quarter of 2010, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates. And historical figures on this slide have been adjusted to reflect that change.
Energy Resources' fourth quarter adjusted EPS increased $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were relatively flat due to the $0.04 lower contribution from CITCs. This was largely offset by the $0.03 contribution from assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2009 that were available for a full quarter in 2010.
We elected to take CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation placed in service in 2010 compared with 815 megawatts in 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.15 relative to the prior year. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.04 per share as compared to the year-ago period, which was largely due to an improved wind resource.
The wind resource was approximately 92% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior year's quarter of 81%. Within our existing merchant assets, the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility in 2010  fourth quarter contributed $0.16. This was partially offset by weak market conditions affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, which resulted in $0.03 lower adjusted earnings per share. 
Within our contracted assets, a positive $0.02 contribution from the lack of a refueling outage at our Point Beach nuclear facility in 2010 was substantially offset by a negative $0.02 contribution from Marcus Hook 750, which was largely due to unfavorable market conditions and a scheduled outage. 
Contributions from the Customer Supply business declined $0.02. Contributions from proprietary trading declined by $0.03 per share. As we've indicated before, results from Customer Supply and trading will often be higher or lower than we expect based on a number of factors, including market volatility and opportunities. As we noted in last year's fourth quarter earnings report, market conditions were particularly favorable in both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Restructuring and asset sales contributed a negative $0.01 compared to last year due to the absence of a gain recorded last year.
During the quarter, we wrote down the value of certain assets associated with our plants that repower two wind facilities. The write-offs negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03. Although we have included the impact of the write-offs in adjusted earnings, we wanted to highlight them separately so investors understand these are not part of ongoing operations. All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense.
For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01. New wind and solar additions contributed $0.11, which was driven primarily by the full year adjusted earnings impact from 2009 wind additions and the benefit of state income tax credits, partially offset by the impact of lower CITC elections in 2010 relative to 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.13 relative to the prior year. For the full year, the contribution from existing wind assets declined $0.02 due to unfavorable pricing of ERCOT wind and the lack of certain state tax credits in 2010, which were substantially offset by lower curtailment and an increased wind resource.
Performance from our existing merchant NEPOOL assets was higher by $0.20, driven primarily by the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility. Contributions from our merchant gas assets in Texas were lower by $0.07 due to unfavorable market conditions. Gas infrastructure contributions were up $0.06 relative to the prior year, largely due to the closing out of certain hedges in the third quarter. 
The Customer Supply business contributed $0.10 due to a strong Full Requirements business as well as GEXA retail and mid-marketing origination contributions. Within Full Requirements, the sale of a power supply contract in the first quarter, new contracts and favorable market conditions contributed to the strong results for the year. The proprietary Power and Gas Trading business contributed a negative $0.16 due to unfavorable market conditions relative to last year's very favorable market conditions. Asset sales contributed a positive $0.02, while the write-offs taken in the fourth quarter related to the California wind assets contributed a negative $0.03. All other factors contributed a negative $0.24, of which $0.13 was from higher interest expense and share dilution, and the balance is largely related to the lack of favorable tax benefits in 2010 relative to 2009.
We remain interested in developing or acquiring new wind generation projects and believe that our economy and our environment will benefit from continued investments, including generation. We're also committed to maintaining our financial discipline. Therefore, the amount of new wind we ultimately add to our portfolio will largely depend upon our ability to secure attractive long-term PPAs. 
As Lew mentioned a couple of minutes ago, during the fourth quarter we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind PPAs, bringing our total wind PPAs signed in 2010 to 1,238 megawatts. As of year-end 2010, we have 612 megawatts of wind capacity that is built and we intend to contract, but currently do not have a signed long-term agreement in hand. Contracting these megawatts continues to be a high priority for us, and I am comfortable with the progress that we are making. 
As noted in the chart on the right, of the total 1,238 megawatts of PPAs secured in 2010, 553 megawatts are for projects we expect to be commissioned in 2011. As always, some of these projects could slip into 2012 due to normal development and construction timing issues. In addition to the 553 megawatts of secured contracts, we have another 400 to 500 megawatts of projects currently in development, but without contracts, that could be commissioned in 2011. This level of certainty regarding contracts for the pipeline is particularly positive, given the challenging conditions we continue to encounter in the market.
One way that we plan to add incremental value to the business in the next couple of years is to begin to repower some of our older wind facilities. We can deploy fewer wind turbines with an increased net capacity factor and also take advantage of new elections of either the production tax credit, or PTCs, or the CITC. In fact during in the fourth quarter, we signed a PPA with an existing California facilities off-taker to repower that facility. We believe we may have the opportunity to repower approximately 300 to 400 megawatts of wind capacity over the next four years.
As we have indicated to you many times and our track record should show, we are as interested in acquiring new and existing wind and solar assets as we are in building them ourselves. In fact, we have acquired approximately 343 megawatts of renewable generation assets since 2008. This does not include 190 megawatts of wind and solar projects purchased or contracted to purchase in the fourth quarter of 2010 that are expected to come online in mid-2011.
As we have indicated over the past 12 to 18 months, we have expected a number of assets to change hands, but the executed transactions have been fewer than we would have predicted. You should expect that when large assets or portions of assets come into the market, we will take a look at most, if not all of these opportunities and pursue the ones that fit into our portfolio and our strategic plans.
As Lew, mentioned in December, the changes to the Royal Decree that we first mentioned during the second quarter earnings conference call were officially approved and incorporated into a revised Royal Decree. As a reminder, the Spain projects consist of two 49.9-megawatt solar thermal projects with molten salt storage. Under the current tariff, the projects will receive a government guaranteed premium tariff rate over their operating lives, which we estimate will be approximately 30 years. 
We are now working to finalize the financing for the projects that should provide the bulk of the funding for construction through the projects' commercial operations. While the financing has not been finalized, we are currently engaged with several European banks on a financing package that would provide the bulk of the necessary cash flows for construction and limit our exposure in the event of a change in the tariff to the amount of our equity investment. 
We began site work in January and expect the two units to reach commercial operations in 2013. The projects in Spain are a high priority for our development team, and are the only significant development or acquisition opportunity we are pursuing outside North America. We continue to believe the risk-adjusted returns are attractive and the projects represent a strategic opportunity for us to further build our skills in solar and expand our Solar Generation portfolio. We have a team permanently on the ground in Spain that is monitoring and managing all the developments that affect our projects. We monitor carefully the financial, economic and political developments in the country. And our team is engaged with the banks, local industry, government officials and other interested parties to manage and support our interests.
Our overall Energy Resources projects gross margin and EBITDA expectations for 2011 and 2012 have not changed significantly since we reviewed them with you last quarter. The full gross margin hedge slides can be found in the appendix of this presentation, which is posted to our website. 
In 2011, the average hedge price for our non-spark spread merchant assets in terms of dollars per MMBtu of natural gas is $6.97, and the average hedge price in 2012 is $6.36. These prices are clearly above current market prices and highlight the effectiveness of our hedging program. In addition to incremental detail about 2011 and 2012, we wanted to give you a little perspective on the visibility we have on Energy Resources business in 2014. Predominantly, as a result of our portfolio of long-term contracted assets, approximately 69% of our existing power assets' expected gross margin is currently hedged in 2014. 
Regarding earnings sensitivities, the adjusted EPS sensitivity to changes in natural gas prices on our 2011 open positions is relatively modest. For every $1 per MMBtu change in gas prices, the annualized impact is approximately $0.03 per share on an adjusted earnings basis at NextEra Energy, Inc. For 2012, the equivalent adjusted earnings sensitivity is $0.06 per share.
We also want to update the sensitivity regarding the wind resource for assets and service as of January 1, 2011. For every 1% change in the wind resource on an annual basis, adjusted EPS at NextEra Energy, Inc., would be impacted approximately $0.02 per share. 
To summarize 2010's fourth quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.43, Energy Resources contributed $0.34 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.03 contribution. That is a total of $0.80 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 or a 1% increase year-over-year. On an adjusted basis for the full year 2010, FPL contributed $2.29 per share, Energy Resources contributed $1.93 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.08 contribution. That is a total $4.30 compared to $4.05 per share in 2009 or a 6% increase year-over-year. 
Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend just a minute discussing our long-term adjusted earnings per share guidance. Back at our May 2010 Investor Conference, when we first discussed our longer-term expectations, I indicated that primarily because of the significance of our current construction cycle at FPL, adjusted earnings per share growth through 2014 would be driven largely by FPL investments. That continues to remain true, and we should not forget about the value that our investments are bringing to our Florida customers. Our typical residential electric bill remains the lowest in Florida, and 24% below the national average. And we estimate that by 2014, our continuing investments and more efficient generation will save our customers roughly $1 billion per year relative to a 2001 base. We continue to believe that a laser-sharp focus on doing what is best for our customers will result in positive outcomes for our shareholders as well. 
And so by 2014, our expectations are that a majority of our consolidated adjusted earnings will be from the regulated side of our business, including our investments in Lone Star Transmission. We believe that not only will our regulated adjusted earnings per share make up roughly 60% of our consolidated adjusted earnings, but that on an EBITDA basis, roughly 80% of our forecasted adjusted EBITDA will be from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted. For 2010, that percentage is approximately 74%. 
Of course, that assumes that new renewable investments in our plan through 2014 are long-term contracted. But that is a proper assumption since we are committed to invest in that side of our business only when we expect longer-term certainty in the cash flows from those investments. 
So that should give you some additional insight regarding the make-up of our expectations for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share growth per year through 2014 from a 2009 base. In 2011, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS within a range of $4.25 and $4.55 is a reasonable expectation. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew."
270586,118137307,95010,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Armando.

I want to close by providing some perspective on why we think NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. 
On the regulated side of our business, we are in the midst of a substantial capital spending program and expect to bring into service projects that cost approximate $7.2 billion between FPL and Lone Star Transmission between now and 2014. In Florida, we will be building new combined-cycle plants, pursuing more than 400 megawatts of added capacity to our nuclear units and continuing the deployment of our Smart Grid program. We plan to spend an approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion on the nuclear uprates, all of which is clause recoverable. We expect to earn an appropriate return on all of these projects, each of which have produced tangible benefits for customers in the form of improved long-term power affordability and reliability.
In Texas, our Lone Star Transmission business became a utility in October 2010. We will earn regulated returns on our roughly 320-mile transmission line, even as we help set the stage for a dramatic expansion of wind power in the state. 
Energy Resources has a strong pipeline of renewable energy projects that should fuel profitable growth. We remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts through 2014. And the 754 megawatts we added in 2010 were an excellent start. 
Equally impressive is the progress we've made on our solar strategy. Of the $3 billion to $4 billion we expect to invest in solar projects between 2010 and 2014, we already have approximately $2.3 billion of projects under contract, and initial site work is underway. We also have a robust pipeline of additional opportunities. 
And of course, whenever assets come up for sale, we will be taking a careful look to see if they make sense for us. With our track record of superior execution, we have every confidence that we will be able to bring these planned projects to a successful completion. That's why we remain very comfortable with our view that the business can generate a 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base, even as the overall level of risk in our portfolio declines. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of NextEra Energy's EBITDA will come from regulated or long-term contracted assets.
In closing, I want to thank NextEra Energy's 15,000 employees for their talent and hard work, which allowed us to deliver superior value for customers and shareholders alike in 2010, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for any questions you might have. Thank you."

And so I would first start out by saying that there is more to this bonus depreciation that should be coming out, I would hope, in the next couple of months. And the interpretations that would be particularly important for the industry and for us are interpretations regarding self-build or self-constructed assets. I'm not going to get into details on this call, but I will tell you that those interpretations are still up in the air and would make the difference between some of our assets receiving 100% bonus depreciation and some of our assets receiving 50% bonus depreciation. But the additional cash that's coming in on both sides of the business is not that significant for us overall. But that's because we had a significant amount of production tax credits that were going to offset future taxable income. And we have talked about that before. So it's really an allocation of cash flows between the companies. But on a corporate level, at least for us, based on what I'm seeing today, I wouldn't expect the cash flows to be significantly different from our forecast of 2014."

We have put a financing plan together that we believe maintains our strong credit and our strong balance sheet. And so we present that, obviously, to the rating agencies every year.

It's not that we feel uncomfortable longer term about contracting those. I mean, we clearly have identified potential customers and we've identified potential opportunities through RFPs that are coming up.

Look, we really believe that we have strong stand-alone growth plans. We've consistently been growing this business at a rate that's, and this is off the top of my head, I think the top quartile in the industry over the last decade. I've talked a lot about the growth that we have going forward. I continue to be very bullish on the Florida market long term. I've always thought that this industry -- it was a real original thought on my part, that this industry should consolidate. That's a joke. People have talked about that for years and years and years. And yet when I look at sort of the growth that we've achieved, in many ways we've effectively added the equivalent of several medium-sized utilities over the years. So we've tried to do this before. We realize that there's a lot of challenges and distractions associated on the M&A side. Having said that, we are always going to be opportunistic about it. We have a fiduciary responsibility to look at the things that come our way. And our criteria for M&A hasn't changed. And we always look at M&A from a standpoint: is it economically attractive? Is it feasible from a regulatory perspective? And is it socially doable? Those have proven to be a tough set of barriers over the years for getting transactions done. So I'm not sure that's a very clear answer for you, Steve, but maybe intentionally so. I guess the bottom line is that we're always open to it, but our focus is on growing our business and building shareholder value that way."

NextEra Energy delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2011. Although our adjusted earnings per share results were flat to last year's comparable quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. At a time of weak natural gas and power prices, this is particularly noteworthy. 
During the quarter, we continued to make considerable investments in Florida's electrical infrastructure, which are helping to keep prices low and reliability high. One of the highlights of the quarter was that at Energy Resources, we signed long-term power purchase agreements for an additional 400 megawatts of wind power since the beginning of the year. In addition, our existing wind fleet generated nearly 1 million-megawatt hours of additional power compared to last year's comparable quarter.
As you know, since our last earnings call, the people of Japan experienced one of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in modern history including extensive damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Our sympathies go out to the Japanese people as they rebuild their country and their lives. Here in the United States, we continue to watch the events in Japan very closely. There's still much we do not know about the events at the Fukushima plant and it will undoubtedly take much more time for full analysis to be completed. 
With regard to NextEra Energy's nuclear fleet, I can tell you that all of our plants are located outside areas deemed ""high hazard"" for seismic activity. In addition, 7 of the 8 units we operate are pressurized water reactors with redundant cooling systems and multi-layer containment systems. In fact, our Florida PWRs are battle tested having maintained plant and public safety through several direct and nearly-direct hit by major hurricanes including Andrew, Francis, Jean and Wilma. The one boiling water reactor, in our fleet, the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa is not in seismic zone, has a higher flood margin that the Japanese plant and stores backup diesel generator fuel underground in a steel-reinforced concrete structure. Simply put, the drivers for a Japanese nuclear are highly unlikely at any of the NextEra Energy nuclear units.  Going forward, I remain optimistic that nuclear power will play a significant role in our energy mix.
For our part, we are on schedule with our existing plan to boost the output of our nuclear fleet through a series of uprates to the nonnuclear components of the plants. 
Now with regard to new nuclear, our position is unchanged. We still plan to move forward in a stepwise fashion to create the option to build two additional units at the site of our Turkey Point plant. Creating the option at this stage is limited to obtaining the necessary federal state and local approvals. 
At Florida Power & Light, we had a strong first quarter. Net income was up roughly 7% over the prior year comparable quarter primarily due to increased investment in the business. Those investments have allowed FPL to provide its customers with 99.98% service reliability and to significantly improve the efficiency of our power generation fleet, saving customers hundreds of million of dollars in fuel costs. During the first quarter, FPL had roughly 30,000 more customers than we had a year earlier. In fact, we've now added customers for 5 quarters in a row. We think this is a positive commentary on the slow but steady improvement in the Florida economy.
The biggest area of concern remains the unemployment rate, which is at a stubbornly high 11.1%. Housing prices in Florida may show further declines, but the market has clearly repriced itself, making the state a much more attractive destination. 
On the development front, we are nearing completion of the West County Energy Center Unit 3. The addition of 1,220 megawatts of highly efficient combined-cycle gas generation to our system is a triple win. it comes online, the new unit will save customers money on fuel, reduced air emissions and start to provide shareholders with a cash return on their investment. 
Construction is also under way on the modernization of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants. When complete in 2013 and 2014 respectively these modernizations will add 2,420 megawatts of even more fuel-efficient, combined-cycle generation to our fleet.
We were also pleased to dedicate our Martin next generation solar energy center in the first quarter. 75-megawatt Martin facility is the first in the world to combine a solar thermal array with an existing combined-cycle natural gas plant, which is a more efficient way of deploying solar thermal technology than on stand-alone basis. FPL has now completed all 110 megawatts of solar power allowed under the 2008 legislation enacted in the state. The net cost to the average customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity is expected to be less than $0.25 a month on average over the lives of these assets.
Solar power holds great potential for Florida. It can boost fuel diversity, create good-paying construction jobs, reduce air emissions and attract research and development dollars to the state. We continue to look forward to working with the state's regulatory and political leaders to expand the state power generating capacity in the future.
On the Energy Resources side of our business, we had a mixed quarter. Our existing assets performed extremely well. I was particularly pleased that we generated nearly 1 million additional megawatt hours or a 21% increase from our wind fleet than we did in the prior year's comparable quarter, mostly on the strength of the wind resource. However, low power prices continue to impact our merchant assets and our full requirements business experienced more customer migration than we expected.
You've heard me say for some time that we believe solar has the potential to be the next wind industry for NextEra Energy, and we are pleased with the progress we made on our solar strategy in the first quarter. Of particular note was our success in procuring lines of credit for our two 49.9-megawatt solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain. Lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with the risks associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariffs to an amount significantly less than the capital costs of the project. We believe the economics of Spain Solar remain attractive and we expect the project to help drive the company's earnings starting in 2013.
Here at home, we are very encouraged that California enacted into law a robust renewable portfolio standard. The law requires load-serving entities to obtain 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020. With this move, California has made itself one of the most attractive renewable energy markets in the nation, and we look forward  to doing additional business in the state. 
On the wind development front, we have signed long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, on 400 megawatts of projects so far in 2011. That brings the total number of wind PPAs to 1,638 megawatts since the beginning of last year. Of particular note, 953 megawatts of these PPAs are for projects we expect to commission in 2011 and 2012, demonstrating our commitment to lining up customers for wind energy early in the process. 
We are also seeing a noticeable spike in the number of requests for proposals being issued for wind energy. the economics of wind improving as a result of better turbine technology and lower turbine prices, wind PPA contracts are very attractively priced. As a result, more buyers are stepping up to take advantage of these prices. 
While earnings at Energy Resources are, by their very nature, more volatile than they are at FPL, I want to emphasize once again how well hedged we are on the competitive side of our business. For 2011, 96% of our gross margin at Energy Resources is protected from swings in commodity prices; and for 2012, the figure is already 91%. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracts, up from 74% in 2010. This reflects our continued focus on investing at regulated assets at FPL and long-term contracted assets at Energy Resources.  As we continue to grow the business, we believe this strategy will allow us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns to our investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"

In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share.

In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $392 million and $0.94, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our nonqualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the first quarter 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $205 million or $0.49 per share. For the term of 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings were largely be a function of its rate base and return an equity. As we indicated in the fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, we believe that FPL realized a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012, subject to the normal caveats as we provide including normal weather and operating conditions.  For the terms of the settlement agreement, FPL won't be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations including the fluctuations due to weather. 
During the first quarter FPL's, contribution to earnings per share increased $0.02 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, for West County Energy Center #3, returns on clause related investments, including Martin Solar and a nuclear uprate and rate-based growth, which was partially offset by share dilution. During the quarter, we recognized $99 million in surplus depreciation on a pretax basis. We currently do not expect to amortize a full amount of surplus depreciation in 2011 that is available to us under the base rate agreement.
We are continuing to see improvements in some of our key customer metrics. The table on the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales fell by 6.2%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth. 
In the first quarter, heating degree days were modestly below normal and well below the record heating degree days experienced in the prior year comparable quarter. Nonweather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.2%. 
As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the first quarter of 2011, we had roughly 30,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. In March, the percentage of low-usage customers experienced its first monthly decline since September 2010. The number of inactive residential meters has declined for 6 months in a row. 
Perhaps contributing to these improvements is the fact that homes in FPL markets are continuing to become more affordable. As depicted in the graph in the bottom right of the current housing affordability index, which measures the percentage of medium-income families who can affordable a home, is now 66% for Miami. That is up from 11% of the peak of the boom in late 2006 and close to the national average of 73%. As you can also see in the graph, affordability in several of our other cities is now above their national average. Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages, and we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move.
Let me now to turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since the beginning of the year, we secured approximately 400 megawatts in wind PPAs, all of which are for products we plan to put into service into 2011 or 2012. We will talk more about the current wind generation development in the contracting environment in a couple of minutes. 
During the quarter, we completed a review of the estimated useful life of the wind turbines we had in our portfolio as of January 1, 2011. As you know, we have an ongoing obligation to revisit the assumptions used to account for our assets including the assumptions that drive the estimated useful life. Over time, the technology employed in wind turbines has improved. With proper maintenance, we believe our fleet will last longer than previously estimated. As a result of this review, we have extended the estimate of useful life for our newer wind turbine fleet to 30 years, which is roughly in the middle of our updated view of the probable range of useful life. For the assets already in service, the after-tax impact of the change in assertion for the first quarter was roughly $0.025 per share. For full year 2011, the impact is expected to be roughly $0.105 per share. We will have more to say on the impact of forward adjusted EPS expectations in a moment.
During April, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 483 megawatts of wind capacity and encompassing 5 projects. This transaction, which is similar to the one we completed in the third quarter 2010, represents a unique structure for Energy Resources in which the differential membership investor makes an initial up-front payment and will make additional payments over time tied to the energy production of the wind projects. The structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt. We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of our deferred production tax credits, or PTCs, on our balance sheet, and the availability of this structure will allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we would have otherwise been able to monetize them. 
As Lew noted, we closed on lines of credit this week for our solar thermal arrays we are building in Spain, which has made available to us roughly EUR 590 million or approximately $875 million. The lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to enema significantly less than the capital costs of the project. Just as with all of our other products, we retain construction and perform risk, which we believe we are well prepared to address. These lines of credit are important steps in the development of these projects, and we are very pleased to be moving forward. As we indicated to you at our May 2010 investor conference, we believe these projects will provide attractive returns and valuable experience in expanding market for solar generation. We continue to expect to bring online both of the 49.9 megawatts units in 2013.
Energy Resources reported first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $65 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter, which exclude the effect of nonqualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $189 million or $0.46 per share. Energy Resources first quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were flat relative to last year. Results increased $0.02 due to the contributions from assets placed into service in the first quarter of 2010 that were available for a full quarter in 2011, as well as our ability to recognize state investment tax credits from some of our wind projects. These positive items were offset by lower expected contributions from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, for 2011.
Regarding our 2011 CITC elections, we concluded during the first quarter that it was probable that we would elect to take CITCs on roughly 275 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2011. Ultimately, we believe our elections will likely range between 275 and 375 megawatts, depending on a variety of factors including when the assets are placed into service. This is down from our previous expectations, largely as a result of converting certain potential CITC projects to PTC projects as a result, of refining and evaluating their overall economics. 
For reference, we elected CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind projects in 2010 and had assumed 600 megawatts of annual elections in last year's first quarter. The difference in the estimated CITC annual elections reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 relative to the comparable quarter. Assuming the lower end of our 2011 CITC range, the full year impact would be approximately $0.08 relative to the prior year.
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.10 relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.17 per share as compared to the year-ago period, of which $0.10 was due to an improved wind resource and lower curtailment. The wind resource was approximately 93% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter at 80%. The remaining $0.07 was a result of our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects and a lower depreciation expense due to the change in the depreciable life of some of our wind assets, slightly offset by unfavorable pricing. Seabrook and Main Hydro contributed $0.06 less than in the prior year's comparable quarter, primarily due to lower price hedges. 
Weak market conditions and higher O&M, due to planned outages affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, resulted in $0.02 lower adjusted earnings per share. The customer supply and power and gas trading businesses are down $0.07, due primarily to our wholesale full requirements business as well as the absence of a sale of a favorable supply contract completed in the first quarter of 2010.  During this year's first quarter, we realized a negative impact from customer migration in our wholesale full requirements business, costing us roughly $0.03 on an adjusted basis. 
Also in last year's first quarter, the sale of a power supply contract in this business increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03. Asset sales contributed a negative $0.03 entirely due to the absence of the benefit associated with last year's sale of our interest in a 27-megawatt waste-to-energy facility located in Pennsylvania. All other factors contributed negative $0.01 per share, associated with higher interest expense due to higher borrowings and higher corporate G&A, both from growth in the business.
As we mentioned earlier, since the beginning of the year, we signed new power purchase agreements for 400 megawatts of new wind projects. This brings us to a total of 953 megawatts of projects, for which we have contracts and expect to commission in 2011 and 2012  1,638 megawatts of PPAs we have signed since the beginning of 2010. 
Given the high level of visibility we have to the 2011 and 2012 pipelines, we believe that we will add -- we will be able to add between 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts of wind before the end of 2012.  We have however, a little less visibility that in prior years as to the amount we may add in the current year, primarily as a result of some timing issues associated with permitting. So although we feel fairly confident on the build over the next couple of years, we believe meeting the bottom end of our previous 700 to 1,000 megawatts range in 2011 will be a challenge.
Turning briefly to asset acquisitions. As we have indicated to you many times, we are as interested in acquiring contracted wind generation projects as we are in building them ourselves as long as returns are attractive. We are not, however, interested in purchasing or developing any additional assets outside of North America for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to acquiring assets, you should also expect that we will continuously look at our entire portfolio of existing assets to make sure that we are optimizing the value of those assets. In some circumstances, it may mean that we would sell certain of our existing assets. Currently, we are exploring the potential sale of 5 of our natural gas fired assets at Energy Resources, including Blythe, a 507-megawatt plant in California,, a 550-megawatt plant in Rhode Island; Boswell, a 879-megawatt plant in Virginia; Turkey, a 98-megawatt plant in South Carolina; and Calhoun, a 668-megawatt plant in Alabama. While there are attractive assets for each of these assets, they have a limited strategic fit within our portfolio. As such, we are investigating whether or not these assets may possess a higher strategic value to another owner. At this time, we can give no assurance that an actual sale will take place.
To summarize 2011's first quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.49, Energy Resources contributed $0.46 and Corporate and Other was a negative $0.01 contribution. That is a total of $0.94 per share for the quarter. Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes discussing our adjusted EPS expectations. As we indicated earlier, the change in the assumption regarding the estimated useful life for a portion of our wind fleet has a positive impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter and is expected to have roughly a $0.105 positive impact on full year 2011 adjusted EPS. Solely as a result of this change, we are increasing our adjusted EPS expectations to a range of $4.35 to $4.65 from the previous range of $4.25 to $4.55. When we initially provided long-term adjusted EPS expectations at the May 2010 Investor Conference, the 5% to 7% average annual growth rate through 2014 was relative to a 2009 base. However, the change in the estimated useful life assumption renders future years' comparison to 2009 less relevant. As a result, we are updating our long-term expectation, and we believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats that we provide.
As we have indicated before, we believe public policy support for wind generation development will ultimately be extended beyond 2012. Historically wind has enjoyed public policy and support under both Republican and Democratic leadership. And our current views is that we will continue to be successful in developing and owing wind plants for many years to come. However, we would like to put into context the impact of the potential slowdown in our expected wind build after the current federal policy on wind energy expires. If we were to assume no additions of wind assets to our operations after 2012, our adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate would continue to be within the range of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2011 base. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

I'd like to conclude this morning with a few observations about the policy framework in which the electric power industry operates. Since the election of last fall, many pundits have predicted a sea change in the nation's approach to energy policy. That strikes me as premature. Yes, it's true the is off the table for the foreseeable future. But in other ways, efforts to make the nation's energy supply cleaner, more efficient and more diverse are proceeding apace. In March, the Environment Protection Agency released its proposed rules to tighten limits on how much mercury and other toxic air pollutants power plants are permitted to release. And in the months and years ahead, the agency will be moving forward with regulations on coal ash, particulate matter, SOx end Nox. I don't believe that replacing 50-year-old fossil plants with new, more efficient units will be the train wreck that we have been hearing so much about, nor do I believe that putting pollution controls on many of the remaining plants is all that terrible. As an aside, it is interesting to note that 2/3 of our nation's coal fleet is without meaningful pollution controls. While there is no free lunch, the cost of this upgrade to the nation's generation fleet is likely to be far less than the costliest latest projections. 
Consider our own utility. In 2010, FPL recorded a SO2 emissions rate 76% below the industry average, a NOx emissions rate 65% below the industry average and a CO2 emissions rate 36% below the industry average. Yet despite having one of the cleanest generation fleet of any utility in the nation, FPL's typical residential customer bills were 24% below the national average at the year-end 2010. We are proof that a utility can be clean and cost-effective at the same time.
In addition to EPA action, I still believe bipartisan action is possible in energy legislation that would encourage cleaner generation and greater fuel diversity. With the cost of renewables, such as wind and solar, coming down so dramatically over the last couple of years, one of the principal objections to a national clean energy standard is now far less compelling. 
On final note, I want to extend special thanks to the 15,000 employees of NextEra Energy. Last month, NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in its sector in Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies list for the fifth consecutive year. No other company in our sector has ever done that. Just as impressive, we are ranked as the 10th most admired company in the world for social responsibility. Less than 2 weeks later, we were named one of the world's most ethical company by Magazine. We are one of only 24 companies worldwide to appear on the list all 5 years of its existence. These accomplishments are possible only through the commitment of our employees, and I want to thank them all. With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions."

Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today. I think in the last couple of quarters, we've indicated that for 2011, we were looking at CITCs in the range of 400 to 550 megawatts.",504,"Okay, let me give you some input on both of those. Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today. I think in the last couple of quarters, we've indicated that for 2011, we were looking at CITCs in the range of 400 to 550 megawatts. And today I said in the first quarter, we were using 275 megawatts. What's happened really over the last, I'd say, 3 to 6 months, is and we always continually do this. We always continually look at our projects to determine whether ultimately they should be CITC or PTC projects. We've continued to see, I mean, this isn't something that certainly caught us by surprise in the last month or so, but we have continued to see improvements in technology. And we've been able to use that technology in some of our previously identified sites, not in all previously identified sites. And it has kind of flipped the switch on the economics from CITC to regular production tax credit projects. Now part of that obviously is we continue to be comfortable with our tax position. But our deferred tax assets had been rising and we know they've been rising according to our forecast. That doesn't surprise me or concern me. But the other part of this is that the tax equity market has really come back pretty aggressively, I'd say, in the last 9 months or so. And so when we are thinking about the economics of the wind project, particularly switching from CITC to PTC, it's both economic view of the project, with wind turbine technology obviously being a big part of that. But it's also the financing of the project. And with the tax equity market coming back pretty aggressively, we've been able to turn several of our CITC projects to PTC projects. So there's nothing else in there. There's nothing nefarious in there, other than I think it makes good sense for us to switch some of those projects over. Your second question regarding the sale or the proposed, the exploring if you will, I want to be clear on that, us exploring whether there's a market for those 5 gas assets. First and foremost, that really has to do with how they strategically fit into our portfolio. Those assets are great assets. We love all of our assets, as Jim Robo would always like to say. But in this time, when we are seeing what's happening with other sales out there, it makes a lot of sense for us to explore these. We would absolutely, in our view, have a large taxable gain associated with the sale of these assets. A large taxable gain would be something that we would be able to use our deferred production tax credits to offset, I would say, significantly. A good rule of thumb is you can offset 75% of your taxable gain with production tax credits, and we certainly have -- would have enough production tax credits to be able to reduce that gain."

You should assume -- well, I will tell you, it would be a good assumption for you to assume that our previous estimates had the lower end of the 400 to 550 megawatts of CITC. So the difference between 400 and a 275 to 375 range is really not that significant.

One of the things that was important for us to get done in our Spanish project was -- we're always very comfortable that when we enter into a construction project that we cannot ultimately get it done on time and on budget, but when we get it done, it actually works the way it was designed to work initially. Those are the types of risks that we take on in any project, and we have those risks in Spain and we feel very comfortable with those. One of the risks that we have not taken in the past is what I'll call, this is probably too long of a title, but feed-in tariff country credit risk. And this isn't to imply that I'm at all concerned with Spanish sovereign credit, but it is something new for us. And what we wanted to do in this transaction was limit the exposure that we would have, that our equity would have, to a potential change in that feed-in tariff during the construction cycle of the project. Now before I go on, let me first say we certainly don't expect any changes in the tariff. We believe it's a great tariff. believe that the government and industry over there has done a great job of putting something together that should be good for Spain itself and for the utilities and for the Spanish people for a very long period of time. But we're a little risk-averse on that, and so the structure we put together allows us to limit our exposure to our equity investment, which will be roughly $250 million or so, plus some amount. And then the plus some amount gets complicated, and I'm not going to go into it on the call. But the $250 million or so plus additional amount is far lower than our expected construction costs, overall construction costs in Spain, which should be over USD $1 billion."

It's really a repeat of what I said in May 2010. Our wind projects are great projects. They're very accretive to us.

This is just, I'm just reemphasizing something I said in May 2010.

We've clearly seen them. We showed slides in the past. And so I think some of the utility companies are feeling a little bit more comfortable about long-term power purchase agreement. That's one. Secondly is we've seen a confluence of events here in, I'd say, the last 6 to 9 months and that confluence of events we talked about a little bit before, which is really the reduction in capital costs and the improvement in technology. I mean, we're going from 80-meter tower, 80-meter blades to 100-meter tower, 100-meter blades. You're improving the wind capture, the production, if you will, by 20 to 30%. At the same time, you are seeing -- we are seeing turbine costs from 2008 compared today roughly down 20%. If you put both of those things together along with the improvement that folks are seeing in load and the economy, I think that's what we're seeing. There are more people coming to ask, What about wind? What about wind? It continues to be the most economical renewable in our view, so I think it's that combination."

NextEra Energy delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2011. Although our adjusted earnings per share results were flat to last year's comparable quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. At a time of weak natural gas and power prices, this is particularly noteworthy. 
During the quarter, we continued to make considerable investments in Florida's electrical infrastructure, which are helping to keep prices low and reliability high. One of the highlights of the quarter was that at Energy Resources, we signed long-term power purchase agreements for an additional 400 megawatts of wind power since the beginning of the year. In addition, our existing wind fleet generated nearly 1 million megawatt hours of additional power compared to last year's comparable quarter.
As you know, since our last earnings call, the people of Japan experienced one of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in modern history, including extensive damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Our sympathies go out to the Japanese people as they rebuild their country and their lives. Here in the United States, we continue to watch the events in Japan very closely. There is still much we do not know about the events at the Fukushima plant, and it will undoubtedly take much more time for full analysis to be completed. 
With regard to NextEra Energy's nuclear fleet, I can tell you that all of our plants are located outside areas deemed ""high hazard"" for seismic activity. In addition, 7 of the 8 units we operate are pressurized water reactors with redundant cooling systems and multi-layered containment systems. In fact, our Florida PWRs are battle tested having maintained plant and public safety through several direct and nearly direct hit by major hurricanes including Andrew, Francis, Jean and Wilma. The one boiling water reactor in our fleet, the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, is not in an active seismic zone, has a higher flood margin than the Japanese plant and stores backup diesel generator fuel underground in a steel-reinforced concrete structure. Simply put, the drivers for a Japanese-style nuclear event are highly unlikely at any of the NextEra Energy nuclear units. 
Going forward, I remain optimistic that nuclear power will play a significant role in our nation's energy mix. For our part, we are on schedule with our existing plan to boost the output of our nuclear fleet through a series of uprates to the nonnuclear components of the plants. Now with regard to new nuclear, our position is unchanged. We still plan to move forward in a stepwise fashion to create the option to build 2 additional units at the site of our Turkey Point plant. Creating the option at this stage is limited to obtaining the necessary federal, state and local approvals. 
At Florida Power & Light, we had a strong first quarter. Net income was up roughly 7% over the prior-year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Those investments have allowed FPL to provide its customers with 99.98% service reliability and to significantly improve the efficiency of our power generation fleet, saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs. During the first quarter, FPL had roughly 30,000 more customers than we had a year earlier. In fact, we've now added customers for 5 quarters in a row. We think this is a positive commentary on the slow but steady improvement in the Florida economy.
The biggest area of concern remains the unemployment rate, which is at a stubbornly high 11.1%. Housing prices in Florida may show further declines, but the market has clearly repriced itself, making the state a much more attractive destination. 
On the development front, we are nearing completion of the West County Energy Center Unit 3. The addition of 1,220 megawatts of highly efficient combined-cycle gas generation to our system is a triple win. When it comes online, the new unit will save customers money on fuel, reduce air emissions and start to provide shareholders with a cash return on their investment. 
Construction is also under way on the modernization of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants. When complete in 2013 and 2014, respectively, these modernizations will add 2,420 megawatts of even more fuel-efficient combined-cycle generation to our fleet.
We were also pleased to dedicate our Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center in the first quarter. 75-megawatt Martin facility is the first in the world to combine a solar thermal array with an existing combined-cycle natural gas plant, which is a more efficient way of deploying solar thermal technology than on a stand-alone basis. FPL has now completed all 110 megawatts of solar power allowed under the 2008 legislation enacted in the state. The net cost to the average customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity is expected to be less than $0.25 a month on average over the lives of these assets.
Solar power holds great potential for Florida. It can boost fuel diversity, create good-paying construction jobs, reduce air emissions and attract research and development dollars to the state. We continue to look forward to working with the state's regulatory and political leaders to expand the state's power generating capacity in the future.
On the Energy Resources side of our business, we had a mixed quarter. Our existing assets performed extremely well. I was particularly pleased that we generated nearly 1 million additional megawatt hours or a 21% increase from our wind fleet than we did in the prior-year's comparable quarter, mostly on the strength of the wind resource. However, low power prices continue to impact our merchant assets and our full requirements business experienced more customer migration than we expected.
You've heard me say for some time that we believe solar has the potential to be the next wind industry for NextEra Energy, and we are pleased with the progress we made on our solar strategy in the first quarter. Of particular note was our success in securing lines of credit for our two 49.9-megawatt solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain. Lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with the risks associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to an amount significantly less than the capital cost of the project. We believe the economics of Spain solar remain attractive, and we expect the project to help drive the company's earnings starting in 2013.
Here at home, we are very encouraged that California enacted into law a robust renewable portfolio standard. The law requires load-serving entities to obtain 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020. With this move, California has made itself one of the most attractive renewable energy markets in the nation, and we look forward to doing additional business in the state. 
On the wind development front, we have signed long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, on 400 megawatts of projects so far in 2011. That brings the total number of wind PPAs to 1,638 megawatts since the beginning of last year. Of particular note, 953 megawatts of these PPAs are for projects we expect to commission in 2011 and 2012, demonstrating our commitment to lining up customers for wind energy early in the process. 
We are also seeing a noticeable spike in the number of request for proposals being issued for wind energy. With the economics of wind improving as a result of better turbine technology and lower turbine prices, wind PPA contracts are very attractively priced. As a result, more buyers are stepping up to take advantage of these prices. 
While earnings at Energy Resources are, by their very nature, more volatile than they are at FPL, I want to emphasize once again how well hedged we are on the competitive side of our business. For 2011, 96% of our gross margin at Energy Resources is protected from swings in commodity prices, and for 2012, the figure is already 91%. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted, up from 74% in 2010. This reflects our continued focus on investing in regulated assets at FPL and long-term contracted assets at Energy Resources.  As we continue to grow the business, we believe this strategy will allow us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns to our investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"

In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share.

In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $392 million and $0.94, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our nonqualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the first quarter 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $205 million or $0.49 per share. For the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. As we indicated in the fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, we believe that FPL realized a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the settlement agreement, FPL won't be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations including the fluctuations due to weather. 
During the first quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.02 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, for West County Energy Center #3, returns on clause-related investments, including Martin Solar and a nuclear uprate and rate-based growth, which was partially offset by share dilution. During the quarter, we recognized $99 million in surplus depreciation on a pretax basis. We currently do not expect to amortize the full amount of surplus depreciation in 2011 that is available to us under the base rate agreement.
We are continuing to see improvements in some of our key customer metrics. The table on the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales fell by 6.2%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth. 
In the first quarter, heating degree days were modestly below normal and well below the record heating degree days experienced in the prior-year comparable quarter. Nonweather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.2%. 
As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the first quarter of 2011, we had roughly 30,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. In March, the percentage of low-usage customers experienced its first monthly decline since September 2010. The number of inactive residential meters has declined for 6 months in a row. 
Perhaps contributing to these improvements is the fact that homes in FPL markets are continuing to become more affordable. As depicted in the graph on the bottom right, the current housing affordability index, which measures the percentage of medium-income families who can affordable a home, is now 66% for Miami. That is up from 11% of the peak of the boom in late 2006 and close to the national average of 73%. As you can also see in the graph, affordability in several of our other cities is now above the national average. Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages, and we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since the beginning of the year, we secured approximately 400 megawatts in wind PPAs, all of which are for projects we plan to put into service into 2011 or 2012. We will talk more about the current wind generation development and contracting environment in a couple of minutes. 
During the quarter, we completed a review of the estimated useful life of the wind turbines we had in our portfolio as of January 1, 2011. As you know, we have an ongoing obligation to revisit the assumptions used to account for our assets, including the assumptions that drive the estimated useful life. Over time, the technology employed in wind turbines has improved. With proper maintenance, we believe our fleet will last longer than previously estimated. As a result of this review, we have extended the estimated useful life for our newer wind turbine fleet to 30 years, which is roughly in the middle of our updated view of the probable range of useful life. For the assets already in service, the after-tax impact of the change in assumption for the first quarter was roughly $0.025 per share. For full year 2011, the impact is expected to be roughly $0.105 per share. We will have more to say on the impact of our -- to our forward adjusted EPS expectations in a moment.
During April, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 483 megawatts of wind capacity encompassing 5 projects. This transaction, which is similar to the one we completed in the third quarter of 2010, represents a unique structure for Energy Resources in which the differential membership investor makes an initial up-front payment and will make additional payments over time tied to the energy production of the wind projects. The structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt. We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of our deferred production tax credits, or PTCs, on our balance sheet, and the availability of this structure will allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we would have otherwise been able to monetize them. 
As Lew noted, we closed on lines of credit this week for our solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain, which has made available to us roughly EUR 590 million or approximately $875 million. The lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to an amount significantly less than the capital cost of the projects. Just as with all of our other projects, we retained construction and performance risk, which we believe we are well prepared to address. 
These lines of credit are important steps in the development of these projects, and we are very pleased to be moving forward. As we indicated to you at our May 2010 investor conference, we believe these projects will provide attractive returns and valuable experience in the expanding market for solar generation. We continue to expect to bring online both of the 49.9-megawatt units in 2013.
Energy Resources reported first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $65 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter, which exclude the effect of nonqualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $189 million or $0.46 per share. Energy Resources' first quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were flat relative to last year. Results increased $0.02 due to the contributions from assets placed into service in the first quarter of 2010 that were available for a full quarter in 2011, as well as our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects. These positive items were offset by lower expected contributions from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, for 2011.
Regarding our 2011 CITC elections, we concluded during the first quarter that it was probable that we would elect to take CITCs on roughly 275 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2011. Ultimately, we believe our elections will likely range between 275 and 375 megawatts, depending on a variety of factors, including when the assets are placed into service. This is down from our previous expectations, largely as a result of converting certain potential CITC projects to PTC projects as a result of refining and evaluating their overall economics. 
For reference, we elected CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind projects in 2010 and had assumed 600 megawatts of annual elections in last year's first quarter. The difference in the estimated CITC annual elections reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 relative to the comparable quarter. Assuming the lower end of our 2011 CITC range, the full year impact would be approximately $0.08 relative to the prior year.
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.10 relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.17 per share as compared to the year-ago period, of which $0.10 was due to an improved wind resource and lower curtailments. The wind resource was approximately 93% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior-year comparable quarter 80%. The remaining $0.07 was a result of our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects and a lower depreciation expense due to the change in the depreciable life of some of our wind assets, slightly offset by unfavorable pricing. Seabrook and Maine Hydro contributed $0.06 less than in the prior-year's comparable quarter, primarily due to lower price hedges. 
Weak market conditions and higher O&M due to planned outages affecting our merchant Texas gas assets resulted in $0.02 lower adjusted earnings per share. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses are down $0.07, due primarily to our wholesale full requirements business, as well as the absence of the sale of a favorable supply contract completed in the first quarter of 2010. During this year's first quarter, we realized a negative impact from customer migration in our wholesale full requirements business, costing us roughly $0.03 on an adjusted basis. 
Also, in last year's first quarter, the sale of a power supply contract in this business increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03. Asset sales contributed a negative $0.03 entirely due to the absence of the benefit associated with last year's sale of our interest in a 27-megawatt waste-to-energy facility located in Pennsylvania. All other factors contributed negative $0.01 per share associated with higher interest expense due to higher borrowings and higher corporate G&A, both from growth of the business.
As we mentioned earlier, since the beginning of the year, we signed new power purchase agreements for 400 megawatts of new wind projects. This brings us to a total of 953 megawatts of projects, for which we have contracts and expect to commission in 2011 and 2012 and 1,638 megawatts of PPAs we have signed since the beginning of 2010. 
Given the high level of visibility we have to the 2011 and 2012 pipelines, we believe that we will add -- we will be able to add between 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts of wind before the end of 2012.  We have, however, a little less visibility than in prior years as to the amount we may add in the current year, primarily as a result of some timing issues associated with permitting. So although we feel fairly confident on the build over the next couple of years, we believe meeting the bottom end of our previous 700- to 1,000-megawatt range in 2011 will be a challenge.
Turning briefly to asset acquisitions. As we have indicated to you many times, we are as interested in acquiring contracted clean generation projects as we are in building them ourselves as long as the returns are attractive. We are not, however, interested in purchasing or developing any additional assets outside of North America for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to acquiring assets, you should also expect that we will continuously look at our entire portfolio of existing assets to make sure that we are optimizing the value of those assets. In some circumstances, it may mean that we would sell certain of our existing assets. Currently, we are exploring the potential sale of 5 of our natural gas-fired assets at Energy Resources, including Blythe, a 507-megawatt plant in California; RIEC [Rhode Island Energy Center], a 550-megawatt plant in Rhode Island; Doswell, a 879-megawatt plant in Virginia; Cherokee, a 98-megawatt plant in South Carolina; and Calhoun, a 668-megawatt plant in Alabama. While there are attractive aspects for each of these assets, they have a limited strategic fit within our portfolio. As such, we are investigating whether or not these assets may possess a higher strategic value to another owner. At this time, we can give no assurance that an actual sale will take place.
To summarize 2011's first quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.49, Energy Resources contributed $0.46, and Corporate and Other was a negative $0.01 contribution. That is a total of $0.94 per share for the quarter. Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes discussing our adjusted EPS expectations. As we indicated earlier, the change in the assumption regarding the estimated useful life for a portion of our wind fleet has a positive impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter, and it is expected to have roughly a $0.105 positive impact on full year 2011 adjusted EPS. Solely as a result of this change, we are increasing our adjusted EPS expectations to a range of $4.35 to $4.65 from the previous range of $4.25 to $4.55. When we initially provided long-term adjusted EPS expectations at the May 2010 investor conference, the 5% to 7% average annual growth rate through 2014 was relative to a 2009 base. However, the change in the estimated useful life assumption renders future years' comparison to 2009 less relevant. As a result, we are updating our long-term expectation, and we believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats that we provide.
As we have indicated before, we believe public policy support for wind generation development will ultimately be extended beyond 2012. Historically, wind has enjoyed public policy support under both Republican and Democratic leadership, and our current views is that we will continue to be successful in developing and owning wind plants for many years to come. However, we would like to put into context the impact of a potential slowdown in our expected wind build after the current federal policy on wind energy expires. If we were to assume no additions of wind assets to our operations after 2012, our adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate would continue to be within the range of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2011 base. 
With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

I'd like to conclude this morning with a few observations about the policy framework in which the electric power industry operates. Since the election of last fall, many pundits have predicted a sea change in the nation's approach to energy policy. That strikes me as premature. Yes, it's true that cap and trade is off the table for the foreseeable future, but in other ways, efforts to make the nation's energy supply cleaner, more efficient and more diverse are proceeding apace. In March, the Environment Protection Agency released its proposed rule to tighten limits on how much mercury and other toxic air pollutants power plants are permitted to release. And in the months and years ahead, the agency will be moving forward with regulations on coal ash, particulate matter, SOx and NOx. 
I don't believe that replacing 50-year-old fossil plants with new, more efficient units will be the train wreck we have been hearing so much about, nor do I believe that putting pollution controls on many of the remaining plants is all that terrible. As an aside, it is interesting to note that 2/3 of our nation's coal fleet is without meaningful pollution controls. While there is no free lunch, the cost of this upgrade to the nation's generation fleet is likely to be far less than the costliest predictions. 
Consider our own utility. In 2010, FPL recorded a SO2 emissions rate 76% below the industry average, a NOx emissions rate 65% below the industry average and a CO2 emissions rate 36% below the industry average. Yet despite having one of the cleanest generation fleet of any utility in the nation, FPL's typical residential customer bills were 24% below the national average at the year-end 2010. We are a proof that utility can be clean and cost-effective at the same time.
In addition to EPA action, I still believe bipartisan action is possible on energy legislation that would encourage cleaner generation and greater fuel diversity. With the cost of renewables, such as wind and solar, photovoltaic coming down so dramatically over the last couple of years, one of the principal objections to a national clean energy standard is now far less compelling. 
On a final note, I want to extend a special thanks to the 15,000 employees of NextEra Energy. Last month, NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in its sector on Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies list for the fifth consecutive year. No other company in our sector has ever done that. Just as impressive, we are ranked as the 10th most admired company in the world for social responsibility. Less than 2 weeks later, we were named one of the world's most ethical company by Ethisphere Magazine. We are one of only 24 companies worldwide to appear on the list all 5 years of its existence. These accomplishments are possible only through the commitment of our employees, and I want to thank them all. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions."

Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today. I think in the last couple of quarters, we've indicated that for 2011, we were looking at CITCs in the range of 400 to 550 megawatts.",507,"Okay. Let me give you some input on both of those. Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today. I think in the last couple of quarters, we've indicated that for 2011, we were looking at CITCs in the range of 400 to 550 megawatts. And today, I said in the first quarter, we were using 275 megawatts. What's happened really over the last, I'd say, 3 to 6 months is -- and we always continually do this. We always continually look at our projects to determine whether ultimately they should be CITC or PTC projects. We've continued to see -- I mean, this isn't something that certainly caught us by surprise in the last month or so, but we have continued to see improvements in technology. And we've been able to use that technology in some of our previously identified sites, not in all previously identified sites, and it has kind of flipped the switch on the economics from CITC to regular production tax credit projects. Now part of that obviously is we continue to be comfortable with our tax position, but our deferred tax assets had been rising and we know they've been rising according to our forecast. That doesn't surprise me or concern me. But the other part of this is that the tax equity market has really come back pretty aggressively, I'd say, in the last 9 months or so. And so when we are thinking about the economics of a wind project, particularly switching from CITC to PTC, it's both an economic view of the project, with wind turbine technology obviously being a big part of that, but it's also the financing of the project. And with the tax equity market coming back pretty aggressively, we've been able to turn several of our CITC projects to PTC projects. So there's nothing else in there. There's nothing nefarious in there, other than I think it makes good sense for us to switch some of those projects over. Your second question regarding the sale or the proposed -- the exploring, if you will, I want to be clear on that, us exploring whether there's a market for those 5 gas assets. First and foremost, that really has to do with how they strategically fit into our portfolio. Those assets are great assets. We love all of our assets, as Jim Robo always like to say. But in this time, when we are seeing what's happening with other sales out there, it makes a lot of sense for us to explore these. We would absolutely, in our view, have a large taxable gain associated with the sale of these assets. A large taxable gain would be something that we would be able to use our deferred production tax credits to offset, I would say, significantly. A good rule of thumb is you can offset 75% of your taxable gain with production tax credits, and we certainly have -- would have enough production tax credits to be able to reduce that gain."

You should assume -- well, I will tell you, it would be a good assumption for you to assume that our previous estimates had the lower end of the 400 to 550 megawatts of CITC. So the difference between 400 and a 275 to 375 range is really not that significant.

One of the things that was important for us to get done in our Spanish project was -- we're always very comfortable that when we enter into a construction project that we cannot ultimately get it done on time and on budget, but when we get it done, it actually works the way it was designed to work initially. Those are the types of risks that we take on in any project, and we have those risks in Spain, and we feel very comfortable with those. One of the risks that we have not taken in the past is what I'll call -- this is probably too long of a title -- but feed-in tariff country credit risk. And this isn't to imply that I'm at all concerned with Spanish sovereign credit, but it is something new for us. And what we wanted to do in this transaction was limit the exposure that we would have, that our equity would have, to a potential change in that feed-in tariff during the construction cycle of the project. Now before I go on, let me first say, we certainly don't expect any changes in the tariff. We believe it's a great tariff. We believe that the government and industry over there has done a great job of putting something together that should be good for Spain itself and for the utilities and for the Spanish people for a very long period of time, but we're a little risk-averse on that. And so the structure we put together allows us to limit our exposure to our equity investment, which will be roughly $250 million or so, plus some amount. And the plus some amount gets complicated, and I'm not going to go into it on the call. But the $250 million or so plus this additional amount is far lower than our expected construction cost, overall construction cost in Spain, which should be over USD $1 billion."

It's really a repeat of what I said in May 2010. Our wind projects are great projects. They're very accretive to us. During the first couple of years though, it isn't significant accretion to really change, in this case, the 5% to 7% materially. So I'm not -- this isn't a red herring, if you will. This is just -- I'm just reemphasizing something I said in May 2010.

We've clearly seen that. We showed slides in the past. And so I think some of the utility companies are feeling a little bit more comfortable about long-term power purchase agreement. That's one. Secondly is we've seen a confluence of events here in, I'd say, the last 6 to 9 months, and that confluence of events we talked about a little bit before, which is really the reduction in capital costs and the improvement in technology. I mean, we're going from 80-meter tower, 80-meter blades to 100-meter tower, 100-meter blades. You're improving the wind capture, the production, if you will, by 20% to 30%. At the same time, you are seeing and we are seeing turbine cost from 2008 compared today roughly down 20%. If you put both of those things together along with the improvement that folks are seeing in load and the economy, I think that's what we're seeing. There are more people coming to ask, ""What about wind? What about wind?"" It continues to be the most economical renewable in our view. So I think it's that combination."

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2011.

NextEra Energy delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2011. Although our adjusted earnings per share results were flat to last year's comparable quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. At a time of weak natural gas and power prices, this is particularly noteworthy. 
During the quarter, we continued to make considerable investments in Florida's electrical infrastructure, which are helping to keep prices low and reliability high. One of the highlights of the quarter was that at Energy Resources, we signed long-term power purchase agreements for an additional 400 megawatts of wind power since the beginning of the year. In addition, our existing wind fleet generated nearly 1 million megawatt hours of additional power compared to last year's comparable quarter.
As you know, since our last earnings call, the people of Japan experienced one of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in modern history, including extensive damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Our sympathies go out to the Japanese people as they rebuild their country and their lives. Here in the United States, we continue to watch the events in Japan very closely. There is still much we do not know about the events at the Fukushima plant, and it will undoubtedly take much more time for full analysis to be completed. 
With regard to NextEra Energy's nuclear fleet, I can tell you that all of our plants are located outside areas deemed ""high hazard"" for seismic activity. In addition, 7 of the 8 units we operate are pressurized water reactors with redundant cooling systems and multi-layered containment systems. In fact, our Florida PWRs are battle tested, having maintained plant and public safety through several direct and nearly direct hit by major hurricanes including Andrew, Francis, Jean and Wilma. The one boiling water reactor in our fleet, the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, is not in an active seismic zone, has a higher flood margin than the Japanese plant and stores backup diesel generator fuel underground in a steel-reinforced concrete structure. Simply put, the drivers for a Japanese-style nuclear event are highly unlikely at any of the NextEra Energy nuclear units. 
Going forward, I remain optimistic that nuclear power will play a significant role in our nation's energy mix. For our part, we are on schedule with our existing plan to boost the output of our nuclear fleet through a series of uprates to the nonnuclear components of the plants. Now with regard to new nuclear, our position is unchanged. We still plan to move forward in a stepwise fashion to create the option to build 2 additional units at the site of our Turkey Point plant. Creating the option at this stage is limited to obtaining the necessary federal, state and local approvals. 
At Florida Power & Light, we had a strong first quarter. Net income was up roughly 7% over the prior-year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Those investments have allowed FPL to provide its customers with 99.98% service reliability and to significantly improve the efficiency of our power generation fleet, saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs. During the first quarter, FPL had roughly 30,000 more customers than we had a year earlier. In fact, we've now added customers for 5 quarters in a row. We think this is a positive commentary on the slow but steady improvement in the Florida economy.
The biggest area of concern remains the unemployment rate, which is at a stubbornly high 11.1%. Housing prices in Florida may show further declines, but the market has clearly repriced itself, making the state a much more attractive destination. 
On the development front, we are nearing completion of the West County Energy Center Unit 3. The addition of 1,220 megawatts of highly efficient combined-cycle gas generation to our system is a triple win. When it comes online, the new unit will save customers money on fuel, reduce air emissions and start to provide shareholders with a cash return on their investment. 
Construction is also under way on the modernization of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants. When complete in 2013 and 2014, respectively, these modernizations will add 2,420 megawatts of even more fuel-efficient combined-cycle generation to our fleet.
We were also pleased to dedicate our Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center in the first quarter. The 75-megawatt Martin facility is the first in the world to combine a solar thermal array with an existing combined-cycle natural gas plant, which is a more efficient way of deploying solar thermal technology than on a stand-alone basis. FPL has now completed all 110 megawatts of solar power allowed under the 2008 legislation enacted in the state. The net cost to the average customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity is expected to be less than $0.25 a month on average over the lives of these assets.
Solar power holds great potential for Florida. It can boost fuel diversity, create good-paying construction jobs, reduce air emissions and attract research and development dollars to the state. We continue to look forward to working with the state's regulatory and political leaders to expand the state's solar generating capacity in the future.
On the Energy Resources side of our business, we had a mixed quarter. Our existing assets performed extremely well. I was particularly pleased that we generated nearly 1 million additional megawatt hours or a 21% increase from our wind fleet than we did in the prior-year's comparable quarter, mostly on the strength of the wind resource. However, low power prices continue to impact our merchant assets and our full requirements business experienced more customer migration than we expected.
You've heard me say for some time that we believe solar has the potential to be the next wind industry for NextEra Energy, and we are pleased with the progress we made on our solar strategy in the first quarter. Of particular note was our success in securing lines of credit for our two 49.9-megawatt solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain. Lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with the risks associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to an amount significantly less than the capital cost of the project. We believe the economics of Spain solar remain attractive and we expect the project to help drive the company's earnings, starting in 2013.
Here at home, we are very encouraged that California enacted into law a robust renewable portfolio standard. The law requires load-serving entities to obtain 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020. With this move, California has made itself one of the most attractive renewable energy markets in the nation, and we look forward to doing additional business in the state. 
On the wind development front, we have signed long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, on 400 megawatts of projects so far in 2011. That brings the total number of wind PPAs to 1,638 megawatts since the beginning of last year. Of particular note, 953 megawatts of these PPAs are for projects we expect to commission in 2011 and 2012, demonstrating our commitment to lining up customers for wind energy early in the process. 
We are also seeing a noticeable spike in the number of requests for proposals being issued for wind energy. With the economics of wind improving as a result of better turbine technology and lower turbine prices, wind PPA contracts are very attractively priced. As a result, more buyers are stepping up to take advantage of these prices. 
While earnings at Energy Resources are, by their very nature, more volatile than they are at FPL, I want to emphasize once again how well hedged we are on the competitive side of our business. For 2011, 96% of our gross margin at Energy Resources is protected from swings in commodity prices and for 2012, the figure is already 91%. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted, up from 74% in 2010. This reflects our continued focus on investing in regulated assets at FPL and long-term contracted assets at Energy Resources.  As we continue to grow the business, we believe this strategy will allow us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns to our investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"

In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share.

In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $392 million and $0.94, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our nonqualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the first quarter 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $205 million or $0.49 per share. For the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. As we indicated in the fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, we believe that FPL realized a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the settlement agreement, FPL won't be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including the fluctuations due to weather. 
During the first quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.02 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, for West County Energy Center #3, returns on clause-related investments, including Martin Solar and a nuclear uprate and rate-based growth, which was partially offset by share dilution. During the quarter, we recognized $99 million in surplus depreciation on a pretax basis. We currently do not expect to amortize the full amount of surplus depreciation in 2011 that is available to us under the base rate agreement.
We are continuing to see improvements in some of our key customer metrics. The table on the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales fell by 6.2%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth. 
In the first quarter, heating degree days were modestly below normal and well below the record heating degree days experienced in the prior-year comparable quarter. Nonweather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.2%. 
As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the first quarter of 2011, we had roughly 30,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. In March, the percentage of low-usage customers experienced its first monthly decline since September 2010. The number of inactive residential meters has declined for 6 months in a row. 
Perhaps contributing to these improvements is the fact that homes in FPL markets are continuing to become more affordable. As depicted in the graph on the bottom right, the current housing affordability index, which measures the percentage of medium-income families who can afford a home, is now 66% for Miami. That is up from 11% of the peak of the boom in late 2006 and close to the national average of 73%. As you can also see in the graph, affordability in several of our other cities is now above the national average. Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages, and we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since the beginning of the year, we secured approximately 400 megawatts in wind PPAs, all of which are for projects we plan to put into service into 2011 or 2012. We will talk more about the current wind generation development and contracting environment in a couple of minutes. 
During the quarter, we completed a review of the estimated useful life of the wind turbines we had in our portfolio as of January 1, 2011. As you know, we have an ongoing obligation to revisit the assumptions used to account for our assets, including the assumptions that drive the estimated useful life. Over time, the technology employed in wind turbines has improved. With proper maintenance, we believe our fleet will last longer than previously estimated. As a result of this review, we have extended the estimated useful life for our newer wind turbine fleet to 30 years, which is roughly in the middle of our updated view of the probable range of useful life. For the assets already in service, the after-tax impact of the change in assumption for the first quarter was roughly $0.025 per share. For full year 2011, the impact is expected to be roughly $0.105 per share. We will have more to say on the impact of our -- to our forward adjusted EPS expectations in a moment.
During April, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 483 megawatts of wind capacity encompassing 5 projects. This transaction, which is similar to the one we completed in the third quarter of 2010, represents a unique structure for Energy Resources in which the differential membership investor makes an initial up-front payment and will make additional payments over time, tied to the energy production of the wind projects. The structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt. We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of our deferred production tax credits, or PTCs, on our balance sheet, and the availability of this structure will allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we would have otherwise been able to monetize them. 
As Lew noted, we closed on lines of credit this week for our solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain, which has made available to us roughly EUR 590 million or approximately $875 million. The lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to an amount significantly less than the capital cost of the projects. Just as with all of our other projects, we retained construction and performance risk, which we believe we are well prepared to address. 
These lines of credit are important steps in the development of these projects and we are very pleased to be moving forward. As we indicated to you at our May 2010 investor conference, we believe these projects will provide attractive returns and valuable experience in the expanding market for solar generation. We continue to expect to bring online both of the 49.9-megawatt units in 2013.
Energy Resources reported first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $65 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter, which exclude the effect of nonqualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $189 million or $0.46 per share. Energy Resources' first quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were flat relative to last year. Results increased $0.02 due to the contributions from assets placed into service in the first quarter of 2010 that were available for a full quarter in 2011, as well as our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects. These positive items were offset by lower expected contributions from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, for 2011.
Regarding our 2011 CITC elections, we concluded during the first quarter that it was probable that we would elect to take CITCs on roughly 275 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2011. Ultimately, we believe our elections will likely range between 275 and 375 megawatts, depending on a variety of factors, including when the assets are placed into service. This is down from our previous expectations, largely as a result of converting certain potential CITC projects to PTC projects as a result of refining and evaluating their overall economics. 
For reference, we elected CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind projects in 2010 and had assumed 600 megawatts of annual elections in last year's first quarter. The difference in the estimated CITC annual elections reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 relative to the comparable quarter. Assuming the lower end of our 2011 CITC range, the full year impact would be approximately $0.08 relative to the prior year.
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.10 relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.17 per share as compared to the year-ago period, of which $0.10 was due to an improved wind resource and lower curtailments. The wind resource was approximately 93% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior-year comparable quarter 80%. The remaining $0.07 was a result of our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects and a lower depreciation expense due to the change in the depreciable life of some of our wind assets, slightly offset by unfavorable pricing. Seabrook and Maine Hydro contributed $0.06 less than in the prior-year's comparable quarter, primarily due to lower priced hedges. 
Weak market conditions and higher O&M, due to planned outages affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, resulted in $0.02 lower adjusted earnings per share. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses are down $0.07, due primarily to our wholesale full requirements business, as well as the absence of the sale of a favorable supply contract completed in the first quarter of 2010. During this year's first quarter, we realized a negative impact from customer migration in our wholesale full requirements business, costing us roughly $0.03 on an adjusted basis. 
Also, in last year's first quarter, the sale of a power supply contract in this business increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03. Asset sales contributed a negative $0.03 entirely due to the absence of the benefit associated with last year's sale of our interest in a 27-megawatt waste-to-energy facility located in Pennsylvania. All other factors contributed negative $0.01 per share associated with higher interest expense due to higher borrowings and higher corporate G&A, both from growth of the business.
As we mentioned earlier, since the beginning of the year, we signed new power purchase agreements for 400 megawatts of new wind projects. This brings us to a total of 953 megawatts of projects, for which we have contracts and expect to commission in 2011 and 2012 and 1,638 megawatts of PPAs we have signed since the beginning of 2010. 
Given the high level of visibility we have for the 2011 and 2012 pipelines, we believe that we will add -- we will be able to add between 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts of wind before the end of 2012.  We have, however, a little less visibility than in prior years as to the amount we may add in the current year, primarily as a result of some timing issues associated with permitting. So although we feel fairly confident on the build over the next couple of years, we believe meeting the bottom end of our previous 700- to 1,000-megawatt range in 2011 will be a challenge.
Turning briefly to asset acquisitions. As we have indicated to you many times, we are as interested in acquiring contracted clean generation projects as we are in building them ourselves, as long as the returns are attractive. We are not, however, interested in purchasing or developing any additional assets outside of North America for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to acquiring assets, you should also expect that we will continuously look at our entire portfolio of existing assets to make sure that we are optimizing the value of those assets. In some circumstances, it may mean that we would sell certain of our existing assets. Currently, we are exploring the potential sale of 5 of our natural gas-fired assets at Energy Resources, including Blythe, a 507-megawatt plant in California; RIEC [Rhode Island Energy Center], a 550-megawatt plant in Rhode Island; Doswell, a 879-megawatt plant in Virginia; Cherokee, a 98-megawatt plant in South Carolina; and Calhoun, a 668-megawatt plant in Alabama. While there are attractive aspects for each of these assets, they have a limited strategic fit within our portfolio. As such, we are investigating whether or not these assets may possess a higher strategic value to another owner. At this time, we can give no assurance that an actual sale will take place.
To summarize 2011's first quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.49, Energy Resources contributed $0.46, and Corporate and Other was a negative $0.01 contribution. That is a total of $0.94 per share for the quarter. Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes discussing our adjusted EPS expectations. As we indicated earlier, the change in the assumption regarding the estimated useful life for a portion of our wind fleet has a positive impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter, and it is expected to have roughly a $0.105 positive impact on full year 2011 adjusted EPS. Solely as a result of this change, we are increasing our adjusted EPS expectations to a range of $4.35 to $4.65 from the previous range of $4.25 to $4.55. When we initially provided long-term adjusted EPS expectations at the May 2010 investor conference, the 5% to 7% average annual growth rate through 2014 was relative to a 2009 base. However, the change in the estimated useful life assumption renders future years' comparison to 2009 less relevant. As a result, we are updating our long-term expectation and we believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats that we provide.
As we have indicated before, we believe public policy support for wind generation development will ultimately be extended beyond 2012. Historically, wind has enjoyed public policy support under both Republican and Democratic leadership, and our current views is that we will continue to be successful in developing and owning wind plants for many years to come. However, we would like to put into context the impact of a potential slowdown in our expected wind build after the current federal policy on wind energy expires. If we were to assume no additions of wind assets to our operations after 2012, our adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate would continue to be within the range of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2011 base. 
With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

I'd like to conclude this morning with a few observations about the policy framework in which the electric power industry operates. Since the election of last fall, many pundits have predicted a sea change in the nation's approach to energy policy. That strikes me as premature. Yes, it's true that cap and trade is off the table for the foreseeable future, but in other ways, efforts to make the nation's energy supply cleaner, more efficient and more diverse are proceeding apace. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency released its proposed rule to tighten limits on how much mercury and other toxic air pollutants power plants are permitted to release. And in the months and years ahead, the agency will be moving forward with regulations on coal ash, particulate matter, SOx and NOx. 
I don't believe that replacing 50-year-old fossil plants with new, more efficient units will be the train wreck we have been hearing so much about, nor do I believe that putting pollution controls on many of the remaining plants is all that terrible. As an aside, it is interesting to note that 2/3 of our nation's coal fleet is without meaningful pollution controls. While there is no free lunch, the cost of this upgrade to the nation's generation fleet is likely to be far less than the costliest predictions. 
Consider our own utility. In 2010, FPL recorded a SO2 emissions rate 76% below the industry average, a NOx emissions rate 65% below the industry average and a CO2 emissions rate 36% below the industry average. Yet despite having one of the cleanest generation fleets of any utility in the nation, FPL's typical residential customer bills were 24% below the national average at the year-end 2010. We are  proof that utility can be clean and cost-effective at the same time.
In addition to EPA action, I still believe bipartisan action is possible on energy legislation that would encourage cleaner generation and greater fuel diversity. With the cost of renewables, such as wind and solar, photovoltaic coming down so dramatically over the last couple of years, one of the principal objections to a national clean energy standard is now far less compelling. 
On a final note, I want to extend a special thanks to the 15,000 employees of NextEra Energy. Last month, NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in its sector on Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies list for the fifth consecutive year. No other company in our sector has ever done that. Just as impressive, we are ranked as the 10th most admired company in the world for social responsibility. Less than 2 weeks later, we were named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Magazine. We are one of only 24 companies worldwide to appear on the list all 5 years of its existence. These accomplishments are possible only through the commitment of our employees, and I want to thank them all. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions."

Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today.

Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today. I think in the last couple of quarters, we've indicated that for 2011, we were looking at CITCs in the range of 400 to 550 megawatts. And today, I said in the first quarter, we were using 275 megawatts. What's happened really over the last, I'd say, 3 to 6 months is -- and we always continually do this. We always continually look at our projects to determine whether ultimately they should be CITC or PTC projects. We've continued to see -- I mean, this isn't something that certainly caught us by surprise in the last month or so, but we have continued to see improvements in technology. And we've been able to use that technology in some of our previously identified sites, not in all previously identified sites, and it has kind of flipped the switch on the economics from CITC to regular production tax credit projects. Now part of that, obviously, is we continue to be comfortable with our tax position, but our deferred tax assets had been rising and we know they've been rising according to our forecast. That doesn't surprise me or concern me. But the other part of this is that the tax equity market has really come back pretty aggressively, I'd say, in the last 9 months or so. And so when we are thinking about the economics of a wind project, particularly switching from CITC to PTC, it's both an economic view of the project, with wind turbine technology obviously being a big part of that, but it's also the financing of the project. And with the tax equity market coming back pretty aggressively, we've been able to turn several of our CITC projects to PTC projects. So there's nothing else in there. There's nothing nefarious in there, other than I think it makes good sense for us to switch some of those projects over. Your second question regarding the sale or the proposed -- the exploring, if you will, I want to be clear on that, us exploring whether there's a market for those 5 gas assets. First and foremost, that really has to do with how they strategically fit into our portfolio. Those assets are great assets. We love all of our assets, as Jim Robo always like to say. But in this time, when we are seeing what's happening with other sales out there, it makes a lot of sense for us to explore these. We would absolutely, in our view, have a large taxable gain associated with the sale of these assets. A large taxable gain would be something that we would be able to use our deferred production tax credits to offset, I would say, significantly. A good rule of thumb is you can offset 75% of your taxable gain with production tax credits and we certainly have -- would have enough production tax credits to be able to reduce that gain."

You should assume -- well, I will tell you, it would be a good assumption for you to assume that our previous estimates had the lower end of the 400 to 550 megawatts of CITC.

One of the things that was important for us to get done in our Spanish project was -- we're always very comfortable that when we enter into a construction project that we cannot ultimately get it done on time and on budget, but when we get it done, it actually works the way it was designed to work initially. Those are the types of risks that we take on in any project and we have those risks in Spain, and we feel very comfortable with those. One of the risks that we have not taken in the past is what I'll call -- this is probably too long of a title -- but feed-in tariff country credit risk. And this isn't to imply that I'm at all concerned with Spanish sovereign credit, but it is something new for us. And what we wanted to do in this transaction was limit the exposure that we would have, that our equity would have, to a potential change in that feed-in tariff during the construction cycle of the project. Now before I go on, let me first say, we certainly don't expect any changes in the tariff. We believe it's a great tariff. We believe that the government and industry over there has done a great job of putting something together that should be good for Spain itself and for the utilities and for the Spanish people for a very long period of time, but we're a little risk-averse on that. And so the structure we put together allows us to limit our exposure to our equity investment, which will be roughly $250 million or so, plus some amount. And the plus some amount gets complicated, and I'm not going to go into it on the call. But the $250 million or so plus this additional amount is far lower than our expected construction cost, overall construction cost in Spain, which should be over USD $1 billion."

It's really a repeat of what I said in May 2010. Our wind projects are great projects. They're very accretive to us.

This is just -- I'm just reemphasizing something I said in May 2010.

So whatever we expect to build in 2012 has not yet been incorporated into the gross margins slide, so it's important for everybody to realize that. The biggest change -- there's roughly a $60 million or so reduction in the gross margin from the midpoint. The biggest change is actually a couple of projects that we have moved from 2011 to 2012, so they were going to have a full year of earnings in 2012 because we got them in 2011. Now that they've been moved back to 2012, there's very little earnings associated with those projects because we haven't included new investments in the 2012 slides. That's the majority of it.

We've clearly seen that. We showed slides in the past. And so I think some of the utility companies are feeling a little bit more comfortable about long-term power purchase agreement. That's one. Secondly is we've seen a confluence of events here in, I'd say, the last 6 to 9 months, and that confluence of events we talked about a little bit before, which is really the reduction in capital costs and the improvement in technology. I mean, we're going from 80-meter tower, 80-meter blades to 100-meter tower, 100-meter blades. You're improving the wind capture, the production, if you will, by 20% to 30%. At the same time, you are seeing and we are seeing turbine cost from 2008 compared today roughly down 20%. If you put both of those things together, along with the improvement that folks are seeing in load and the economy, I think that's what we're seeing. There are more people coming to ask, ""What about wind? What about wind?"" It continues to be the most economical renewable, in our view. So I think it's that combination."

Our strategy of inves",981,"Okay. Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy had strong performance in the second quarter. We grew adjusted earnings per share be approximately 6% over the prior-year comparable quarter. Our strategy of investing in clean renewable and efficient generation continues to drive solid results. We're executing well while continuing to enhance our generation portfolio be weighting it significantly towards regulated or long-term contracted opportunities that should enhance shareholder value.
At Florida Power and Light Company, we had a strong second quarter. Net income was up approximately 14% over the prior-year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Over the quarter, FPL averaged more than 10,000 additional customers than we had in the first 3 months of the year. In Florida, our biggest area of concern remains the difficult employment climate in the state with an unemployment rate of 10.6% as of June 2011, which nears the depressed national employment market. However, even in a difficult economy, our generation portfolio development pipeline at FPL -- our generation portfolio and our development pipeline at FPL is setting the pace for the industry, provided significant operating efficiencies, sustainable environmental performance and strong customer benefits.
The operate work at our St. Lucy and Turkeypoint nuclear facilities in Florida is proceeding. We expect that these investments, which will add about 450 megawatts of clean, reliable, emission-free energy to our portfolio will save FPL customers about $4.6 billion to 4.8 billion in fuel cost over the life of the plant.
We've brought the third unit of our West County Energy Center online, on-time and on budget. This unit adds approximately 1,220 megawatts to what is now the nation's largest combined cycle natural gas-fired power plant. This facility increases the efficiency of FPL's generation fleet, saves our customer's money on fuel and reduces air emissions. 
In June, we moved forward with the construction of the modernized $1.3 billion Riviera Beach Next-generation Clean Energy Center by demolishing the boilers, the stacks and the related equipment at the Riviera Beach plant. If you haven't taken a chance to look at it, there's a nice clip on YouTube, kind of fun to watch.
We expect the modernized plant to come online in 2014. In addition, the modernization of our Cape Canaveral plant is progressing well and is on track to meet its planned 2013 start date. These 2 combined cycle facilities at estimated cost of $2.4 billion are expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation and we estimate that they will provide customers $850 million to $950 million of net savings over the life of the plants.
Now we indicated in FPL's 10-year site plan that we would need to bring new capacity online in 2016 to meet our projected load obligations. Earlier this month, we took an initial step to seek state regulatory approval to modernize the Port Everglades facility. Like West County, Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, we expect a modernized Port Everglades to offer considerable customer benefits through fuel and other savings that exceed the revenue requirements over the life of the project. If it were to come online in 2016 as proposed, the Port Everglades' modernization will cost roughly $1.2 billion and would use about 35% less fuel per megawatt hour and provide customers with more than $400 million in estimated net savings over the life of the plant.
If this project moves forward, our investment in the Port Everglades modernization would make FPL's generation fleet even more efficient. We projected 21% efficiency improvement in our fossil system heat rate from 2001 to 2016, amounting to about $1.3 billion in annual fuel savings in 2016 compared to a 2001 baseline.
These investments in Florida Electric Infrastructure also provides a significant benefit to customers in terms of efficiency and reliability. In fact, FPL customers now enjoy 99.98% service reliability.
Now turning to NextEra Energy Resources. Our distinctive wind fleet produced an average 766,000-megawatt hours of electricity or a 13% increase compared to the year ago comparable quarter, driven primarily by an improved wind resource. In addition, the 909 megawatts of

That we added during the second quarter of 2010 made a positive contribution to results in the second quarter. Challenges in the quarter included the extended refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities, as well as impairment of certain assets in West Texas and in the Northeast. While the duration of Seabrook and Point Beach is longer than we anticipated, both facilities are now back online and operating well. A positive outcome of the extended Point Beach outage is that we completed the uprate wor on Units 2. We expect to increase output from the unit to be more than our earlier estimates of 80 megawatts and note that all incremental power resulting from the uprate investments will be sold under a long-term contract.
In our first quarter earnings call, we signed long-term power purchase agreements on 632 megawatts of new wind projects. Roughly 469 megawatts of that amount results from the recently signed this of contract, for projects in Ontario, Canada which we currently expect to be online before the end of 2014.
This represents a significant investment and demonstrates our commitment to building a renewable footprint in Canada's supported by long term contracts. We are excited about the continued prospects in Canada and the amount of this project, we will be one of the largest owners of wind generation in Canada.
Additionally, we signed a 23-year contract for an average of approximately 50 megawatts of generation from our Seabrook Station nuclear facility.
It certainly been a good quarter in terms of contracting our future revenue and I'm proud of the teams to continue to work hard to get this done. With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"
270586,137368947,146887,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew and good morning, everyone. The second quarter 2011 NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $500 million and $1.18, respectively. The",2541,"Thank you, Lew and good morning, everyone. The second quarter 2011 NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $500 million and $1.18, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the second quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $301 million or $0.72 per share. During the second quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.08 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by rate base growth and returns on cost related investments including Martin Solar and the nuclear upgrades. 
As a reminder for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. We continue to believe that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012, subject to the normal caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions.
For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including the fluctuations due to weather. As such, general weather variability is not expected to affect earnings. Also, keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings.
During the quarter, we recognized $31 million in surplus depreciation and amortization, bringing the total amount recognized during the first 6 months of the year to $131 million. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to amortize between $180 million and $200 million, less than the full amount of the surplus depreciation for the year that is available to us under the base rate agreement.
This estimate for 2011 is down from the range of $245 million to $265 million that we provided in our Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call, largely as a result of the favorable weather experience in the second quarter.
Turning to our customer metrics, the economic recovery in Florida appears to continue to take hold but the progress is slow and uneven. As a result, some of our key metrics were mixed. The table in the upper left shows the change in the retail kilowatt hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales increased by 2.8% due primarily to higher weather-related usage and an increase in customers. In the second quarter, cooling days were well above normal and higher than the level experienced in the prior-year comparable quarter.
Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.6%. We continue to look at the overall picture but feel it is too early to have a clear longer-term view on customer usage. 
As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the second quarter 2011, we had approximately 28,500 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the sixth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior-year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of page shows inactive and low usage customers,, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. Both of these metrics have improved relative to the same time last year. 
In fact, a number of inactive meters has declined approximately 5% since the end of last year's second quarter. Regarding the modest sequential increase in inactive meters in June, note that prior to the recession, we experienced strong seasonal patterns that would result in higher levels of inactive meters during the summer months.
Although we cannot be certain, it's possible some seasonality may be appearing again after being largely masked by other drivers during the recession. The chart in the lower right-hand corner shows weekly unemployment claims in Florida. The chart shows that initial job claims are well below the levels reached during the height of the recession. Nevertheless, the downward trend is slow, it's slope is not as steep as we would like to see and we have seen a small uptick in the data since April. A number of the economic indicators we follow similar patterns. There have been improvements from the peak of the recession, the progress is slow and at times, a bit bumpy.
In an effort to continue to support economic development in Florida, we've just created and staffed a new Office of Economic Development to help Governor and local economic development organizations to attract businesses to the state. We believe that when businesses thrive and grow, it drives the economy and creates jobs, which benefits all of us. We continue to look for ways to partner with our communities to spur economic development here in Florida. We are the largest investor in the State of Florida, having invested on a cumulative basis approximately $33 billion in infrastructure investments. In the last 5 years alone, that investment total is approximately $12 billion.
Overall, we continue to be positive regarding future developments in Florida and believe we have one of the best utility franchises in the country. Although Florida's economy is not rebounded completely from the recession, we are optimistic that the positive attributes of Florida will drive long-term growth over a sustained period as compared to other parts of the country. As such, we continue to make significant investments in our regulated businesses in Florida, which provide both direct benefits for our customers and earnings growth for our shareholders.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since our first quarter 2011 earnings call, we secured approximately 632 megawatts in wind PPAs for new projects, of which roughly 469 megawatts are for Canadian projects we plan to put in service in 2013 and 2014. We are awarded these feed and tariff contract earlier this month by the Ontario Power Authority. The opportunity to develop these projects is consistent with our comments over the last several years, indicating that we plan to develop more renewable energy in Canada.
During June, we closed the previously announced acquisition of White Oak, a 150-megawatt wind facility in Illinois, and at the same time, we completed the differential membership transaction, often referred to as tax equity by others relating to the project. This is the fourth differential membership transaction we completed in the last 3 months. This transactions are attractive as we allow us to allocate the tax attributes of our investments to third-party investors that can more efficiently utilize these benefits.
In essence, these transactions allow us to monetize of the tax benefits of our investments in a timelier manner. We will continue to look for opportunities with both of existing portfolio and new investments to structure these tax benefit sharing the regions. 
On the solar front, our 2 primary solar project Genesis and Spain continue to move forward. During the quarter, we are notified by the Department of Energy that our Genesis solar project received conditional approval to receive a loan guarantee from the government. This guarantee would lower the debt financing cost for the project. Our Spain projects are under construction and are progressing well.
Turning to our nuclear portfolio. Turning the quarter, refueling outages that our Seabrook Station and Point Beach nuclear plants reduced EPS by $0.09, of which approximately $0.045 were due to the expanded portions of the refueling outages. The Point Beach outage work included work associated with the upgrade of Unit 2. That work consisted of approximately 3 million man hours and produced more than 80 megawatts of additional power. This is the first of 6 plant upgrades that FPL and Energy Resources nuclear units during the next 2 years.
Energy Resources reported second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $239 million or $0.57 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter, which exclude the effect of non qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $159 million or $0.37 per share.
Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.11 from last year's comparable quarter. These results included negative $0.08 impact from the previously discussed asset impairment charges. New wind and solar investment contributions increased $0.03 relative to last year as a result of our adding 900 megawatts of wind and solar during or after the second quarter of 2010.
Our estimate for full-year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged from the first quarter at roughly 275 megawatts, including the 150 megawatts associated with the differential membership transaction we completed during the quarter. Although the full year earnings impact is roughly the same, under differential membership transaction, the earnings impact is required to be fully recognized in the period the assets are placed into service as opposed to being allocated ratibly throughout the year.
In addition, this benefited supported in operating income as opposed to income taxes. This resulted in a $0.01 increase in contributions from CITC this quarter compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. We estimate that the full-year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 will be approximately $0.07. 
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.07 per share that's compared to the year-ago period, driven primarily by an improved wind resource and lower depreciation expense. These items were partially offset by lower West Texas pricing. The wind resource was approximately 111% of normal, which is an improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter of 96%.
In the merchant portfolio, Sea Brook's contributions to earnings decreased $0.09. the refueling outages at Sea Brook reduced earnings by $0.07 per share as compared to the prior year while the remaining 2% decrease was largely a result of lower hedged prices, partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. 
In contracted generation, Point Beach contributed a negative $0.01. the refueling outage for Unit 2 contributed a negative $0.02, substantially all of which was related to the extended portion of the outage. This was partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. White contributed $0.02 relative to last year due to the improved pricing we received under the new long-term agreement.
The remaining $0.01 of positive contributions from existing assets came from a number of small items, none of which is particularly noteworthy. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses were down $0.01 due to weakness in the Full Requirements business. Power and Gas Trading were roughly flat.
Asset sales contributed negative $0.01 from the lack of a gain realized in the prior-year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we recognized impairment charges associated with certain assets, totaling $0.08 per share. $0.05 of which is due to an assessment of the fair value of our older wind assets in West Texas as a result of recent market value indications. An additional $0.02 relates to an impairment taken, a 2039-megawatt of oil for facilities in Maine as a result of a recently issued proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Finally, $0.01 relates to the impairment of an older 50-megawatt natural gas peaking facility in Pennsylvania, as well as some other impairment costs.
All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share associated with share dilution and higher interest expense due to higher borrowings from the growth of the business. In the appendix of this presentation, we've included in the updated hedging disclosure information that we typically provide in our quarterly earnings report. For 2011, equivalent gross margin estimates have been updated to reflect actual performance during the second quarter, including the impact of the extended outages at Seabrook and Point Beach and the impairment charges. We've also reduced our expectations for the Power and Gas Trading businesses. The prevailing lower price volatility conditions across the power and gas markets have reduced the opportunities we see for these businesses in the near-term. In light of this view, we've also reduced our expectations for these businesses in 2012.
All other changes in 2012 were minor. As a reminder, the 2012 slide does not yet include contributions from assets we expect to put in service in 2012. Now we would like to turn your attention to our wind and solar development pipelines.
As we've discussed over the last 9 months or so, obtaining long-term contracts on our wind pipeline opportunities has been a priority for us. Our intense focus on contracting assets, along with an improving economy, which benefits energy load and generally better economics, is what we believe is driving the improved results we are seeing. In fact, Energy Resources has had plenty of success in 2010 and 2011 by signing 1,823 megawatts of long-term PPAs for new wind projects.
We have signed more long-term PPAs for new wind projects thus far in the first 7 months of 2011 than we did in all of 2010. As we stand today, we now have 1,116 megawatts of long-term contracts for U.S. and Canadian wind projects that we have already put in service in 2011 or planned to put in service in 2011 and 2012. In addition, this month, we were awarded with roughly 469 megawatts of contract with the Ontario Power Authority for assets to be put in service in 2013 and 2014.
Together, these projects represent an estimated $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of planned capital expenditures in wind generation in 2011 and 2012, and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion expected to be spent in 2013 and 2014.
We are pleased to get an early start on the 2013 and 2014 pipeline particularly with projects not dependent on U.S. incentive policies. Although we continue to believe U.S. renewable policies will support wind development beyond 2012, we are pleased with our continued expansion in Canada. In addition to our strong wind development pipeline, we also have our large solar thermal project, Genesis and Spain, as well as some solar PV projects, which we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion between 2011 and 2014.
To summarize 2011 second quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.72, Energy Resources contributed $0.37 and Corporate and Other was a $0.09 contribution, for a total $1.18 per share for the current quarter. Corporate and Other increased $0.10 versus the prior year's comparable quarter, primarily due to previously mentioned state tax law changes, partially offset by other tax adjustments.
Before turning the call back over to Lew, I want to reiterate our view that our adjusted EPS for 2011 will likely fall on the range of $4.35 to $4.65. We continue to believe there are adjusted EPS will grow with an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats we provide. Finally, we continue to explore the option of selling the gas-fired generation assets that we mentioned last quarter. The process is moving forward and we plan to update you further on or before the third quarter call. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

I want to close with some perspective on why we believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. 
In total, we have a strong backlog of approximately $12 billion of committed growth projects including the major capital projects under construction at FPL, the contracted wind and solar investments at Energy Resources and the regulated transmission investments at Lone Star Transmission. Of course, our development pipeline includes many other potential projects that we continue to work on. We expect that by 2014, approximately 80% of our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA will come from regulated or long-term contracted business.
At FPL, we're executing well on the midst of one of our largest ever development cycles, which we believe will drive significant savings for our customers. The $5.8 billion in major capital project under construction includes modernizations, Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, uprates at our St. Lucy and Turkey Point nuclear plants and our Energy Smart Florida smart grid projects. In addition, as previously discussed, our proposal to modernize the Port Everglades facility would add an incremental investment of approximately $1.2 billion for 2016. We expect all of these projects to improve the long-term affordability and reliability of our service to FPL customers.
At Energy Resources, we plan to invest more than $5 billion between 2011 and 2014 and renewable projects for which we already have long-term contracts. Our wind development pipeline remains robust and we remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts between 2011 and 2012. As we also discussed today, we've already started to the pipeline of contracted projects we plan to put into service in 2013 and 2014. In addition to wind, we continue to be solar is an attractive growth opportunity.
We have 415 megawatts of long-term contracts on hand today for projects we plan to put into service between 2011 and 2014. Construction work at our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain Solar, is proceeding well. 
Finally, Lone Star Transmission represents approximately $800 million of capital expenditures that will be rate regulated in Texas. We expected construction work on Loan Star's credit line to begin later this year and for the line to be energized in 2013. Also, we have a development backlog that we feel confident in executing and that it will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders alike. As one of the cleanest energy producers in the country, I believe in NextEra Energy is well-positioned for the future in the face of increased federal regulatory activity. We held ourselves to higher standards and in doing so, we are serving our customers well, doing our part for the environment and driving shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

But assuming that it does, what I've said about any proceeds that we received from those projects is, if we had new opportunities, new opportunities that we have not yet discussed, clearly that would be 1 avenue where we could use the proceeds to invest in that new commitment. If there are no new opportunities that come up other than those that we have in the forecast and we've discussed with you, then we would use those to try to determine whether we want to rebalance our capital structure. Our comments on our capital structure before, I think have been relatively that starting in May of 2010, which is we want a strong balance sheet, we're comfortable with our current credit metrics. If we were to receive proceeds from that asset sale, then we would probably look to rebalance our structure to be consistent with our current structure, and not look to necessarily improve or deteriorate from where we currently are."

One, I think it's right to focus on the second quarter signings, but this is really something that started I'd say later or at least the second half of 2010. We came into this year, in January this year, with 553 megawatts of contracts in hand for 2011 and 2012 wind. That was a very large number for us to have in hand for construction when you look back at our history. In the quarter, we signed another 563 megawatts of wind, so a little higher than what we came into the year with. I've got 469 of that was a big chunk in Canada that we were awarded 6 projects at one time. We've been spending time in Canada for now for the last 3 years or so. And we've got some success there. So I wouldn't -- we're certainly harping on it, we're very proud of it, we're happy about it, we've been working hard on it. But some of those contracts could have been done in the first quarter as opposed to the second quarter. Some of the ones in the second quarter could have been signed in the third quarter as opposed to the second quarter. I think the bigger focus here is the trend. Really since the second half of 2010, we've been successful in signing long-term agreements up to the point now where we've got over 1,100 megawatts just for '11 and '12 in hand. So I think it's a variety of factors and I've mentioned them, and we just had a couple of minutes on increased loads, where you've got increased economic activity in the U.S. that's leading to increased loads, that's a huge positive. To the tax incentives in the U.S. of this at this point, and at the end of 2012, I think is also moving people to get something done a little sooner. The economics have improved a little bit. I've talked about that the cost of the come down, the CapEx has come down for this project. That's helping with the economics. All that, I think when you put it together, in addition to the focus that we put at a senior management level has helped. Your last point on margins, as we continue to look at the margins that we're getting across -- on an average basis, I think both Lew and I have said that there are some contracts that we signed that don't meet the criteria. But on an average basis, we are still getting a low double-digit after tax on leveraged returns. that's what we've said for a number of years we've been getting and on an average we're still there."

It's probably ratibly with 1 exception and an exceptional just gets into a different explanation. But it's ratibly, and the reason its ratibly is because under the accounting rules, the full benefit you're expecting for the year, you actually have to allocate on a quarterly basis, right. You allocate to each quarter based on what you expect to have of the end of the year and the allocation is actually based on the amount of pretax earnings that you had in each quarter. So maybe if you would have had the same expectation at the beginning of the year for 2010 and 2011, right, you would have said 600 megawatts of CITC for '10 and '11. Then the only difference on the quarterly allocation basis would be the difference in pretax income for each quarter. So last year, I think, we started the year with 600 megawatts of expected CITC, this year we started with I think with 275 megawatts of CITC. The difference of that is $0.07. Assuming no change in pretax earnings, allocation between the quarter, let's take that as an assumption, the $0.07 would be ratibly allocated throughout the year. The 1 exception is we talked about White Oat, 150 megawatts in the second quarter, because that was a project financed under differential membership interest or tax equity. The full benefit of that 1 actually happened in the second quarter."

I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy had strong performance in the second quarter. We grew adjusted earnings per share be approximately 6% over the prior year comparable quarter. Our strategy of inves",993,"Okay. Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy had strong performance in the second quarter. We grew adjusted earnings per share be approximately 6% over the prior year comparable quarter. Our strategy of investing in clean renewable and efficient generation continues to drive solid results. We're executing well while continuing to enhance our generation portfolio by weighting it significantly toward regulated and long-term contracted opportunities that should enhance shareholder value.
At Florida Power & Light Company, we had a strong second quarter. Net income was up approximately 14% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Over the quarter, FPL averaged more than 10,000 additional customers than we had in the first 3 months of the year. In Florida, our biggest area of concern remains the difficult employment climate in the state with an unemployment rate of 10.6% as of June 2011, which gears the depressed national employment market. However, even in a difficult economy, our generation portfolio development pipeline at FPL -- our generation portfolio and our development pipeline at FPL is setting the pace for the industry, providing significant operating efficiencies, sustainable environmental performance and strong customer benefits.
The uprate work at our St. Lucy and Turkey Point nuclear facilities in Florida is proceeding. We expect that these investments, which will add about 450 megawatts of clean, reliable, emission-free energy to our portfolio will save FPL customers about $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion in fuel cost over the life of the plants. We've brought the third unit of our West County Energy Center online, on time and on budget. This unit adds approximately 1,220 megawatts to what is now the nation's largest combined cycle natural gas-fired power plant. This facility increases the efficiency of FPL's generation fleet, saves our customers money on fuel and reduces air emissions. 
In June, we moved forward with the construction of the modernized $1.3 billion Riviera Beach Next Generation Clean Energy Center by demolishing the boilers, the stacks and related equipment at the Riviera Beach plant. If you haven't taken a chance to look at it, there's a nice little clip on YouTube, kind of fun to watch. We expect the modernized plant to come online in 2014. In addition, the modernization of our Cape Canaveral plant is progressing well and is on track to meet its planned 2013 start date. These 2 combined cycle facilities at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion are expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation, and we estimate that they will provide customers $850 million to $950 million in net savings over the life of the plants.
Now we indicated in FPL's 10-year site plan that we would need to bring new capacity online in 2016 to meet our projected load obligations. Earlier this month, we took an initial step to seek state regulatory approval to modernize the Port Everglades facility. Like West County, Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, we expect a modernized Port Everglades to offer considerable customer benefits through fuel and other savings that exceed the revenue requirements over the life of the project. If it were to come online in 2016 as proposed, the Port Everglades' modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and would use about 35% less fuel per megawatt hour and provide customers with more than $400 million in estimated net savings over the life of the plants.
If this project move forward, our investment in the Port Everglades modernization would make FPL's generation fleet even more efficient. We project a 21% efficiency improvement in our fossil system heat rate from 2001 through 2016, amounting to about $1.3 billion in annual fuel savings in 2016 compared to a 2001 baseline. These investments in Florida Electric Infrastructure also provides a significant benefit to customers in terms of efficiency and reliability. In fact, FPL customers now enjoy 99.98% service reliability.
Now turning to NextEra Energy Resources. Our existing wind fleet produced an additional 766,000-megawatt hours of electricity or a 13% increase compared to the year-ago comparable quarter, driven primarily by an improved wind resource. In addition, the 909 megawatts of assets that we added during or since the second quarter of 2010 made a positive contribution to results in the second quarter. Challenges in the quarter included the extended refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities, as well as impairment of certain assets in West Texas and in the Northeast. While the duration of Seabrook and Point Beach outages was longer than we had anticipated, both facilities are now back online and operating well. A positive outcome of the extended Point Beach outage was that we completed the uprate work on unit 2. We expect to increased output from the unit to be more than our earlier estimates of 80 megawatts, and note that all incremental power resulting from the uprate investments will be sold under a long-term contract.
Since our first earning -- first quarter earnings call, we signed long-term power purchase agreements on 632 megawatts of new wind projects. Roughly 469 megawatts of that amount results from the recently signed series of contracts for projects in Ontario, Canada, which we currently expect to be online before the end of 2014. This represents a significant investment and demonstrates our commitment to growing our renewable footprint in Canada supported by long-term contracts. We're excited about the continued prospects from Canada and the announcement of these projects, we will be one of the largest owners of wind generation in Canada. Additionally, we have signed a 23-year contract for an average of approximately 50 megawatts of generation from our Seabrook Station nuclear facility.
It certainly have been a good quarter in terms of contracting our future revenue and I'm proud of the teams that continue to work hard to get this done. With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"
270586,137368947,147020,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","?Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter 2011's, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $500 million and $1.18, respectiv",2555,"?Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter 2011's, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $500 million and $1.18, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For's the second quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $301 million or $0.72 per share. During the second quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.08 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by rate base growth and returns on cost-related investments including Martin Solar and the nuclear upgrades. 
As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. We continue to believe that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012, subject to the normal caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions.
For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including the fluctuations due to weather. As such, general weather variability is not expected to affect earnings. Also, keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings.
During the quarter, we recognized $31 million in surplus depreciation and amortization, bringing the total amount recognized during the first 6 months of the year to $131 million. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to amortize between $180 million and $200 million, less than the full amount of the surplus depreciation for the year that is available to us under the base rate agreement. This estimate for 2011 is down from the range of $245 million to $265 million that we provided in our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, largely as a result of the favorable weather experience in the second quarter.
Turning to our customer metrics. The economic recovery in Florida appears to continue to take hold, but the progress is slow and uneven. As a result, some of our key metrics are mixed. The table in the upper left shows the change in the retail kilowatt hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales increased by 2.8% due primarily to higher weather-related usage and an increase in customers. In the second quarter, cooling the grid days were well above normal and higher than the level experienced in the prior year comparable quarter. Non-weather related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.6%. We continue to look at the overall picture, but feel it is too early to have a clear longer term view on customer usage. 
As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the second quarter 2011, we had approximately 28,500 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the sixth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. Both of these metrics have improved relative to the same time last year. In fact, a number of inactive meters has declined approximately 5% since the end of last year's second quarter. Regarding the modest sequential increase in inactive meters in June, note that prior to the recession, we experienced strong seasonal patterns that would result in higher levels of inactive meters during the summer months. Although we cannot be certain, it is possible some seasonality may be appearing again after being largely masked by other drivers during the recession. 
The chart at the lower right-hand corner shows weekly unemployment claims in Florida. The chart shows that initial jobless claims are well below the levels reached during the height of the recession. Nevertheless, the downward trend is slow, it's slope is not as steep as we would like to see and we have seen a small uptick in the data since April. A number of the economic indicators we follow similar patterns. There have been improvements from the peak of the recession, the progress is slow and at times, a bit bumpy.
In an effort to continue to support economic development in Florida, we've just created and staffed a new Office of Economic Development to help the governor and local economic development organizations to attract businesses to the state. We believe that when businesses thrive and grow, it drives the economy and creates jobs, which benefits all of us. We continue to look for ways to partner with our communities to spur economic development here in Florida. We are the largest investor in the State of Florida, having invested on a cumulative basis approximately $33 billion in infrastructure investments. In the last 5 years alone, that investment total is approximately $12 billion.
Overall, we continue to be positive regarding future developments in Florida and believe we have one of the best utility franchises in the country. Although Florida's economy is not rebounded completely from the recession, we are optimistic that the positive attributes of Florida will drive greater long-term growth over a sustained period as compared to other parts of the country. As such, we continue to make significant investments in our regulated businesses in Florida, which provide both direct benefits for our customers and earnings growth for our shareholders.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since our first quarter 2011 earnings call, we secured approximately 632 megawatts in wind PPAs for new projects, of which roughly 469 megawatts are for Canadian projects we plan to put in service in 2013 and 2014. We are awarded these feed-in tariff contracts earlier this month by the Ontario Power Authority. The opportunity to develop these projects is consistent with our comments over the last several years, indicating that we plan to develop more renewable energy in Canada.
During June, we closed the previously announced acquisition of White Oak, a 150-megawatt wind facility in Illinois and at the same time, we completed the differential membership transaction, often referred to as tax equity by others relating to the project. This is the fourth differential membership transaction we have completed in the last 15 months. Each transactions are attractive as they allow us to allocate the tax attributes of our investments to third-party investors that can more efficiently utilize these benefits.
In essence, these transactions allow us to monetize the tax benefits of our investments in a timelier manner. We will continue to look for opportunities with both our existing portfolio and new investments to structure these tax benefit sharing arrangements. 
On the solar front, our 2 primary solar projects, Genesis and Spain, continue to move forward. During the quarter, we are notified by the Department of Energy that our Genesis solar project received conditional approval to receive a loan guarantee from the government. This guarantee would lower the debt financing cost for the project. Our Spain projects are under construction and are progressing well.
Turning to our nuclear portfolio. During the quarter, refueling outages at our Seabrook Station and Point Beach nuclear plants reduced EPS by $0.09, of which approximately $0.045 was due to the expanded portions of the refueling outages. The Point Beach outage work included work associated with the upgrade of unit 2. That work consisted of approximately 3 million man hours and produced more than 80 megawatts of additional power. This is the first of 6 planned upgrades at FPL and Energy Resources nuclear units during the next 2 years.
Energy Resources reported second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $239 million or $0.57 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $159 million or $0.37 per share.
Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.11 from last year's comparable quarter. These results included negative $0.08 impact from the previously discussed asset impairment charges. New wind and solar investment contributions increased $0.03 relative to last year as a result of our adding 900 megawatts of wind and solar during or after the second quarter of 2010.
Our estimate for full year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged from the first quarter at roughly 275 megawatts, including the 150 megawatts associated with the differential membership transaction we completed during the quarter. Although the full year earnings impact is roughly the same, under a differential membership transaction, the earnings impact is required to be fully recognized in the period the assets are placed into service as opposed to being allocated ratably throughout the year. In addition, this benefit is reported in operating income as opposed to income taxes. This resulted in a $0.01 increase in contributions from CITC this quarter compared to the prior year comparable quarter. We estimate that the full year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 will be approximately $0.07. 
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.07 per share that's compared to the year-ago period, driven primarily by an improved wind resource and lower depreciation expense. These items were partially offset by lower West Texas pricing. The wind resource was approximately 111% of normal, which is an improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter of 96%.
In the merchant portfolio, Seabrook's contribution to earnings decreased $0.09. The refueling outage at Seabrook reduced earnings by $0.07 per share as compared to the prior year, while the remaining $0.02 decrease was largely a result of lower hedge prices, partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. 
In contract degeneration, Point Beach contributed a negative $0.01. The refueling outage for unit 2 contributed a negative $0.02, substantially all of which was related to the extended portion of the outage. This was partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. White contributed $0.02 relative to last year due to the improved pricing it receives under the new long-term agreement. The remaining $0.01 of positive contributions from existing assets came from a number of small items, none of which is particularly noteworthy. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses were down $0.01 due to weakness in the full requirements business. Power and gas trading were roughly flat.
Asset sales contributed negative $0.01 from the lack of a gain realized in the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we recognized impairment charges associated with certain assets, totaling $0.08 per share. $0.05 of which is due to an assessment of the fair value of our older wind assets in West Texas as a result of recent market value indications. An additional $0.02 relates to an impairment taken, a 2039-megawatt of oil-fired facilities in Maine as a result of a recently issued proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Finally, $0.01 relates to the impairment of an older 50-megawatt natural gas peaking facility in Pennsylvania, as well as some other impairment costs.
All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share associated with share dilution and higher interest expense due to higher borrowings from the growth of the business. In the appendix of this presentation, we have included in the updated hedging disclosure information that we typically provide in our quarterly earnings report. For 2011, equivalent gross margin estimates have been updated to reflect actual performance during the second quarter, including the impact of the extended outages at Seabrook and Point Beach and the impairment charges. We have also reduced our expectations for the power and gas trading businesses. The prevailing lower price volatility conditions across the power and gas markets have reduced the opportunities we see for these businesses in the near term. In light of this view, we have also reduced our expectations for these businesses in 2012.
All other changes in 2012 were minor. As a reminder, the 2012 slide does not yet include contributions from assets we expect to put in service in 2012. Now we would like to turn your attention to our wind and solar development pipelines.
As we have discussed over the last 9 months or so, obtaining long-term contracts on our wind pipeline opportunities has been a priority for us. Our intense focus on contracting assets, along with an improving economy, which benefits energy load and generally better economics, is what we believe is driving the improved results we are seeing. In fact, Energy Resources has had plenty of success in 2010 and 2011 by signing 1,823 megawatts of long-term PPAs for new wind projects.
We have signed more long-term PPAs for new wind projects thus far in the first 7 months of 2011 than we did in all of 2010. As we stand today, we now have 1,116 megawatts of long-term contracts for U.S. and Canadian wind projects that we have already put in service in 2011 or plan to put in service in 2011 and 2012. In addition, this month, we were awarded roughly 469 megawatts of contracts with the Ontario Power Authority for assets to be put in service in 2013 and 2014. Together, these projects represent an estimated $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of planned capital expenditures in wind generation in 2011 and 2012, and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion expected to be spent in 2013 and 2014.
We are pleased to get an early start on the 2013 and 2014 pipeline, particularly with projects not dependent on U.S. incentive policies. Although we continue to believe U.S. renewable policies will support wind development beyond 2012, we are pleased with our continued expansion in Canada. In addition to our strong wind development pipeline, we also have our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain, as well as some solar PV projects, in which we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion between 2011 and 2014.
To summarize 2011 second quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.72, Energy Resources contributed $0.37 and Corporate and Other was a $0.09 contribution, for a total $1.18 per share for the current quarter. Corporate and Other increased $0.10 versus the prior year's comparable quarter, primarily due to previously mentioned state tax law changes, partially offset by other tax adjustments.
Before turning the call back over to Lew, I want to reiterate our view that our adjusted EPS for 2011 will likely fall on the range of $4.35 to $4.65. We continue to believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats we provide. Finally, we continue to explore the option of selling the gas-fired generation assets that we mentioned last quarter. The process is moving forward and we plan to update you further on or before the third quarter call. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

I want to close with some perspective on why we believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. 
In total, we have a strong backlog of approximately $12 billion of committed growth projects including the major capital projects under construction at FPL, the contracted wind and solar investments at Energy Resources and the regulated transmission investments at Lone Star Transmission. Of course, our development pipeline includes many other potential projects that we continue to work on. We expect that by 2014, approximately 80% of our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA will come from regulated or long-term contracted businesses.
At FPL, we're executing well in the midst of one of our largest ever development cycles, which we believe will drive significant savings for our customers. The $5.8 billion in major capital projects under construction includes modernizations of Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, uprates at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear plants and our Energy Smart Florida smart grid project. In addition, as previously discussed, our proposal to modernize the Port Everglades facility would add incremental investment of approximately $1.2 billion through 2016. We expect all of these projects to improve the long-term affordability and reliability of our service to FPL customers.
At Energy Resources, we plan to invest more than $5 billion between 2011 and 2014 in renewable projects for which we already have long-term contracts. Our wind development pipeline remains robust and we remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts between 2011 and 2012. As we also discussed today, we have already started to build a pipeline of contracted projects we plan to put into service in 2013 and 2014. In addition to wind, we continue to be solar is an attractive growth opportunity. We have 415 megawatts of long-term contracts on hand today for projects we plan to put into service between 2011 and 2014. Construction work at our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain Solar, is proceeding well. 
Finally, Lone Star Transmission represents approximately $800 million of capital expenditures that will be rate regulated in Texas. We expect construction work on Loan Star's credit line to begin later this year and for the line to be energized in 2013. Also, we have a development backlog that we feel confident in executing and that it will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders alike. As one of the cleanest energy producers in the country, I believe in NextEra Energy is well-positioned for the future in the face of increased federal regulatory activity. We held ourselves to higher standards and in doing so, we are serving our customers well, doing our part for the environment and driving shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

I mean before we had this, the gas asset sale, before we were exploring the sale of those gas assets, clearly we had a longer term plan as to where we were going to get the both the debt and the equity to be able to fulfill these commitments. I think what I've said specifically on the gas asset sales and again, we're still exploring the opportunity, I don't know whether it will come to fruition are not. But assuming that it does, what I've said about any proceeds that we received from those projects is, if we have new opportunities, new opportunities that we have not yet discussed, clearly that would be one avenue where we could use the proceeds to invest in that new commitment. If there are no new opportunities that come up other than those that we have in the forecast and we've discussed with you, then we would use those to try to determine whether we would want to rebalance our capital structure. Our comments on our capital structure before, I think have been relatively clear back starting in May of 2010, which is we want a strong balance sheet, we're comfortable with our current credit metrics. If we were to receive proceeds from an asset sale, then we would probably look to rebalance our structure to be consistent with our current structure, and not look to necessarily improve or deteriorate from where we currently are."

One, I think it's right to focus on the second quarter signings, but this is really something that started I'd say later or at least the second half of 2010. We came into this year, in January this year, with 553 megawatts of contracts in hand for 2011 and 2012 wind. That was a very large number for us to have in hand for construction when you kind of look back at our history. In the quarter, we signed another 563 megawatts of wind, so a little higher than what we came into the year with. I've got -- 469 of that was a big chunk in Canada that we were awarded 6 projects at one time. We've been spending time in Canada for now for the last 3 years or so. And we've gotten some success there. So I wouldn't -- we're certainly harping on it, we're very proud of it, we're happy about it, we've been working hard on it. But some of those contracts could have been done in the first quarter as opposed to the second quarter. Some of the ones in the second quarter could have been signed in the third quarter as opposed to the second quarter. I think the bigger focus here is the trend. Really since the second half of 2010, we've been successful in signing long-term agreements up to the point now where we've got over 1,100 megawatts just for '11 and '12 in hand. So I think it's a variety of factors and I've mentioned them before and just spend a couple of minutes on increased loads, where you've got increased economic activity in the U.S. that's leading to increased load, that's a huge positive. The fact that the tax incentives in the U.S. at least at this point and at the end of 2012, I think is also moving people to get something done a little sooner. The economics have improved a little bit. I talked about the cost have come down, the CapEx has come down for these projects. That's helping with the economics. All that, I think when you put it together in addition to the focus that we put on at a senior management level has helped. Your last point on margins, as we continue to look at the margins that we're getting across -- on an average basis, I think both Lew and I have said there are some contracts that we signed that don't meet this criteria. But on an average basis, we are still getting a low double-digit after tax on levered returns. That's what we've said for a number of years we've been getting, and on average we're still there."

We weren't looking to sell them but when someone made an offer, we decided to enter into some negotiations with them. Based on the outcome of those negotiations, we, looking at the accounting rules, believe that we had to look at them for impairment. We did. And 3 of those projects in West Texas were impaired at about $0.05. Our fossil plant up in New England that we have, oil-fired plant. Because of the proposed Toxics Rule from the EPA, we took a look at that plant. We took our best shot at what we believe the final outcome of that rule would be. We wrote that down, there was a couple of another $0.02. And then the other $0.01 is really a variety of matters, including a small 50-megawatt peak that we have up in the Northeast."

So that's -- I would say that most -- you know what, I was going to say fourth quarter. It's probably ratably with one exception and the exceptional just get into a difficult explanation. But it's ratably, and the reason its ratably is because under the accounting rules, the full benefit that you're expecting for the year, you actually have to allocate on a quarterly basis, right. You allocate to each quarter based on what you expect to have of the end of the year and the allocation is actually based on the amount of pretax earnings that you have in each quarter. So if you would have had the same expectation at the beginning of the year for 2010 and 2011, right, you would have said 600 megawatts of CITC for '10 and '11. Then the only difference on the quarterly allocation basis would be the difference in pretax income for each quarter. So last year, I think, we started the year with 600 megawatts of expected CITC, this year we started with I think with 275 megawatts of CITC. The difference of that is $0.07. Assuming no change in pretax earnings allocation between the quarter, let's take that as an assumption, the $0.07 would be ratably allocated throughout the year. The one exception is we talked about White Oak, 150 megawatts in the second quarter, because that was a project financed under differential membership interest or tax equity.

Our strategy of inves",991,"Okay. Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy had strong performance in the second quarter. We grew adjusted earnings per share be approximately 6% over the prior year comparable quarter. Our strategy of investing in clean, renewable and efficient generation continues to drive solid results. We're executing well while continuing to enhance our generation portfolio by weighting it significantly toward regulated and long-term contracted opportunities that should enhance shareholder value.
At Florida Power & Light Company, we had a strong second quarter. Net income was up approximately 14% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Over the quarter, FPL averaged more than 10,000 additional customers than we had in the first 3 months of the year. In Florida, our biggest area of concern remains the difficult employment climate in the state, with an unemployment rate of 10.6% as of June 2011, which gears the depressed national employment market. However, even in a difficult economy, our generation portfolio development pipeline at FPL -- our generation portfolio and our development pipeline at FPL is setting the pace for the industry, providing significant operating efficiencies, sustainable environmental performance and strong customer benefits.
The uprate work at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear facilities in Florida is proceeding. We expect that these investments, which will add about 450 megawatts of clean, reliable, emission-free energy to our portfolio, will save FPL customers about $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion in fuel costs over the life of the plants. We've brought the third unit of our West County Energy Center online, on time and on budget. This unit adds approximately 1,220 megawatts to what is now the nation's largest combined-cycle natural-gas-fired power plant. This facility increases the efficiency of FPL's generation fleet, saves our customers money on fuel and reduces air emissions. 
In June, we moved forward with the construction of the modernized $1.3 billion Riviera Beach Next-Generation Clean Energy Center by demolishing the boilers, the stacks and related equipment at the Riviera Beach plant. If you haven't taken a chance to look at it, there's a nice little clip on YouTube, kind of fun to watch. We expect the modernized plant to come online in 2014. In addition, the modernization of our Cape Canaveral plant is progressing well and is on track to meet its planned 2013 start date. These 2 combined cycle facilities, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion, are expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation, and we estimate that they will provide customers $850 million to $950 million in net savings over the life of the plants.
Now we indicated in FPL's 10-year site plan that we would need to bring new capacity online in 2016 to meet our projected load obligations. Earlier this month, we took an initial step to seek state regulatory approval to modernize the Port Everglades facility. Like West County, Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, we expect a modernized Port Everglades to offer considerable customer benefits through fuel and other savings that exceed the revenue requirements over the life of the project. If it were to come online in 2016 as proposed, the Port Everglades modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and would use about 35% less fuel per megawatt hour and provide customers with more than $400 million in estimated net savings over the life of the plants.
If this project moves forward, our investment in the Port Everglades modernization would make FPL's generation fleet even more efficient. We project a 21% efficiency improvement in our fossil system heat rate from 2001 through 2016, amounting to about $1.3 billion in annual fuel savings in 2016 compared to a 2001 baseline. These investments in Florida Electric Infrastructure also provides a significant benefit to customers in terms of efficiency and reliability. In fact, FPL customers now enjoy 99.98% service reliability.
Now turning to NextEra Energy Resources. Our existing wind fleet produced an additional 766,000 megawatt hours of electricity, or a 13% increase compared to the year-ago comparable quarter, driven primarily by an improved wind resource. In addition, the 909 megawatts of assets that we added during or since the second quarter of 2010 made a positive contribution to results in the second quarter. Challenges in the quarter included the extended refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities as well as impairments of certain assets in West Texas and in the Northeast. While the duration of Seabrook and Point Beach outages was longer than we had anticipated, both facilities are now back online and operating well. A positive outcome of the extended Point Beach outage was that we completed the uprate work on unit 2. We expect the increased output from the units to be more than our earlier estimates of 80 megawatts, and note that all incremental power resulting from the uprate investments will be sold under a long-term contract.
Since our first earning -- first quarter earnings call, we signed long-term power purchase agreements on 632 megawatts of new wind projects. Roughly 469 megawatts of that amount results from the recently signed series of contracts for projects in Ontario, Canada, which we currently expect to be online before the end of 2014. This represents a significant investment and demonstrates our commitment to growing our renewable footprint in Canada supported by long-term contracts. We're excited about the continued prospects from Canada, and with the announcement of these projects, we will be one of the largest owners of wind generation in Canada. Additionally, we have signed a 23-year contract for an average of approximately 50 megawatts of generation from our Seabrook Station nuclear facility.
It's certainly been a good quarter in terms of contracting our future revenue, and I'm proud of the teams that continue to work hard to get this done. With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"

In the second quarter 2011's, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million, or $1.38 per share.

In the second quarter 2011's, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million, or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $500 million and $1.18, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI.
For the second quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $301 million, or $0.72 per share. During the second quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.08 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by rate base growth and returns on clause-related investments, including Martin Solar and the nuclear upgrades. 
As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. We continue to believe that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012, subject to the normal caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.
For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including the fluctuations due to weather. As such, general weather variability is not expected to affect earnings. Also, keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you should expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings.
During the quarter, we recognized $31 million in surplus depreciation and amortization, bringing the total amount recognized during the first 6 months of the year to $131 million. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to amortize between $180 million and $200 million, less than the full amount of the surplus depreciation for the year that is available to us under the base rate agreement. This estimate for 2011 is down from the range of $245 million to $265 million that we provided in our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, largely as a result of the favorable weather experience in the second quarter.
Turning to our customer metrics. The economic recovery in Florida appears to continue to take hold, but the progress is slow and uneven. As a result, some of our key metrics are mixed. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales increased by 2.8%, due primarily to higher weather-related usage and an increase in customers. In the second quarter, cooling degree days were well above normal and higher than the level experienced in the prior year comparable quarter. Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.6%. We continue to look at the overall picture but feel it is too early to have a clear longer-term view on customer usage. 
As depicted in the graph in the upper-right-hand corner, during the second quarter 2011, we had approximately 28,500 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the sixth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. Both of these metrics have improved relative to the same time last year. In fact, the number of inactive meters has declined approximately 5% since the end of last year's second quarter. Regarding the modest sequential increase in inactive meters in June, note that prior to the recession, we experienced strong seasonal patterns that would result in higher levels of inactive meters during the summer months. Although we cannot be certain, it is possible some seasonality may be appearing again after being largely masked by other drivers during the recession. 
The chart at the lower right-hand corner shows weekly unemployment claims in Florida. The chart shows that initial jobless claims are well below the levels reached during the height of the recession. Nevertheless, the downward trend is slow, it's slope is not as steep as we would like to see, and we have seen a small uptick in the data since April. A number of the economic indicators we follow have similar patterns. There have been improvements from the peak of the recession, but progress is slow and, at times, a bit bumpy.
In an effort to continue to support economic development in Florida, we've just created and staffed a new Office of Economic Development to help the governor and local economic development organizations attract businesses to the state. We believe that when businesses thrive and grow, it drives the economy and creates jobs, which benefits all of us. We continue to look for ways to partner with our communities to spur economic development here in Florida. We are the largest investor in the State of Florida, having invested on a cumulative basis approximately $33 billion in infrastructure investments. In the last 5 years alone, that investment total is approximately $12 billion.
Overall, we continue to be positive regarding future developments in Florida and believe we have one of the best utility franchises in the country. Although Florida's economy has not rebounded completely from the recession, we are optimistic that the positive attributes of Florida will drive greater long-term growth over a sustained period as compared to other parts of the country. As such, we continue to make significant investments in our regulated businesses in Florida, which provide both direct benefits for our customers and earnings growth for our shareholders.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since our first quarter 2011 earnings call, we secured approximately 632 megawatts in wind PPAs for new projects, of which roughly 469 megawatts are for Canadian projects we plan to put in service in 2013 and 2014. We were awarded these feed-in tariff contracts earlier this month by the Ontario Power Authority. The opportunity to develop these projects is consistent with our comments over the last several years indicating that we plan to develop more renewable energy in Canada.
During June, we closed the previously announced acquisition of White Oak, a 150-megawatt wind facility in Illinois, and at the same time, we completed the differential membership transaction, often referred to as tax equity by others, relating to the project. This is the fourth differential membership transaction we have completed in the last 15 months. These transactions are attractive as they allow us to allocate the tax attributes of our investments to third-party investors that can more efficiently utilize these benefits.
In essence, these transactions allow us to monetize the tax benefits of our investments in a timelier manner. We will continue to look for opportunities with both our existing portfolio and new investments to structure these tax-benefit-sharing arrangements. 
On the solar front, our 2 primary solar projects, Genesis and Spain, continue to move forward. During the quarter, we were notified by the Department of Energy that our Genesis solar project received conditional approval to receive a loan guarantee from the government. This guarantee would lower the debt financing cost for the project. Our Spain projects are under construction and are progressing well.
Turning to our nuclear portfolio. During the quarter, refueling outages at our Seabrook Station and Point Beach nuclear plants reduced EPS by $0.09, of which approximately $0.045 was due to the extended portions of the refueling outages. The Point Beach outage work included work associated with the upgrade of unit 2. That work consisted of approximately 3 million man hours and produced more than 80 megawatts of additional power. This is the first of 6 planned upgrades at FPL and Energy Resources nuclear units during the next 2 years.
Energy Resources reported second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $239 million, or $0.57 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $159 million, or $0.37 per share.
Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.11 from last year's comparable quarter. These results included a negative $0.08 impact from the previously discussed asset impairment charges. New wind and solar investment contributions increased $0.03 relative to last year as a result of our adding 909 megawatts of wind and solar during or after the second quarter of 2010.
Our estimate for full year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged from the first quarter at roughly 275 megawatts, including the 150 megawatts associated with the differential membership transaction we completed during the quarter. Although the full year earnings impact is roughly the same, under a differential membership transaction, the earnings impact is required to be fully recognized in the period the assets are placed into service as opposed to being allocated ratably throughout the year. In addition, this benefit is reported in operating income as opposed to income taxes. This resulted in a $0.01 increase in contributions from CITC this quarter compared to the prior year comparable quarter. We estimate that the full year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 will be approximately $0.07. 
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.07 per share as compared to the year-ago period, driven primarily by an improved wind resource and lower depreciation expense. These items were partially offset by lower West Texas pricing. The wind resource was approximately 111% of normal, which is an improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter of 96%.
In the merchant portfolio, Seabrook's contribution to earnings decreased $0.09. The refueling outage at Seabrook reduced earnings by $0.07 per share as compared to the prior year, while the remaining $0.02 decrease was largely a result of lower hedge prices, partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. 
In contracted generation, Point Beach contributed a negative $0.01. The refueling outage for unit 2 contributed a negative $0.02, substantially all of which was related to the extended portion of the outage. This was partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. White contributed $0.02 relative to last year due to the improved pricing it receives under the new long-term agreement. The remaining $0.01 of positive contributions from existing assets came from a number of small items, none of which is particularly noteworthy. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses were down $0.01 due to weakness in the full requirements business. Power and gas trading were roughly flat.
Asset sales contributed negative $0.01 from the lack of a gain realized in the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we recognized impairment charges associated with certain assets, totaling $0.08 per share, $0.05 of which is due to an assessment of the fair value of our older wind assets in West Texas as a result of recent market value indications. An additional $0.02 relates to an impairment taken on a 2039-megawatt of oil-fired facilities in Maine as a result of a recently issued proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Finally, $0.01 relates to the impairment of an older 50-megawatt natural gas peaking facility in Pennsylvania as well as some other impairment costs.
All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share, associated with share dilution and higher interest expense due to higher borrowings from the growth of the business. In the appendix of this presentation, we have included the updated hedging disclosure information that we typically provide in our quarterly earnings report. For 2011, equivalent gross margin estimates have been updated to reflect actual performance during the second quarter, including the impact of the extended outages at Seabrook and Point Beach and the impairment charges. We have also reduced our expectations for the power and gas trading businesses. The prevailing lower price and volatility conditions across the power and gas markets have reduced the opportunities we see for these businesses in the near term. In light of this view, we have also reduced our expectations for these businesses in 2012.  All other changes in 2012 were minor. As a reminder, the 2012 slide does not yet include contributions from assets we expect to put in service in 2012. 
Now we would like to turn your attention to our wind and solar development pipelines.  As we have discussed over the last 9 months or so, obtaining long-term contracts on our wind pipeline opportunities has been a priority for us. Our intense focus on contracting assets along with an improving economy, which benefits energy load, and generally better economics is what we believe is driving the improved results we are seeing. In fact, Energy Resources has had plenty of success in 2010 and 2011 by signing 1,823 megawatts of long-term PPAs for new wind projects.
We have signed more long-term PPAs for new wind projects thus far in the first 7 months of 2011 than we did in all of 2010. As we stand today, we now have 1,116 megawatts of long-term contracts for U.S. and Canadian wind projects that we have already put in service in 2011 or plan to put in service in 2011 and 2012. In addition, this month, we were awarded roughly 469 megawatts of contracts with the Ontario Power Authority for assets to be put in service in 2013 and 2014. Together, these projects represent an estimated $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of planned capital expenditures in wind generation in 2011 and 2012 and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion expected to be spent in 2013 and 2014.
We are pleased to get an early start on the 2013 and 2014 pipeline, particularly with projects not dependent on U.S. incentive policies. Although we continue to believe U.S. renewable policies will support wind development beyond 2012, we are pleased with our continued expansion in Canada. In addition to our strong wind development pipeline, we also have our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain, as well as some solar PV projects, in which we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion between 2011 and 2014.
To summarize 2011 second quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.72, Energy Resources contributed $0.37 and Corporate and Other was a $0.09 contribution, for a total $1.18 per share for the current quarter. Corporate and Other increased $0.10 versus the prior year's comparable quarter, primarily due to previously mentioned state tax law changes, partially offset by other tax adjustments.
Before turning the call back over to Lew, I want to reiterate our view that our adjusted EPS for 2011 will likely fall in a range of $4.35 to $4.65. We continue to believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats we provide. Finally, we continue to explore the option of selling the gas-fired generation assets that we mentioned last quarter. The process is moving forward, and we plan to update you further on or before the third quarter call. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

I want to close with some perspective on why we believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth. 
In total, we have a strong backlog of approximately $12 billion of committed growth projects, including the major capital projects under construction at FPL, the contracted wind and solar investments at Energy Resources and the regulated transmission investments at Lone Star Transmission. Of course, our development pipeline includes many other potential projects that we continue to work on. We expect that by 2014, approximately 80% of our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, will come from regulated or long-term contracted businesses.
At FPL, we're executing well in the midst of one of our largest-ever development cycles, which we believe will drive significant savings for our customers. The $5.8 billion in major capital projects under construction includes modernizations of Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, uprates at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear plants and our Energy Smart Florida smart grid project. In addition, as previously discussed, our proposal to modernize the Port Everglades facility would add incremental investment of approximately $1.2 billion through 2016. We expect all of these projects to improve the long-term affordability and reliability of our service to FPL customers.
At Energy Resources, we plan to invest more than $5 billion between 2011 and 2014 in renewable projects, for which we already have long-term contracts. Our wind development pipeline remains robust, and we remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts between 2011 and 2012. As we also discussed today, we have already started to build a pipeline of contracted projects we plan to put into service in 2013 and 2014. In addition to wind, we continue to believe solar is an attractive growth opportunity. We have 415 megawatts of long-term contracts in hand today for projects we plan to put into service between 2011 and 2014. Construction work at our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain Solar, is proceeding well. 
Finally, Lone Star Transmission represents approximately $800 million of capital expenditures that will be rate-regulated in Texas. We expect construction work on Loan Star's credit line to begin later this year and for the line to be energized in 2013. All told, we have a development backlog that we feel confident in executing and that will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders alike. As one of the cleanest energy producers in the country, I believe NextEra Energy is well-positioned for the future in the face of increased federal regulatory activity. We've held ourselves to a higher standards, and in doing so, we are serving our customers well, doing our part for the environment and driving shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

One, I think it's right to focus on the second quarter signings, but this is really something that started, I'd say, later or at least the second half of 2010. We came into this year, in January this year, with 553 megawatts of contracts in hand for 2011 and 2012 wind. That was a very large number for us to have in hand for construction when you kind of look back at our history. In the quarter, we signed another 563 megawatts of wind, so a little higher than what we came into the year with. I've got -- 469 of that was a big chunk in Canada, where we were awarded 6 projects at one time. We've been spending time in Canada for now for the last 3 years or so. And we've gotten some success there. So I wouldn't -- we're certainly harping on it, we're very proud of it, we're happy about it, we've been working hard on it. But some of those contracts could have been done in the first quarter as opposed to the second quarter. Some of the ones in the second quarter could have been signed in the third quarter as opposed to the second quarter. I think the bigger focus here is the trend. Really since the second half of 2010, we have been successful in signing long-term agreements up to the point now where we've got over 1,100 megawatts just for '11 and '12 in hand. So I think it's a variety of factors, and I've mentioned them before.  Let me just spend a couple of minutes on increased load, where you've got increased economic activity in the U.S. that's leading to increased load, that's a huge positive. The fact that the tax incentives in the U.S., at least at this point and at the end of 2012, I think is also moving people to get something done a little sooner. The economics have improved a little bit. I talked about the cost have come down, the CapEx has come down for these projects. That's helping with the economics. All that, I think, when you put it together, in addition to the focus that we put on it at a senior management level, has helped. Your last point on margins, as we continue to look at the margins that we're getting, across -- on an average basis, I think both Lew and I have said there are some contracts that we signed that don't meet this criteria. But on an average basis, we are still getting low double-digit after-tax unlevered returns. That's what we've said for a number of years we've been getting, and on average we're still there."

We weren't looking to sell them, but when someone made an offer, we decided to enter into some negotiations with them. Based on the outcome of those negotiations, we, looking at the accounting rules, believed that we had to look at them for impairment. We did. And 3 of those projects in West Texas were impaired.  That's about $0.05. Our fossil plant up in New England that we have, oil-fired plant. Because of the proposed Toxics Rule from the EPA, we took a look at that plant. We took our best shot at what we believed the final outcome of that rule would be. We wrote that down.  That was a couple of another $0.02.

So that's -- I would say that most -- you know what, I was going to say fourth quarter. It's probably ratably with one exception, and the exception will just get into a difficult explanation. But it's ratably, and the reason it's ratably is because under the accounting rules, the full benefit that you're expecting for the year, you actually have to allocate on a quarterly basis, right?  You allocate to each quarter based on what you expect to have of the end of the year, and the allocation is actually based on the amount of pretax earnings that you have in each quarter. So if you would have had the same expectation at the beginning of the year for 2010 and 2011, right, you would have said 600 megawatts of CITC for '10 and '11, then the only difference on the quarterly allocation basis would be the difference in pretax income for each quarter. So last year, I think we started the year with 600 megawatts of expected CITC.  This year we started, I think, with 275 megawatts of CITC. The difference of that is $0.07. Assuming no change in pretax earnings allocation between the quarter, let's just take that as an assumption, the $0.07 would be ratably allocated throughout the year. The one exception is we talked about White Oak, 150 megawatts, in the second quarter, because that was a project financed under differential membership interest or tax equity. The full benefit of that one actually happened in the second quarter."

On the one hand, if we look at the mandatory renewable generation targets set by the 30-odd states that have in the next 5-year period of fairly rapid growth. But my concern is that, that growth is concentrated in a handful of states that have the most ambitious targets and that meeting those targets may translate into rate increases that could translate into a bit of political backlash against the cost of renewable generation, particularly as the federal tax incentives roll off in 2014. So I was wondering what your medium-term outlook for the growth of U.S. renewable generation is, the opportunities it creates for you, and what are the risks to that outlook?"

And right now, there's some uncertainty as to what happens post-2012 from a federal incentive side -- standpoint on wind.  We feel like in the long term that wind is an important piece of the energy mix in the U.S. and that there's going to be continued support for that. But there's some uncertainty around the short-term impacts, particularly in 2013, if we're watching closely. But in the long term, we're very optimistic about the wind business in the U.S. as well for one of the reasons you talked about, which is the state renewable portfolio standards. So I think we can talk to our own backlog and our own portfolio and, say, we just talked about it today over several billion dollars of wind and solar that we have signed today that we're going to be building between now and the end of 2014.

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that FPO had strong performance in the third quarter and while Energy Resources had a challenging quarter financially, the team executed well on creating tangible growth opportunities for the future. During the quarter, we continued to build a large backlog of future investment investor opportunities at both of our main businesses. Despite the decline in year-over-year financial results at Energy Resources, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be at the low end of our range of $4.35 to $4.65. At Florida Power & Light Company. Earnings per share were up approximately 12% over the prior year comparable quarter due to increased investment in the business. The Florida economy continues to show mixed signs with improvement in some indicators and little change in augers. Florida's unemployment rate was 10.6% as of September 2011. This is 1.1 percentage points below last year's comparable month and represents one of the largest year-over-year decreases in state unemployment rates in the United States. Florida's housing affordability has improved significantly, particularly in FPL score markets. The case index, which track ties price of residential real estate has fallen 50% from its 2006 peak for the Miami-Dade and Palm Beach County markets in South Florida. This makes Florida much more attractive to baby boomers as they enter retirement and the state's existing home sales trend continue to show positive momentum. Over the quarter, FPL averaged 24,000 more customers than we had in the year-ago comparable quarter in our inactive meters have declined 4.4% since the year-ago period. Florida also continues to have a low tax burden and we are encouraged by the efforts of Governor Scott's administration to make the state even more attractive to businesses. At FPL, we continue to make good progress on our large investment program. Our nuclear upgrade work at St. Lucie and Turkey Point continuous. Lastly, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's nuclear cost recovery of $196 million total capacity cost. This amount relates primarily to the cost of nuclear operates, which by themselves are estimated to provide fuel savings to customers of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million over the lives of the plants. The commission determined that FPL's 2009 and 2010 operate costs were prudently incurred and FPL's actual and projected 2011 and 2012 costs are reasonable. Cost recovery for 2009 and 2010 was one of several issues that had been left unresolved by the prior commission. All of the prior unresolved issues have now been resolved. This week, the commission approved the remainder of the clauses for 2012 including fuel conservation and environmental clauses. This approval was reached through stipulation with all parties. During the third quarter, the commission accepted FPL's request for a bid rule exemption regarding the proposed modernization of the Port Everglades facility. And we plan to file a petition for a determination of need for the facility later this month. If the new plant will come online in 2016 as currently proposed, the Port Everglade's modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and is expected to provide net customer benefits of more than 400 million over the life of the plant. In aggregate, FPL's completed and planned investments from 2001 to 2016 are expected to save customers an estimated $1.3 billion in projected fuel costs in 2016 relative to our 2001 baseline. These investments are delivering significant benefits to our customers through operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs. As a result, FPL &L customers are receiving cleaner, more reliable energy for a typical bill that is the lowest in Florida and more than 20% below the national average. Looking forward, we expect that these investments will allow us to keep our this typical residential customer bill among the lowest in the state. On the Energy Resources side of the business, we made great strides in growing our backlog at contracted global energy projects by entering into contracts for approximately 1,100 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity since our second quarter earnings call. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have signed approximately 2,100 megawatts of contracts for new win and solar projects. Now the numbers I just gave you are slightly higher than what are shown on the slides as last night, we entered into a new 100-megawatt win contract, which is not included in the numbers you're seeing on the slides. This year is the most successful contracting the year in Energy Resources history. On the solar development front, we were pleased to announce that we have purchased a 50% ownership interest in 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight pluggable solar project. We believe the addition of Desert Sunlight, which is expected to be one of the world's largest solar PV facilities considerably strengthens our backlog of solar projects. We expect this project will begin operation in 2013 and be at full capacity in 2015. Long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, for new projects have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. I also want to take this opportunity to announce that we are pursuing the necessarily approvals and permits to develop the McCoy solar facility, a 250-megawatt solar PV project located in the Mojave Desert near the Genesis and Desert Sunlight projects. This project, which is expected to reach full commercial operations by 2016 has a long-term contract with Southern California Edison, currently pending approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. This project further enhances the visibility of our longer-term backlog, and we look forward to providing you additional updates on McCoy in the future. McCoy and Desert Sunlight join our solar portfolio alongside our Genesis and Spain solar thermal projects and several other smaller PV projects, increasing our backlog of already contracted solar opportunities to 940 megawatts expected to come into service sometime between 2011 and 2016. We expect these projects will begin contributing meaningfully to cash flow and earnings in 2013. On the wind development front, we had another active quarter and now have long-term PPAs for over 1,400 megawatts of new wind projects to be commissioned in 2011 and 2012, including the contract we signed last night. By 2012, Energy Resources expects to have approximately 10,000 megawatts of operating wind projects that provide all-around attractive upside opportunities. Looking beyond 2012, our current backlog of already contracted wind projects for 2013 and 2014 is 593 megawatts, which includes 469 megawatts of Canadian projects that we talked about last quarter, as well as an additional Canadian project of 124 megawatts that we've previously included in our 2012 backlog that now expect to come online in 2013. As you know, last month, we announced new management rules for Armando Pimentel and Moray Dewhurst. Since Armando was Chief Financial Officer during the third quarter, he will be presenting the company's quarterly financial results today. With that, I will turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"
270586,141952143,185013,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, r",4061,"Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the market or non-qualifying hedge category, description of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI, and exclusion of the impact of the pending sale of Energy Resources ownership interest in a portfolio for natural gas-fired generation assets. The pending sales of these assets resulted in a one-time after-tax charge of approximately $0.23 per share, of which approximately $0.22 was at Energy Resources and $0.01 was at corporate and other due to the consolidated tax impact. These results are still subject to various closing adjustments. Late last month, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in RISEC, a 550-megawatt gas-fired generation assets. The transaction is expected to result in a one-time after-tax charge of less than $0.01 per share subject to final closing adjustments, which the company expects to exclude from fourth quarter in fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings. For the third quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $347 million or $0.83 per share. FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.09 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven almost entirely by the substantial investments we have made in the business, including the nuclear operates in our Martin solar facility. As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity cap. We continue to expect that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide including weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including modest differences from normal weather. Keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you should expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings. But on an annual basis, we expect that retail regulatory return to be approximately 11% in 2011 and 2012. During the quarter, we reversed $47 million of surplus depreciation to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11% in accordance with the settlement agreement. Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $84 million of surplus depreciation amortization. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we now expect to amortize between $160 million and $180 million, down from our previous range of $180 million to $200 million provided on our second quarter earnings call. This revision is largely a result of modestly favorable weather experience in the third quarter. At this point, we expect to utilize between $510 million and $530 million of surplus depreciation in 2012, leaving us at the end of 2012 would be $280 million [ph] and $220 million remaining of the original $895 million established in the last rate case. Although, of course, the exact amount will depend upon a variety of other factors affecting 2012 results including the actual 2012 weather. Some of FPL's key customer metrics continue to show mixed results. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, on a comparable basis, retail kilowatt-hour sales decreased by 2.4% with the average number of customers increasing 0.5%. Although the usage due the weather is down slightly from last year, cooling degree days were 6.9% higher than normal. Non-weather related or underlying usage and all other declined by 1.1%. We continue to analyze customer usage statistics to assess how much of the decline can be attributed to the economic environment and how much is a result of efficiency standards. At this point, we believe each is contributing roughly equally to the decline. There is, however, more work for us to do in this important area. As depicted in graph in the upper right corner, during the third quarter of 2011, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. While the percentage of low usage customers is a flat to last year, inactive accounts declined approximately 4.4% since the end of last year's third quarter. We also want to highlight a recent update from the office of Economic and Demographic Research regarding its population growth outlook for Florida. The chart at the bottom right corner provides annual projected population growth in Florida through 2021. The chart shows population growth rates increasing from 0.6% in 2012 to a peak of 1.5% in 2016 before tapering off slightly. We believe this is a positive indication of long-term potential customer growth. Turning to Florida's economic environment. A number of the indicators we follow have improved since the depth of the recession. The premises been is consistent than we would prefer to see. Both the retail sales Index and the tourism taxable sales are up over the comparable period in 2010. The trailing 12-month average of existing home sales continues to trend positively suggesting the market is moving through the inventory of available homes. We continue to believe Florida offers a unit proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy. All of which should continue to lead to ongoing customer growth for FPL in the future. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $67 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges, net OTTI and the previously announced lost in the 4 [ph] natural gas-fired generation assets held for sale were $204 million or $0.49 per share. Energy Resources' third quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.15 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions decreased $0.06 relative to last year as a result of lower CITC elections and lower state tax credits. Our estimate for full year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged at roughly 275 megawatts compared with approximately 600 megawatts for 2010 projects. We continue to expect the full year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 to be approximately $0.07. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Wind resource in the quarter was 88% relative to normal compared to 99% relative to normal in the prior-year comparable quarter. The weaker wind resource was a primary driver of the negative $0.04 contribution from existing wind assets relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Year-to-date, the wind resource has been at 98% of normal. The Texas gas-fired generation assets contributed $0.02 primarily as a result of extreme hot weather in the York region. In the nuclear asset portfolio, contribution was lower by $0.03 as a result of lower price hedges why Point Beach contributed $0.05 more as a result of decommissioning fund gains, favorable generation and the lack of an outage in this quarter. Our shell gas well drilling program contributed an additional $0.05 compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Customer supply in proprietary trading were down $0.13. This includes lower earnings a retail business of approximately $0.05 attributable to the extreme hot weather in Texas during the month of August and lower contributions from our proprietary trading business of roughly $0.07. As you know, there are 3 main parts to our Texas portfolio. 2 large-combined cycle plants come approximately 1,700 megawatts of hedged wind assets and a position in the competitive retail markets projects through our Texas subsidiary. Normally, we expect warm weather to be good for the gas assets, challenging for Jackson and uncertain for the wind assets. If the wind blows hard, it is good as we have excess capacity to sell. If the wind is weak, it is bad as we have to buy power to cover our hedges. Through most of the quarter, which experienced much warmer than usual weather, our experience was consistent with prior years. However, in August, when the Houston area experienced 22 days of record heat, the negative impact on Gexa increased more rapidly than the favorable impact on the gas plants, which were largely hedged and at the same time, the wind resource was light during the super peak period. As a result, the negative out-way depositors and at the portfolio level, we were down $0.05. After undertaking a thorough, it is clear that we could have reacted more quickly to certain signs we were seeing in the marketplace and reduce this impact. We have made changes as a result and we believe we are now better positioned to avoid the recurrence of this issue. Ironically, however, the same events that cause us pain in the current quarter helped in other ways, as forward curves move up sharply and we were able to hedged at additional volumes for future years and higher prices than we could have done before the heatwave. From a development standpoint, we had a terrific quarter in terms of adding to our backlog of already-contracted solar and wind opportunities as Lew mentioned just a couple of minutes ago. Starting with a solar, since the second quarter, we have added 2 new projects, Desert Sunlight and McCoy. With the addition of these 2 projects, we now expect to be toward the high-end of the plans we laid  out for investors at our May 2010 investor conference to invest between $3 billion and $4 billion in solar opportunities during the 2010 to 2014 timeframe. Including all of the planned solar projects that are already under long-term contract, Energy Resources plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012 and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. We now plan to add roughly 660 megawatts of solar to the portfolio between 2011 and 2014 and plan for an additional roughly 280 megawatts to be brought into service between 2015 and 2016. Turning to our wind business, Energy Resources backlog of tangible intangible opportunities includes plans of spend between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012 and $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. Included in these expectations are the 1,310 megawatts of signed PPAs for projects we plan to put in service in either 2011 or 2012 or 2013 to 2014 backlog includes 593 megawatts Canadian wind projects. These numbers do not include the CapEx associated with the 100-megawatt contract we signed last night, which we expect to complete in 2012. Since this is our first opportunity to talk to you regarding our 2 new large solar projects, we want to provide a short overview of each projects. At the end of September, we acquired 50% ownership in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight solar PV project. construction began in September and interconnection is expected by the end of 2013. Full commercial operations expected in 2015. We plan to elect CITCs for Desert Sunlight as the megawatts go into service at an estimated pace of 150 megawatts in 2013, 90 megawatts in 2014 and 35 megawatts in 2015. The project has 2 long-term PPAs on the full output of the facility, both of which have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Total invested capital for the project is estimated at $2.2 billion, 50% of which represents our subsidiaries, capital obligations. And we will account for the project under the equity method of accounting. Also adding to our solar development backlog, our newest development project, McCoy, is expected to consist of 250 megawatts of solar PV technology. We plan to develop the project so that it reaches full commercial operations in 2016. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately $1 billion. In September, we signed a PPA with the Southern California Edison for the full output of the project, contingent on the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission. This contract will be submitted for the commission's approval by the end of the year and we expect approval in 2012. The McCoy site has further expansion capabilities, which could at least double our current plans. Let's now spend some time to discussing our earnings expectations for the rest of 2011, as well as the next several years. Turning first to the outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our original guidance range of $4.35% to $4.65. This is disappointing. We see what the benefit of hindsight that to reach the upper end of our range would have required contributions from our customer supply and proprietary trading operations that were not likely given how actual market conditions unfolded. And we have not increased and we do not intend to increase our risk exposure from those operations in an effort to make up any shortfall relative to our expectations. Having said that, it is also true that we believe that we could have and should have been at the midpoint of our original range had we executed better. Mistakes in executions are not acceptable to us and we are committed to improving. We have already taken several actions in response to the events of this year. As far as the earnings outlook beyond 2011, we want to give you a bit more detail regarding some factors that are expected to drive results in 2012 and 2013. First, as we have indicated before, we expect that the major driver of our earnings growth over the next several years will be the investments that we continue to make at FPL. We expect these investments to reward our customers with operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs, all while keeping our bills among the lowest in Florida. At Energy Resources, we expect adjusted earnings drivers over the next couple of years to primarily fall into 2 different buckets. First, the significant headwind associated with above market interest will enough, as well as the expiration of PTCs and some increased costs. The second bucket contains a significant earnings contribution attributable to bringing our contract backlog of new solar and wind energy investments to completion. Although both of Energy Resources drivers will affect our adjusted earnings expectations in the next couple of years, we expect the headwinds to be a bit stronger in 2012, while the contributions from new investments are expected to be much stronger in 2013 and beyond. Looking at 2012 specifically, as a result of our rate agreement, FPL's earnings will be primarily based on the amount of rate-based investment it makes. We expect average total rate base in 2012 to be between $24.7 billion and $24.9 billion or approximately 14% higher than in 2011. The growth in total rate base is driven primarily by generation projects that have received prior PSC approval. The variability in FPL's earnings, assuming normal conditions, is expected to fall within a relatively tight range. Because we have the opportunity under the rate agreement, the varity amount the surplus depreciation and amortization we use to achieve an approximate 11% retail regulatory ROE. A Energy Resources, significant headwinds primarily associated with above market hedge roll-offs of roughly $60 million after-tax are expected to affect adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2012. Our expectations for 2012 also includes PPC roll-off and lower state tax benefit, which combine a roughly $75 million after-tax reduction to earnings compared to 2011. In terms of offsetting positive drivers, fewer days of nuclear outages are expected to contribute approximately $60 million after-tax and new asset additions are expected to contribute roughly $70 million after-tax, including higher CITC elections, which are expected to contribute approximately $20 million after-tax, all relative to 2011. We currently estimate that we will elect CITCs an approximately 450 megawatts of wind projects compared to our estimate of 275 megawatts in 2011. There are obviously other puts and takes, but these are the primary drivers we see in 2012. After accounting for all of these effects, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2012 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. Turning to 2013, we expect FPL customer rates in place that will provide an appropriate cash return on the significant capital investments we continue to make. These investments in 2013 are expected to include the completion for our Cape Canaveral combined-cycle project, completion of FPL's nuclear operators at Turkey Point in St. Lucie and the continuing construction of the Riviera Beach next-generation clean energy center. Our customers should greatly benefit from the fuel efficiency and environmental improvements associated with these investments over their useful lives. We expect total average rate base in 2013 to be between $26.4 billion and $26.8 billion or approximately 7% higher than in 2012. In addition, the approximate 320-mile rate regulated transmission line that our Lone Star Transmission subsidiary is building, is expected to be completed in 2013. Our expectations are that when completed, Lone Star will have approximately 800 million of utility rate base in Texas. On this side, we are providing you with a walk of Energy Resources' expected adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2013. The renewable energy investments we plan to commission in 2011, 2012 and 2013 provide significant earnings contributions at Energy Resources through 2013. As you can see from this chart, we expect that the growth in our solar business will contribute between $90 million and $115 million in earnings relative to 2011 with virtually all of these increased earnings coming in 2013. Driving this expected growth of the contributions from our Spain solar projects, the first half of our Genesis solar project and a portion of our Desert Sunlight project. We expect our new wind additions primarily the contributions from the 2011 and 2012 project additions to contribute between $60 million and $75 million during this period. Recall that there will be no CITC earnings for new wind projects in 2013, and that we expect to have roughly $35 million of CITC earnings in 2011. So the $60 million to $75 million range you see here is net of that CITC amount. We also expect price escalators built into a number of our long-term PPAs on our existing assets to contribute approximately $55 million during this period. The tangible growth at Energy Resources that we see through 2013 resulting from this new long-term contract and investments will be partially offset by the expiration of production tax credits, higher costs and unfavorable market pricing from our merchant assets. While we do not have the exposure to merchant prices that many of our peers have, as a result of our largely contracted portfolio, we do have some exposure that shows up here from higher price hedges with will be rolling off during this time period. In fact, from 2011 to 2013, the reduction in Energy Resources gross margin associated with the above market hedge roll-off is expected to be approximately $85 million. As I just pointed out a second ago, roughly $60 million of this $85 million occurs from 2011 to 2012. So there's much less headwind associated with above market hedges rolling off in 2013. Overall, we are currently 92% hedged in 2013 in terms of equivalent gross margin for our existing assets. For your reference, we have included in the appendix to this presentation the 2012 and 2013 hedging slides. On the 2012 slide, you will notice the reduction in our expectations for the proprietary trading business. As part of an effort to align the cost structure of our gas trading operations with our reduced expectations for the business going forward, in the first quarter 2012, we will be relocating the gas trading and scheduling operations from Houston back to our corporate headquarters in Florida. In addition to reducing costs, bringing these operations back to Florida will allow us to better integrate the team and improve leverage across the overall business. On the 2013 slide, note that the new investment line includes both the contributions from the 2012 additions and the 2013 additions that we already have under contract. Please also note that with the pending sale of the 5 natural gas plants, we have tried to simplify and clarify the hedging charts to align better with the primary drivers of commodity price exposure in the different parts of the portfolio. By executing on our tangible backlog to investment opportunities, we expect to be able to grow earnings at Energy Resources even in the face of the headwinds I just described. The combination of FPL, Lone Star Transmission and Energy Resources investments offset by the headwinds I've described for the period are expected to result in significant adjusted earnings growth in 2013 over 2012. Turning to 2014, in addition to a full year contributions from the 2013 Energy Resources investments I just discussed, 2014 is also expected to add the second half of our Genesis solar project, 90 megawatts of Desert Sunlight and contributions from our Canadian wind projects that we plan to put in service between 2013 and 2014. Also, the headwinds from the roll-off of above market hedges are not present in 2014. In fact, we currently expect gross margin on our merchant assets to be up in 2014 compared to 2013. Our 2014 merchant assets gross margin is roughly 70% hedged. In addition to the contributions from Energy Resources, rate base growth at FPL is expected to be approximately 3% from 2013 to 2014. All of the investments we are making at FPL and Energy Resources are expected to meaningfully increase cash flow from operations beginning in 2013. We expect that in 2013, cash flow from operations will cover capital expenditures. And in 2014, we currently expected cash flow from operations to exceed capital expenditures and expected dividends, assuming we do not add any additional projects to our current backlog. In 2014, we expect consolidated cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.5 billion, which would be an increase of over 35% from our consolidated expectations in 2011. Based on our current cash flow expectations and asset further new investment opportunities, we would, therefore, expect to be in a position to return some capital to shareholders in 2013 and 2014. We continue to believe that maintaining our strong balance sheet and capital structure is an important differentiator for us and is added to our competitiveness at critical times over the past decade. As such, we plan to maintain this balance sheet strength in our credit metrics as we go forward. Of course, we will always look for additional opportunities to deploy capital into new investment that we would expect to produce additional value for our shareholders while maintaining our capital structure. On a net basis from now to 2014, we expect that outstanding shares may decline slightly relative to 2011. Today, we have given you additional information to help you better understand the adjusted earnings drivers for our business over the next couple of years. In addition to the specific guidance ranges for 2011 and 2012, we have provided additional color on the expected adjusted earnings drivers for 2013 and 2014. In summary, we continue to believe that our adjusted earnings per share will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65 in 2014, subject to all the usual caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions. Before turning the call back to Lew, I wanted to take a quick moment to thank all of you, the analysts and investors, with whom I have worked over the last few years while I was the CFO of NextEra Energy. I look forward to continuing to interact with you in my new role at Energy Resources. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

To close, let me just say that while we're not satisfied with the financial results this year at Energy Resources, we remain very positive about our outlook for the future. During my tenure as CEO, we have never before enjoyed the position, which so much of our future is represented by projects from our current backlog with high visibility and a clear path to completion. Altogether, our backlogs totaled almost $20 billion of capital investments across FPL, Energy Resources and Lone Star. Our growth for the next few years will be driven primarily by growth toward at power light where our investments are fundamentally substituting capital for fuel and, thereby making our delivery system more efficient. We already have what we believe is the customer value proposition in Florida, combining the lowest bills in the state with top quartile reliability, award-winning customer service and the risk mitigation that comes for our clean emissions profile and we're working hard to improve this. Our investment will mean real benefits for our customers in the form of lower bill, lower fuel bills, which means total bills will need to rise very little even in nominal terms and will likely continue to decline in real terms. As a result, we believe we should be able to earn a fair rate of return on the capital we are in investing the business. This will lead to strong growth and contributions to earnings per share. While the outlook for FPL is a fairly consistent growth, at Energy Resources, we first need to fight through the effects of some headwinds most notably, the impact of the decline in power and gas prices that has occurred over the last few years and which will somewhat mask the positive impact of the strong growth in new business through the end of next year. Nevertheless, Energy Resources has a bright and highly visible future path to grow through 2014 in the form of continued investment in new wind and solar projects. And at the same time, the mix of Energy Resources businesses will continue to shift toward long-term contracted projects thus improving the overall risk profile. Combining all of these, we continue to believe we can grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65. We can -- we believe we can do so even after conservatively assuming no U.S. wind additions in 2013 or 2014. Yet we firmly believe we will find additional growth opportunities in the years ahead behind those we have currently identified and we will be working very hard to do so. Notwithstanding the short-term uncertainties related to renewable energy policy, we believe that U.S. Renewable Energy policies will continue to be supportive of future investments over the long haul. We understand that we have much work to do to execute effectively against our extensive backlog of projects and that is of our immediate focus. But will continue to seek ways to deploy new capital at attractive returns to build long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

As far as what we see happening right now, we don't have -- we don't even have a mirky crystal ball, a clear crystal ball on this. You all read the papers and between the U.S. deficit situation and some of the partisan politics, it's hard to say where things are going to go in the short term. Although I will note, Bill has just been introduced in Congress to extend wind PTCs to 2016, which is the same period of time where the solar PTCs expire. But historically, renewables have received strong by-partisan and I think renewables are going to be an important part of our energy mix going forward. And the other thing that I will add as I think you all have seen now over the years, the cost for renewables, wind and solar especially, continues to come down. And so they are becoming more and more competitive. So it's proof that these incentives have worked in terms of making renewables much more cost effective. So it's hard to predict what's going to happen very short term. I'm pleased that we're in a position that we can give guidance out through 2014 but doesn't rely on any changes to U.S. energy policy. But again as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, I see over the long haul, that they would have continued support of look for renewables and renewables are going to be a viable business."

As if it Armando said and I said, we're going to continue to look for other opportunities if you look at our track record of finding other opportunities, I think it's a pretty darn good bet that we will have other opportunities. But for a financial forecast, you have to make some kind of assumption at this point. We never like to assume that things we don't know about and so I think that provides sort of a baseline kind of forecast. For sure, we're not going to go in investing things that are dilutive or highly dilutive so if we find new investments, they've got to have a better economic proposition than what you're seeing in the numbers we've just laid out.

That's the first big driver. The second big driver's $800 million of rate base in our Texas utility or transmission utility, Lone Star. and the next big driver, which we laid out really on 19 and we laid it out from '11 to '13 but it's really the Energy Resources solar projects, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So you've got first half in Genesis, you've got Spain Solar, you've got Desert Sunlight and you've got a whole bunch of wind that you're putting in, primarily in '12 as opposed to '11. And those wind projects that are going in, in '12 will have a full year of operations in 2013. When you put all that together, that accounts for the big driver from '12 to '13. The other piece that we shouldn't forget I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a -- at Energy Resources, a significant amount of headwinds from the roll off of above market hedges from 2011 to 2012. So if you look at Slide 19, and you look at the merchant pricing down of $85 million from '11 to '13, 60 of that is actually from '11 to '12. As so you have much less headwinds in 2013. Now I'm just going to make this comment because you also add merchant in there. On the merchant side of the business, our merchant gross margin at this point is not fully locked up but even in 2014, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got 70% of that margin in 2014 locked up. And in 2013, if you look at the new slide that's in the appendix, we've got 86% of that gross margin currently hedged. So we feel fairly comfortable that there will be a big up in adjusted earnings per share. Assuming we can execute on our plans.

I'm pleased to report that FPL had strong performance in the third quarter and while Energy Resources had a challenging quarter financially, the team executed well on creating tangible growth opportuni",1159,"Okay. Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that FPL had strong performance in the third quarter and while Energy Resources had a challenging quarter financially, the team executed well on creating tangible growth opportunities for the future. During the quarter, we continued to build a large backlog of future investment opportunities at both of our main businesses. Despite the decline in year-over-year financial results at Energy Resources, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be at the low end of our range of $4.35 to $4.65. 
At Florida Power & Light Company, earnings per share were up approximately 12% over the prior year comparable quarter due to increased investment in the business. The Florida economy continues to show mixed signs with improvement in some indicators and little change in others. Florida's unemployment rate was 10.6% as of September 2011. This is 1.1 percentage points below last year's comparable month, and represents one of the largest year-over-year decreases in state unemployment rates in the United States. Florida's housing affordability has improved significantly, particularly in FPL score markets. The Case-Shiller index, which tracks the prices of residential real estate has fallen 50% from its 2006 peak for the Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County markets in South Florida. This makes Florida much more attractive to baby boomers as they enter retirement, and the state's existing home sales trend continue to show positive momentum. 
Over the quarter, FPL averaged 24,000 more customers than we had in the year-ago comparable quarter, and our inactive meters have declined 4.4% since the year-ago period. Florida also continues to have a low tax burden, and we are encouraged by the efforts of Governor Scott's administration to make the state even more attractive to businesses. 
At FPL, we continue to make good progress on our large investment program. Our nuclear uprate work at St. Lucie and Turkey Point continues. Last week, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's nuclear cost recovery of $196 million through the capacity clause. This amount relates primarily to the cost of nuclear uprates, which by themselves are estimated to provide fuel savings to customers of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million over the lives of the plants. The commission determined that FPL's 2009 and 2010 uprate costs were prudently incurred, and FPL's actual and projected 2011 and 2012 costs are reasonable. Cost recovery for 2009 and 2010 was one of several issues that had been left unresolved by the prior commission. All of the prior unresolved issues have now been resolved. This week, the commission approved the remainder of the clauses for 2012 including fuel conservation and environmental clauses. This approval was reached through stipulation with all parties. 
During the third quarter, the commission accepted FPL's request for a bid rule exemption regarding the proposed modernization of the Port Everglades facility. And we plan to file a petition for a determination of need for the facility later this month. If the new plant were to come online in 2016 as currently proposed, the Port Everglade's modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and is expected to provide net customer benefits of more than 400 million over the life of the plant. 
In aggregate, FPL's completed and planned investments from 2001 to 2016 are expected to save customers an estimated $1.3 billion in projected fuel costs in 2016 relative to our 2001 baseline. These investments are delivering significant benefits to our customers through operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs. As a result, FPL customers are receiving cleaner, more reliable energy for a typical bill that is the lowest in Florida and more than 20% below the national average. Looking forward, we expect that these investments will allow us to keep our typical residential customer bill among the lowest in the state. 
On the Energy Resources side of the business, we made great strides in growing our backlog of contracted renewable energy projects by entering into contracts for approximately 1,100 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity since our second quarter earnings call. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have signed approximately 2,100 megawatts of contracts per new wind and solar projects. Now the numbers I just gave you are slightly higher than what are shown on the slides as last night, we entered into a new 100-megawatt win contract, which is not included in the numbers you're seeing on the slides. This year is the most successful contracting the year in Energy Resources' history. 
On the solar development front, we were pleased to announce that we have purchased a 50% ownership interest in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight photovoltaic solar project. We believe the addition of Desert Sunlight, which is expected to be one of the world's largest solar PV facilities considerably strengthens our backlog of solar projects. We expect this project will begin operation in 2013 and be at full capacity in 2015. Long-term power purchase agreements or PPAs for the project have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
I also want to take this opportunity to announce that we are pursuing the necessary approvals and permits to develop the McCoy solar facility, a 250-megawatt solar PV project located in the Mojave Desert near the Genesis and Desert Sunlight projects. This project, which is expected to reach full commercial operations by 2016 has a long-term contract with Southern California Edison, currently pending approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. This project further enhances the visibility of our longer-term backlog, and we look forward to providing you additional updates on McCoy in the future. McCoy and Desert Sunlight join our solar portfolio alongside our Genesis and Spain solar thermal projects and several other smaller PV projects, increasing our backlog of already contracted solar opportunities to 940 megawatts expected to come into service sometime between 2011 and 2016. We expect these projects will begin contributing meaningfully to cash flow and earnings in 2013. 
On the wind development front, we had another active quarter and now have long-term PPAs for over 1,400 megawatts of new wind projects to be commissioned in 2011 and 2012, including the contract we signed last night. By 2012, Energy Resources expects to have approximately 10,000 megawatts of operating wind projects that provide all-around attractive upside opportunities. Looking beyond 2012, our current backlog of already contracted wind projects for 2013 and 2014 is 593 megawatts, which includes 469 megawatts of Canadian projects that we talked about last quarter, as well as an additional Canadian project of 124 megawatts that we have previously included in our 2012 backlog but now expect to come online in 2013. 
As you know, last month, we announced new management rules for Armando Pimentel and Moray Dewhurst. Since Armando was Chief Financial Officer during the third quarter, he will be presenting the company's quarterly financial results today. With that, I will turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"
270586,141952143,185175,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, r",4075,"Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the market or non-qualifying hedge category, the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI, and exclusion of the impact of the pending sale of Energy Resources ownership interest in a portfolio for natural gas-fired generation assets. The pending sale of these assets resulted in a onetime after-tax charge of approximately $0.23 per share, of which approximately $0.22 was at Energy Resources and $0.01 was at corporate and other due to the consolidated tax impact. These results are still subject to various closing adjustments. 
Late last month, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in RIEC, a 550-megawatt gas-fired generation asset. The transaction is expected to result in a onetime after-tax charge of less than $0.01 per share subject to final closing adjustments, which the company expects to exclude from fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings. 
For the third quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $347 million or $0.83 per share. FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.09 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter driven almost entirely by the substantial investments we have made in the business, including the nuclear uprates in our Martin solar facility. As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity cap. We continue to expect that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide, including weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including modest differences from normal weather. Keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you should expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings. But on an annual basis, we expect that retail regulatory return to be approximately 11% in 2011 and 2012. 
During the quarter, we reversed $47 million of surplus depreciation to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11% in accordance with the settlement agreement. Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $84 million of surplus depreciation amortization. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we now expect to amortize between $160 million and $180 million, down from our previous range of $180 million to $200 million provided on our second quarter earnings call. This revision is largely a result of modestly favorable weather experienced in the third quarter. At this point, we expect to utilize between $510 million and $530 million of surplus depreciation in 2012, leaving us at the end of 2012 with between $180 million and $220 million remaining of the original $895 million established in the last rate case. Although, of course, the exact amount will depend upon a variety of other factors affecting 2012 results including the actual 2012 weather. 
Some of FPL's key customer metrics continue to show mixed results. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, on a comparable basis, retail kilowatt-hour sales decreased by 2.4% with the average number of customers increasing 0.5%. Although the usage due to weathers down slightly from last year, cooling degree days were 6.9% higher than normal. Non-weather related or underlying usage and all other declined by 1.1%. We continue to analyze customer usage statistics to assess how much of the decline can be attributed to the economic environment, and how much is the result of mandated efficiency standards. At this point, we believe each is contributing roughly equally to the decline. There is, however, more work for us to do in this important area. As depicted in the graph in the upper right corner, during the third quarter of 2011, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. While the percentage of low usage customers is a flat to last year, inactive accounts declined approximately 4.4% since the end of last year's third quarter. We also want to highlight a recent update from the office of Economic and Demographic Research regarding its population growth outlook for Florida. The chart at the bottom right corner provides annual projected population growth in Florida through 2021. The chart shows population growth rates increasing from 0.6% in 2012 to a peak of 1.5% in 2016 before tapering off slightly. We believe this is a positive indication of long-term potential customer growth. 
Turning to Florida's economic environment. A number of the indicators we follow have improved since the depth of the recession, but progress has been less consistent than we would prefer to see. Both the retail sales index and the tourism taxable sales are up over the comparable period in 2010. The trailing 12-month average of existing home sales continues to trend positively, suggesting the market is moving through the inventory of available homes. We continue to believe Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy. All of which should continue to lead to ongoing customer growth for FPL in the future. 
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $67 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges, net OTTI and the previously announced loss in the 4 natural gas-fired generation assets held for sale, were $204 million or $0.49 per share. 
Energy Resources' third quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.15 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions decreased $0.06 relative to last year as a result of lower CITC elections and lower state tax credits. Our estimate for full year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged at roughly 275 megawatts compared with approximately 600 megawatts for 2010 projects. We continue to expect the full year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 to be approximately $0.07. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Wind resource in the quarter was 88% relative to normal compared to 99% relative to normal in the prior year comparable quarter. The weaker wind resource was the primary driver of the negative $0.04 contribution from existing wind assets relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Year-to-date, the wind resource has been at 98% of normal. The Texas gas-fired generation assets contributed $0.02 primarily as a result of extreme hot weather in the Eureka region. 
In the nuclear asset portfolio, Seabrook's contribution was lower by $0.03 as a result of lower price hedges while Point Beach contributed $0.05 more as a result of decommissioning fund gains, favorable generation and the lack of an outage in this quarter. 
Our shale gas well drilling program contributed an additional $0.05 compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Customer supply in proprietary trading were down $0.13. This includes lower earnings at Gexa, our retail business, of approximately $0.05 attributable to the extreme hot weather in Texas during the month of August, and lower contributions from our proprietary trading business of roughly $0.07. 
As you know, there are 3 main parts to our Texas portfolio: two large-combined cycle plants, approximately 1,700 megawatts of hedged wind assets and a position in a competitive retail market through our Gexa subsidiary. Normally, we expect warm weather to be good for the gas assets, challenging for Gexa and uncertain for the wind assets. If the wind blows hard, it is good as we have excess capacity to sell. If the wind is weak, it is bad as we have to buy power to cover our hedges. Through most of the quarter, which experienced much warmer than usual weather, our experience was consistent with prior years. However, in August, when the Houston area experienced 22 days of record heat, the negative impact on Gexa increased more rapidly than the favorable impact on the gas plants, which were largely hedged and at the same time, the wind resource was light during the super peak period. As a result, the negative out-weighed depositors and at the portfolio level, we were down $0.05. 
After undertaking a thorough, it is clear that we could have reacted more quickly to certain signs we were seeing in the marketplace and reduced this impact. We have made changes as a result, and we believe we are now better positioned to avoid the recurrence of this issue. Ironically, however, the same events that caused us pain in the current quarter helped in other ways as forward curves moved up sharply and we were able to hedge out additional volumes for future years and higher prices than we could have done before the heatwave. 
From a development standpoint, we had a terrific quarter in terms of adding to our backlog of already contracted solar and wind opportunities, as Lew mentioned, just a couple of minutes ago. Starting with a solar, since the second quarter, we have added 2 new projects: Desert Sunlight and McCoy. With the addition of these 2 projects, we now expect to be toward the high-end of the plans we laid out for investors at our May 2010 investor conference to invest between $3 billion and $4 billion in solar opportunities during the 2010 to 2014 timeframe. Including all of the planned solar projects that are already under long-term contract, Energy Resources plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012, and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. We now plan to add roughly 660 megawatts of solar to the portfolio between 2011 and 2014, and plan for an additional roughly 280 megawatts to be brought into service between 2015 and 2016. 
Turning to our wind business. Energy Resources' backlog of tangible investment opportunities includes plans to spend between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012, and $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. Included in these expectations are the 1,310 megawatts of signed PPAs for projects we plan to put in service in either 2011 or 2012, our 2013 to 2014 backlog includes 593 megawatts Canadian wind projects. These numbers do not include the CapEx associated with the 100-megawatt contract we signed last night, which we expect to complete in 2012. 
Since this is our first opportunity to talk to you regarding our 2 new large solar projects, we want to provide a short overview of each projects. At the end of September, we acquired 50% ownership in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight solar PV project. construction began in September and interconnection is expected by the end of 2013. Full commercial operation is expected in 2015. We plan to elect CITCs for Desert Sunlight as the megawatts go into service at an estimated pace of 150 megawatts in 2013, 90 megawatts in 2014 and 35 megawatts in 2015. The project has 2 long-term PPAs on the full output of the facility, both of which have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Total invested capital for the project is estimated at $2.2 billion, 50% of which represents our subsidiaries' capital obligations, and we will account for the project under the equity method of accounting. 
Also adding to our solar development backlog, our newest development project, McCoy, is expected to consist of 250 megawatts of solar PV technology. We plan to develop the project so that it reaches full commercial operations in 2016. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately $1 billion. In September, we signed a PPA with the Southern California Edison for the full output of the project, contingent on the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission. This contract will be submitted for the commission's approval by the end of the year, and we expect approval in 2012. The McCoy site has further expansion capabilities, which could at least double our current plans. 
Let's now spend some time to discussing our earnings expectations for the rest of 2011, as well as the next several years. Turning first to the outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our original guidance range of $4.35% to $4.65. This is disappointing. We see with the benefit of hindsight that to reach the upper end of our range would have required contributions from our customer supply and proprietary trading operations that were not likely given how actual market conditions unfolded. And we have not increased and we do not intend to increase our risk exposure from those operations in an effort to make up any shortfall relative to our expectations. Having said that, it is also true that we believe that we could have and should have been at the midpoint of our original range had we executed better. Mistakes in execution are not acceptable to us and we are committed to improving. We have already taken several actions in response to the events of this year. 
As far as the earnings outlook beyond 2011, we want to give you a bit more detail regarding some factors that are expected to drive results in 2012 and 2013. First, as we have indicated before, we expect that the major driver of our earnings growth over the next several years will be the investments that we continue to make at FPL. We expect these investments to reward our customers with operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs, all while keeping our bills among the lowest in Florida. 
At Energy Resources, we expect the adjusted earnings drivers over the next couple of years to primarily fall into 2 different buckets. First, there are significant headwind associated with above market hedges rolling off, as well as the expiration of PTCs and some increased costs. The second bucket contains the significant earnings contributions attributable to bringing our contract backlog of new solar and wind energy investments to completion. Although both of Energy Resources drivers will affect our adjusted earnings expectations in the next couple of years, we expect the headwinds to be a bit stronger in 2012 while the contributions from new investments are expected to be much stronger in 2013 and beyond. 
Looking at 2012 specifically, as a result of our rate agreement, FPL's earnings will be primarily based on the amount of rate base investment it makes. We expect average total rate base in 2012 to be between $24.7 billion and $24.9 billion or approximately 14% higher than in 2011. The growth in total rate base is driven primarily by generation projects that have received prior PSC approval. The variability in FPL's earnings, assuming normal conditions, is expected to fall within a relatively tight range because we have the opportunity under the rate agreement to vary the amount of surplus depreciation amortization we use to achieve an approximate 11% retail regulatory ROE. 
At Energy Resources, significant headwinds primarily associated with above market hedge roll-offs of roughly $60 million after-tax are expected to affect adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2012. Our expectations for 2012 also include PTC roll-off and lower state tax benefit, which combined a roughly $75 million after-tax reduction to earnings compared to 2011. 
In terms of offsetting positive drivers, fewer days of nuclear outages are expected to contribute approximately $60 million after-tax and new asset additions are expected to contribute roughly $70 million after-tax including higher CITC elections, which are expected to contribute approximately $20 million after-tax, all relative to 2011. We currently estimate that we will elect CITCs at approximately 450 megawatts of wind projects compared to our estimate of 275 megawatts in 2011. There are obviously other puts and takes, but these are the primary drivers we see in 2012. After accounting for all of these effects, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2012 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. 
Turning to 2013, we expect the FPL to have customer rates in place that will provide an appropriate cash return on the significant capital investments we continue to make. These investments in 2013 are expected to include the completion for our Cape Canaveral combined cycle project, completion of FPL's nuclear uprates at Turkey Point and St. Lucie, and the continuing construction of the Riviera Beach next generation clean energy center. 
Our customers should greatly benefit from the fuel efficiency and environmental improvements associated with these investments over their useful lives. We expect total average rate base in 2013 to be between $26.4 billion and $26.8 billion or approximately 7% higher than in 2012. In addition, the approximately 320-mile rate regulated transmission line that our Lone Star Transmission subsidiary is building, is expected to be completed in 2013. Our expectations are that when completed, Lone Star will have approximately 800 million of utility rate base in Texas. 
On this slide, we are providing you with a walk of Energy Resources' expected adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2013. The renewable energy investments we plan to commission in 2011, 2012 and 2013 provide significant earnings contributions at Energy Resources through 2013. As you can see from this chart, we expect that the growth in our solar business will contribute between $90 million and $115 million in earnings relative to 2011, with virtually all of these increased earnings coming in 2013. Driving this expected growth are the contributions from our Spain solar projects, the first half of our Genesis solar project and a portion of our Desert Sunlight project. 
We expect our new wind additions, primarily the contributions from the 2011 and 2012 project additions, to contribute between $60 million and $75 million during this period. Recall that there will be no CITC earnings for new wind projects in 2013, and that we expect to have roughly $35 million of CITC earnings in 2011 so the $60 million to $75 million range you see here is net of that CITC amount. We also expect price escalators built into a number of our long-term PPAs on our existing assets to contribute approximately $55 million during this period. The tangible growth at Energy Resources that we see through 2013 resulting from these new long-term contract and investments will be partially offset by the expiration of production tax credits, higher costs and unfavorable market pricing from our merchant assets. 
While we do not have the exposure to merchant prices that many of our peers have, as a result of our largely contracted portfolio, we do have some exposure that shows up here from higher price hedges that will be rolling off during this time period. In fact, from 2011 to 2013, the reduction in Energy Resources' gross margin associated with above market hedge roll-off is expected to be approximately $85 million. As I just pointed out a second ago, roughly $60 million of this $85 million occurs from 2011 to 2012, so there's much less headwind associated with above market hedges rolling off in 2013. Overall, we are currently 92% hedged in 2013 in terms of equivalent gross margin for our existing assets. For your reference, we have included in the appendix to this presentation the 2012 and 2013 hedging slides. 
On the 2012 slide, you will notice the reduction in our expectations for the proprietary trading business. As part of an effort to align the cost structure of our gas trading operations with our reduced expectations for the business going forward, in the first quarter 2012, we will be relocating the gas trading and scheduling operations from Houston back to our corporate headquarters in Florida. In addition to reducing costs, bringing these operations back to Florida will allow us to better integrate the teams and improve leverage across the overall business. 
On the 2013 slide, note that the new investment line includes both the contributions from the 2012 additions and the 2013 additions that we already have under contract. Please also note that with the pending sale of the 5 natural gas plants, we have tried to simplify and clarify the hedging charts to align better with the primary drivers of commodity price exposure in the different parts of the portfolio. By executing on our tangible backlog to investment opportunities, we expect to be able to grow earnings at Energy Resources even in the face of the headwinds I have just described. The combination of FPL, Lone Star Transmission and Energy Resources investments offset by the headwinds I've described for the period are expected to result in significant adjusted earnings growth in 2013 over 2012. 
Turning to 2014. In addition to a full year of contributions from the 2013 Energy Resources investments I just discussed, 2014 is also expected to add the second half of our Genesis solar project, 90 megawatts of Desert Sunlight and contributions from our Canadian wind projects that we plan to put in service between 2013 and 2014. Also, the headwinds from the roll-off of above market hedges are not present in 2014. In fact, we currently expect gross margin on our merchant assets to be up in 2014 compared to 2013. Our 2014 merchant assets gross margin is roughly 70% hedged. In addition to the contributions from Energy Resources, rate base growth at FPL is expected to be approximately 3% from 2013 to 2014. All of the investments we are making at FPL and Energy Resources are expected to meaningfully increase cash flow from operations beginning in 2013. We expect that in 2013, cash flow from operations will cover capital expenditures. And in 2014, we currently expect cash flow from operations to exceed capital expenditures and expected dividends, assuming we do not add any additional projects to our current backlog. 
In 2014, we expect consolidated cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.5 billion, which would be an increase of over 35% from our consolidated expectations in 2011. Based on our current cash flow expectations and asset further new investment opportunities, we would therefore expect to be in a position to return some capital to shareholders in 2013 and 2014. We continue to believe that maintaining our strong balance sheet and capital structure is an important differentiator for us, and has added to our competitiveness at critical times over the past decade. As such, we plan to maintain this balance sheet strength in our credit metrics as we go forward. Of course, we will always look for additional opportunities to deploy capital into new investments that we would expect to produce additional value for our shareholders while maintaining our capital structure. 
On a net basis from now through 2014, we expect that outstanding shares may decline slightly relative to 2011. Today, we have given you additional information to help you better understand the adjusted earnings drivers for our business over the next couple of years. In addition to the specific guidance ranges for 2011 and 2012, we have provided additional color on the expected adjusted earnings drivers for 2013 and 2014. 
In summary, we continue to believe that our adjusted earnings per share will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65 in 2014 subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. 
Before turning the call back to Lew, I wanted to take a quick moment to thank all of you, the analysts and investors, with whom I have worked over the last few years while I was the CFO of NextEra Energy. I look forward to continuing to interact with you in my new role at Energy Resources. 
With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."

To close, let me just say that while we're not satisfied with the financial results this year at Energy Resources, we remain very positive about our outlook for the future. During my tenure as CEO, we have never before enjoyed the position with so much of our future is represented by projects from our current backlog with high visibility and a clear path to completion. Altogether, our backlogs total almost $20 billion of capital investments across FPL, Energy Resources and Lone Star. Our growth for the next few years will be driven primarily by growth at Florida Power & Light, where our investments are fundamentally substituting capital for fuel and thereby making our delivery system more efficient. We already have what we believe is the customer value proposition in Florida, combining the lowest bills in the state with top quartile reliability, award-winning customer service and the risk mitigation that comes for our clean emissions profile and we're working hard to improve this. Our investments will mean real benefits for our customers in the form of lower bill -- lower fuel bills, which means total bills will need to rise very little even in nominal terms and will likely continue to decline in real terms. As a result, we believe we should be able to earn a fair rate of return on the capital we are in investing the business. This will lead to strong growth and contributions to earnings per share. 
While the outlook for FPL is for fairly consistent growth, at Energy Resources, we first need to fight through the effects of some headwinds, most notably the impact of the decline in power and gas prices that has occurred over the last few years and which will somewhat mask the positive impact of the strong growth in new business through the end of next year. Nevertheless, Energy Resources has a bright and highly visible future path to grow through 2014 in the form of continued investment in new wind and solar projects. And at the same time, the mix of Energy Resources businesses will continue to shift toward long-term contracted projects, thus improving the overall risk profile. Combining all of these, we continue to believe we can grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65. We can -- we believe we can do so even after conservatively assuming no U.S. wind additions in 2013 or 2014. Yet we firmly believe we will find additional growth opportunities in the years ahead beyond those we have currently identified, and we will be working very hard to do so. 
Notwithstanding the short-term uncertainties related to renewable energy policy, we believe that U.S. Renewable Energy policies will continue to be supportive of future investments over the long haul. We understand that we have much work to do to execute effectively against our extensive backlog of projects, and that is of our immediate focus. But we will continue to seek ways to deploy new capital at attractive returns to build long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

As far as what we see happening right now, we don't have -- we don't even have a murky crystal ball or a clear crystal ball on this. You all read the papers and between the U.S. deficit situation and some of the partisan politics, it's hard to say where things are going to go in the short term. Although I will note, Bill has just been introduced in Congress to extend wind PTCs to 2016, which is the same period of time where the solar PTCs expire. But historically, renewables have received strong by-partisan support and I think it will -- renewables are going to be an important part of our energy mix going forward. And the other thing that I will add is, as I think you all have seen now, over the years, the cost for renewables, wind and solar, especially, continues to come down. And so they are becoming more and more competitive. So it's proof that these incentives have worked in terms of making renewables much more cost effective. So it's hard to predict what's going to happen very short term. I'm pleased that we're in a position that we can give guidance out through 2014 that doesn't rely on any changes to U.S. energy policy. But again, as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, I see over the long haul that we will have continued support for renewables and renewables are going to be a viable business."

As I think Armando said and I said, we're going to continue to look for other opportunities if you look at our track record of finding other opportunities, I think it's a pretty darn good bet that we will have other opportunities. But for a financial forecast, you have to make some kind of assumption at this point. We never like to assume things that we don't know about, and so I think that provides sort of a baseline kind of forecast. For sure, we're not going to go and invest in things that are dilutive or highly dilutive. So if we find new investments, they've got to have a better economic proposition than what you're seeing in the numbers we've just laid out. So I can assure you, my request to the team and the things that they're going to be incentivized on are to execute well on the projects that we've talked about, but also to keep the nose to the grindstone, if you will, in coming up with attractive investment opportunities."

So you've got first half at Genesis, you've got Spain Solar, you've got Desert Sunlight and you've got a whole bunch of wind that you're putting in, primarily in '12 as opposed to '11. And those wind projects that are going in, in '12 will have a full year of operations in 2013. When you put all that together, that accounts for the big driver from '12 to '13. The other piece that we shouldn't forget I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a -- at Energy Resources, a significant amount of headwinds from the roll-off of above market hedges from 2011 to 2012. So if you look at Slide 19, and you look at the merchant pricing down of $85 million from '11 to '13, 60 of that is actually from '11 to '12. And so you have much less headwinds in 2013. Now I'm going just make this comment because we also had merchant in there. On the merchant side of the business, our merchant gross margin at this point is not fully locked up. But even in 2014, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got 70% of that margin in 2014 locked up. And in 2013, if you look at the new slide that's in the appendix, we've got 86% of that gross margin currently hedged. So we feel fairly comfortable that there will be a big up in adjusted earnings per share assuming we can execute on our plans. But if we execute on our plans, there should be a pretty big up in adjusted EPS from 2012 to 2013."

So the O&M increase that you see on slide which I think is part of your question, Michael, is really for existing projects, not new projects. As far as our expectations just on a general basis going forward, I wouldn't expect it to be much more than inflation and maybe it's slightly even less than inflation on a go-forward basis."

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that FPL had strong performance in the third quarter and while Energy Resources had a challenging quarter financially, the team executed well on creating tangible growth opportunities for the future. During the quarter, we continued to build a large backlog of future investment opportunities at both of our main businesses. Despite the decline in year-over-year financial results at Energy Resources, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be at the low end of our range of $4.35 to $4.65. 
At Florida Power & Light Company, earnings per share were up approximately 12% over the prior year comparable quarter due to increased investment in the business. The Florida economy continues to show mixed signs with improvement in some indicators and little change in others. Florida's unemployment rate was 10.6% as of September 2011. This is 1.1 percentage points below last year's comparable month, and represents one of the largest year-over-year decreases in state unemployment rates in the United States. Florida's housing affordability has improved significantly, particularly in FPL's core markets. The Case-Shiller index, which tracks the prices of residential real estate has fallen 50% from its 2006 peak for the Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County markets in South Florida. This makes Florida much more attractive to baby boomers as they enter retirement, and the state's existing home sales trend continue to show positive momentum. 
Over the quarter, FPL averaged 24,000 more customers than we had in the year-ago comparable quarter, and our inactive meters have declined 4.4% since the year-ago period. Florida also continues to have a low tax burden, and we are encouraged by the efforts of Governor Scott's administration to make the state even more attractive to businesses. 
At FPL, we continue to make good progress on our large investment program. Our nuclear uprate work at St. Lucie and Turkey Point continues. Last week, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's nuclear cost recovery of $196 million through the capacity clause. This amount relates primarily to the cost of nuclear uprates, which by themselves are estimated to provide fuel savings to customers of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million over the lives of the plants. The commission determined that FPL's 2009 and 2010 uprate costs were prudently incurred, and FPL's actual and projected 2011 and 2012 costs are reasonable. Cost recovery for 2009 and 2010 was one of several issues that had been left unresolved by the prior commission. All of the prior unresolved issues have now been resolved. This week, the commission approved the remainder of the clauses for 2012 including fuel conservation and environmental clauses. This approval was reached through stipulation with all parties. 
During the third quarter, the commission accepted FPL's request for a bid rule exemption regarding the proposed modernization of the Port Everglades facility. And we plan to file a petition for a determination of need for the facility later this month. If the new plant were to come online in 2016 as currently proposed, the Port Everglade's modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and is expected to provide net customer benefits of more than $400 million over the life of the plant. 
In aggregate, FPL's completed and planned investments from 2001 to 2016 are expected to save customers an estimated $1.3 billion in projected fuel costs in 2016 relative to a 2001 baseline. These investments are delivering significant benefits to our customers through operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs. As a result, FPL customers are receiving cleaner, more reliable energy for a typical bill that is the lowest in Florida and more than 20% below the national average. Looking forward, we expect that these investments will allow us to keep our typical residential customer bill among the lowest in the state. 
On the Energy Resources side of the business, we made great strides in growing our backlog of contracted renewable energy projects by entering into contracts for approximately 1,100 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity since our second quarter earnings call. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have signed approximately 2,100 megawatts of contracts per new wind and solar projects. Now the numbers I just gave you are slightly higher than what are shown on the slides as last night, we entered into a new 100-megawatt wind contract, which is not included in the numbers you're seeing on the slides. This year is the most successful contracting the year in Energy Resources' history. 
On the solar development front, we were pleased to announce that we have purchased a 50% ownership interest in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight photovoltaic solar project. We believe the addition of Desert Sunlight, which is expected to be one of the world's largest solar PV facilities considerably strengthens our backlog of solar projects. We expect this project will begin operation in 2013 and be at full capacity in 2015. Long-term power purchase agreements or PPAs for the project have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
I also want to take this opportunity to announce that we are pursuing the necessary approvals and permits to develop the McCoy solar facility, a 250-megawatt solar PV project located in the Mojave Desert near the Genesis and Desert Sunlight projects. This project, which is expected to reach full commercial operations by 2016 has a long-term contract with Southern California Edison, currently pending approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. This project further enhances the visibility of our longer-term backlog, and we look forward to providing you additional updates on McCoy in the future. McCoy and Desert Sunlight join our solar portfolio alongside our Genesis and Spain solar thermal projects and several other smaller PV projects, increasing our backlog of already contracted solar opportunities to 940 megawatts expected to come into service sometime between 2011 and 2016. We expect these projects will begin contributing meaningfully to cash flow and earnings in 2013. 
On the wind development front, we had another active quarter and now have long-term PPAs for over 1,400 megawatts of new wind projects to be commissioned in 2011 and 2012, including the contract we signed last night. By 2012, Energy Resources expects to have approximately 10,000 megawatts of operating wind projects that provide on their own attractive upside opportunities. Looking beyond 2012, our current backlog of already contracted wind projects for 2013 and 2014 is 593 megawatts, which includes 469 megawatts of Canadian projects that we talked about last quarter, as well as an additional Canadian project of 124 megawatts that we had previously included in our 2012 backlog but now expect to come online in 2013. 
As you know, last month we announced new management roles for Armando Pimentel and Moray Dewhurst. Since Armando was Chief Financial Officer during the third quarter, he will be presenting the company's quarterly financial results today. With that, I will turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?"
270586,141952143,185377,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, r",4066,"Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category, the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI, and exclusion of the impact of the pending sale of Energy Resources' ownership interest in a portfolio for natural gas-fired generation assets. The pending sale of these assets resulted in a onetime after-tax charge of approximately $0.23 per share, of which approximately $0.22 was at Energy Resources and $0.01 was at corporate and other due to the consolidated tax impact. These results are still subject to various closing adjustments. 
Late last month, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in RIEC, a 550-megawatt gas-fired generation asset. The transaction is expected to result in a onetime after-tax charge of less than $0.01 per share subject to final closing adjustments, which the company expects to exclude from fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings. 
For the third quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $347 million or $0.83 per share. FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.09 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter driven almost entirely by the substantial investments we have made in the business, including the nuclear uprates in our Martin solar facility. As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity cap. We continue to expect that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide, including weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including modest differences from normal weather. Keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you should expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings. But on an annual basis, we expect that retail regulatory return to be approximately 11% in 2011 and 2012. 
During the quarter, we reversed $47 million of surplus depreciation to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11% in accordance with the settlement agreement. Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $84 million of surplus depreciation amortization. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we now expect to amortize between $160 million and $180 million, down from our previous range of $180 million to $200 million provided on our second quarter earnings call. This revision is largely a result of modestly favorable weather experienced in the third quarter. At this point, we expect to utilize between $510 million and $530 million of surplus depreciation in 2012, leaving us at the end of 2012 with between $180 million and $220 million remaining of the original $895 million established in the last rate case. Although, of course, the exact amount will depend upon a variety of other factors affecting 2012 results including the actual 2012 weather. 
Some of FPL's key customer metrics continue to show mixed results. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, on a comparable basis, retail kilowatt-hour sales decreased by 2.4% with the average number of customers increasing 0.5%. Although the usage due to weather is down slightly from last year, cooling degree days were 6.9% higher than normal. Non-weather related or underlying usage and all other declined by 1.1%. We continue to analyze customer usage statistics to assess how much of the decline can be attributed to the economic environment, and how much is the result of mandated efficiency standards. At this point, we believe each is contributing roughly equally to the decline. There is, however, more work for us to do in this important area. As depicted in the graph in the upper right corner, during the third quarter of 2011, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. While the percentage of low usage customers is flat to last year, inactive accounts declined approximately 4.4% since the end of last year's third quarter. We also want to highlight a recent update from the Office of Economic and Demographic Research regarding its population growth outlook for Florida. The chart at the bottom right corner provides annual projected population growth in Florida through 2021. The chart shows population growth rates increasing from 0.6% in 2012 to a peak of 1.5% in 2016 before tapering off slightly. We believe this is a positive indication of long-term potential customer growth. 
Turning to Florida's economic environment. A number of the indicators we follow have improved since the depth of the recession, but progress has been less consistent than we would prefer to see. Both the retail sales index and the tourism taxable sales are up over the comparable period in 2010. The trailing 12-month average of existing home sales continues to trend positively, suggesting the market is moving through the inventory of available homes. We continue to believe Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy. All of which should continue to lead to ongoing customer growth for FPL in the future. 
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $67 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges, net OTTI and the previously announced loss in the 4 natural gas-fired generation assets held for sale, were $204 million or $0.49 per share. 
Energy Resources' third quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.15 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions decreased $0.06 relative to last year as a result of lower CITC elections and lower state tax credits. Our estimate for full-year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged at roughly 275 megawatts compared with approximately 600 megawatts for 2010 projects. We continue to expect the full-year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 to be approximately $0.07. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Wind resource in the quarter was 88% relative to normal compared to 99% relative to normal in the prior year comparable quarter. The weaker wind resource was the primary driver of the negative $0.04 contribution from existing wind assets relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Year-to-date, the wind resource has been at 98% of normal. The Texas gas-fired generation assets contributed $0.02 primarily as a result of extreme hot weather in the [indiscernible] region. 
In the nuclear asset portfolio, Seabrook's contribution was lower by $0.03 as a result of lower price hedges while Point Beach contributed $0.05 more as a result of decommissioning fund gains, favorable generation and the lack of an outage in this quarter. 
Our shale gas well-drilling program contributed an additional $0.05 compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Customer supply in proprietary trading were down $0.13. This includes lower earnings at Gexa, a retail business, of approximately $0.05 attributable to the extreme hot weather in Texas during the month of August, and lower contributions from our proprietary trading business of roughly $0.07. 
As you know, there are 3 main parts to our Texas portfolio: two large-combined cycle plants, approximately 1,700 megawatts of hedged wind assets and a position in the competitive retail market through our Gexa subsidiary. Normally, we expect warm weather to be good for the gas assets, challenging for Gexa and uncertain for the wind assets. If the wind blows hard it is good, as we have excess capacity to sell. If the wind is weak, it is bad as we have to buy power to cover our hedges. Through most of the quarter, which experienced much warmer than usual weather, our experience was consistent with prior years. However, in August, when the Houston area experienced 22 days of record heat, the negative impact on Gexa increased more rapidly than the favorable impact on the gas plants, which were largely hedged and at the same time, the wind resource was light during the super peak period. As a result, the negatives out-weighed the positives and at the portfolio level, we were down $0.05. 
After undertaking a thorough review, it is clear that we could have reacted more quickly to certain signs we were seeing in the marketplace and reduced this impact. We have made changes as a result, and we believe we are now better positioned to avoid a recurrence of this issue. Ironically, however, the same events that caused us pain in the current quarter helped in other ways as forward curves moved up sharply and we were able to hedge out additional volumes for future years at higher prices than we could have done before the heatwave. 
From a development standpoint, we had a terrific quarter in terms of adding to our backlog of already contracted solar and wind opportunities, as Lew mentioned, just a couple of minutes ago. Starting with solar, since the second quarter, we have added 2 new projects: Desert Sunlight and McCoy. With the addition of these 2 projects, we now expect to be toward the high-end of the plans we laid out for investors at our May 2010 investor conference to invest between $3 billion and $4 billion in solar opportunities during the 2010 to 2014 timeframe. Including all of the planned solar projects that are already under long-term contract, Energy Resources plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012, and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. We now plan to add roughly 660 megawatts of solar to the portfolio between 2011 and 2014, and plan for an additional roughly 280 megawatts to be brought into service between 2015 and 2016. 
Turning to our wind business. Energy Resources' backlog of tangible investment opportunities includes plans to spend between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012, and $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. Included in these expectations are the 1,310 megawatts of signed PPAs for projects we plan to put in service in either 2011 or 2012. Our 2013 to 2014 backlog includes 593 megawatts Canadian wind projects. These numbers do not include the CapEx associated with the 100-megawatt contract we signed last night, which we expect to complete in 2012. 
Since this is our first opportunity to talk to you regarding our 2 new large solar projects, we want to provide a short overview of each project. At the end of September, we acquired 50% ownership in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight solar PV project. Construction began in September and interconnection is expected by the end of 2013. Full commercial operation is expected in 2015. We plan to elect CITCs for Desert Sunlight as the megawatts go into service at an estimated pace of 150 megawatts in 2013, 90 megawatts in 2014 and 35 megawatts in 2015. The project has 2 long-term PPAs on the full output of the facility, both of which have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Total invested capital for the project is estimated at $2.2 billion, 50% of which represents our subsidiaries' capital obligations, and we will account for the project under the equity method of accounting. 
Also adding to our solar development backlog, our newest development project, McCoy, is expected to consist of 250 megawatts of solar PV technology. We plan to develop the project so that it reaches full commercial operations in 2016. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately $1 billion. In September, we signed a PPA with the Southern California Edison for the full output of the project, contingent on the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission. This contract will be submitted for the commission's approval by the end of the year, and we expect approval in 2012. The McCoy site has further expansion capabilities, which could at least double our current plans. 
Let's now spend some time to discussing our earnings expectations for the rest of 2011, as well as the next several years. Turning first to the outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our original guidance range of $4.35 to $4.65. This is disappointing. We see with the benefit of hindsight that to reach the upper end of our range would have required contributions from our customer supply and proprietary trading operations that were not likely given how actual market conditions unfolded. And we have not increased and we do not intend to increase our risk exposure from those operations in an effort to make up any shortfall relative to our expectations. Having said that, it is also true that we believe that we could have and should have been at the midpoint of our original range had we executed better. Mistakes in execution are not acceptable to us and we are committed to improving. We have already taken several actions in response to the events of this year. 
As far as the earnings outlook beyond 2011, we want to give you a bit more detail regarding some factors that are expected to drive results in 2012 and 2013. First, as we have indicated before, we expect that the major driver of our earnings growth over the next several years will be the investments that we continue to make at FPL. We expect these investments to reward our customers with operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs, all while keeping our bills among the lowest in Florida. 
At Energy Resources, we expect the adjusted earnings drivers over the next couple of years to primarily fall into 2 different buckets. First, there are significant headwind associated with above-market hedges rolling off, as well as the expiration of PTCs and some increased costs. The second bucket contains the significant earnings contributions attributable to bringing our contract backlog of new solar and wind energy investments to completion. Although both of Energy Resources' drivers will affect our adjusted earnings expectations in the next couple of years, we expect the headwinds to be a bit stronger in 2012 while the contributions from new investments are expected to be much stronger in 2013 and beyond. 
Looking at 2012 specifically, as a result of our rate agreement, FPL's earnings will be primarily based on the amount of rate base investment it makes. We expect average total rate base in 2012 to be between $24.7 billion and $24.9 billion or approximately 14% higher than in 2011. The growth in total rate base is driven primarily by generation projects that have received prior PSC approval. The variability in FPL's earnings, assuming normal conditions, is expected to fall within a relatively tight range because we have the opportunity under the rate agreement to vary the amount of surplus depreciation amortization we use to achieve an approximate 11% retail regulatory ROE. 
At Energy Resources, significant headwinds primarily associated with above-market hedge roll-offs of roughly $60 million after-tax are expected to affect adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2012. Our expectations for 2012 also include PTC roll-offs and lower state tax benefits, which combined a roughly $75 million after-tax reduction to earnings compared to 2011. 
In terms of offsetting positive drivers, fewer days of nuclear outages are expected to contribute approximately $60 million after-tax and new asset additions are expected to contribute roughly $70 million after-tax including higher CITC elections, which are expected to contribute approximately $20 million after-tax, all relative to 2011. We currently estimate that we will elect CITCs at approximately 450 megawatts of wind projects compared to our estimate of 275 megawatts in 2011. There are obviously other puts and takes, but these are the primary drivers we see in 2012. After accounting for all of these effects, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2012 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. 
Turning to 2013, we expect FPL to have customer rates in place that will provide an appropriate cash return on the significant capital investments we continue to make. These investments in 2013 are expected to include the completion of our Cape Canaveral combined cycle project, completion of FPL's nuclear uprates at Turkey Point and St. Lucie, and the continuing construction of the Riviera Beach next-generation clean energy center. 
Our customers should greatly benefit from the fuel efficiency and environmental improvements associated with these investments over their useful lives. We expect total average rate base in 2013 to be between $26.4 billion and $26.8 billion or approximately 7% higher than in 2012. In addition, the approximately 320-mile rate-regulated transmission line that our Lone Star Transmission subsidiary is building, is expected to be completed in 2013. Our expectations are that when completed, Lone Star will have approximately $800 million of utility rate base in Texas. 
On this slide, we are providing you with a walk of Energy Resources' expected adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2013. The renewable energy investments we plan to commission in 2011, 2012 and 2013 provide significant earnings contributions at Energy Resources through 2013. As you can see from this chart, we expect that the growth in our solar business will contribute between $90 million and $115 million in earnings relative to 2011, with virtually all of these increased earnings coming in 2013. Driving this expected growth are the contributions from our Spain solar projects, the first half of our Genesis solar project and a portion of our Desert Sunlight project. 
We expect our new wind additions, primarily the contributions from the 2011 and 2012 project additions, to contribute between $60 million and $75 million during this period. Recall that there will be no CITC earnings for new wind projects in 2013, and that we expect to have roughly $35 million of CITC earnings in 2011 so the $60 million to $75 million range you see here is net of that CITC amount. We also expect price escalators built into a number of our long-term PPAs on our existing assets to contribute approximately $55 million during this period. The tangible growth at Energy Resources that we see through 2013 resulting from these new long-term contract and investments will be partially offset by the expiration of production tax credits, higher costs and unfavorable market pricing from our merchant assets. 
While we do not have the exposure to merchant prices that many of our peers have, as a result of our largely contracted portfolio, we do have some exposure that shows up here from higher price hedges that will be rolling off during this time period. In fact, from 2011 to 2013, the reduction in Energy Resources' gross margin associated with above-market hedge roll-offs is expected to be approximately $85 million. As I just pointed out a second ago, roughly $60 million of this $85 million occurs from 2011 to 2012, so there's much less headwind associated with above-market hedges rolling off in 2013. Overall, we are currently 92% hedged in 2013 in terms of equivalent gross margin for our existing assets. For your reference, we have included in the appendix to this presentation the 2012 and 2013 hedging slides. 
On the 2012 slide, you will notice the reduction in our expectations for the proprietary trading business. As part of an effort to align the cost structure of our gas trading operations with our reduced expectations for the business going forward, in the first quarter 2012 we will be relocating the gas trading and scheduling operations from Houston back to our corporate headquarters in Florida. In addition to reducing costs, bringing these operations back to Florida will allow us to better integrate the teams and improve leverage across the overall business. 
On the 2013 slide, note that the new investment line includes both the contributions from the 2012 additions and the 2013 additions that we already have under contract. Please also note that with the pending sale of the 5 natural gas plants, we have tried to simplify and clarify the hedging charts to align better with the primary drivers of commodity price exposure in the different parts of the portfolio. By executing on our tangible backlog of investment opportunities, we expect to be able to grow earnings at Energy Resources even in the face of the headwinds I have just described. The combination of FPL, Lone Star Transmission and Energy Resources' investments offset by the headwinds I've described for the period are expected to result in significant adjusted earnings growth in 2013 over 2012. 
Turning to 2014. In addition to a full year of contributions from the 2013 Energy Resources investments I just discussed, 2014 is also expected to add the second half of our Genesis solar project, 90 megawatts of Desert Sunlight and contributions from our Canadian wind projects that we plan to put in service between 2013 and 2014. Also, the headwinds from the roll-off of above-market hedges are not present in 2014. In fact, we currently expect gross margin on our merchant assets to be up in 2014 compared to 2013. Our 2014 merchant assets gross margin is roughly 70% hedged. In addition to the contributions from Energy Resources, rate base growth at FPL is expected to be approximately 3% from 2013 to 2014. All of the investments we are making at FPL and Energy Resources are expected to meaningfully increase cash flow from operations beginning in 2013. We expect that in 2013, cash flow from operations will cover capital expenditures. And in 2014, we currently expect cash flow from operations to exceed capital expenditures and expected dividends, assuming we do not add any additional projects to our current backlog. 
In 2014, we expect consolidated cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.5 billion, which would be an increase of over 35% from our consolidated expectations in 2011. Based on our current cash flow expectations and absent further new investment opportunities, we would therefore expect to be in a position to return some capital to shareholders in 2013 and 2014. We continue to believe that maintaining our strong balance sheet and capital structure is an important differentiator for us, and has added to our competitiveness at critical times over the past decade. As such, we plan to maintain this balance sheet strength and our credit metrics as we go forward. Of course, we will always look for additional opportunities to deploy capital into new investments that we would expect to produce additional value for our shareholders while maintaining our capital structure. 
On a net basis from now through 2014, we expect that outstanding shares may decline slightly relative to 2011. Today, we have given you additional information to help you better understand the adjusted earnings drivers for our business over the next couple of years. In addition to the specific guidance ranges for 2011 and 2012, we have provided additional color on the expected adjusted earnings drivers for 2013 and 2014. 
In summary, we continue to believe that our adjusted earnings per share will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65 in 2014 subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. 
Before turning the call back to Lew, I wanted to take a quick moment to thank all of you, the analysts and investors, with whom I have worked over the last few years while I was the CFO of NextEra Energy. I look forward to continuing to interact with you in my new role at Energy Resources. 
With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks."
270586,141952143,185377,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Armando.

During my tenure as CEO, we have never before enjoyed a position",541,"Thanks, Armando. To close, let me just say that while we're not satisfied with the financial results this year at Energy Resources, we remain very positive about our outlook for the future. During my tenure as CEO, we have never before enjoyed a position in which so much of our future is represented by projects in our current backlog with high visibility and a clear path to completion. Altogether, our backlogs total almost $20 billion of capital investments across FPL, Energy Resources and Lone Star. Our growth for the next few years will be driven primarily by growth at Florida Power & Light, where our investments are fundamentally substituting capital for fuel and thereby making our delivery system more efficient. We already have what we believe is the best customer value proposition in Florida, combining the lowest bills in the state with top-quartile reliability, award-winning customer service and the risk mitigation that comes for our clean emissions profile and we're working hard to improve this. Our investments will mean real benefits for our customers in the form of lower bill -- lower fuel bills, which means total bills will need to rise very little even in nominal terms and will likely continue to decline in real terms. As a result, we believe we should be able to earn a fair rate of return on the capital we are investing the business. This will lead to strong growth and contributions to earnings per share. 
While the outlook for FPL is for fairly consistent growth, at Energy Resources, we first need to fight through the effects of some headwinds, most notably the impact of the decline in power and gas prices that has occurred over the last few years and which will somewhat mask the positive impact of the strong growth in new business through the end of next year. Nevertheless, Energy Resources has a bright and highly visible future path to growth through 2014 in the form of continued investment in new wind and solar projects. And at the same time, the mix of Energy Resources' businesses will continue to shift toward long-term contracted projects, thus improving the overall risk profile. Combining all of these, we continue to believe we can grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65. We can -- we believe we can do so even after conservatively assuming no U.S. wind additions in 2013 or 2014. Yet we firmly believe we will find additional growth opportunities in the years ahead beyond those we have currently identified, and we will be working very hard to do so. 
Notwithstanding the short-term uncertainties related to renewable energy policy, we believe that U.S. Renewable Energy policies will continue to be supportive of future investments over the long haul. We understand that we have much work to do to execute effectively against our extensive backlog of projects, and that is our immediate focus. But we will continue to seek ways to deploy new capital at attractive returns to build long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

As far as what we see happening right now, we don't have -- we don't even have a murky crystal ball or a clear crystal ball on this. You all read the papers and between the U.S. deficit situation and some of the partisan politics, it's hard to say where things are going to go in the short term. Although I will note, a bill has just been introduced in Congress to extend wind PTCs to 2016, which is the same period of time where the solar PTCs expire. But historically, renewables have received strong bi-partisan support and I think it will -- renewables are going to be an important part of our energy mix going forward. And the other thing that I will add is, as I think you all have seen now, over the years, the cost for renewables, wind and solar, especially, continues to come down. And so they are becoming more and more competitive. So it's proof that these incentives have worked in terms of making renewables much more cost effective. So it's hard to predict what's going to happen very short term. I'm pleased that we're in a position that we can give guidance out through 2014 that doesn't rely on any changes to U.S. energy policy. But again, as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, I see over the long haul that we will have continued support for renewables and renewables are going to be a viable business."

But for a financial forecast, you have to make some kind of assumption at this point. We never like to assume things that we don't know about, and so I think that provides sort of a baseline kind of forecast. For sure, we're not going to go and invest in things that are dilutive or highly dilutive. So if we find new investments, they've got to have a better economic proposition than what you're seeing in the numbers we've just laid out.

It's a 250-megawatt thermal project out in California, 125 megawatts of that project will come in mid- to last-half of 2013 and the other 125 megawatts will come in around mid-2014. The third project is Desert Sunlight. That's an equity investment by us, 50%. That megawatt is currently -- those megawatts are currently scheduled to come in roughly 150 megawatts later in 2013, roughly 90 megawatts, I'd say, probably throughout 2014 and roughly 30 megawatts, I'd say, probably the first half of 2015. And then we've got McCoy, which we talked about today. McCoy is a 250-megawatt, also a PV Project like Desert Sunlight. That's actually -- there is some CapEx from McCoy in our forecast period, it's not significant and by our forecast period, I mean through 2014. But we don't expect any earnings associated with McCoy until 2015. Most of that -- most of those earnings though will probably be in 2016."

The slide's probably in the upper teens but it's 2012 -- I'm sorry, 2013 drivers and the 2013 drivers really come in 3 pieces. First, you've got Florida Power & Light Company, which is making significant investments to rate base in 2011, 2012. And we'll have new rates in 2013 since our rate agreement ends at the end of 2012. That's the first big driver. The second big driver's $800 million of rate base in our Texas utility our transmission utility, Lone Star. And the next big driver which we laid out really on 19, and we laid it out from '11 to '13 but it's really the Energy Resources solar projects, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So you've got first half of Genesis, you've got Spain Solar, you've got Desert Sunlight and you've got a whole bunch of wind that you're putting in, primarily in '12 as opposed to '11. And those wind projects that are going in, in '12 will have a full year of operations in 2013. When you put all that together, that accounts for the big driver from '12 to '13. The other piece that we shouldn't forget I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a -- at Energy Resources, a significant amount of headwinds from the roll-off of above-market hedges from 2011 to 2012. So if you look at Slide 19, and you look at the merchant pricing down of $85 million from '11 to '13, $60 of that is actually from '11 to '12. And so you have much less headwinds in 2013. Now I'm going just make this comment because you also had Merchant in there. On the Merchant side of the business, our Merchant gross margin at this point is not fully locked up. But even in 2014, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got 70% of that margin in 2014 locked up. And in 2013, if you look at the new slide that's in the appendix, we've got 86% of that gross margin currently hedged. So we feel fairly comfortable that there will be a big up in adjusted earnings per share assuming we can execute on our plans. But if we execute on our plans, there should be a pretty big up in adjusted EPS from 2012 to 2013."

But if you go to Slide 19, for those of you that are out there trying to model all this, the green bars that you see there, those ups that you see on those projects, those green bars are already net of the O&M for those new projects. So the O&M increase that you see on that slide which I think is part of your question, Michael, is really for existing projects, not new projects. As far as our expectations just on a general basis going forward, I wouldn't expect it to be much more than inflation and maybe it's slightly even less than inflation on a go-forward basis."
