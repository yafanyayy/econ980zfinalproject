First, I'll address NiSource's strong overall performance for 2010. As you can see, the team once again delivered financial results in line with our earnings guidance while taking significant steps towards meeting customer needs, creating shareholder value and generating long-term sustainable earnings growth. 
I'll also touch on the foundational actions state taking during 2010 to strengthen NiSource's financial profile and enhance our ability to find a wide array of attractive infrastructure modernization and growth investment opportunities. And finally, I'll outline our 2011 earnings guidance, which reflects our continued commitment to sustainable earnings growth and underscores the underlying strength of NiSource's core businesses and the markets that we serve.
So first, let's turn to our 2010 results. For the year, we continued to see positive customer benefits, enhanced shareholder value and sustainable earnings growth from NiSource's well-established infrastructure investment driven strategy. During 2010, our team executed on a broad array of key regulatory and financial initiatives, infrastructure enhancement programs and new growth projects. 
These achievements, combined with improved margins and increased usage in our industrial electric markets, enabled us to deliver on our earnings commitments for the fourth consecutive year. For 2010, that means delivering earnings squarely in line with the increased non-GAAP range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share that we provided when we reported earnings for the third quarter. And notably, we achieved these results while remaining responsive to needs of our customers and other key stakeholders.
On Slide 3 of the supplemental slides, you can see that NiSource delivered 2010 net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $340 million or $1.22 per share compared to $1.07 per share last year, representing a 14% increase over 2009. Our earnings release and supplemental slides spell out the details regarding our improved 2010 results. 
But here are just a few highlights. We saw materially improved industrial margins and usage in our Electric business which helped boost operating earnings by more than $50 million over 2009. In addition, our Gas Distribution infrastructure enhancement and regulatory initiatives helped generate more than $50 million in added revenues. In our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, the successful completion of growth project helped increase demand margin revenues by more than $20 million over 2009. Despite the fact that a number of our projects were in service for only a portion of the year. These results reflect core strength of our business plan, the focus of our team as well as continued signs of resilience in our key markets.
Going forward, I'm convinced that NiSource's established infrastructure investment driven strategy will continue to generate positive results for our company, our customers and our investors. We remain committed to this strategy and are focused on executing it in a disciplined, thoughtful manner.
Turning to Slide 4, this slide highlights several key initiatives Steve Smith and our finance team completed during 2010. These efforts significantly strengthened our financial profile and position us to fund our compelling array of infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Most notably in September we completed a $400 million equity offering. This offering, which was structured as a forward sell arrangement, aligns with and strongly supports our targeted annual capital investment level, which I'm pleased to note for 2011 is targeted up to $1.1 billion. In addition, in December, we successfully tendered nearly $275 million in debt and concurrently executed a 30-year debt offering of $250 million. 
This will reduce our interest expense by about $10 million in 2011 and extend the maturity of our debt profile. Of course we also remain true to our key financial commitments to preserve our stable investment grade credit rating and maintain our attractive secure dividend, all while delivering long-term earnings growth.
With the successful completion of our equity offering and other key elements of financial strategy, NiSource's well-positioned to take advantage of the deep inventory of investment opportunities available across our business portfolio and continue growing our business and earnings on a sustainable basis.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, let me on just some of the key business accomplishments that play such a key role in advancing our business strategy. 
First and foremost, we continue to see solid progress in Indiana. Jimmy Staton and his NIPSCO team are taking significant steps to improve customer service and reliability while addressing a number of important regulatory matters. In November, NIPSCO filed a new electric rate case with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. 
While filed in November, the preparation and stakeholder outreach and engagement for the case began long before that. The result is a proposal that is balanced and responsive to both the needs of the company and our customers and other constituencies. We'll continue to engage with all stakeholders and expect the case to be completed during 2011. As we mentioned in today's release and have discussed in past updates, we expect to restore NIPSCO's earnings to a reasonable and appropriate level by the beginning of 2012.
Also, in November, NIPSCO received IURC approval of the unanimous settlement of its 2010 natural gas rate case, the company's first in 20 years. The settlement resulted in an overall rate decrease for customers while enhancing the company's operating earnings. It also improved rate design and continued our strong support for low-income assistance, energy efficiency and conservation.
Last but not least, following IURC certificate of approval at the end of December, NIPSCO is launching a major environmental upgrade in our Schaeffer generating station, which will contribute to the company's earnings growth going forward. This is the first phase of a series of the environmental investments in Indiana, totaling about $600 million over the next six to eight years. These initiatives are fully in line with NIPSCO's new source review settlement with the EPA that we announced earlier this year.
Turning to our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage business on Slide 7. Chris Helm and his team are continuing to capitalize on NiSource's unparalleled geographic footprint to complete and advance customer driven growth projects primarily in the Marcellus Shale production area. During 2010, NGT&S put in service or nearly completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus shale production area. These products provide market access for more than 500,000 decatherms of natural gas daily. 
Our $80 million Majorsville series of projects served as a cornerstone of an array of additional projects currently in process across the Marcellus play. Progress also continued on our Columbia Gulf Transmission rate case for the federal energy regulatory commission. The following increased revenues of approximately $50 million per year, reflecting updated cost and operating conditions. new rate go into effect subject to refund starting this May.
As I noted earlier, growth project revenues were up by more than $20 million in NGT&S in 2010 and for projects such as Majorsville, we've not yet experienced a full year's earnings run rate. Having said that, overall operating earnings for the year were down due to anticipated expense increases, pension and integrity management in particular and reduced short-term transportation revenue resulting from a lack of natural gas price volatility. 
Looking forward, we remain enthusiastic NGT&S earnings growth prospects for 2011 and beyond driven by accretive infrastructure investments which we expect to amount to about $200 million annually.
Turning to our third major business unit, NiSource Gas Distribution or NGD. Our NGD teams continue to execute our strategy of combining long-term infrastructure replacement programs with complementary regulatory initiatives. 
Millions of customers are benefiting from this strategy, which includes significant revenue producing facility modernization programs at our largest utilities, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. In aggregate, these programs provide NGD with an investment opportunity approaching $4.5 billion over the next 20 to 25 years. On the regulatory front in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission of a unanimous settlement of its first base rate case in 12 years. 
The settlement authorized a $5 million revenue increase as well as a number of rate design and other enhancements. The new rates took effect January 1. And in mid-January, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a new rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That case seeks recovery of ongoing infrastructure investments, a modernized rate structure, as well as new senior citizen and energy efficiency programs. Filing seeks an annual revenue increase of about $38 million.
Finally, I'd like to briefly outline our 2011 earnings guidance and key 2010 takeaways on Slide 8 before opening the line to your questions. Based on the continued success of our balanced business strategy and an extensive array of growth investment opportunities available across all of our businesses, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually.
In fact in the near term, particularly as we execute a number of regulatory initiatives, our operating earnings growth may well exceed that longer-term percentage range. 
With that in mind, we expect NiSource's 2011 net operating earnings to fall within a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. As you know, this is a non-GAAP range. Consistent with last year's outlook due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, we're not providing GAAP earnings guidance. I'll also note that our 2011 guidance continues to be premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets we serve.
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team, our customers and our many business community partners for their support and engagement during the past year. We've made significant progress in our business plan during 2010, all built on a foundation of ongoing investment across all of our companies.  
This core strategy remains unchanged for 2011, with the notable enhancement of our ability to invest in our businesses by the steps taken over the last years. And I can assure you that our investment approach will remain disciplined and straightforward, focused on meeting our customer needs while building long-term value for our shareholders.
As always, we remain committed to communicating with our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on www.NiSource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your continued interest and support of NiSource.

First, I'll address NiSource's strong overall performance for 2010. As you can see, the team once again delivered financial results in line with our earnings guidance while taking significant steps towards meeting customer needs, creating shareholder value and generating long-term sustainable earnings growth. 
I'll also touch on the foundational actions taken during 2010 to strengthen NiSource's financial profile and enhance our ability to find a wide array of attractive infrastructure modernization and growth investment opportunities. And finally, I'll outline our 2011 earnings guidance, which reflects our continued commitment to sustainable earnings growth and underscores the underlying strength of NiSource's core businesses and the markets that we serve.
So first, let's turn to our 2010 results. For the year, we continued to see positive customer benefits, enhanced shareholder value and sustainable earnings growth from NiSource's well-established infrastructure investment-driven strategy. During 2010, our team executed on a broad array of key regulatory and financial initiatives, infrastructure enhancement programs and new growth projects. 
These achievements, combined with improved margins and increased usage in our industrial electric markets, enabled us to deliver on our earnings commitments for the fourth consecutive year. For 2010, that means delivering earnings squarely in line with the increased non-GAAP range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share that we provided when we reported earnings for the third quarter. And notably, we achieved these results while remaining responsive to the needs of our customers and other key stakeholders.
On Slide 3 of the supplemental slides, you can see that NiSource delivered 2010 net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $340 million or $1.22 per share compared to $1.07 per share last year, representing a 14% increase over 2009. Our earnings release and supplemental slides spell out the details regarding our improved 2010 results. 
But here are just a few highlights. We saw materially improved industrial margins and usage in our Electric business, which helped boost operating earnings by more than $50 million over 2009. In addition, our Gas Distribution infrastructure enhancement and regulatory initiatives helped generate more than $50 million in added revenues. In our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, the successful completion of growth project helped increase demand margin revenues by more than $20 million over 2009 despite the fact that a number of our projects were in service for only a portion of the year. These results reflect the core strength of our business plan, the focus of our team as well as continued signs of resilience in our key markets.
Going forward, I'm convinced that NiSource's established infrastructure investment-driven strategy will continue to generate positive results for our company, our customers and our investors. We remain committed to this strategy and are focused on executing it in a disciplined, thoughtful manner.
Turning to Slide 4, this slide highlights several key initiatives Steve Smith and our finance team completed during 2010. These efforts significantly strengthened our financial profile and position us to fund our compelling array of infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Most notably in September, we completed a $400 million equity offering. This offering, which was structured as a forward-sale arrangement, aligns with and strongly supports our targeted annual capital investment level, which I'm pleased to note for 2011 is targeted at up to $1.1 billion. In addition, in December, we successfully tendered nearly $275 million in debt and concurrently executed a 30-year debt offering of $250 million. 
This will reduce our interest expense by about $10 million in 2011 and extends the maturity of our debt profile. Of course, we also remain true to our key financial commitments to preserve our stable investment grade credit rating and maintain our attractive secure dividend, all while delivering long-term earnings growth.
With the successful completion of our equity offering and other key elements of financial strategy, NiSource is well-positioned to take advantage of the deep inventory of investment opportunities available across our Business portfolio and continue growing our business and earnings on a sustainable basis.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, let me touch on just some of the key business unit accomplishments that play such key role in advancing our business strategy. 
First and foremost, we continue to see solid progress in Indiana. Jimmy Staton and his NIPSCO team are taking significant steps to improve customer service and reliability while addressing a number of important regulatory matters. In November, NIPSCO filed a new electric rate case with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. 
While filed in November, the preparation and stakeholder outreach and engagement for the case began long before that. The result is a proposal that is balanced and responsive to both the needs of the company and our customers and other constituencies. We'll continue to engage with all stakeholders and expect the case to be completed during 2011. As we mentioned in today's release and have discussed in past updates, we expect to restore NIPSCO's earnings to a reasonable and appropriate level by the beginning of 2012.
Also in November, NIPSCO received IURC approval of the unanimous settlement of its 2010 natural gas rate case, the company's first in 20 years. The settlement resulted in an overall rate decrease for customers while enhancing the company's operating earnings. It also improved rate design and continued our strong support for low-income assistance, energy efficiency and conservation.
Last, but not least, following IURC certificate approval at the end of December, NIPSCO is launching a major environmental upgrade at our Schahfer Generating Station, which will contribute to the company's earnings growth going forward. This is the first phase of a series of new environmental investments in Indiana, totaling about $600 million over the next six to eight years. These initiatives are fully in line with NIPSCO's new source review settlement with the EPA that we announced earlier this year.
Turning to our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage business on Slide 7. Chris Helms and his team are continuing to capitalize on NiSource's unparalleled geographic footprint to complete and advance customer-driven growth projects primarily in the Marcellus Shale production area. During 2010, NGT&S put in service or nearly completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area. These products provide market access for more than 500,000 dekatherms of natural gas daily. 
Our $80 million Majorsville series of projects serve as the cornerstone of an array of additional projects currently in process across the Marcellus play. Progress also continued on our Columbia Gulf Transmission rate case for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The following seeks an increase in revenues of approximately $50 million per year, reflecting updated costs and operating conditions. New rates go into effect subject to refund starting this May.
As I noted earlier, growth project revenues were up by more than $20 million in NGT&S in 2010, and for projects such as Majorsville, we've not yet experienced a full year's earnings run rate. Having said that, overall operating earnings for the year were down due to anticipated expense increases, pension and integrity management in particular and reduced short-term transportation revenue resulting from a lack of natural gas price volatility. Looking forward, we remain enthusiastic about NGT&S' earnings growth prospects for 2011 and beyond, driven by accretive infrastructure investments, which we expect to amount to about $200 million annually.
Turning to our third major business unit, NiSource Gas Distribution or NGD. Our NGD teams continued to execute on our strategy of combining long-term infrastructure replacement programs with complementary regulatory initiatives. 
Millions of customers are benefiting from this strategy, which includes significant revenue-producing facility modernization programs at our largest utilities, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. In aggregate, these programs provide NGD with an investment opportunity approaching $4.5 billion over the next 20 to 25 years. 
On the regulatory front in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission of a unanimous settlement of its first base rate case in 12 years.  The settlement authorized a $5 million revenue increase as well as a number of rate design and other enhancements. The new rates took effect January 1. 
And in mid-January, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a new rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That case seeks recovery of ongoing infrastructure investments, a modernized rate structure, as well as new senior citizen and energy efficiency programs. The filing seeks an annual revenue increase of about $38 million.
Finally, I'd like to briefly outline our 2011 earnings guidance and key 2010 takeaways on Slide 8 before opening the line to your questions. Based on the continued success of our balanced business strategy and the extensive array of growth investment opportunities available across all of our businesses, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually.
In fact, in the near term, particularly as we execute a number of regulatory initiatives, our operating earnings growth may well exceed that longer-term percentage range. 
With that in mind, we expect NiSource's 2011 net operating earnings to fall within a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. You should know, this is a non-GAAP range. Consistent with last year's outlook due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, we're not providing GAAP earnings guidance. I'll also note that our 2011 guidance continues to be premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets we serve.
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team, our customers and our many business community partners for their support and engagement during the past year. We've made significant progress on our business plan during 2010, all built on a foundation of ongoing investment across all of our companies.  
This core strategy remains unchanged for 2011, with the notable enhancement of our ability to invest in our businesses by the steps taken over the last years. And I can assure you that our investment approach will remain disciplined and straightforward, focused on meeting our customer needs while building long-term value for our shareholders.
As always, we remain committed to communicating with our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on NiSource.com.

First, I'll address NiSource's strong overall performance for 2010. As you can see, the team once again delivered financial results in line with our earnings guidance while taking significant steps towards meeting customer needs, creating shareholder value and generating long-term sustainable earnings growth. 
I'll also touch on the foundational actions taken during 2010 to strengthen NiSource's financial profile and enhance our ability to fund a wide array of attractive infrastructure modernization and growth investment opportunities. And finally, I'll outline our 2011 earnings guidance, which reflects our continued commitment to sustainable earnings growth and underscores the underlying strength of NiSource's core businesses and the markets that we serve.
So first, let's turn to our 2010 results. For the year, we continued to see positive customer benefits, enhanced shareholder value and sustainable earnings growth from NiSource's well-established infrastructure investment-driven strategy. During 2010, our team executed on a broad array of key regulatory and financial initiatives, infrastructure enhancement programs and new growth projects. 
These achievements, combined with improved margins and increased usage in our industrial electric markets, enabled us to deliver on our earnings commitments for the fourth consecutive year. For 2010, that means delivering earnings squarely in line with the increased non-GAAP range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share that we provided when we reported earnings for the third quarter. And notably, we achieved these results while remaining responsive to the needs of our customers and other key stakeholders.
On Slide 3 of the supplemental slides, you can see that NiSource delivered 2010 net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $340 million or $1.22 per share compared to $1.07 per share last year, representing a 14% increase over 2009. Our earnings release and supplemental slides spell out the details regarding our improved 2010 results. 
But here are just a few highlights. We saw materially improved industrial margins and usage in our Electric business, which helped boost operating earnings by more than $50 million over 2009. In addition, our Gas Distribution infrastructure enhancement and regulatory initiatives helped generate more than $50 million in added revenues. In our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, the successful completion of growth project helped increase demand margin revenues by more than $20 million over 2009 despite the fact that a number of our projects were in service for only a portion of the year. These results reflect the core strength of our business plan, the focus of our team as well as continued signs of resilience in our key markets.
Going forward, I'm convinced that NiSource's established infrastructure investment-driven strategy will continue to generate positive results for our company, our customers and our investors. We remain committed to this strategy and are focused on executing it in a disciplined, thoughtful manner.
Turning to Slide 4, this slide highlights several key initiatives Steve Smith and our finance team completed during 2010. These efforts significantly strengthened our financial profile and position us to fund our compelling array of infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Most notably in September, we completed a $400 million equity offering. This offering, which was structured as a forward-sale arrangement, aligns with and strongly supports our targeted annual capital investment level, which I'm pleased to note for 2011 is targeted at up to $1.1 billion. In addition, in December, we successfully tendered nearly $275 million in debt and concurrently executed a 30-year debt offering of $250 million. 
This will reduce our interest expense by about $10 million in 2011 and extends the maturity of our debt profile. Of course, we also remain true to our key financial commitments to preserve our stable investment grade credit rating and maintain our attractive secure dividend, all while delivering long-term earnings growth.
With the successful completion of our equity offering and other key elements of financial strategy, NiSource is well-positioned to take advantage of the deep inventory of investment opportunities available across our Business portfolio and continue growing our business and earnings on a sustainable basis.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, let me touch on just some of the key business unit accomplishments that play such key role in advancing our business strategy. 
First and foremost, we continue to see solid progress in Indiana. Jimmy Staton and his NIPSCO team are taking significant steps to improve customer service and reliability while addressing a number of important regulatory matters. In November, NIPSCO filed a new electric rate case with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. 
While filed in November, the preparation and stakeholder outreach and engagement for the case began long before that. The result is a proposal that is balanced and responsive to both the needs of the company and our customers and other constituencies. We'll continue to engage with all stakeholders and expect the case to be completed during 2011. As we mentioned in today's release and have discussed in past updates, we expect to restore NIPSCO's earnings to a reasonable and appropriate level by the beginning of 2012.
Also in November, NIPSCO received IURC approval of the unanimous settlement of its 2010 natural gas rate case, the company's first in 20 years. The settlement resulted in an overall rate decrease for customers while enhancing the company's operating earnings. It also improved rate design and continued our strong support for low-income assistance, energy efficiency and conservation.
Last, but not least, following IURC certificate approval at the end of December, NIPSCO is launching a major environmental upgrade at our Schahfer Generating Station, which will contribute to the company's earnings growth going forward. This is the first phase of a series of new environmental investments in Indiana, totaling about $600 million over the next six to eight years. These initiatives are fully in line with NIPSCO's new source review settlement with the EPA that we announced earlier this year.
Turning to our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage business on Slide 7. Chris Helms and his team are continuing to capitalize on NiSource's unparalleled geographic footprint to complete and advance customer-driven growth projects primarily in the Marcellus Shale production area. During 2010, NGT&S put in service or nearly completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area. These products provide market access for more than 500,000 dekatherms of natural gas daily. 
Our $80 million Majorsville series of projects serve as the cornerstone of an array of additional projects currently in process across the Marcellus play. Progress also continued on our Columbia Gulf Transmission rate case for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The following seeks an increase in revenues of approximately $50 million per year, reflecting updated costs and operating conditions. New rates go into effect subject to refund starting this May.
As I noted earlier, growth project revenues were up by more than $20 million in NGT&S in 2010, and for projects such as Majorsville, we've not yet experienced a full year's earnings run rate. Having said that, overall operating earnings for the year were down due to anticipated expense increases, pension and integrity management in particular and reduced short-term transportation revenue resulting from a lack of natural gas price volatility. Looking forward, we remain enthusiastic about NGT&S' earnings growth prospects for 2011 and beyond, driven by accretive infrastructure investments, which we expect to amount to about $200 million annually.
Turning to our third major business unit, NiSource Gas Distribution or NGD. Our NGD teams continued to execute on our strategy of combining long-term infrastructure replacement programs with complementary regulatory initiatives. 
Millions of customers are benefiting from this strategy, which includes significant revenue-producing facility modernization programs at our largest utilities, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. In aggregate, these programs provide NGD with an investment opportunity approaching $4.5 billion over the next 20 to 25 years. 
On the regulatory front in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission of a unanimous settlement of its first base rate case in 12 years.  The settlement authorized a $5 million revenue increase as well as a number of rate design and other enhancements. The new rates took effect January 1st. 
And in mid-January, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a new rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That case seeks recovery of ongoing infrastructure investments, a modernized rate structure, as well as new senior citizen and energy efficiency programs. The filing seeks an annual revenue increase of about $38 million.
Finally, I'd like to briefly outline our 2011 earnings guidance and key 2010 takeaways on Slide 8 before opening the line to your questions. Based on the continued success of our balanced business strategy and the extensive array of growth investment opportunities available across all of our businesses, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually.
In fact, in the near term, particularly as we execute a number of regulatory initiatives, our operating earnings growth may well exceed that longer-term percentage range. 
With that in mind, we expect NiSource's 2011 net operating earnings to fall within a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. You should know, this is a non-GAAP range. Consistent with last year's outlook due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, we're not providing GAAP earnings guidance. I'll also note that our 2011 guidance continues to be premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets we serve.
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team, our customers and our many business community partners for their support and engagement during the past year. We've made significant progress on our business plan during 2010, all built on a foundation of ongoing investment across all of our companies.  
This core strategy remains unchanged for 2011, with the notable enhancement of our ability to invest in our businesses by the steps taken over the last years. And I can assure you that our investment approach will remain disciplined and straightforward, focused on meeting our customer needs while building long-term value for our shareholders.
As always, we remain committed to communicating with our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on NiSource.com.

First, I'll address NiSource's strong overall performance for 2010. As you can see, the team once again delivered financial results in line with our earnings guidance while taking significant steps towards meeting customer needs, creating shareholder value and generating long-term sustainable earnings growth. 
I'll also touch on the foundational actions taken during 2010 to strengthen NiSource's financial profile and enhance our ability to fund a wide array of attractive infrastructure modernization and growth investment opportunities. And finally, I'll outline our 2011 earnings guidance, which reflects our continued commitment to sustainable earnings growth and underscores the underlying strength of NiSource's core businesses and the markets that we serve.
So first, let's turn to our 2010 results. For the year, we continued to see positive customer benefits, enhanced shareholder value and sustainable earnings growth from NiSource's well-established infrastructure investment-driven strategy. During 2010, our team executed on a broad array of key regulatory and financial initiatives, infrastructure enhancement programs and new growth projects. 
These achievements, combined with improved margins and increased usage in our industrial electric markets, enabled us to deliver on our earnings commitments for the fourth consecutive year. For 2010, that means delivering earnings squarely in line with the increased non-GAAP range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share that we provided when we reported earnings for the third quarter. And notably, we achieved these results while remaining responsive to the needs of our customers and other key stakeholders.
On Slide 3 of the supplemental slides, you can see that NiSource delivered 2010 net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $340 million or $1.22 per share compared to $1.07 per share last year, representing a 14% increase over 2009. Our earnings release and supplemental slides spell out the details regarding our improved 2010 results. 
But here are just a few highlights. We saw materially improved industrial margins and usage in our Electric business, which helped boost operating earnings by more than $50 million over 2009. In addition, our Gas Distribution infrastructure enhancement and regulatory initiatives helped generate more than $50 million in added revenues. In our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, the successful completion of growth project helped increase demand margin revenues by more than $20 million over 2009 despite the fact that a number of our projects were in service for only a portion of the year. These results reflect the core strength of our business plan, the focus of our team as well as continued signs of resilience in our key markets.
Going forward, I'm convinced that NiSource's established infrastructure investment-driven strategy will continue to generate positive results for our company, our customers and our investors. We remain committed to this strategy and are focused on executing it in a disciplined, thoughtful manner.
Turning to Slide 4, this slide highlights several key initiatives Steve Smith and our finance team completed during 2010. These efforts significantly strengthened our financial profile and position us to fund our compelling array of infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Most notably in September, we completed a $400 million equity offering. This offering, which was structured as a forward-sale arrangement, aligns with and strongly supports our targeted annual capital investment level, which I'm pleased to note for 2011 is targeted at up to $1.1 billion. In addition, in December, we successfully tendered nearly $275 million in debt and concurrently executed a 30-year debt offering of $250 million. 
This will reduce our interest expense by about $10 million in 2011 and extends the maturity of our debt profile. Of course, we also remain true to our key financial commitments to preserve our stable investment grade credit rating and maintain our attractive secure dividend, all while delivering long-term earnings growth.
With the successful completion of our equity offering and other key elements of financial strategy, NiSource is well-positioned to take advantage of the deep inventory of investment opportunities available across our Business portfolio and continue growing our business and earnings on a sustainable basis.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, let me touch on just some of the key business unit accomplishments that play such key role in advancing our business strategy. 
First and foremost, we continue to see solid progress in Indiana. Jimmy Staton and his NIPSCO team are taking significant steps to improve customer service and reliability while addressing a number of important regulatory matters. In November, NIPSCO filed a new electric rate case with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. 
While filed in November, the preparation and stakeholder outreach and engagement for the case began long before that. The result is a proposal that is balanced and responsive to both the needs of the company and our customers and other constituencies. We'll continue to engage with all stakeholders and expect the case to be completed during 2011. As we mentioned in today's release and have discussed in past updates, we expect to restore NIPSCO's earnings to a reasonable and appropriate level by the beginning of 2012.
Also in November, NIPSCO received IURC approval of the unanimous settlement of its 2010 natural gas rate case, the company's first in 20 years. The settlement resulted in an overall rate decrease for customers while enhancing the company's operating earnings. It also improved rate design and continued our strong support for low-income assistance, energy efficiency and conservation.
Last, but not least, following IURC certificate approval at the end of December, NIPSCO is launching a major environmental upgrade at our Schahfer Generating Station, which will contribute to the company's earnings growth going forward. This is the first phase of a series of new environmental investments in Indiana, totaling about $600 million over the next six to eight years. These initiatives are fully in line with NIPSCO's new source review settlement with the EPA that we announced earlier this year.
Turning to our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage business on Slide 7. Chris Helms and his team are continuing to capitalize on NiSource's unparalleled geographic footprint to complete and advance customer-driven growth projects primarily in the Marcellus Shale production area. During 2010, NGT&S put in service or nearly completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area. These products provide market access for more than 500,000 dekatherms of natural gas daily. 
Our $80 million Majorsville series of projects serve as the cornerstone of an array of additional projects currently in process across the Marcellus play. Progress also continued on our Columbia Gulf Transmission rate case for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The following seeks an increase in revenues of approximately $50 million per year, reflecting updated costs and operating conditions. New rates go into effect subject to refund starting this May.
As I noted earlier, growth project revenues were up by more than $20 million in NGT&S in 2010, and for projects such as Majorsville, we've not yet experienced a full year's earnings run rate. Having said that, overall operating earnings for the year were down due to anticipated expense increases, pension and integrity management in particular and reduced short-term transportation revenue resulting from a lack of natural gas price volatility. Looking forward, we remain enthusiastic about NGT&S' earnings growth prospects for 2011 and beyond, driven by accretive infrastructure investments, which we expect to amount to about $200 million annually.
Turning to our third major business unit, NiSource Gas Distribution or NGD. Our NGD teams continued to execute on our strategy of combining long-term infrastructure replacement programs with complementary regulatory initiatives. 
Millions of customers are benefiting from this strategy, which includes significant revenue-producing facility modernization programs at our largest utilities, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. In aggregate, these programs provide NGD with an investment opportunity approaching $4.5 billion over the next 20 to 25 years. 
On the regulatory front in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission of a unanimous settlement of its first base rate case in 12 years.  The settlement authorized a $5 million revenue increase as well as a number of rate design and other enhancements. The new rates took effect January 1st. 
And in mid-January, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a new rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That case seeks recovery of ongoing infrastructure investments, a modernized rate structure, as well as new senior citizen and energy efficiency programs. The filing seeks an annual revenue increase of about $38 million.
Finally, I'd like to briefly outline our 2011 earnings guidance and key 2010 takeaways on Slide 8 before opening the line to your questions. Based on the continued success of our balanced business strategy and the extensive array of growth investment opportunities available across all of our businesses, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually.
In fact, in the near term, particularly as we execute a number of regulatory initiatives, our operating earnings growth may well exceed that longer-term percentage range. 
With that in mind, we expect NiSource's 2011 net operating earnings to fall within a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. You should know, this is a non-GAAP range. Consistent with last year's outlook due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, we're not providing GAAP earnings guidance. I'll also note that our 2011 guidance continues to be premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets we serve.
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team, our customers and our many business community partners for their support and engagement during the past year. We've made significant progress on our business plan during 2010, all built on a foundation of ongoing investment across all of our companies.  
This core strategy remains unchanged for 2011, with the notable enhancement of our ability to invest in our businesses by the steps taken over the last years. And I can assure you that our investment approach will remain disciplined and straightforward, focused on meeting our customer needs while building long-term value for our shareholders.
As always, we remain committed to communicating with our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on NiSource.com.

First, I'll address NiSource's strong overall performance for 2010. As you can see, the team once again delivered financial results in line with our earnings guidance while taking significant steps towards meeting customer needs, creating shareholder value and generating long-term sustainable earnings growth. 
I'll also touch on the foundational actions taken during 2010 to strengthen NiSource's financial profile and enhance our ability to fund a wide array of attractive infrastructure modernization and growth investment opportunities. And finally, I'll outline our 2011 earnings guidance, which reflects our continued commitment to sustainable earnings growth and underscores the underlying strength of NiSource's core businesses and the markets that we serve.
So first, let's turn to our 2010 results. For the year, we continued to see positive customer benefits, enhanced shareholder value and sustainable earnings growth from NiSource's well-established infrastructure investment-driven strategy. During 2010, our team executed on a broad array of key regulatory and financial initiatives, infrastructure enhancement programs and new growth projects. 
These achievements, combined with improved margins and increased usage in our industrial electric markets, enabled us to deliver on our earnings commitments for the fourth consecutive year. For 2010, that means delivering earnings squarely in line with the increased non-GAAP range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share that we provided when we reported earnings for the third quarter. And notably, we achieved these results while remaining responsive to the needs of our customers and other key stakeholders.
On Slide 3 of the supplemental slides, you can see that NiSource delivered 2010 net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $340 million or $1.22 per share compared to $1.07 per share last year, representing a 14% increase over 2009. Our earnings release and supplemental slides spell out the details regarding our improved 2010 results. 
But here are just a few highlights. We saw materially improved industrial margins and usage in our Electric business, which helped boost operating earnings by more than $50 million over 2009. In addition, our Gas Distribution infrastructure enhancement and regulatory initiatives helped generate more than $50 million in added revenues. And in our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, the successful completion of growth projects helped increase demand margin revenues by more than $20 million over 2009 despite the fact that a number of our projects were in service for only a portion of the year. These results reflect the core strength of our business plan, the focus of our team as well as continued signs of resilience in our key markets.
Going forward, I'm convinced that NiSource's established infrastructure investment-driven strategy will continue to generate positive results for our company, our customers and our investors. We remain committed to this strategy and are focused on executing it in a disciplined, thoughtful manner.
Turning to Slide 4, this slide highlights several key initiatives Steve Smith and our finance team completed during 2010. These efforts significantly strengthened our financial profile and position us to fund our compelling array of infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Most notably in September, we completed a $400 million equity offering. This offering, which was structured as a forward-sale arrangement, aligns with and strongly supports our targeted annual capital investment level, which I'm pleased to note for 2011 is targeted at up to $1.1 billion. In addition, in December, we successfully tendered nearly $275 million in debt and concurrently executed a 30-year debt offering of $250 million. 
This will reduce our interest expense by about $10 million in 2011 and extends the maturity of our debt profile. Of course, we also remain true to our key financial commitments: to preserve our stable investment-grade credit rating and maintain our attractive secure dividend, all while delivering long-term earnings growth.
With the successful completion of our equity offering and other key elements of financial strategy, NiSource is well-positioned to take advantage of the deep inventory of investment opportunities available across our Business portfolio and continue growing our business and earnings on a sustainable basis.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, let me touch on just some of the key business unit accomplishments that played such a key role in advancing our business strategy. 
First and foremost, we continue to see solid progress in Indiana. Jimmy Staton and his NIPSCO team are taking significant steps to improve customer service and reliability while addressing a number of important regulatory matters. In November, NIPSCO filed a new electric rate case with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. 
While filed in November, the preparation and stakeholder outreach and engagement for the case began long before that. The result is a proposal that is balanced and responsive to both the needs of the company and our customers and other constituencies. We'll continue to engage with all stakeholders and expect the case to be completed during 2011. As we mentioned in today's release and have discussed in past updates, we expect to restore NIPSCO's earnings to a reasonable and appropriate level by the beginning of 2012.
Also in November, NIPSCO received IURC approval of the unanimous settlement of its 2010 natural gas rate case, the company's first in 20 years. The settlement resulted in an overall rate decrease for customers while enhancing the company's operating earnings. It also improved rate design and continued our strong support for low-income assistance, energy efficiency and conservation.
Last, but not least, following IURC certificate approval at the end of December, NIPSCO is launching a major environmental upgrade at our Schahfer Generating Station, which will contribute to the company's earnings growth going forward. This is the first phase of a series of new environmental investments in Indiana, totaling about $600 million over the next six to eight years. These initiatives are fully in line with NIPSCO's new source review settlement with the EPA that we announced earlier this year.
Turning to our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage business on Slide 7. Chris Helms and his team are continuing to capitalize on NiSource's unparalleled geographic footprint to complete and advance customer-driven growth projects primarily in the Marcellus Shale production area. During 2010, NGT&S put in service or nearly completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area. These projects provide market access for more than 500,000 dekatherms of natural gas daily. 
Our $80 million Majorsville series of projects serve as the cornerstone of an array of additional projects currently in process across the Marcellus play. Progress also continued on our Columbia Gulf Transmission rate case for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The filing seeks an increase in revenues of approximately $50 million per year, reflecting updated costs and operating conditions. New rates go into effect subject to refund starting this May.
As I noted earlier, growth project revenues were up by more than $20 million at NGT&S in 2010, and for projects such as Majorsville, we've not yet experienced a full year's earnings run rate. Having said that, overall operating earnings for the year were down due to anticipated expense increases, pension and integrity management in particular and reduced short-term transportation revenue resulting from a lack of natural gas price volatility. Looking forward, we remain enthusiastic about NGT&S' earnings growth prospects for 2011 and beyond, driven by accretive infrastructure investments, which we expect to amount to about $200 million annually.
Turning to our third major business unit, NiSource Gas Distribution or NGD. Our NGD teams continue to execute on our strategy of combining long-term infrastructure replacement programs with complementary regulatory initiatives. 
Millions of customers are benefiting from this strategy, which includes significant revenue-producing facility modernization programs at our largest utilities: Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. In aggregate, these programs provide NGD with an investment opportunity approaching $4.5 billion over the next 20 to 25 years. 
On the regulatory front in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission of a unanimous settlement of its first base rate case in 12 years.  The settlement authorized a $5 million revenue increase as well as a number of rate design and other enhancements. The new rates took effect January 1st. 
And in mid-January, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a new rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That case seeks recovery of ongoing infrastructure investments, a modernized rate structure, as well as new senior citizen and energy efficiency programs. The filing seeks an annual revenue increase of about $38 million.
Finally, I'd like to briefly outline our 2011 earnings guidance and key 2010 takeaways on Slide 8 before opening the line to your questions. Based on the continued success of our balanced business strategy and the extensive array of growth investment opportunities available across all of our businesses, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually.
In fact, in the near term, particularly as we execute a number of regulatory initiatives, our operating earnings growth may well exceed that longer-term percentage range. 
With that in mind, we expect NiSource's 2011 net operating earnings to fall within a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. You should know, this is a non-GAAP range. Consistent with last year's outlook due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, we're not providing GAAP earnings guidance. I'll also note that our 2011 guidance continues to be premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets we serve.
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team, our customers and our many business community partners for their support and engagement during the past year. We've made significant progress on our business plan during 2010, all built on a foundation of ongoing investment across all of our companies.  
This core strategy remains unchanged for 2011, with the notable enhancement of our ability to invest in our businesses by the steps taken over the last years. And I can assure you that our investment approach will remain disciplined and straightforward, focused on meeting our customer needs while building long-term value for our shareholders.
As always, we remain committed to communicating with our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on NiSource.com.

So first I'll touch on a few key takeaways from our first quarter performance. Next, I'll note several key highlights for NiSource in each of our business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions. 
To kick off, a few key takeaways from the first quarter. If you turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental materials, you see several headlines but the core message is this: We are on track. 
First and foremost, our numbers are on track, perhaps more so than immediately meets the eye, as I'll touch on in a moment. The strength of this year's performance if anything is obscured a bit by a few items. So again, the overriding takeaways that NiSource's regulatory, commercial and operational fundamentals are quite strong and our year-to-date performance is squarely in line with our 2011 earnings outlook. 
Second, our Indiana strategy is on track. As you know, a key focus for our NIPSCO team is successful resolution of our 2010 electric rate case. That case is moving forward, and we still expect resolution at the end of the year or early next year. 
Third, we're also building on our track record of successful regulatory and infrastructure modernization programs at our gas utilities. These efforts are generating positive results this year and will continue to build long-term shareholder and customer value going forward. 
And finally, we remain on track with our growth investments at our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, with a particular emphasis on those projects that leverage our very attractive footprint in our Marcellus Shale region. 
Underpinning all these efforts is our commitment to effective financial management and a strong liquidity profile is demonstrated our a new $1.5 billion 4-year revolving credit facility that we closed in early March. 
So the 10-second soundbite is this: NiSource is on track to deliver on a robust agenda of infrastructure investments paired with exceptional commercial and regulatory execution. 
With that preface, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with our overall financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered first quarter net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $202 million, or $0.72 per share. As I mentioned a moment ago, the year-over-year comparison is skewed a bit by 3 items: first, the quarter's revenues were reduced almost $20 million as a result of redesign changes under last year's favorable NIPSCO gas rate case settlement. Notably, those revenue impacts will be mitigated through the course of the year. Second, during the quarter, we reported a nonrecurring $8 million accounting charge related to environmental costs at NIPSCO. And third, in last year's first quarter, we recognized revenues of about $8 million, associated with the sale of stored gas. 
When you take these items into consideration, considered strong fundamentals posted for the quarter, you get a clear picture of the ongoing earnings momentum we are building here at NiSource. 
With that, let's dive into our individual business unit results, starting with Indiana and our Electric business on Slide 5. 
Our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve performance, services and rates, and restore NIPSCO's earnings to an appropriate level. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported first quarter operating earnings of about $42 million, compared to $46 million for the same period in 2010. Notably, NIPSCO saw an increase in its industrial margins and usage to help drive a net revenue increase of about $9 million, excluding trackers. 
Operating expenses increased by about $13 million over last year's levels. However, that jump was due to the environmental charge that I mentioned a moment ago. On the regulatory front, NIPSCO remains on track to establish electric base rates by late 2011 or early 2012. While the formal rate case process continues to move forward, NIPSCO is actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its stakeholders. Once resolved, we're confident the case will position the company for ongoing growth for continued customer focus investments in service, reliability and environmental infrastructure. 
Speaking of investments, NIPSCO is moving ahead on installation of a new Flue Gas Desulfurization or FGD unit at our Schahfer Generating Station. Preliminary engineering is complete, and crews have prepped the site and started construction. If you recall, this is the first of a number of FGD units planned across NIPSCO's systems. These investments, more than $600 million over 6 to 8 years, will strengthen earnings while creating hundreds of project-related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. Together, these new units will reduce SOx emissions on an additional 80% beyond current levels. 
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group on Slide 6. 
Our gas distribution operating earnings for the quarter were about $237 million, compared to about $235 million during the same period in 2010. As I noted earlier, there's a bit of noise, net revenues excluding trackers were down due to the change in NIPSCO's gas rate design, as were expenses. 
On the Investment front, Columbia Gas Kentucky, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Columbia Gas of Ohio, and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania all continue to advance their significant infrastructure modernization programs during the first quarter. These ongoing programs, which began more than 3 years, proactively and systemically replaced portions of our system to ensure continued reliable and efficient service, at the same time, growing earnings. As we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity, in fact, just lastly, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on our most recent filing to recover costs associated with our infrastructure replacement and energy efficiency programs which will increase yearly revenues by about $24 million effective May 1. And in Pennsylvania, our team is advancing a base rate case filed in January, seeking enhanced revenues of about $38 million. The rate case is paired with an improved rate design, and new programs to help senior citizens and others better manage their energy costs. We expect to resolve that case by year's end. 
Without question, we believe the strong focus on infrastructure, modernization in our utilities, along with appropriate regulatory treatment, will benefit our customers and communities, as well as NiSource's shareholders for decades to come. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, highlighted on Slide 7. 
Here the team's focus continues to be on market-driven growth projects, with particular emphasis on our extensive opportunities in the Marcellus Shale region. From an earnings standpoint, the NGT&S team generated operating earnings of about $119 million in the first quarter, compared to about $126 million in 2010. Net revenues were relatively flat for the quarter, as a result of last year's native storage gas sales. Operating expenses were up only about $3 million. 
Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue inventory growth projects, ranging from traditional transportation and storage services, to power generation, supply aggregation, and other Marcellus production-related projects. Some of our other near-term Marcellus investments includes the Clendenin and Smithfield projects, Line WB, and the Southern Appalachia project. Together these projects will generate about half a a BCF per day of new firm transportation capacity. 
Also driven by increased Marcellus production, Millennium Pipeline completed a binding open season for proposed mainline expansion projects to provide incremental firm transportation capacity to northeast markets. Notably, prior to the season, the company executed binding precedent agreements with 2 anchor shippers. 
We are also advancing the new power generation project in the mid-Atlantic region. Although we can't share specific details at this time, it's clear the power generation market has real potential for us, given our strategic footprint between major generation hubs and the Marcellus Shale region. You'll soon see our birth certification filing for this power gen [generation] project. On the regulatory front, Columbia Gulf 2010 $50 million general rate case moved forward with the company placing new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. Columbia Gulf and the parties to the case are actively engaged in discussions to resolve the case. 
As you can see, the NGT&S team continues to execute on its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low-risk, high-value growth opportunities.
To wrap up, 2 key points. First, we are squarely in line with our expectations and remain on track to meet demand operating earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non-GAAP, for 2011. Second, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually, perhaps a bit more in the near term, so we execute on our Indiana business and regulatory agenda. 
As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today, and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. Laura, let's now open the call to questions."

We're also up fairly strongly first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So again we're seeing a reasonably good amount of strength in that area.

Number one, you'll see demand and commodity revenues are up in a very positive fashion, again reflecting projects, recon, track team, and the like. You'll also see the volumes are up considerably. And third, the underlying expense structure continues to be well-managed. And then last but not least, beginning in May we have the lift from the Columbia Gulf rate cas. We'll reserve a portion of that case, but nonetheless, we have a significant lift in the end. So again when you cut through the noise and look at the key fundamentals, demand, commodity, volumes, expenses, regulatory activity and then the projects that we're working on, we feel very good about NGT&S and where it stands."

In the way of what the producers are looking for, and you touched on most of those, but it's a gathering quasi-gathering, deep bottlenecking, getting casted point to liquid points where they can monetize as quickly and effectively as they can. We do believe that there will be opportunities for processing and the like, liquid handling and the like. That hasn't necessarily been our sweet spot, but we consider opportunities to enable or deleverage ongoing investments in the areas, sure. But they are going to have to meet our risk return profile, and again, we do believe there are opportunities in that region. We've said this consistently, we don't see production levels at levels that would support large-scale, long-line expansion projects. We do believe though as production grows, and we have more critical mass, the gas will go further downstream, we'll seek markets that will require larger-scale investments. But for the time-being, the bite-size, access providing sorts of projects, that's where we'll continue to focus."

How serious is that? I mean, at this stage, is this something where we could in fact be looking at a new pipeline to serve mid-Atlantic generation, I guess feeding mid-continent shale gas?

Karl, maybe I could just give you a bit of an overview and perspective for management on growth projects at NGT&S. Without a doubt, without a question, the primary focus is going to be leveraging this Marcellus opportunity that we have. That's Job 1, 2 and 3. And as you recognize, that's a supply push, a producer push sort of opportunity. We're not going to predicate our entire growth on supply push, so we are looking for demand opportunities on-system, adjacent to the system. So we are going to continue to look at demand opportunities. I mentioned one power generation project that we are actively advancing. That's a good example of continued focus on the demand side of the market. The opportunity that you mentioned, it's called Canasom[ph], and again, it represents demand-focused opportunity for us. It's a potential opportunity to provide another outlet to another market for Marcellus gas. As you suggested, this project is in the early, early stage of development. So that's one of the reasons it's not reflected in our formal comments today, because we're actively working the markets to determine whether this has a real potential for us. So, that's the overview on where we stand. This project is a long-term sort of look, and I just closed up by saying our tenants for growth remain the same. And anything we do is going to be focused, we're going to be disciplined, project -- our projects will be 100% contracted for, as you know, we try to actively risk manage projects through the use of structured arrangements, joint venture partners, or whatever. So a little bit of overview, little bit of color on how we regard demand projects."

So first I'll touch on a few key takeaways from our first quarter performance. Next, I'll note several key highlights for NiSource and each of our business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions. 
To kick off, a few key takeaways from the first quarter. If you turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental materials, you'll see several headlines but the core message is this, we're on track. 
First and foremost, our numbers are on track, perhaps more so than immediately meets the eye, as I'll touch on in a moment. The strength of this year's performance if anything is obscured a bit by a few items. So again, the overriding takeaway is that NiSource's regulatory, commercial and operational fundamentals are quite strong and our year-to-date performance is squarely in line with our 2011 earnings outlook. 
Second, our Indiana strategy is on track. As you know, a key focus for our NIPSCO team is successful resolution of our 2010 electric rate case. That case is moving forward, and we still expect resolution at the end of the year or early next year. 
Third, we're also building on our track record of successful regulatory and infrastructure modernization programs at our gas utilities. These efforts are generating positive results this year, and will continue to build long-term shareholder and customer value going forward. 
And finally, we remain on track with our growth investments at our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, with a particular emphasis on those projects that leverage our very attractive footprint in the Marcellus Shale region. 
Underpinning all these efforts is our commitment to effective financial management, and the strong liquidity profile is demonstrated by our new $1.5 billion 4-year revolving credit facility that we closed in early March. 
So the 10-second soundbite is this, NiSource is on track to deliver on a robust agenda of infrastructure investments paired with exceptional commercial and regulatory execution. 
With that preface, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with our overall financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered first quarter net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $202 million or $0.72 per share. As I mentioned a moment ago, the year-over-year comparison is skewed a bit by 3 items: first, the quarter's revenues were reduced almost $20 million as a result of rate design  changes under last year's favorable NIPSCO gas rate case settlement. Notably, those revenue impacts will be mitigated through the course of the year. Second, during the quarter, we recorded a non-recurring $8 million accounting charge related to environmental costs at NIPSCO. And third, in last year's first quarter, we recognized revenues of about $8 million, associated with the sale of  native storage gas. 
When you take these items into consideration, consider the strong fundamentals posted for the quarter, you get a clear picture of the ongoing earnings momentum we're building here at NiSource. 
With that, let's dive into our individual business unit results, starting with Indiana and our Electric business on Slide 5. 
Our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve performance,  modernize services and rates and restore NIPSCO's earnings to an appropriate level. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported first quarter operating earnings of about $42 million, compared to $46 million for the same period in 2010. Notably, NIPSCO saw an increase in its industrial margins and usage that helped drive a net revenue increase of about $9 million, excluding trackers. 
Operating expenses increased by about $13 million over last year's levels. However, that jump was due in large measure to the environmental charge that I mentioned a moment ago. On the regulatory front, NIPSCO remains on track to establish new electric base rates by late 2011 or early 2012. While the formal rate case process continues to move forward, NIPSCO is actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its stakeholders. Once resolved, we're confident the case will position the company for ongoing growth through continued customer focus, investments in service, reliability and environmental infrastructure. 
Speaking of investments, NIPSCO is moving ahead on installation of a new Flue Gas Desulfurization or FGD unit at our Schahfer Generating Station.  Preliminary engineering is complete, and the crews have prepped the site and started construction. You recall, that this is the first of a number of FGD units planned across NIPSCO's system. These investments, more than $600 million over 6 to 8 years, will strengthen earnings while creating hundreds of project-related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. Together, these new units will reduce SOx emissions by an additional 80% beyond current levels. 
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group on Slide 6. 
Our Gas Distribution operating earnings for the quarter were about $237 million, compared to about $235 million during the same period in 2010. As I noted earlier, there's a bit of noise, net revenues excluding trackers were down due to the change in NIPSCO's gas rate design, as were expenses. 
On the investment front, Columbia Gas Kentucky, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Columbia Gas of Ohio, and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania all continued to advance their significant infrastructure modernization programs during the first quarter. These ongoing programs, which began more than 3 years ago, proactively and systemically replaced portions of our system to ensure continued reliable and efficient service, at the same time, growing earnings. As we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity, in fact, just last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on our most recent filing to recover costs associated with our infrastructure replacement and energy efficiency programs, which will increase yearly revenues by about $24 million effective May 1. 
And in Pennsylvania, our team is advancing a base rate case filed in January, seeking enhanced revenues of about $38 million. The rate case is paired with an improved rate design, and new programs to help senior citizens and others better manage their energy costs. We expect to resolve that case by year's end. 
Without question, we believe the strong focus on infrastructure, modernization at our utilities, along with appropriate regulatory treatment, will benefit our customers and communities, as well as NiSource's shareholders for decades to come. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage Operations, highlighted on Slide 7. 
Here, the team's focus continues to be on market-driven growth projects, with particular emphasis on our extensive opportunities in the Marcellus Shale region. From an earnings standpoint, the NGT&S team generated operating earnings of about $119 million in the first quarter, compared to about $126 million in 2010. Net revenues were relatively flat for the quarter, as a result of last year's native storage gas sales. Operating expenses were up only about $3 million. 
Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue an inventory of growth projects, ranging from traditional transportation and storage services, to power generation, supply aggregation, and other Marcellus production-related projects. Some of our other near-term Marcellus investment includes the Clendenin and Smithfield projects, Line WB, and the Southern Appalachia project. Together, these projects will generate about 0.5 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity. 
Also driven by increased Marcellus production, Millennium Pipeline completed a binding open season for proposed mainline expansion projects to provide incremental firm transportation capacity to northeast markets. Notably, prior to the open season, the company executed binding preceding  agreements with 2 anchor shippers. 
We're also advancing the new power generation project in the mid-Atlantic region. Although we can't share specific details at this time, it's clear the power generation market has real potential for us, given our strategic footprint between major generation hubs and the Marcellus Shale region. You'll soon see our FERC certification filing for this power gen [generation] project. 
On the regulatory front, Columbia Gulf 2010 $50 million general rate case moved forward with the company placing new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. Columbia Gulf and the parties to the case are actively engaged in discussions to resolve the case. 
As you can see, the NGT&S team continues to execute on its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low-risk, high-value growth opportunities.
To wrap up, 2 key points. First, we're squarely in line with our expectations and remain on track to meet the net operating earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non-GAAP, for 2011. Second, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually, perhaps a bit more in the near term, so we execute on our Indiana business and regulatory agenda. 
As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today, and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource.

And, James, I'm sure you've seen some of the announcements from U.S. Steel and Mills about relatively bullish outlook on demand through the first 3 quarters of the year. And again, those outlooks are being reflected in their production in this region. You mentioned that we were up considerably quarter-to-quarter. We're also up fairly strongly first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So again, we're seeing a reasonably good amount of strength in that area. I just remind you and everybody that our plan assumes a very measured, relatively slow recovery of the economy. So our outlook is not premised on a spike in demand. And we're encouraged by this but our plan is not predicated on this being sustained over the, near term. Paul, I'm sorry, Jay, you also mentioned gas volumes. And again, you see some pretty good strength across the footprint on industrial manufacturing throughput. So again, we're encouraged, the plan is not predicated on those  sorts of increases continuing, but we feel pretty good about where we stand. And just one other editorial, and I know you recognize that on the industrial side, particularly on the gas side of our business, the margins for incremental throughput are relatively thin, relatively thin. So you're not going to see future pops in revenue associated with that. And I'll also say on the electric side, we need the strength in the economy. We certainly enjoyed the strength in the production. But again, a lot of the margin revenues are not being driven by those industrial increases."

That's a good example of continuing the focus on the demand side of the market. The opportunity that you mentioned, it's called Kennesaw. And again, it represents demand-focused opportunity for us. It's a potential opportunity to provide an outlet or another market for Marcellus gas. As you suggested, this project is in the early, early stage of development. So that's one of the reasons it's not reflected in our formal comments today because we're actively working the market to determine whether this has a real potential for us. So that's the overview on where we stand. This project is a long-term sort of look. And I just closed out by saying our tenants for growth remain the same. And anything we do is going to be focused, we're going to be disciplined. Project, or projects will be 100% contracted for. And as you know, we try to actively risk manage projects through the use of structured arrangements, joint venture partners or whatever. So a little bit of an overview, a little bit of color around how we regard demand projects."

And I know you guys are kind of going through the binding, the results of the open season. But if that were to move forward, what would be the timing of potential capacity expansion at Millennium? And I guess, I'm also trying to just brainstorm and think about this in terms of the PENNSTAR pipeline, which goes into Millennium, because our understanding is that the well is coming out in Northeast Pennsylvania are so large that even Millennium is now kind of getting backed up for your open season. And so, is PENNSTAR partly predicated on the fact of getting more capacity on Millennium?"

To PENNSTAR, we've been consistent in saying we believe this a 2014 project, part of the softening of gas prices has moved that back a year or so. Clearly, opportunities for additional capacity on Millennium, I think, enhance the position of the PENNSTAR."

So first I'll touch on a few key takeaways from our first quarter performance. Next, I'll note several key highlights for NiSource and each of our business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions. 
To kick off, a few key takeaways from the first quarter. If you turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental materials, you'll see several headlines but the core message is this, we're on track. 
First and foremost, our numbers are on track, perhaps more so than immediately meets the eye, as I'll touch on in a moment. The strength of this year's performance, if anything, is obscured a bit by a few items. So again, the overriding takeaway is that NiSource's regulatory, commercial and operational fundamentals are quite strong and our year to date performance is squarely in line with our 2011 earnings outlook. 
Second, our Indiana strategy is on track. As you know, a key focus for our NIPSCO team is successful resolution of our 2010 electric rate case. That case is moving forward, and we still expect resolution at the end of the year or early next year. 
Third, we're also building on our track record of successful regulatory and infrastructure modernization programs at our gas utilities. These efforts are generating positive results this year, and will continue to build long term shareholder and customer value going forward. 
And finally, we remain on track with our growth investments at our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, with a particular emphasis on those projects that leverage our very attractive footprint in the Marcellus Shale region. 
Underpinning all these efforts is our commitment to effective financial management, and a strong liquidity profile is demonstrated by our new $1.5 billion 4 year revolving credit facility that we closed in early March. 
So the 10 second sound bite is this, NiSource is on track to deliver on a robust agenda of infrastructure investments paired with exceptional commercial and regulatory execution. 
With that preface, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with our overall financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered first quarter net operating earnings, non GAAP, of about $202 million or $0.72 per share. As I mentioned a moment ago, the year over year comparison is skewed a bit by 3 items: first, the quarter's revenues were reduced almost $20 million as a result of rate design changes under last year's favorable NIPSCO gas rate case settlement. Notably, those revenue impacts will be mitigated through the course of the year. Second, during the quarter, we recorded a non recurring $8 million accounting charge related to environmental costs at NIPSCO. And third, in last year's first quarter, we recognized revenues of about $8 million, associated with the sale of native storage gas. 
When you take these items into consideration and consider the strong fundamentals posted for the quarter, you get a clearer picture of the ongoing earnings momentum we're building here at NiSource. 
With that, let's dive into our individual business unit results, starting with Indiana and our Electric business on Slide 5. 
Our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve performance, modernize services and rates and restore NIPSCO's earnings to an appropriate level. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported first quarter operating earnings of about $42 million compared to $46 million for the same period in 2010. Notably, NIPSCO saw an increase in its industrial margins and usage that helped drive a net revenue increase of about $9 million, excluding trackers. 
Operating expenses increased by about $13 million over last year's levels. However, that jump was due in large measure to the environmental charge that I mentioned a moment ago. On the regulatory front, NIPSCO remains on track to establish new electric base rates by late 2011 or early 2012. While the formal rate case process continues to move forward, NIPSCO is actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its stakeholders. Once resolved, we're confident the case will position the company for ongoing growth through continued customer focus, investments in service, reliability and environmental infrastructure. 
Speaking of investments, NIPSCO is moving ahead on installation of a new Flue Gas Desulfurization or FGD unit at our Schahfer Generating Station.  Preliminary engineering is complete, and the crews have prepped the site and started construction. You'll recall that this is the first of a number of FGD units planned across NIPSCO's system. These investments, more than $600 million over 6 to 8 years, will strengthen earnings while creating hundreds of project related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. Together, these new units will reduce SOx emissions by an additional 80% beyond current levels.
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group on Slide 6. 
Our Gas Distribution operating earnings for the quarter were about $237 million compared to about $235 million during the same period in 2010. As I noted earlier, there's a bit of noise, net revenues excluding trackers were down due to the change in NIPSCO gas rate design, as were expenses. 
On the investment front, Columbia Gas Kentucky, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Columbia Gas of Ohio, and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania all continued to advance their significant infrastructure modernization programs during the first quarter. These ongoing programs, which began more than 3 years ago, proactively and systemically replaced portions of our system to ensure continued reliable and efficient service, at the same time, growing earnings. As we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity, in fact, just last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on our most recent filing to recover costs associated with our infrastructure replacement and energy efficiency programs, which will increase yearly revenues by about $24 million effective May 1. 
And in Pennsylvania, our team is advancing a base rate case filed in January, seeking enhanced revenues of about $38 million. The rate case is paired with an improved rate design, and new programs to help senior citizens and others better manage their energy costs. We expect to resolve that case by year's end. 
Without question, we believe the strong focus on infrastructure, modernization at our utilities, along with appropriate regulatory treatment, will benefit our customers and communities, as well as NiSource's shareholders for decades to come. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage Operations, highlighted on Slide 7. 
Here, the team's focus continues to be on market driven growth projects, with particular emphasis on our extensive opportunities in the Marcellus Shale region. From an earnings standpoint, the NGT&S team generated operating earnings of about $119 million in the first quarter compared to about $126 million in 2010. Net revenues were relatively flat for the quarter, as a result of last year's native storage gas sales. Operating expenses were up only about $3 million. 
Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue an inventory of growth projects, ranging from traditional transportation and storage services, to power generation, supply aggregation, and other Marcellus production related projects. Some of our other near term Marcellus investment includes the Clendenin and Smithfield projects, Line WB, and the Southern Appalachia project. Together, these projects will generate about 0.5 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity. 
Also driven by increased Marcellus production, Millennium Pipeline completed a binding open season for proposed mainline expansion projects to provide incremental firm transportation capacity to northeast markets. Notably, prior to the open season, the company executed binding preceding  agreements with 2 anchor shippers. 
We're also advancing the new power generation project in the mid Atlantic region. Although we can't share specific details at this time, it's clear the power generation market has real potential for us, given our strategic footprint between major generation hubs and the Marcellus Shale region. You'll soon see our FERC certification filing for this power gen [generation] project. 
On the regulatory front, Columbia Gulf 2010 $50 million general rate case moved forward with the company placing new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. Columbia Gulf and the parties to the case are actively engaged in discussions to resolve the case. 
As you can see, the NGT&S team continues to execute on its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low risk, high value growth opportunities.
To wrap up, 2 key points. First, we're squarely in line with our expectations and remain on track to meet the net operating earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non GAAP, for 2011. Second, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually, perhaps a bit more in the near term, so we execute on our Indiana business and regulatory agenda. 
As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today, and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource.

Process wise, we believe we're still up in that sweet spot or that window of time, where we believe we can reach a resolution. There's another round of evidentiary hearings scheduled for mid month. That will again involve NIPSCO witnesses [ph] talking about cost allocation, rate design and the like. The intervener stakeholders are then slated to present their testimony.

And, James, sure you've seen some of the announcements from U.S. Steel and Mills about a relatively bullish outlook on demand through the first 3 quarters of the year.

We're also up fairly strongly first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So again, we're seeing a reasonably good amount of strength in that area. I just remind you and everybody that our plan assumes a very measured, relatively slow recovery of the economy. So our outlook's not premised on a spike in demand. And, again, we're encouraged by this but our plan's not predicated on this being sustained over the near term. Paul, I'm sorry, Jay, you also mentioned gas volumes. And again, you see some pretty good strength across the footprint on industrial manufacturing throughput. So again, we're encouraged, the plan is not predicated on those sorts of increases continuing, but we feel pretty good about where we stand. And just one other editorial, and I know you recognize that on the industrial side, particularly on the gas side of our business, the margins for incremental throughput are relatively thin, relatively thin. So you're not going to see huge pops in revenue associated with that. And I'd also say on the electric side, we need the strength in the economy. We certainly enjoy the strength in the production. But again, a lot of the margin revenues are not being driven by those industrial increases."

Again, these are unusual out of the ordinary sorts of occurrences, I think, that do skew the quarter a bit. But when you drill down and look on the NGT&S numbers, several notable pluses and takeaways that continue for the balance of the year and going forward. Number one, you'll see demand and commodity revenues are up in a very positive fashion, again reflecting projects, re contracting and the like. You'll also see that volumes are up considerably. And third, their underlying expense structure continues to be well managed, aggressively managed. And then last but not least, beginning in May, we have the lift from the Columbia Gulf rate case. We'll reserve a portion of that case, but nonetheless, we'll have a significant lift coming in.

Would we consider opportunities to enable or to leverage our ongoing investments in the area? Sure. But they're going to have to meet our risk return profile. And again, we do believe there are opportunities in that region. We've said this consistently, we don't see production levels at levels that would support large scale, long line expansion projects.

Without a doubt, without a question, the primary focus is going to be leveraging this Marcellus opportunity that we have. That's job 1, 2 and 3. And as you recognize, that's a supply push, a producer push sort of opportunity. We are not going to predicate our entire growth on supply push, so we are looking for demand opportunities on system, adjacent to the system. So we are going to continue to look at demand opportunities. I mentioned the one power generation project that we are actively advancing. That's a good example of continuing to focus on the demand side of the market. The opportunity that you mentioned is called Kennesaw. And again, it represents demand focused opportunity for us. It's a potential opportunity to provide an outlet or another market for Marcellus gas. As you suggested, this project is in the early, early stage of development. So that's one of the reasons it's not reflected in our formal comments today because we're actively working the market to determine whether this has a real potential for us. So that's the overview on where we stand. This project is a long term sort of look. And I'd just close out by saying our tenants for growth remain the same. And anything we do is going to be focused, is going to be disciplined. Project, or projects will be 100% contracted for. And as you know, we try to actively risk manage projects through the use of structured arrangements, joint venture partners or whatever.

So first I'll touch on a few key takeaways from our first quarter performance. Next, I'll note several key highlights for NiSource and each of our business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions. 
To kick off, a few key takeaways from the first quarter. If you turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental materials, you'll see several headlines but the core message is this, we're on track. 
First and foremost, our numbers are on track, perhaps more so than immediately meets the eye, as I'll touch on in a moment. The strength of this year's performance, if anything, is obscured a bit by a few items. So again, the overriding takeaway is that NiSource's regulatory, commercial and operational fundamentals are quite strong and our year-to-date performance is squarely in line with our 2011 earnings outlook. 
Second, our Indiana strategy is on track. As you know, a key focus for our NIPSCO team is successful resolution of our 2010 electric rate case. That case is moving forward, and we still expect resolution at the end of the year or early next year. 
Third, we're also building on our track record of successful regulatory and infrastructure modernization programs at our gas utilities. These efforts are generating positive results this year, and will continue to build long-term shareholder and customer value going forward. 
And finally, we remain on track with our growth investments at our Gas Pipeline and Storage business, with a particular emphasis on those projects that leverage our very attractive footprint in the Marcellus Shale region. 
Underpinning all these efforts is our commitment to effective financial management, and a strong liquidity profile is demonstrated by our new $1.5 billion 4 year revolving credit facility that we closed in early March. 
So the 10 second sound bite is this, NiSource is on track to deliver on a robust agenda of infrastructure investments paired with exceptional commercial and regulatory execution. 
With that preface, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with our overall financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered first quarter net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $202 million or $0.72 per share. As I mentioned a moment ago, the year-over-year comparison is skewed a bit by 3 items: first, the quarter's revenues were reduced almost $20 million as a result of rate design changes under last year's favorable NIPSCO gas rate case settlement. Notably, those revenue impacts will be mitigated through the course of the year. Second, during the quarter, we recorded a non-recurring $8 million accounting charge related to environmental costs at NIPSCO. And third, in last year's first quarter, we recognized revenues of about $8 million, associated with the sale of native storage gas. 
When you take these items into consideration and consider the strong fundamentals posted for the quarter, you get a clearer picture of the ongoing earnings momentum we're building here at NiSource. 
With that, let's dive into our individual business unit results, starting with Indiana and our Electric business on Slide 5. 
Our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve performance, modernize services and rates and restore NIPSCO's earnings to an appropriate level. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported first quarter operating earnings of about $42 million compared to $46 million for the same period in 2010. Notably, NIPSCO saw an increase in its industrial margins and usage that helped drive a net revenue increase of about $9 million, excluding trackers. 
Operating expenses increased by about $13 million over last year's levels. However, that jump was due in large measure to the environmental charge that I mentioned a moment ago. On the regulatory front, NIPSCO remains on track to establish new electric base rates by late 2011 or early 2012. While the formal rate case process continues to move forward, NIPSCO is actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its stakeholders. Once resolved, we're confident the case will position the company for ongoing growth through continued customer focus, investments in service, reliability and environmental infrastructure. 
Speaking of investments, NIPSCO is moving ahead on installation of a new Flue Gas Desulfurization or FGD unit at our Schahfer Generating Station.  Preliminary engineering is complete, and the crews have prepped the site and started construction. You'll recall that this is the first of a number of FGD units planned across NIPSCO's system. These investments, more than $600 million over 6 to 8 years, will strengthen earnings while creating hundreds of project-related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. Together, these new units will reduce SOx emissions by an additional 80% beyond current levels.
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group on Slide 6. 
Our Gas Distribution operating earnings for the quarter were about $237 million compared to about $235 million during the same period in 2010. As I noted earlier, there's a bit of noise, net revenues excluding trackers were down due to the change in NIPSCO gas rate design, as were expenses. 
On the investment front, Columbia Gas Kentucky, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Columbia Gas of Ohio, and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania all continued to advance their significant infrastructure modernization programs during the first quarter. These ongoing programs, which began more than 3 years ago, proactively and systemically replaced portions of our system to ensure continued reliable and efficient service, at the same time, growing earnings. As we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity, in fact, just last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on our most recent filing to recover costs associated with our infrastructure replacement and energy efficiency programs, which will increase yearly revenues by about $24 million effective May 1. 
And in Pennsylvania, our team is advancing a base rate case filed in January, seeking enhanced revenues of about $38 million. The rate case is paired with an improved rate design, and new programs to help senior citizens and others better manage their energy costs. We expect to resolve that case by year's end. 
Without question, we believe the strong focus on infrastructure, modernization at our utilities, along with appropriate regulatory treatment, will benefit our customers and communities, as well as NiSource's shareholders for decades to come. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage Operations, highlighted on Slide 7. 
Here, the team's focus continues to be on market-driven growth projects, with particular emphasis on our extensive opportunities in the Marcellus Shale region. From an earnings standpoint, the NGT&S team generated operating earnings of about $119 million in the first quarter compared to about $126 million in 2010. Net revenues were relatively flat for the quarter, as a result of last year's native storage gas sales. Operating expenses were up only about $3 million. 
Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue an inventory of growth projects, ranging from traditional transportation and storage services, to power generation, supply aggregation, and other Marcellus production-related projects. Some of our other near-term Marcellus investment includes the Clendenin and Smithfield projects, Line WB, and the Southern Appalachia project. Together, these projects will generate about 0.5 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity. 
Also driven by increased Marcellus production, Millennium Pipeline completed a binding open season for proposed mainline expansion projects to provide incremental firm transportation capacity to northeast markets. Notably, prior to the open season, the company executed binding preceding  agreements with 2 anchor shippers. 
We're also advancing the new power generation project in the mid-Atlantic region. Although we can't share specific details at this time, it's clear the power generation market has real potential for us, given our strategic footprint between major generation hubs and the Marcellus Shale region. You'll soon see our FERC certification filing for this power gen [generation] project. 
On the regulatory front, Columbia Gulf 2010 $50 million general rate case moved forward with the company placing new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. Columbia Gulf and the parties to the case are actively engaged in discussions to resolve the case. 
As you can see, the NGT&S team continues to execute on its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low risk, high value growth opportunities.
To wrap up, 2 key points. First, we're squarely in line with our expectations and remain on track to meet the net operating earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non-GAAP, for 2011. Second, we remain confident that NiSource will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3% to 5% annually, perhaps a bit more in the near term, so we execute on our Indiana business and regulatory agenda. 
As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today, and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource.

That will again involve NIPSCO witnesses [ph] talking about cost allocation, rate design and the like. The intervener stakeholders are then slated to present their testimony. I believe it's in August, give or take, Paul. So we believe between now and August, Labor Day, we have that window of opportunity to work with the stakeholders and they continue to be responsive, constructive and we're working hard at achieving that settlement."

And, James, sure you've seen some of the announcements from U.S. Steel and Mills about a relatively bullish outlook on demand through the first 3 quarters of the year.

We're also up fairly strongly first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So again, we're seeing a reasonably good amount of strength in that area. I just remind you and everybody that our plan assumes a very measured, relatively slow recovery of the economy. So our outlook's not premised on a spike in demand. And, again, we're encouraged by this but our plan's not predicated on this being sustained over the near term. Paul, I'm sorry, Jay, you also mentioned gas volumes. And again, you see some pretty good strength across the footprint on industrial manufacturing throughput. So again, we're encouraged, the plan is not predicated on those sorts of increases continuing, but we feel pretty good about where we stand. And just one other editorial, and I know you recognize that on the industrial side, particularly on the gas side of our business, the margins for incremental throughput are relatively thin, relatively thin. So you're not going to see huge pops in revenue associated with that. And I'd also say on the electric side, we need the strength in the economy. We certainly enjoy the strength in the production. But again, a lot of the margin revenues are not being driven by those industrial increases."

Again, these are unusual out of the ordinary sorts of occurrences, I think, that do skew the quarter a bit. But when you drill down and look on the NGT&S numbers, several notable pluses and takeaways that continue for the balance of the year and going forward. Number one, you'll see demand and commodity revenues are up in a very positive fashion, again reflecting projects, re-contracting and the like. You'll also see that volumes are up considerably. And third, their underlying expense structure continues to be well-managed, aggressively managed. And then last but not least, beginning in May, we have the lift from the Columbia Gulf rate case. We'll reserve a portion of that case, but nonetheless, we'll have a significant lift coming in.

We are not going to predicate our entire growth on supply push, so we are looking for demand opportunities on system, adjacent to the system. So we are going to continue to look at demand opportunities. I mentioned the one power generation project that we are actively advancing. That's a good example of continuing to focus on the demand side of the market. The opportunity that you mentioned is called Kennesaw. And again, it represents demand focused opportunity for us. It's a potential opportunity to provide an outlet or another market for Marcellus gas. As you suggested, this project is in the early, early stage of development. So that's one of the reasons it's not reflected in our formal comments today because we're actively working the market to determine whether this has a real potential for us. So that's the overview on where we stand. This project is a long-term sort of look. And I'd just close out by saying our tenants for growth remain the same. And anything we do is going to be focused, is going to be disciplined. Project, or projects will be 100% contracted for.

This morning's agenda is brief to allow as much time as possible for questions and discussion. To start off, I'll touch on a few takeaways from our second quarter including outstanding progress the team has made in executing our business plan. I will then turn to key highlights for NiSource in each of our business units. And then we'll open the line to your questions. 
First, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck. As you'll see from the highlight accomplishments for the quarter, we've made significant progress across NiSource in delivering on our balanced four-part strategy for long-term sustainable growth. 
Turning first to Indiana, as most of you know on July 18, we filed a landmark settlement with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission of NIPSCO's 2010 electric rate case. The settlement, which enjoys widespread support, is the product of literally months of extensive discussions with customers and other regulatory stakeholders. 
The agreement resolves all issues in the preceding -- will establish foundation for NIPSCO to make ongoing investments in Northern Indiana's energy infrastructure. These investments will help fuel job creation, improve reliability, pave the way for new customer programs and provide reasonable return for shareholders. 
In terms of financial impact, the settlement is approved by the IURC would permission NIPSCO to deliver results fully in line with our expectations. We expect the party's attention is now keenly focused on the approval process. Together, we've asked the IURC to act on the settlement by year-end so the new rates can be placed into effect by early 2012. 
Also on the regulatory front, in early July we filed a partial settlement of our Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania rate case. If approved, the case will increase revenues by about $17 million annually. Among the two issues reserved for a determination by the Pennsylvania Commission is the prospective rate design for residential customers. 
As many of you know, rate design reform is an area where we have made significant progress in the number for states, and we're pleased to have the opportunity to make our case with the Pennsylvania Commission. We anticipate a resolution of the litigated issues as well as the settlement in time to place new rates into effect during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage or NGT&S unit delivered second quarter earnings that were impacted positively by a number of projects completed during the second half of 2010. The NGT&S team is delivering projects on time and on budget and is continuing to build a solid portfolio of projects particularly in the Marcellus supplier. 
Also noted on Slide 3, we remain committed to thoughtful and disciplined management and in particular to maintaining the strength and flexibility to execute our long-term $1 billion plus annual capital expenditure program. 
During the second quarter, our finance team completed a $400 million three-year bond offering, taking advantage of very attractive interest rate environment. 
We also introduced a $500 million commercial paper program, which further diversifies our short-term funding sources and is fully supported by our recently renewed revolving credit facility. 
Although not mentioned on the slide, on the equity side of the balance sheet, as most of you know during September of last year we successfully executed a $400 million forward equity sale, which we can draw upon at anytime through September of next year. Now it adds up. As we discussed on prior calls, our modeling assumption has been to draw half of the equity this September and the balance in September of 2012. With that said, we've not yet made a firm decision on timing, given our strong cash position including a significant positive impact of bonus depreciation. We're now considering the possibility of drawing the entire amount of the equity during the second half of next year. 
Back to Slide 3, on a macro level, the key take-away in the second quarter is that we're on track to deliver 2011 earnings solidly in line with our guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share non-GAAP. 
With those highlights in the backdrop, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with the snapshot of our financials on Slide 4. As you can see, we delivered second quarter net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $46 million or $0.17 per share compared to $0.13 per share in 2010. Our operating earnings increased for the quarter to approximately $162 million. 
Turning to our individual business units, let's start with Indiana with our Electric business to summarize on Slide 5. In addition to the breakthrough progress on the electric rate case, our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve operating performance, meet customer needs and modernize our services and rates. 
On the operations front, we were particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of our electric generation fleet as well as our transmission and distribution systems during the recent period of unprecedented hot weather across our operating area. On multiple locations, we reached peak generation levels at near-record levels. From a financial standpoint, electric reported second quarter operating earnings of about $37 million compared to $48 million in the same period in 2010. 
Revenues were essentially unchanged while operating expenses increased by $11 million over last year's levels primarily due to higher planned electric generation cost. 
Looking forward to the rate settlement, if approved by the IURC, it will provide the underpinning for ongoing customer focus infrastructure investments and service reliability and environmental improvements and sustainable earnings growth for the company. 
On the customer front, we recently received approval from the IURC on NIPSCO's electric and net metering programs. These programs allow customers to generate more of their electricity using renewable energy to offset these utility costs. 
In addition, just last week the IURC approved NIPSCO's request for a variety of new electric energy efficiency programs designed to help the company's electric customers reduce their energy consumption and save money. 
And last but certainly not least, NIPSCO's Flue Gas Desulfurization or FGD units at the company's Schahfer generating station are under construction and remain on schedule and on budget. As you'll recall, our investments in the FGD units to approximately $850 million in investment stream over the next 8 years or so will strengthen earnings while upgrading hundreds of project-related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. 
Let's shift now to our Gas Distribution Group discussed on Slide 6. NiSource Gas Distribution or NGD operating earnings for the quarter were about $49 million compared to about $36 million during the same period in 2010. Revenues were relatively unchanged while operating expenses were about $12 million less than last year primarily as a result of lower depreciation costs. 
On the regulatory front, as noted earlier, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania rate case is pending before the Pennsylvania Commission and new rates are expected to be placed into effect in the fourth quarter of the year. 
In addition, our investments in infrastructure modernization programs in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania all continue to advance. As we've highlighted in prior discussions, these investments are designed to ensure continued safe, reliable and efficient service while at the same time growing NGD's earnings on a long-term sustainable basis. 
And we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity. Most recently on June 1, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for accelerating the recovery of certain infrastructure projects consistent with the law passed by the Virginia Legislature in 2010. We expect a decision from the commission in the fourth quarter. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage operations highlighted on Slide 7.  Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue an inventory of growth projects to serve, supply aggregation in other Marcellus production related capacity requirements as well as growing natural gas needs of the power generation industry. 
From an earnings standpoint, NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $85 million in the second quarter compared to about $75 million in 2010. Net revenues were about $14 million higher as a result of growth projects placed into service in 2010 as was the impact of new rates placed into effect subject to refund by Columbia Gulf in May. 
Operating expenses were up about $6 million over the last quarter due to higher employee and administrative expenses and depreciation costs. 
During the quarter, the team completed 2 significant Marcellus related projects, our Southern Appalachian and Clendenin projects. 
Other ongoing investments include the Rimersburg Expansion, the Smithfield project and the Line WB expansion. These and other projects were highlighted on the key markers slide on the last page of the appendix for the supplemental materials. 
I would also mention that as noted in this morning's press release, NGT&S has added a number of industry veterans to senior commercial leadership ranks over the last several months. These key adds will support the NGT&S ability to capitalize on midstream and other commercial opportunities available across its extensive footprint. 
In terms of investments to meet growing power generation demand, in May NGT&S filed an application with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the FERC to construct a pipeline infrastructure to provide 240,000 dekatherms of firm transportation to Virginia Power's planned 1300-megawatt gas fire generation facility in Warren County, Virginia. Pending approval by the FERC, the project is expected to be placed into service in 2014. NGT&S continues to actively pursue similar projects to serve new natural gas field electric generation markets including coal conversion opportunities. 
On the regulatory front, as I mentioned, Columbia Gulf placed new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. The regulatory team currently is in advanced discussions with customers and other stakeholders to settle the case on a mutually acceptable basis so stay tuned. In the meantime, NGT&S remains intently focused on the continued execution of its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low-risk, high-value growth opportunities. 
To wrap up, as this quarter's and year-to-date attest, the NiSource team is continuing to build on its track record of delivering collaborative regulatory and commercial solutions for its customers and making disciplined, low-risk investments on a sustainable basis. As a team, it's dedicated to maintaining its high level of performance through the balance of the year and hitting the ground running in 2012. Although much work certainly lies ahead, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to look to deliver on our commitments including our commitment to grow earnings in the 5% zip code on a long-term sustainable basis. As always, we'll communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on www.nisource.com.

There have been two rounds of testimony submitted to support the settlement agreement. One that was buy the company by NIPSCO. Second step that I recommend you may take a look at is very, very well done testimony by interveners that support the testimonies. In about mid-August, will see another submission of testimony. There's one group that does not support the summit so we expect to see that circa mid-August. Then in mid-September, there'll be a hearing on the settlement against the document, the agreement and move it to the next step. As you know and recall, the settlement provides for commission approval by year-end. So that's what everyone is working on to secure that approval so that rates can go into effect first of 2012."

Number one, it's a shoulder shorter month or shorter shoulder period, shoulder quarter on the gas side certainly on the electric set. So for us, it's hard to draw any firm conclusions of what's going on in the residential and commercial fronts. Our assumption as we provided outlooks to the financial markets has been that the residential market will be relatively flat in terms of usage. We still believe that is the case. And I think from one quarter particularly as a shoulder quarter, it's hard to draw additional conclusions and insights beyond that. So we wouldn't read too much into it. Just to make a bit of an editorial comment about the economy in Northwest Indiana, it continues to be somewhat sluggish. We see a few signs of accelerated recovery but certainly nothing that we would consider to be a trend. As you indicated, the industrial volumes look pretty good for the quarter. But again we would just that we believe the recovery is going to be very slow, very measured. Our plan reflects that. Our plan does not reflect any robust recovery in any of the usage or deliveries in the entire footprint."

We were looking at small, organic, discrete drop-down projects that would build a small MLP, again the growth that that opportunity 3 or 4 years ago, small individualized projects that were discrete. As the market has changed and the growth profile has changed, we're now seeing growth projects on our system that are integrated, intertwined with our system. They tend to be de- bottlenecking, looping, adding compression on existing facilities and those projects haven't been amenable to a small drop-down strategy. So we have not seen, technically speaking, a good fit for the MLP when we look at our current growth profile. And I would emphasize current growth profile. Again, we're not just counting this out of hand. When we looked at other forms of MLP, we had concerns because our current assets are very low tax-based assets so that has been a consideration. Last but not least, it's less of a -- previously is credit agency concern. Two years ago, three years ago, credit rating concerns were accrued. And we felt an MLP might disturb the view of the credit rating agencies around NiSource. So those are some of the key considerations that we had to deal with in the past and we currently are dealing with."

This morning's agenda is brief to allow as much time as possible for questions and discussion. To start things off, I'll touch on a few takeaways from our second quarter, including outstanding progress the team has made in executing our business plan. I'll then turn to key highlights for NiSource in each of our business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions. 
First, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck. As you'll see from the highlight of accomplishments for the quarter, we've made significant progress across NiSource in delivering on our balanced 4-part strategy for long-term sustainable growth. 
Turning first to Indiana. As most of you know, on July 18, we filed a landmark settlement with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission of NIPSCO's 2010 electric rate case. The settlement, which enjoys widespread support, is the product of literally months of extensive discussions with customers and other regulatory stakeholders. 
The agreement resolves all issues in the preceding -- will establish the foundation for NIPSCO to make ongoing investments in Northern Indiana's energy infrastructure. These investments will help fuel job creation, improve reliability, pave the way for new customer programs and provide a reasonable return for shareholders. 
In terms of financial impacts, we're confident the settlement, if approved by the IURC, would position NIPSCO to deliver results fully in line with our expectations. As you would expect, the party's attention is now keenly focused on the approval process. And together, we've asked the IURC to act on the settlement by year end so the new rates can be placed into effect by early 2012. 
Also on the regulatory front, in early July, we filed a partial settlement of our Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania rate case. If approved, the case will increase revenues by about $17 million annually. Among the 2 issues reserved for a determination by the Pennsylvania Commission is the prospective rate design for residential customers. 
As many of you know, rate design reform is an area where we have made significant progress in a number of our states. And we're pleased to have the opportunity to make our case with the Pennsylvania Commission. We anticipate a resolution of the litigated issues as well as the settlement in time to place new rates into effect during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage, or NGT&S, unit delivered second quarter earnings that were impacted positively by a number of growth projects completed during the second half of 2010. The NGT&S team is delivering projects on time and on budget, and is continuing to build a solid portfolio of projects particularly in the Marcellus supply area. 
Also noted on Slide 3, we remain committed to thoughtful and disciplined financial management and in particular to maintaining the strength and flexibility to execute our long-term $1 billion plus annual capital expenditure program. 
During the second quarter, our finance team completed a $400 million 3-year bond offering, taking advantage of a very attractive interest rate environment. 
We also introduced a $500 million commercial paper program, which further diversifies our short-term funding sources and is fully supported by our recently renewed revolving credit facility. 
Although not mentioned on the slide, on the equity side of the balance sheet, as most of you know during September of last year, we successfully executed a $400 million forward equity sale, which we can draw upon at anytime through September of next year. Now a bit of a heads up, as we discussed on prior calls, our modeling assumption has been to draw half of the equity this September and the balance in September of 2012. That said, we've not yet made a firm decision on timing. Given our strong cash position including the significant positive impact of bonus depreciation, we're now considering the possibility of drawing the entire amount of the equity during the second half of next year. 
Back to Slide 3, on a macro level, the key takeaway in the second quarter is that we're on track to deliver 2011 earnings solidly in line with our guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share non-GAAP. 
With those highlights in the backdrop, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with the snapshot of our financials on Slide 4. As you can see, we delivered second quarter net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $46 million or $0.17 per share compared to $0.13 per share in 2010. And our operating earnings increased for the quarter to approximately $162 million. 
Turning to our individual business units. Let's start with Indiana with our electric business to summarize on Slide 5. In addition to the breakthrough progress on the electric rate case, our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve operating performance, meet customer needs and modernize our services and rates. 
On the operations front, we were particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of our electric generation fleet, as well as our transmission and distribution systems during the recent period of unprecedented hot weather across our operating area. On multiple occasions, we reached peak generation levels at near-record levels. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported second quarter operating earnings of about $37 million compared to $48 million for the same period in 2010. 
Revenues were essentially unchanged. While operating expenses increased by about $11 million over last year's levels, primarily due to higher planned electric generation cost. 
Looking forward to rate case settlement, if approved by the IURC, will provide the underpinning for ongoing customer focus, infrastructure investments in service, reliability and environmental improvements and sustainable earnings growth for the company. 
On the customer front, we recently received approval from the IURC on NIPSCO's feed-in electric and net metering programs. These programs allow customers to generate more of their own electricity using renewable energy to offset the utility costs. 
In addition, just last week, the IURC approved NIPSCO's request for a variety of new electric energy efficiency programs designed to help the company's electric customers reduce their energy consumption and save money. 
And last but certainly not least, NIPSCO's Flue Gas Desulfurization, or FGD, units at the company's Schahfer Generating Station are under construction and remain on schedule and on budget. As you'll recall, our investments in the FGD units, part of an up to approximately $850 million environmental investment stream over the next 8 years or so, will strengthen earnings while upgrading hundreds of project-related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. 
Let's shift now to our Gas Distribution Group discussed on Slide 6. NiSource Gas Distribution, or NGD, operating earnings for the quarter were about $49 million compared to about $36 million during the same period in 2010. Revenues were relatively unchanged. While operating expenses were about $12 million less than last year, primarily as a result of lower depreciation costs. 
On the regulatory front, as noted earlier, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania base rate case is pending before the Pennsylvania Commission, and new rates are expected to be placed into effect in the fourth quarter of the year. 
In addition, our investments in infrastructure modernization programs in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania all continue to advance. As we've highlighted in prior discussions, these investments are designed to ensure continued safe, reliable and efficient service while at the same time growing NGD's earnings on a long-term sustainable basis. 
And we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity. Most recently on June 1, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for accelerating the recovery of certain infrastructure projects consistent with the law passed by the Virginia Legislature in 2010. We expect a decision from the commission in the fourth quarter. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage operations highlighted on Slide 7. Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue an inventory of growth projects to serve, supply aggregation in other Marcellus production-related capacity requirements as well as growing natural gas needs of the power generation industry. 
From an earnings standpoint, NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $85 million in the second quarter compared to about $75 million in 2010. Net revenues were about $14 million higher as a result of growth projects placed into service in 2010, as well as the impact of new rates placed into effect subject to refund by Columbia Gulf in May. 
Operating expenses were up about $6 million over last quarter due to higher employee and administrative expenses and depreciation costs. 
During the quarter, the team completed 2 significant Marcellus-related projects, our Southern Appalachian and Clendenin projects. 
Other ongoing investments include the Rimersburg Expansion, the Smithfield project and the Line WB Expansion. These and other projects were highlighted on the key marker slide on the last page of the appendix to the supplemental materials. 
I would also mention that as noted in this morning's press release, NGT&S has added a number of industry veterans to its senior commercial leadership ranks over the last several months. These key adds will support NGT&S' ability to capitalize on midstream and other commercial opportunities available across its extensive footprint. 
In terms of investments to meet growing power generation demand, in May, NGT&S filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, to construct the pipeline infrastructure to provide 240,000 dekatherms of firm transportation to Virginia Power's planned 1,300-megawatt gas-fired generation facility in Warren County, Virginia. Pending approval by the FERC, the project is expected to be placed into service in 2014. NGT&S continues to actively pursue similar projects to serve new natural gas-fueled electric generation markets including coal conversion opportunities. 
On the regulatory front, as I mentioned, Columbia Gulf placed new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. The regulatory team currently is in advanced discussions with customers and other stakeholders to settle the case on a mutually acceptable basis, stay tuned. In the meantime, NGT&S remains intently focused on the continued execution of its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low-risk, high-value growth opportunities. 
To wrap up, as this quarter's and year-to-date results attest, the NiSource team is continuing to build on its track record of delivering collaborative regulatory and commercial solutions for its customers and making disciplined, low-risk investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. As the team is dedicated to maintaining its high level of performance through the balance of the year and to hitting the ground running in 2012. Although much work certainly lies ahead, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to look to deliver on our commitments, including our commitment to grow earnings in the 5% zip code on a long-term sustainable basis. As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com.

If you recall that our stated intention is to deploy about $200 million in that region of the Marcellus on an annual basis. This year, we're going to spend about $150 million. So we certainly want to ramp that up, accelerate it and hit the $200 million mark in that area. We continue to see opportunities, and the team's charge is to capture those opportunities. You also hit though on the other consideration and that's the emergence of the Utica play, particularly in Ohio and Western Pennsylvania -- Eastern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.

We see a few signs of accelerated recovery but certainly nothing that we would consider to be a trend. As you indicated, the industrial volumes look pretty good for the quarter.

Number one, we originally looked at the MLP as an opportunity. We, in fact, filed with the SEC for the opportunity. We were looking at small, organic, discrete drop-down projects that would build a small MLP. Again, the growth that, that opportunity 3 or 4 years ago, small individualized projects that were discrete. As the market has changed and the growth profile has changed, we're now seeing growth projects on our system that are integrated, intertwined with our system. They tend to be add-ons, bolt-ons, debottlenecking, looping, added compression on existing facilities, and those projects haven't been amenable to a small drop-down strategy. So we have not seen, technically speaking, a good fit for the MLP when we look at our current growth profile, and I would emphasize current growth profile. Again, we're not discounting this out of hand. When we looked at other forms of the MLP, we've a had concern because of tax basis. Our current assets are very, very low, tax-based assets, so that's been a consideration. Last but not least, it's less of a -- may in certain quarters be less of an issue today than it was previously is credit agency concern.

This morning's agenda is brief to allow as much time as possible for questions and discussion. To start things off, I'll touch on a few takeaways from our second quarter, including outstanding progress the team has made in executing our business plan. I'll then turn to key highlights for NiSource in each of our business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions. 
First, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck. As you'll see from the highlighted accomplishments for the quarter, we've made significant progress across NiSource in delivering on our balanced 4-part strategy for long-term sustainable growth. 
Turning first to Indiana. As most of you know, on July 18, we filed a landmark settlement with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission of NIPSCO's 2010 electric rate case. The settlement, which enjoys widespread support, is the product of literally months of extensive discussions with customers and other regulatory stakeholders. 
The agreement resolves all issues in the preceding -- would establish the foundation for NIPSCO to make ongoing investments in Northern Indiana's energy infrastructure. These investments will help fuel job creation, improve reliability, pave the way for new customer programs and provide a reasonable return for shareholders. 
In terms of financial impacts, we're confident the settlement, if approved by the IURC, would position NIPSCO to deliver results fully in line with our expectations. As you would expect, the party's attention is now keenly focused on the approval process. And together, we've asked the IURC to act on the settlement by year end so the new rates can be placed into effect by early 2012. 
Also on the regulatory front, in early July, we filed a partial settlement of our Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania rate case. If approved, the case will increase revenues by about $17 million annually. Among the 2 issues reserved for a determination by the Pennsylvania Commission is the prospective rate design for residential customers. 
As many of you know, rate design reform is an area where we have made significant progress in a number of our states. And we're pleased to have the opportunity to make our case with the Pennsylvania Commission. We anticipate a resolution of the litigated issues as well as the settlement in time to place new rates into effect during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage, or NGT&S, unit delivered second quarter earnings that were impacted positively by a number of growth projects completed during the second half of 2010. The NGT&S team is delivering projects on time and on budget, and is continuing to build a solid portfolio of projects particularly in the Marcellus supply area. 
Also noted on Slide 3, we remain committed to thoughtful and disciplined financial management and in particular to maintaining the strength and flexibility to execute our long-term $1 billion plus annual capital expenditure program. 
During the second quarter, our finance team completed a $400 million 30-year bond offering, taking advantage of a very attractive interest rate environment. 
We also introduced a $500 million commercial paper program, which further diversifies our short-term funding sources and is fully supported by our recently renewed revolving credit facility. 
Although not mentioned on the slide, on the equity side of the balance sheet, as most of you know during September of last year, we successfully executed a $400 million forward equity sale, which we can draw upon at anytime through September of next year. Now a bit of a heads up, as we discussed on prior calls, our modeling assumption has been to draw half of the equity this September and the balance in September of 2012. That said, we've not yet made a firm decision on timing. Given our strong cash position including the significant positive impact of bonus depreciation, we're now considering the possibility of drawing the entire amount of the equity during the second half of next year. 
Back to Slide 3, on a macro level, the key takeaway for the second quarter is that we're on track to deliver 2011 earnings solidly in line with our guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share non-GAAP. 
With those highlights as a backdrop, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with the snapshot of our financials on Slide 4. As you can see, we delivered second quarter net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $46 million or $0.17 per share compared to $0.13 per share in 2010. And our operating earnings increased for the quarter to approximately $162 million. 
Turning to our individual business units. Let's start in Indiana with our electric business as summarized on Slide 5. In addition to the breakthrough progress on the electric rate case, our Indiana team continues to make significant progress on our efforts to improve operating performance, meet customer needs and modernize our services and rates. 
On the operations front, we were particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of our electric generation fleet, as well as our transmission and distribution systems during the recent period of unprecedented hot weather across our operating area. On multiple occasions, we reached peak generation levels at near-record levels. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported second quarter operating earnings of about $37 million compared to $48 million for the same period in 2010. 
Revenues were essentially unchanged. While operating expenses increased by about $11 million over last year's levels, primarily due to higher planned electric generation cost. 
Looking forward to rate case settlement, if approved by the IURC, will provide the underpinning for ongoing customer focus, infrastructure investments in service, reliability and environmental improvements and sustainable earnings growth for the company. 
On the customer front, we recently received approval from the IURC on NIPSCO's feed-in electric and net metering programs. These programs allow customers to generate more of their own electricity using renewable energy to offset their utility costs. 
In addition, just last week, the IURC approved NIPSCO's request for a variety of new electric energy efficiency programs designed to help the company's electric customers reduce their energy consumption and save money. 
And last but certainly not least, NIPSCO's Flue Gas Desulfurization, or FGD units at the company's Schahfer Generating Station are under construction and remain on schedule and on budget. As you'll recall, our investments in these FGD units, is part of an up to approximately $850 million environmental investment stream over the next 8 years or so, will strengthen earnings while creating hundreds of project-related jobs and improving the environment and economic vitality of the region. 
Let's shift now to our Gas Distribution Group discussed on Slide 6. NiSource Gas Distribution, or NGD, operating earnings for the quarter were about $49 million compared to about $36 million during the same period in 2010. Revenues were relatively unchanged. While operating expenses were about $12 million less than last year, primarily as a result of lower depreciation costs. 
On the regulatory front, as noted earlier, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania base rate case is pending before the Pennsylvania Commission, and new rates are expected to be placed into effect in the fourth quarter of the year. 
In addition, our investments in infrastructure modernization programs in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania all continue to advance. As we've highlighted in prior discussions, these investments are designed to ensure continued safe, reliable and efficient service while at the same time growing NGD's earnings on a long-term sustainable basis. 
And we continue to pair these programs with complementary regulatory activity. Most recently on June 1, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for accelerating the recovery of certain infrastructure projects consistent with the law passed by the Virginia Legislature in 2010. We expect a decision from the commission in the fourth quarter. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource's Gas Transmission & Storage operations highlighted on Slide 7. Commercially, our NGT&S team continues to aggressively pursue an inventory of growth projects to serve supplier aggregation in other Marcellus production-related capacity requirements as well as growing natural gas needs of the power generation industry. 
From an earnings standpoint, NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $85 million in the second quarter compared to about $75 million in 2010. Net revenues were about $14 million higher as a result of growth projects placed into service in 2010, as well as the impact of new rates placed into effect subject to refund by Columbia Gulf in May. 
Operating expenses were up about $6 million over last year due to higher employee and administrative expenses and depreciation costs. 
During the quarter, the team completed 2 significant Marcellus-related projects, our Southern Appalachian and Clendenin projects. 
Other ongoing investments include the Rimersburg Expansion, the Smithfield project and the Line WB Expansion. These and other projects were highlighted on the key marker slide on the last page of the appendix to the supplemental materials. 
I would also mention that as noted in this morning's press release, NGT&S has added a number of industry veterans to its senior commercial leadership ranks over the last several months. These key adds will support NGT&S' ability to capitalize on midstream and other commercial opportunities available across its extensive footprint. 
In terms of investments to meet growing power generation demand, in May, NGT&S filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, to construct the pipeline infrastructure to provide 240,000 dekatherms of firm transportation to Virginia Power's planned 1,300-megawatt gas-fired generation facility in Warren County, Virginia. Pending approval by the FERC, the project is expected to be placed into service in 2014. NGT&S continues to actively pursue similar projects to serve new natural gas-fueled electric generation markets including coal conversion opportunities. 
On the regulatory front, as I mentioned, Columbia Gulf placed new rates into effect subject to refund on May 1. The regulatory team currently is in advanced discussions with customers and other stakeholders to settle the case on a mutually acceptable basis, stay tuned. In the meantime, NGT&S remains intently focused on the continued execution of its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base and capturing disciplined, low-risk, high-value growth opportunities. 
To wrap up, as this quarter's and year-to-date results attest, the NiSource team is continuing to build on its track record of delivering collaborative regulatory and commercial solutions for its customers and making disciplined, low-risk investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. And the team is dedicated to maintaining its solid level of performance through the balance of the year and to hitting the ground running in 2012. Although much work certainly lies ahead, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to look to deliver on our commitments, including our commitment to grow earnings in the 5% zip code on a long-term sustainable basis. As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com.

So we certainly want to ramp that up, accelerate it and hit the $200 million mark in that area. We continue to see opportunities, and the team's charge is to capture those opportunities.

Our assumption as we provided outlooks to the financial markets has been that the residential market would be relatively flat in terms of usage. We still believe that is the case. And I think from one quarter particularly as a shoulder quarter, it's hard to draw additional conclusions and insights beyond that. So we wouldn't read too much into it. Just to make a bit of an editorial comment about the economy in Northwest Indiana, it continues to be somewhat sluggish. We see a few signs of accelerated recovery but certainly nothing that we would consider to be a trend. As you indicated, the industrial volumes look pretty good for the quarter. But again, we would just say that we believe the recovery is going to be very slow, very measured. Our plan reflects that.

I think you may have heard Steve, Glen and I talk to you and others about headroom on the multiple of our value. And then going forward, we believe that we ought to be valued more closely to high-quality gas LDCs.

Again, the growth that, that opportunity 3 or 4 years ago, small individualized projects that were discrete. As the market has changed and the growth profile has changed, we're now seeing growth projects on our system that are integrated, intertwined with our system. They tend to be add-ons, bolt-ons, debottlenecking, looping, added compression on existing facilities, and those projects haven't been amenable to a small drop-down strategy. So we have not seen, technically speaking, a good fit for the MLP when we look at our current growth profile, and I would emphasize current growth profile. Again, we're not discounting this out of hand. When we looked at other forms of the MLP, we've had a concern because of tax basis. Our current assets are very, very low, tax-based assets, so that's been a consideration. Last but not least, and it's less of a -- may in certain quarters be less of an issue today than it was previously is credit agency concern. And 2 years ago, 3 years ago, of course, credit rating concerns were acute. And we felt that an MLP might disturb the view of the credit rating agencies around NiSource.

This morning's agenda is crisp to allow time for your questions. To start things off, I'll start with a few key highlights that demonstrate the team's continued progress on executing NiSource's business plan. I'll provide a few specific updates on NiSource's results, as well as the performance of our key business units. And then, we'll open the line to your questions.
starting off, let's turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck, labeled key takeaways from the third quarter. I'll discuss in a moment. Despite sluggish economic conditions, our balanced investment driven strategy continues to deliver strong earnings growth and increased shareholder value. Our strategy also has remained true to our underlying commitments to do the right thing in enhancing customer service, modernizing our energy infrastructure, and expanding our network across the entire NiSource footprint.
As noted in this morning's release, our performance today has NiSource on pace to deliver earnings at the upper half of our 2011 guidance range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non-GAAP. NiSource is also on track to deliver double-digit shareholder returns for the third consecutive year, significantly outperforming the utility indices in the broader markets. 
This performance record as the direct result of the continued exceptional into an array of core across each segment of NiSource's businesses. Just a few examples, from a regulatory standpoint, we've received approval for significant a rate case settlement in Pennsylvania. We also advanced settlement of our Columbia Gulf rate case, as FERC approval targeted by the year end. In Indiana, our watershed electric rate case settlement remains on track for approval rate this year or early 2012. Meanwhile, NIPSCO's substantial environmental scrubber investment program at our Schahfer generating station remains on schedule and on budget. And then our Gas Transmission & Storage business, new CEO Jimmy -- is driving development and an aggressive, comprehensive plan to leverage NiSource's unparalleled position in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. 
With that premise, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with the financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered third quarter net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $33 million or $0.11 per share, compared to $0.04 per share in 2010. our operating earnings increased for the quarter from about $110 million to over $140 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, given our strong year-to-date performance, coupled with our expectations for the balance of the year, we expect that our full-year results will be in the upper half of our non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share for 2011. 
Shifting to our individual business unit results, let's start in Indiana with our electric business, as summarized on Slide 5. Defending on electric rate case settlements is an unquestionably huge milestone for NIPSCO, its customers and our many other Indiana stakeholders. This landmark agreement has been literally years in the making, sets the stage for NIPSCO to provide customers with reliable, competitively-priced electric service while making long-term investments in our infrastructure. This outcome contributes to the economic vitality, environmental sustainability of northern Indiana, while earning a fair return on NIPSCO's investment base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate receiving approval of the pending settlement by year-end or early 2012. Our Indiana team also continues to make significant progress on efforts to improve operating performance, meet customer needs and modernize our systems. For example, on the customer front, we received approval for a number of new electric energy efficiency programs that complement our existing natural gas conservation programs and help customers manage their energy costs. Progress also continues on significant environmental upgrades at NIPSCO's Schahfer Generating Station. I noted earlier, this work remains on schedule and on budget. As you'll recall, the shaper improvements are part of the NIPSCO environmental investments stream withi the next 6 to 8 years that will approach $900 million dollars. Taken together, these efforts are helping NIPSCO customers manage energy use, providing a long-term environment and economic benefits for northern Indiana, supporting stable and sustaining earnings growth.
The third quarter, our Electric Operations reported operating earnings of about $73 million, compared to $80 million for the same period in 2010. Revenues were down about $4 million, primarily reflecting lower environmental spend and associated cost recovery compared to the third quarter of 2010. Operating expenses increased by about $3 million, primarily due to higher employee administrative expenses and rate case costs. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage operations highlighted on Slide 6. Jimmy Staten and his team are working aggressively to advance key strategies to enhance system reliability and customer service, develop new growth projects, and leverage NiSource's strategic footprint the emerging shell production areas. The quarter NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $68 million compared to about $76 million in 2010. Net revenues were up about $11 million, thanks to growth projects placed into service, as well as the impact of new Columbia Gulf rates that took effects subject to refund in May. Operating expenses were up $19 million for the quarter due primarily to an adjustment of an environmental reserve totaling about $11 million. 
As I noted earlier, Jimmy and his team are intently focused on developing and deploying a robust comprehensive strategy for meeting customer needs, maximizing the value of our extensive pipeline and storage assets, and are attractive positions in the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions.
In the Marcellus area, our expansion projects continue to produce tangible results. In the aggregate, we added about 1.2 BCF per day of pipeline capacity in the Marcellus shale region, as I know that the team continues to aggressively pursue additional growth projects. 
On the leadership front, just yesterday, we announced that 2 seasoned industry veterans are joining the NGT&S senior leadership team. Joe Shields, who most recently served as CEO of Millenium Pipeline, is NGT&S in the role of Chief Operating Officer, while regulated pipeline and storage businesses reporting to Jimmy. In addition, Steve Warnick, who has served in a variety of executive positions in virtually every sector of the industry, including with Chesapeake Energy, will be joining Joe's senior team as Senior Vice President of Supply and Business Development. You also may recall that we have announced a number of key leadership ads in our midstream business, most recent of which is John Howard, who joined the team as Senior Vice President for Strategy and Development. In his new role, John will support the support and execution of the company's midstream strategy, from mineral rights to project development. In tandem with our midstream efforts, the team has continued to advance low-risk, high-value growth opportunities, including projects to serve gas-fueled electric generation markets. In addition to the Warren County Virginia project that we announced earlier this year, to serve a 1,300-megawatt new Dominion power-generating facility, the team is in active discussions with a number of large power generators to meet their needs for new natural gas infrastructure. 
Before moving to our gas distribution here, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional matters relating to NGT&S. First, I know there is considerable interest in the extend and potential value of our mineral rights, particularly at the Utica shale region. At this point, what we can share with you is this: We currently estimate that we have between 100,000 and 200,000 acres in the Utica area associated with our Ohio storage leases that may have potential for natural gas and/or oil production. We will refine this notional range as we continue our geotechnical and legal analyses, and as the producers continue to delineate the parameters of the play. 
In addition, I would note that our ultimate mineral rights strategy and value will be heavily influenced by our ongoing discussions with key producers participating in the Utica. Discussions I would describe as constructive, but not yet at a mature stage. 
Finally, I want to emphasize that as we develop and assess our approach and our options for this opportunity, our focus will be on long-term shareholder value, which ultimately is what we're all about. I fully recognize that folks are anxious to receive additional detail and definition on our minerals opportunity. For our part, we are committed to being transparent and timely in providing high-quality, reliable information without premature speculative observations. At this time, we expect to be in a position to provide further definition in the first quarter of next year. That said, if we have something meaningful to share prior to then, we'll certainly do so.
Turning to the second NGT&S lay consideration, you would expect we've observed with keen interest a significant level of activity unfolding in the midstream business, including pending M&A transactions involving -- Dominion, El Paso. In light of those developments, it might be helpful to take a moment to reiterate our perspective on our NGT&S business, which is very straightforward. We believe it's a great business and a key part of the NiSource portfolio with tremendous assets, exceptional investment opportunities, invigorated leadership and the ability to consistently grow earnings and increase value over the long-term for our shareholders. 
Well, we've consistently said that we have an open mind when it comes to options and approaches, including alternative structures to ensure we're optimizing the value of NGT&S, we believe that our current plan and structure continue to be the appropriate one for us. Having said that, I can assure you that our team will continue to explore and has helped us to continue optimizing our NGT&S business.
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group, discussed on Slide 7. The hallmark of our Gas Distribution stategy is to work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a broad array of core infrastructure, customer and regulatory initiatives. Our team's execution of that strategy continues to be nothing short of exceptional. NiSource Gas Distribution operating earnings for the quarter were $8 million compared to a loss of about $41 million in the same period in 2010. Revenues were up $24 million, while operating expenses were about $25 million less than last year, primarily as a result of lower depreciation cost and lower depreciation rates at NIPSCO gas. On the regulatory front, as I noted earlier, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the settlement of Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's rate case. The order authorizes an annual revenue increase of about $17 million effective October 18. The commission also approved a new rate design incorporating a higher minimum monthly charge, including a fixed customer charge and usage allocation.
On the customer front, while our gas distribution companies continue to introduce, expand programs to help customers reduce energy usage and manage their monthly bills. For example, Columbia Gas of Ohio filed a proposal with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to extend -- expand its broad array of energy efficiency programs for an additional 5 years starting in 2012. Over the life of the proposed programs, EOH estimates customers will save up to $300 million. And most notably, we asked distribution teams gases division team continues to execute on and it's the industry-leading series of long-term infrastructure modernization and replacement programs. 2011 NGD is on pace to invest at a record level, more than $300 million, to ensure safe and reliable service. These investments are part of the more than $4 billion modernization program we've placed in motion over the past few years. As we've highlighted in prior discussions, these investments are part of our commitment to do the right thing to ensure continued safe, reliable and responsive service to our customers, while supporting the NGT's earnings growth on a long-term sustainable basis. 
Before we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we have a strong financial foundation to support our infrastructure investment-driven business strategy. That foundation continues to be our commitment to preserving investment-grade credit rating, maintain the financial flexibility and liquidity necessary to support disciplined annual capital spend north of $1 billion. 
At the end of the third quarter, NiSource maintained net available liquidity of over $460 million, as well as a stable investment-grade credit rating. We remain on track to invest more than $1.1 billion of capital expenditures this year. I also note that we continue to monitor historically-attractive debt capital markets for opportunities to reduce financing costs, extend our maturity profile and manage our liabilities; in particular, our pension obligations. 
And on the equity side of the balance sheet, given our strong cash position, including the positive impact of bonus depreciation, we're now planning to draw upon the proceeds of our 2010 forward sell equity offering in the second half of next year.
To wrap up, this quarter's and year-to-date results NiSource team is continuing to build on strong track record in delivering collaborative regulatory and commercial solutions for our customers while making disciplined low-risk investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. We are dedicated to maintaining this solid level of performance through the balance of the year, We hit the ground running in 2012. Although much work certainly lies ahead, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to deliver on our commitments, including our commitment to grow earnings in the 5% zip code on a long-term sustainable basis. 
Coupled with a secure attractive dividend, one we have to grow you in the not-too-distant future, we believe this plan creates compelling proposition for investors. 
And as always, we will communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource become. With that, Lacey, we can open up the call to questions."

This morning's agenda is brisk to allow time for your questions.

This morning's agenda is brisk to allow time for your questions. 
To start things off, I'll touch on a few key highlights that demonstrate the team's continued progress on executing NiSource's business plan. I'll provide a few specific updates on NiSource's results, as well as the performance of our key business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions.
starting off, let's turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck, labeled Key Takeaways for the Third Quarter. I'll discuss in a moment, despite sluggish economic conditions, our balanced investment-driven strategy continues to deliver solid earnings growth and increased shareholder value. Our strategy also has remained true to our underlying commitments to do the right thing in enhancing customer service, modernizing our energy infrastructure and expanding our network across the entire NiSource footprint.
As noted in this morning's release, our performance today has NiSource on pace to deliver earnings at the upper half of our 2011 guidance range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non-GAAP. NiSource is also on track to deliver double-digit shareholder returns for the third consecutive year, significantly outperforming the utility indices and the broader markets. This performance record is the direct result of the continued exceptional execution in array of core initiatives across each segment of NiSource's businesses. 
Just a few examples. From a regulatory standpoint, we've received approval for a significant rate case settlement in Pennsylvania. We also advanced settlement of our Columbia Gulf rate case, as FERC approval targeted by year end. In Indiana, our watershed electric rate case settlement remains on track for approval late this year or early 2012. Meanwhile, NIPSCO's substantial environmental scrubber investment program at our Schahfer Generating Station remains on schedule and on budget. And then our Gas Transmission & Storage business, new CEO Jimmy Staton is driving development with an aggressive comprehensive plan to leverage NiSource's unparalleled position in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. 
With that premise, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with the financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered third quarter net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $33 million or $0.11 per share compared to $0.04 per share in 2010. Our operating earnings increased for the quarter from about $110 million to over $140 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, given our strong year-to-date performance, coupled with our expectations for the balance of the year, we expect that our full year results will be in the upper half of our non-GAAP earnings range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share for 2011. 
Shifting to our individual business unit results. Let's start in Indiana with our Electric business, as summarized on Slide 5. The pending electric rate case settlement is unquestionably a huge milestone for NIPSCO, its customers and our many other Indiana stakeholders. This landmark agreement has been literally years in the making, sets the stage for NIPSCO to provide customers with reliable, competitively-priced electric service while making long-term investments in our infrastructure. This outcome contributes to the economic vitality, environmental sustainability of northern Indiana while earning a fair return on NIPSCO's investment base. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate receiving approval of the pending settlement by year end or early 2012. 
Our Indiana team also continues to make significant progress on efforts to improve operating performance, meet customer needs and modernize our systems. For example, on the customer front, we received approval for a number of new electric energy efficiency programs that complement our existing natural gas conservation programs and help customers manage their energy costs. Progress also continues on significant environmental upgrades at NIPSCO's Schahfer Generating Station. I noted earlier, this work remains on schedule and on budget. As you'll recall, the Schahfer improvements are part of the NIPSCO environmental investments stream. With the next 6 to 8 years, that will approach $900 million. Taken together, these efforts are helping NIPSCO customers manage energy use, providing a long-term environmental and economic benefits for northern Indiana, supporting stable and sustaining earnings growth.
The third quarter, our Electric Operations reported operating earnings of about $73 million compared to $80 million for the same period in 2010. Revenues were down about $4 million, primarily reflecting lower environmental spend and associated cost recovery compared to the third quarter of 2010. Operating expenses increased by about $3 million, primarily due to higher employee administrative expenses and rate case costs. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage operations, highlighted on Slide 6. Jimmy Staton and the team are working aggressively to advance key strategies to enhance system reliability and customer service, develop new growth projects and leverage NiSource's strategic footprint in emerging shale production areas. The quarter, NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $68 million compared to about $76 million in 2010. Net revenues were up about $11 million, thanks to growth projects placed into service, as well as the impact of new Columbia Gulf rates that took effect subject to refund in May. Operating expenses were up $19 million for the quarter due primarily to an adjustment of an environmental reserve, totaling about $11 million. 
As I noted earlier, Jimmy and his team are intently focused on developing and deploying a robust comprehensive strategy for meeting customer needs, maximizing the value of our extensive pipeline and storage assets and our attractive position in the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions.
In the Marcellus area, our expansion projects continue to produce tangible results. In aggregate, we added about 1.2 BCF per day of pipeline capacity in the Marcellus shale region. As I noted, that the team continues to aggressively pursue additional growth projects. 
On the leadership front, just yesterday, we announced that 2 seasoned industry veterans are joining the NGT&S senior leadership team. Joe Shields, who most recently served as CEO of Millenium Pipeline, is joining NGT&S in the role of Chief Operating Officer, our regulated pipeline and storage businesses, reporting to Jimmy. In addition, Steve Warnick, who has served in a variety of executive positions in virtually every sector of the industry, including a stint with Chesapeake Energy, will be joining Joe's senior team as Senior Vice President of Supply and Business Development. You also may recall that we have announced a number of key leadership adds in our midstream business, most recent of which is John Howard, who joined the team as Senior Vice President for Strategy and Development. In his new role, John will support the development and execution of the company's midstream strategy, from mineral rights to project development. In tandem with our midstream efforts, the team is continuing to advance low-risk, high-value growth opportunities, including projects to serve gas-fueled electric generation markets. In addition to the Warren County, Virginia project that we announced earlier this year to serve a 1,300-megawatt new Dominion power-generating facility, the team is in active discussions with a number of large power generators to meet their needs for new natural gas infrastructure. 
Before moving to our gas distribution unit, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional matters relating to NGT&S. First, I know there is considerable interest in the extent and potential value of our mineral rights, particularly in the Utica shale region. At this point, what we can share with you is this: we currently estimate that we have between 100,000 and 200,000 acres in the Utica area associated with our Ohio storage leases that may have potential for natural gas and/or oil production. We will refine this notional range as we continue our geotechnical and legal analysis and as the producers continue to delineate the parameters of the play. In addition, I would note that our ultimate mineral rights strategy and value will be heavily influenced by our ongoing discussions with key producers participating in the Utica, discussions I would describe as constructive, but not yet at a mature stage. 
Finally, I want to emphasize that as we develop and assess our approach and our options for this opportunity, our focus will be on long-term shareholder value, which ultimately is what we're all about. I fully recognize that folks are anxious to receive additional detail and definition on our minerals opportunity. For our part, we are committed to being transparent and timely in providing high-quality, reliable information without premature speculative observations. This time, we expect to be in the position to provide further definition in the first quarter of next year. That said, if we have something meaningful to share prior to then, we'll certainly do so.
Turning to the second NGT&S-related consideration. You would expect we've observed with keen interest a significant level of activity unfolding in the midstream business, including pending M&A transactions involving Southern Union in El Paso. In light of those developments, it might be helpful to take a moment to reiterate our perspective on our NGT&S business, which is very straightforward: we believe it's a great business and a key part of the NiSource portfolio, which have tremendous assets, exceptional investment opportunities, invigorated leadership and the ability to consistently grow earnings and increase value over the long term for our shareholders. 
While we've consistently said that we have an open mind when it comes to options and approaches, including alternative structures to ensure we're optimizing the value of NGT&S, we believe that our current plan and structure continue to be the appropriate one for us. Having said that, I can assure you that our team will continue to explore and has helped us [ph] to continue optimizing our NGT&S business.
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group, discussed on Slide 7. The hallmark of our Gas Distribution strategy is to work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a broad array of core infrastructure, customer and regulatory initiatives. Our team's execution of that strategy continues to be nothing short of exceptional. NiSource Gas Distribution operating earnings for the quarter were $8 million compared to a loss of about $41 million in the same period in 2010. Revenues were up $24 million while operating expenses were about $25 million less than last year, primarily as a result of lower depreciation cost and lower depreciation rates at NIPSCO Gas. 
On the regulatory front, as I noted earlier, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the settlement of Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case. The order authorizes an annual revenue increase of about $17 million effective October 18. The Commission also approved the new rate design incorporating a higher minimum monthly charge, including a fixed customer charge and usage allocation.
On the customer front, our Gas Distribution companies continue to introduce, expand programs to help customers reduce energy usage and manage their monthly bills. For example, Columbia Gas of Ohio filed a proposal with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to extend -- expand its broad array of energy efficiency programs for an additional 5 years starting in 2012. Over the life of the proposed programs, EOH estimates customers will save up to $300 million. And most notably, the Gas Distribution teams continue to execute on an industry-leading series of long-term infrastructure modernization and replacement programs. 2011, NGD is on pace to invest at a record level, more than $300 million, to ensure safe and reliable service. These investments are part of the more-than-$4-billion modernization program we've placed in motion over the past few years. As we've highlighted in prior discussions, these investments are part of our commitment to do the right thing to ensure continued safe, reliable and responsive service to our customers while supporting the NGD's earnings growth on a long-term sustainable basis. 
Before we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we have a strong financial foundation to support our infrastructure, investment-driven business strategy. That foundation continues to be our commitment to preserving investment-grade credit rating, maintain the financial flexibility and liquidity necessary to support disciplined annual capital spend north of $1 billion. 
At the end of the third quarter, NiSource maintain net available liquidity of over $460 million, as well as a stable investment-grade credit rating. We remain on track to invest more than $1.1 billion of capital expenditures this year. I also note that we continue to monitor historically-attractive debt capital markets for opportunities to reduce financing costs, extend our maturity profile and manage our liabilities; in particular, our pension obligations. 
And on the equity side of the balance sheet, given our strong cash position, including the positive impact of bonus depreciation, we're now planning to draw upon the proceeds of our 2010 forward-sell equity offering in the second half of next year.
To wrap up, as this quarter's and our year-to-date results passed, the NiSource team is continuing to build on a strong track record of delivering collaborative, regulatory and commercial solutions for our customers while making disciplined low-risk investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. We are dedicated to maintaining this solid level of performance through the balance of the year to hit the ground running in 2012. Although much work certainly lies ahead, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to deliver on our commitments, including our commitment to grow earnings in the 5% zip code on a long-term sustainable basis. Coupled with a secure attractive dividend, one we have to grow you in the not-too-distant future, we believe this plan creates compelling proposition for investors. 
And as always, we will communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. 
With that, Lacey, we can now open the call to questions."

This morning's agenda is brisk to allow time for your questions. 
To start things off, I'll touch on a few key highlights that demonstrate the team's continued progress on executing NiSource's business plan. I'll provide a few specific updates on NiSource's results, as well as the performance of our key business units, and then we'll open the line to your questions.
Starting off, let's turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck, labeled Key Takeaways for the Third Quarter. I'll discuss in a moment, despite sluggish economic conditions, our balanced investment-driven strategy continues to deliver solid earnings growth and increased shareholder value. Our strategy also has remained true to our underlying commitments to do the right thing in enhancing customer service, modernizing our energy infrastructure and expanding our network across the entire NiSource footprint.
As noted in this morning's release, our performance today has NiSource on pace to deliver earnings at the upper half of our 2011 guidance range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share, non-GAAP. NiSource is also on track to deliver double-digit shareholder returns for the third consecutive year, significantly outperforming the utility indices and the broader markets. This performance record is the direct result of the continued exceptional execution in array of core initiatives across each segment of NiSource's businesses. 
Just a few examples. From a regulatory standpoint, we've received approval for a significant rate case settlement in Pennsylvania. We also advanced settlement of our Columbia Gulf rate case, as FERC approval targeted by year end. In Indiana, our watershed electric rate case settlement remains on track for approval late this year or early 2012. Meanwhile, NIPSCO's substantial environmental scrubber investment program at our Schahfer Generating Station remains on schedule and on budget. And then our Gas Transmission & Storage business, new CEO Jimmy Staton is driving development with an aggressive comprehensive plan to leverage NiSource's unparalleled position in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. 
With that premise, let's now take a closer look at the quarter, starting with the financial highlights on Slide 4. 
As you can see, we delivered third quarter net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $33 million or $0.11 per share compared to $0.04 per share in 2010. Our operating earnings increased for the quarter from about $110 million to over $140 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, given our strong year-to-date performance, coupled with our expectations for the balance of the year, we expect that our full year results will be in the upper half of our non-GAAP earnings range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share for 2011. 
Shifting to our individual business unit results. Let's start in Indiana with our Electric business, as summarized on Slide 5. The pending electric rate case settlement is unquestionably a huge milestone for NIPSCO, its customers and our many other Indiana stakeholders. This landmark agreement has been literally years in the making, sets the stage for NIPSCO to provide customers with reliable, competitively-priced electric service while making long-term investments in our infrastructure. This outcome contributes to the economic vitality, environmental sustainability of northern Indiana while earning a fair return on NIPSCO's investment base. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate receiving approval of the pending settlement by year end or early 2012. 
Our Indiana team also continues to make significant progress on efforts to improve operating performance, meet customer needs and modernize our systems. For example, on the customer front, we received approval for a number of new electric energy efficiency programs that complement our existing natural gas conservation programs and help customers manage their energy costs. Progress also continues on significant environmental upgrades at NIPSCO's Schahfer Generating Station. I noted earlier, this work remains on schedule and on budget. As you'll recall, the Schahfer improvements are part of the NIPSCO environmental investments stream. With the next 6 to 8 years, that will approach $900 million. Taken together, these efforts are helping NIPSCO customers manage energy use, providing a long-term environmental and economic benefits for northern Indiana, supporting stable and sustaining earnings growth.
The third quarter, our Electric Operations reported operating earnings of about $73 million compared to $80 million for the same period in 2010. Revenues were down about $4 million, primarily reflecting lower environmental spend and associated cost recovery compared to the third quarter of 2010. Operating expenses increased by about $3 million, primarily due to higher employee administrative expenses and rate case costs. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage operations, highlighted on Slide 6. Jimmy Staton and the team are working aggressively to advance key strategies to enhance system reliability and customer service, develop new growth projects and leverage NiSource's strategic footprint in emerging shale production areas. The quarter, NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $68 million compared to about $76 million in 2010. Net revenues were up about $11 million, thanks to growth projects placed into service, as well as the impact of new Columbia Gulf rates that took effect subject to refund in May. Operating expenses were up $19 million for the quarter due primarily to an adjustment of an environmental reserve, totaling about $11 million. 
As I noted earlier, Jimmy and his team are intently focused on developing and deploying a robust comprehensive strategy for meeting customer needs, maximizing the value of our extensive pipeline and storage assets and our attractive position in the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions.
In the Marcellus area, our expansion projects continue to produce tangible results. In aggregate, we’ve added about 1.2 BCF per day of pipeline capacity in the Marcellus shale region. As I noted, that the team continues to aggressively pursue additional growth projects. 
On the leadership front, just yesterday, we announced that 2 seasoned industry veterans are joining the NGT&S senior leadership team. Joe Shields, who most recently served as CEO of Millenium Pipeline, is joining NGT&S in the role of Chief Operating Officer, our regulated pipeline and storage businesses, reporting to Jimmy. In addition, Steve Warnick, who has served in a variety of executive positions in virtually every sector of the industry, including a stint with Chesapeake Energy, will be joining Joe's senior team as Senior Vice President of Supply and Business Development. You also may recall that we have announced a number of key leadership adds in our midstream business, most recent of which is John Howard, who joined the team as Senior Vice President for Strategy and Development. In his new role, John will support the development and execution of the company's midstream strategy, from mineral rights to project development. In tandem with our midstream efforts, the team is continuing to advance low-risk, high-value growth opportunities, including projects to serve gas-fueled electric generation markets. In addition to the Warren County, Virginia project that we announced earlier this year to serve a 1,300-megawatt new Dominion power-generating facility, the team is in active discussions with a number of large power generators to meet their needs for new natural gas infrastructure. 
Before moving to our gas distribution unit, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional matters relating to NGT&S. First, I know there is considerable interest in the extent and potential value of our mineral rights, particularly in the Utica shale region. At this point, what we can share with you is this: we currently estimate that we have between 100,000 and 200,000 acres in the Utica area associated with our Ohio storage leases that may have potential for natural gas and/or oil production. We will refine this notional range as we continue our geotechnical and legal analysis and as the producers continue to delineate the parameters of the play. In addition, I would note that our ultimate mineral rights strategy and value will be heavily influenced by our ongoing discussions with key producers participating in the Utica, discussions I would describe as constructive, but not yet at a mature stage. 
Finally, I want to emphasize that as we develop and assess our approach and our options for this opportunity, our focus will be on long-term shareholder value, which ultimately is what we're all about. I fully recognize that folks are anxious to receive additional detail and definition on our minerals opportunity. For our part, we are committed to being transparent and timely in providing high-quality, reliable information without premature speculative observations. This time, we expect to be in the position to provide further definition in the first quarter of next year. That said, if we have something meaningful to share prior to then, we'll certainly do so.
Turning to the second NGT&S-related consideration. You would expect we've observed with keen interest a significant level of activity unfolding in the midstream business, including pending M&A transactions involving Southern Union in El Paso. In light of those developments, it might be helpful to take a moment to reiterate our perspective on our NGT&S business, which is very straightforward: we believe it's a great business and a key part of the NiSource portfolio, which have tremendous assets, exceptional investment opportunities, invigorated leadership and the ability to consistently grow earnings and increase value over the long term for our shareholders. 
While we've consistently said that we have an open mind when it comes to options and approaches, including alternative structures to ensure we're optimizing the value of NGT&S, we believe that our current plan and structure continue to be the appropriate one for us. Having said that, I can assure you that our team will continue to explore and help us to continue optimizing our NGT&S business.
Let's now shift to our Gas Distribution group, discussed on Slide 7. The hallmark of our Gas Distribution strategy is to work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a broad array of core infrastructure, customer and regulatory initiatives. Our team's execution of that strategy continues to be nothing short of exceptional. NiSource Gas Distribution operating earnings for the quarter were $8 million compared to a loss of about $41 million in the same period in 2010. Revenues were up $24 million while operating expenses were about $25 million less than last year, primarily as a result of lower depreciation cost and lower depreciation rates at NIPSCO Gas. 
On the regulatory front, as I noted earlier, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the settlement of Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case. The order authorizes an annual revenue increase of about $17 million effective October 18. The Commission also approved the new rate design incorporating a higher minimum monthly charge, including a fixed customer charge and usage allocation.
On the customer front, our Gas Distribution companies continue to introduce, expand programs to help customers reduce energy usage and manage their monthly bills. For example, Columbia Gas of Ohio filed a proposal with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to extend -- expand its broad array of energy efficiency programs for an additional 5 years starting in 2012. Over the life of the proposed programs, EOH estimates customers will save up to $300 million. And most notably, the Gas Distribution teams continue to execute on an industry-leading series of long-term infrastructure modernization and replacement programs. 2011, NGD is on pace to invest at a record level, more than $300 million, to ensure safe and reliable service. These investments are part of the more-than-$4-billion modernization program we've placed in motion over the past few years. As we've highlighted in prior discussions, these investments are part of our commitment to do the right thing to ensure continued safe, reliable and responsive service to our customers while supporting the NGD's earnings growth on a long-term sustainable basis. 
Before we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we have a strong financial foundation to support our infrastructure, investment-driven business strategy. That foundation continues to be our commitment to preserving investment-grade credit rating, maintain the financial flexibility and liquidity necessary to support disciplined annual capital spend north of $1 billion. 
At the end of the third quarter, NiSource maintain net available liquidity of over $460 million, as well as a stable investment-grade credit rating. We remain on track to invest more than $1.1 billion of capital expenditures this year. I also note that we continue to monitor historically-attractive debt capital markets for opportunities to reduce financing costs, extend our maturity profile and manage our liabilities; in particular, our pension obligations. 
And on the equity side of the balance sheet, given our strong cash position, including the positive impact of bonus depreciation, we're now planning to draw upon the proceeds of our 2010 forward-sell equity offering in the second half of next year.
To wrap up, as this quarter's and our year-to-date results passed, the NiSource team is continuing to build on a strong track record of delivering collaborative, regulatory and commercial solutions for our customers while making disciplined low-risk investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. We are dedicated to maintaining this solid level of performance through the balance of the year to hit the ground running in 2012. Although much work certainly lies ahead, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to deliver on our commitments, including our commitment to grow earnings in the 5% zip code on a long-term sustainable basis. Coupled with a secure attractive dividend, one we have to grow you in the not-too-distant future, we believe this plan creates compelling proposition for investors. 
And as always, we will communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. 
With that, Lacey, we can now open the call to questions."
