203028,109128600,98731,"ACE Limited, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning, everybody. ACE had a very good fourth quarter, which contributed to an excellent year. In fact, this is the first quarter in our history that we earned over $1 billion of net income. After-tax operating income for the quarter, as you’ve se",1515,"Good morning, everybody. ACE had a very good fourth quarter, which contributed to an excellent year. In fact, this is the first quarter in our history that we earned over $1 billion of net income. After-tax operating income for the quarter, as you’ve seen was $2.05 per share bringing full-year operating income to $779 or nearly $2.7 billion.
Given the challenging economic and insurance market conditions we faced in 2010, these are great results with all of our principal businesses making a positive and meaningful contribution.
In fact, full-year operating income was relatively flat with prior year. With our P&C lines of business down 6% really all due to increased catastrophe losses and our A&H and Life business up 5%. This speaks to the power of our diversification strategy while we manage the cycle, and our recent acquisitions continue to add to that trend.
Per share book value grew 2% in the quarter, bringing full-year growth to 17%. For the last five years, we’ve grown our per share book and tangible book at a compound annual rate of 14.5% and 15.8% respectively.
ROE for the year was just over 13%, an efficient and favorable risk adjusted return on capital, particularly when measured against risk free returns and that result includes a modest amount of fourth quarter share repurchases.
Our underwriting results, both calendar and accident year was simply excellent. The calendar year combined ratio for the full-year was about 90%, which included more than triple the catastrophe losses compared to prior year and favorable prior period reserve development roughly equivalent to prior year. This quarter’s cat losses $51 million, included $31 million of IBNR for the Australian floods and $5 million for the New Zealand earthquake.
Prior period development for the quarter includes the results of our own annual as well as the State of Pennsylvania’s bi-annual reviews of A&E reserves and other run-off liabilities. We took a charge of $60 million after-tax and Phil will have more to say about this.
Our accident year loss ratio for the quarter, excluding cats was 58.5%, which is lower than last year and deserves some comment.
We had a number of nonrecurring items, which benefited the current accident year result. Due to the acquisition of Rain and Hail, our year-end adjustment normally taken in the first quarter, came forward to the fourth. In addition, we added couple of one-time premium-related adjustments that benefited the current accident year.
Lastly, our mix of business is changing. While most byline P&C ratios have increased as one would expect given rate and trend, we’ve continued to shed higher loss ratio lines, while grow or maintain lower loss ratio business.
Phil will provide more details around the accident year components and Brian and John will be available to provide more color during the Q&A.
The expense ratio was up in the quarter and full-year compared to prior, due almost entirely to crop and fewer loss portfolio type large transactions. Excluding these two items from both years, our expense ratio was essentially flat for the quarter and up slightly for the year, again Phil will provide more detail.
In December S&P upgraded the financial strength rating of our core operating insurance companies to AA minus. This development acknowledges not only the strength of our balance sheet but also our distinct global franchise and our well diversified balance of businesses.
During the quarter we closed on two of the acquisitions we announced last year, Rain and Hail in the United States and Jerneh Insurance in Malaysia. Our acquisition of New York Life’s operations in Korea as you saw closed earlier this week; we intend to close the acquisition of their Life Company in Hong Kong by the end of the first quarter. These acquisitions are on track and should make a meaningful contribution to our results while further enhancing our diversification.
I want to make a few comments about the insurance market environment. As I said in the last quarter, we’re observing typical, commercial ENC soft market behavior with prices continuing to soften around the world and more competition around terms and conditions.
Well I must say, overall the US market, Bermuda and the London wholesale market are more competitive than the other markets around the world.
Globally the second half of 2010 was more competitive than the first half, this is reality. We are not ringing our hands over it, the market is the market and these conditions will likely be with us for some time.
Rather we’re managing the cycle prudently and not kidding ourselves about price or reserve adequacy. In fact as the market has softened, we’ve added even more rigor to our underwriting portfolio management. We have very good insights by product as to where we’ve opportunity and where we need to take corrective action.
With that, total company net premiums were up 4% in the quarter. In North America premiums were up 5%. As would be expected, in retail our new business writings were down about one-third from prior year while our renewal retention ratio in the quarter was over 90%, up from 88% prior year. Quite simply we’re writing less new business and maintaining our renewals.
Retentions were up particularly in those areas of business were more than price mattered. For the business we wrote rates in North America were down overall about 2% in the quarter ranging from between up 3% for certain casualty lines and down 6% in property. To the business we didn’t write rates were substantially below our targets.
For our international commercial P&C business, excluding the impact of foreign exchange premium revenues in the quarter was flat with retail up 4% and London wholesale down 10%. New business premiums in retail P&C were up 8% driven largely by Asia and Latin America and the renewal retention ratio was in the mid 80s.
Rates in the quarter were down overall, about 1% and our London wholesale business and new business writings were down over 25% in the quarter while renewal premiums were up 10%.
Turning to our reinsurance business, net written premiums were about flat in the quarter. However for January 1, on an underwriting year basis, Global Re was off about 10% from prior year with casualty related classes flat.
Our US Casualty reinsurance business shrank and our international casualty business grew. Our property cat and property per risk business writings were both down.
Brian Dowd and John Keogh are available to provide more color on their business in the market environment and their operations.
Turning to our A&H insurance business, A&H premium growth globally was again up with ACE International business growing and our combined insurance business down.
Our international A&H continued to pick up momentum this quarter as anticipated and grew 7%, with strong growth in Asia and Latin America. I believe our international business growth will continue to improve as we move through 2011.
Meanwhile, combined insurance premiums were down around 5% to 6% from prior year, and I expect this trend to continue in ‘11, given that our business is primarily concentrated in the most economically-challenged regions of the world, the US and Western Europe. It’ll simply take longer for combined business to recover from the impact of the recession.
Another factor that impacts combined in the U.K. and Ireland is the change of the regulatory environment. Regulators in those two countries have adopted a new stance regarding sales practices. Combined has operated these for four decades without incident. However, the regulators’ new stance has resulted in a need for us to retrain our agents and reengineer our processes.
We put these two operations under a sales moratorium, while we work on this. Ireland is back in operation; in the U.K. that moratorium is continuing though we hope to resume new business sales sometime in the future. However, with that said, combined’s operating income for the quarter and full-year was up 11% and 12% respectively.
In summary, I believe ACE’s financial results for the quarter and the full-year were excellent and distinguished our company as demonstrated by our strong operating income, book value growth and ROE. We’re well diversified and our balance sheet is in great shape.
We’ve made great strides in the year, continuing to position our company for the future. We added to our executive management ranks, we completed a number of acquisitions, and we improved upon our underwriting figure. We are simply so well positioned for opportunity this year and beyond.
While Phil will provide full-year guidance, I want to add a comment. We expect 2011 revenue growth will be in the mid to upper single-digit range. So, given changes to our mix of business, there will greater variability from quarter-to-quarter than we’ve experienced in recent years with some quarters down and other quarters up. First quarter is the quarter we expect to be impacted to the negative, and don’t be surprised.
In sum, again, I am quite optimistic about the coming year and barring unforeseen events, we expect 2011 will be another very good year for ACE.
Now, let me turn it over to Phil.

We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and capital position, tangible book value per share grew 16.8% for the year and declined 2% in the quarter. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, predominantly Rain and Hail, tangible book value per share grew 21% for the year and 1.5% for the quarter.
Net realized and unrealized losses after-tax for the quarter were $270 million. Our operating and underwriting cash flow for the year were $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion respectively. Our cash and invested assets grew this year by $5 billion to over $52 billion
Investment income was $532 million for the quarter up 4% and benefited from private equity distributions. Normalizing for this, the quarterly investment income run rate is closer to $520 million. Current new money rates are 3.6% if we invested in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio.
Our net loss reserves were 1.4% year-over-year, while our paid-to-incurred ratio was 98%. Adjusting for prior period development our paid-to-incurred ratio was 91%.
There were several items in the quarter that had somewhat of an offsetting effect one related to the prior period and a number related to the current accident year. First, we had net positive prior period development of about $120 million after tax primarily related to short tail lines, it was offset by a charge of about $60 million also after tax related to our reserve review of runoff operations including Brandy-wine. About half of this $60 million charge was an addition to our asbestos and environmental reserves.
Second, concerning the current exiting a year, our P&C accident year loss ratio before Cat losses dropped about 5 percentage points over last year. Let me break this down by division.
In North America, if you eliminate the beneficial effect of the crop adjustment which was $32 million as well as the underwriting income benefit from a couple of non-recurring premium adjustments which totaled $80 million, the current accident year loss ratio was flat.
Line by line the loss ratio was actually up as one would expect but as Evan mentioned, there was a change in business mix. We are in less premium and higher loss ratio lines.
In ACE Overseas General, a number of large property losses negatively impacted our loss ratio in the fourth quarter of 2009; secondly lower loss ratio regions of the world of growing faster than other regions, again a mix of business change.
Our P&C expense ratio was up 1.6 percentage points from the prior year’s fourth quarter to 32.1%. Adjusting for crop and large one-off transactions that we wrote in 2009 and did not repeat in 2010, our expense ratio was flat in the quarter and up half a point for the year.
We normalized for the crop adjustment and the one-time premium items, our current accident year combined ratio excluding cats was 93.8% for the quarter and 92% for the year and by the way we believe we’ve continued to reserve conservatively.
Our financial leverage were quite low at 16.7%, was up from the third quarter and will come down from this range over the next six to nine months as we repay the $1.3 billion of short-term financing associated with the purchase of Rain and Hail and the buyback of $300 million of our own shares in the fourth quarter. Reinsurance recoverables were down 5% from December 31, 2009 and our recoverable leverage is now 56%.
Finally, our press release issued last night included our guidance for 2011. Our range is $6.10 to $6.50 for the current accident year after tax operating income. This includes cat losses of $300 million after tax.
Again, just as with last year, guidance is for the current accident year only and includes no assumption for prior period development. We currently expect to be in the middle of the range.
For 2010 the comparable operating income per share excluding prior period development was $6.48. Our estimate for 2011 is down only about 3% which we believe is strong.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Helen.

First of all, those deals are worth about $0.35 of accretion, number one. Number two, once you do the deals, they become core business, so I don’t distinguish them from our other core businesses, but I take your point, look, you have rate and trend and it doesn’t take a lot in rate and trend to erode current accident year results.
Anybody who expects that you have that going on and yet you have absolute stability and what have been excellent combined ratios is kidding themselves. And those who try to simply put up those same kinds of results will take charges in the future, there is no way around that, it’s pretty simple math. I don’t think the deterioration is that significant. I think it’s logical.
And frankly, the acquisitions we made are both accretive, they are accretive to our hurdle rates and they were a good use of the capital rather than writing more organic business to build our core. We acquired more core, so that’s kind of how I see it.
And as you say, so that we address this subject fully, we’re guiding you really in the beginning to middle of the range. So as Phil said, it’s like 6.30. In ‘10 we produced 6.48, so not so bad. You said it, but it’s worth my mentioning it.
Again the guidance is for current accident year only, because that’s what we can prudently project. By its nature we can’t predict prior period development. However, if the loss development trends continue in a similar fashion and again that is unknowable, then we could have prior period development in the same range as we did in 2010.

Evan ment",590,"I’ll give some thoughts on North America retention, maybe probably not a bad time just talking about the market in general to give you some feel for the pricing our retention and new business, because all three probably give you color on that. Evan mentioned North America. Our rates were down about 2.1%. Frankly, the themes in the quarter are consistent with last couple of quarters. Wholesale is a little more competitive than retail, commodity accounts and layers are more competitive than account for newer service capacities.
Our service capabilities are a key and awful lot our business is both insurance and service. People buy it, because we can front the policies, we can handle the collateral, we got the engineering to avail that. That differentiates us from a lot of other companies with our global network.
Some of the lines we saw the most competition were property and professional liability, where we saw rates go down by about 6%. The two main reasons I think they had the largest reductions, these were the lines, remember, in ‘09, we were still getting price increases in property and professional liability last year. And second, the early indications in 2010, both property and professional liability look like they were going to be pretty profitable, so I think people are competing for those lines on that basis.
We also saw some increased competition in medical liability and a few of the other lines and all of those have caused rate erosion, some decreased retention rates and lower new business.
On the other hand, some of our retail umbrella pricing and wholesale umbrella pricing helps steady. We also saw some modest price increases in the energy related casualty account as well as in our Private Risk Services business.
As we continue to differentiate ourselves with our insurance and service capabilities, our retention ratios are high. In North America, premium retention ratio was about 87% in the quarter, which is an improvement from 84% a year ago. And frankly, if the lines were our service capabilities, our retention ratios are in the high-90s.
Examples include our national accounts risk management business, our foreign casualty, our facilities business and where we’re the lead in professional liability (inaudible). Frankly, there are only a handful of companies that can do those types of services. Three or more in most cases. So we tend to get retention ratios in those businesses in the high-90s. Lines that are more commodity-like, like our (inaudible), frankly, retentions do fall to the 70s in those lines of business.
And then lastly as we look at new business, competition is still robust and so we’re still seeing a lot of submission activity. However, we remain just from our approach where new business has to meet the same hurdle pricing as our renewal business. And as a result, we wrote about a third less new business in the quarter than we wrote a year ago. And frankly, new business was down in virtually all lines with probable exceptions of ACE Private Risk Services and one large program we talked about last year.
So truth is we’re about where we’d expect in the cycle right now. Our efficiency metrics are going down, are bound to submit, and are bound to close. They’re down about two percentage points over where they were a year ago and (inaudible) expected for those points in the cycle. I do think the investment we made in our service capabilities differentiates us in our retention ratio from most of our competitors.

Let’s take the exposure first. When I look forward what do I expect. First, crop. I think if there is a one line of business that may surprise to the upside because of economic factors is crop insurance, because I think commodity prices are up. It was part of our thinking that we couldn’t project with any certainty.
When we bought Rain and Hail, it was just the macro trend that you have a middle-class growing around the world. People are eating more meat around the world and so grains and crop naturally, there was a shortage of food and the US is a major exporter and grower of food. We are seeing right now crop prices is very strong and that could have a beneficial impact on both revenue and potentially income beyond what we’ve projected so far.
In the balance of P&C, I’d say and Brian can give a little more of a breakdown into three categories. What we’ve seen is, in one or two categories of economic development, we’ve seen a flattening, so no further deterioration, in fact, some growth and activity which benefits exposure, which benefits applied against rate benefits premium, but there are one or two where we’ve like equipment-related, business asset-related where we haven’t seen I believe the same level of pick up. I mean he could give a little more on that if you like.
When I look forward I think there will be a beneficial impact and I think it’s going to be modest and will increase as the year goes along. And we can’t project it with any certainty. That’s in the US.
On the other side of the coin, Europe, I expected to continue to be flat, but Asia and Latin America, we’re growing our business and it’s growing, because business activity is increasing.
When you turn to Egypt and the Middle East and your question was what would create material losses? Interesting. You’re relating to political violence, et cetera. We’ve very little political risk PV exposure in our political risk portfolio. PV is political violence. And most of our exposure that we’ve in Egypt or in other countries, particularly, in Egypt is not in the urban center. We have very little exposure in the urban center.
Look, what would create significant loss? And I say significant, and I’ll clarify that in a moment, but you’d have to go to a complete Iran-type situation. Even with all the projections, the predictions that are out there right now, that’s not foreseen.
And let me maybe then just give you a little more. The political events in Egypt are unfolding. And no one knows the outcome obviously with any certainty.
Our political risk exposures relate mostly to areas of vital importance for the country to function. Natural resources, critical infrastructure-related. Our urban venued exposures are, as I said, they are minimal, they are tiny. All of our policies have conditionality and have substantial reinsurance.
We insured defined perils, as you know. And in the case of Egypt, you’re talking about confiscation, ex-appropriation, nationalization, and currency and convertibility. At this time, we don’t know of any losses developing. And at this time, we do not envision any losses developing that are not contemplated within our loss reserves impacts.

Number two, when you talk about contagion, the countries most at risk, which I’m not going to go into, that are discussed, that could go next, we’ve virtually no exposure.
And I have read some of the papers that have been written by analysts and I think there is some confusion as to what countries constitute the Middle East. For instance, I don’t consider Turkey, a Middle East country. I don’t think they consider themselves that either. There are a lot of things to worry about.

You can’t study everything at once and then we really best practice we think for the industry and the company. We have external actuaries review each of those portfolios also. So they all come up during the year.
At this moment in time, there are studies; there are portfolios that were studied 9 months and 12 months ago, some were studied six months ago, some were studied three months ago, and so we’re at various points of maturations since the last reviews of each and from what I can see right now if the trends that have developed, in aggregate, when I add it all up.

Number one, the ROE, you are projecting is current accident year only as we both know, in the way you are projecting that and we will see what happens. But we’ve been pretty good at producing double-digit ROEs and I feel fairly bullish about this year, I feel quite bullish.
When I look at capital and think about capital going forward, you’ve seen us have a track record of good ROE, we’ve been patient over the years taken aggregate period, five-year period, take a three-year period. Our ROE has been I believe quite good, and take it over a total cycle of 10 years or longer and our ROE has been excellent as well, so we’re patient about it and we’ve contributed to that ROE through both organic growth at the right times in the right areas and we’ve a lot of optionality in that regard because of our mix of business and because of our geographic mix.
And we’ve also complimented that ROE from accretion with acquisitions that’s further along our strategy, we are patient about that, you’ve seen that we’ve made a few acquisitions in ‘10. I must say nothing that analysts could have imagined because you’re looking at a very narrow cohort of potential companies. When you look at market, much narrower than what we imagine because we’re in a perch that looks across the globe. I think there’s a lot of stress in the world and there’s a lot of reassessment of strategy.
Cost to capital in the world I believe is going to rise and that’s going to cause more stress and more reassessment of strategy and I think that provides opportunity. With all that said, you know, we’re not shareholder unfriendly, we’re not going to be unmindful, we’re not going to hold capital just for the sake of holding endless amounts of capital, we’re going to hold what we think is right for risk and what we think is right for opportunity over a reasonable time horizon and if we can’t do something with it or think we can, we’re going to return it to shareholders.

It breaks down by country.

And we tease it out into its categories and we PML it and then there is lots of reinsurance and conditionality around it. So you just can’t. I think look it that way. And I know the one exhibit looked at had the Middle East and Turkey, let’s imagine, Turkey was a large part.

It certainly was an eventful quarter in terms of natural catastrophes around the globe and as a result, our earnings were significantly impacted.  This of course is the nature of the insurance business and our cat losses were within our expectation of loss for these events given their size and scope.
In spite of the cat losses, we produced positive operating income and growth in the book value.  I believe this once again points to the strength of our underwriting, risk management and demonstrates the benefit of our broadly diversified business.  In fact, both revenue and growth and current accident year operating income excluding the cats were better than we had anticipated.
Frankly from what we know now we are quite optimistic about the balance of the year.  After-tax operating income for the quarter was 268 million or 79 cents per share which includes 440 million in after-tax cat losses or $1.30 per share.  Our per-share book value grew 1% and now stands just shy of $70.  From a pure underlying perspective, our combined ratio for the first quarter was 105 and this includes 16-1/2 points of cat losses.
As I said a moment ago, both premium revenue and current accident year results excluding cats were better than anticipated.  Our current accident year combined ratio excluding the cats was 91.8.  Revenue growth in our North American division was down from prior year as I warned last quarter because of a couple of one-time items that Phil will describe.  Adjusting for these, our total company P&C premiums were flat.
Last quarter when we released guidance we said that full year growth would range between mid to upper single-digit.  We are more confident about our prospects for full year premium growth, which we now believe will be between upper single-digit and low double-digit driven by our recent acquisitions, our personal lines and A&H businesses and commercial P&C in a number of areas such as Asia, Latin America and Retail UK.
And this revised view contemplates no change to market conditions for property and certain other classes, which could occur and further benefit our company.  The expense ratio was up a bit over half a point in the quarter compared to the same period last year primarily because of reinstatement premiums and you see that show up substantially in AOG.  Phil will provide more detail.
However, the expense ratios should improve significantly beginning with the second quarter and for the full year will be below prior year levels.  I want to make a few comments about the market environment as it relates to the impact of recent cat loss activity and then I'll speak about pricing and growth more generally.
Total industry cat losses for the first quarter are likely to exceed 45 billion contributing to total industry cat losses over the last 15 months of circa 75 billion or more.  Losses from the Japan earthquake and tsunami alone are estimated to be in the range of 30 billion, though no one knows with any certainty at this time.  Keep in mind that earthquake losses are notoriously slow to develop and this one will be no exception.
In my judgment for the industry overall, the cat losses in the first quarter and the last 15 months are more an income event than a balance sheet stress event although a substantial amount of capital will be converted to claims and that puts the overall industry that much closer to a real capital event.  Speaking about the market as a whole though is somewhat simplistic and doesn't tell the entire story.
A considerable amount of these losses will be concentrated with relatively few companies and certain important markets such as London, Bermuda and continental reinsurers.  For individual companies and certain markets the losses place varying degrees of real stress on the balance sheet.  In addition, catastrophe model changes will most certainly have a real impact over time.  They place additional pressure on capacity and cost of risk and this should translate into higher rates.
Almost lost in all of the cat noise was the fact that the industry has had numerous and sizeable energy and marine market losses over the past year and these classes additionally will be impacted by some of the cats as well.  So with all that, I believe certain classes of property business such as single peril cat expose risks, large account property requiring significant capacity and potentially other classes such as marine and energy will firm; how much and exact timing remain to be seen.
We are already seeing for certain property classes, cat exposed and large accounts in particular, where prices were decreasing 5% to 10%, rates have now gone flat to positive, and in certain cases, though still spotty are increasing double-digit.  This varies by market and it's early days but we are seeing more evidence as the weeks roll on.  In fact, we just received May 1 data and it is even more encouraging than the observations I just made.
Moreover, market firming typically begins on the reinsurance side, both per risk and risk excess, facultative and treaty.  As you know, the property retro market has firmed significantly.  This places pressure on property reinsurers, which in turn means the cost of protection for insurers will go up, which in turn puts pressure on insurance rates.  Again, this takes time to run its course.
As the markets firm in any individual geography or class and reach a point where we find the risk-reward attractive, I assure you we are well positioned to take advantage.  Turning to the market more broadly, in North America our renewal premium retention ratio improved to 90%.  We benefited from both positive exposure changes and a modestly better pricing environment.
We experienced more than 2 points of exposure change as a result of payroll and sales increases, a welcomed an encouraging development, while prices for our renewal book were off less than 2%, the slowest rate of decline we have seen in a number of quarters.  Overall we are getting both better rate and retention on those lines that are less commodity oriented and these happen to be more large account oriented.
On the other side of the coin on a policy count basis, our renewal persistency was down as we continued active underwriting portfolio management in each of our businesses.  Competition remained fierce particularly in the commodity-oriented classes where simply price and terms continue to be the order of the deck.
In terms of growth, excluding the one-time transactions from prior year that I mentioned earlier, net premiums in North America were down 1% in the quarter.  We wrote half the new business we wrote last year due to competition but what's very encouraging is that we wrote it at similar pricing to our renewal portfolio.  In fact, we secured positive rate at a number of classes for both renewal and new due to our continued and even more aggressive focus on portfolio management.
In our international P&C business net premiums written were up 2%.  But they were up about 5 excluding the reinsurance, reinstatement premiums we paid.  Retail was up 6 while wholesale was up 2.  For our renewal book rates were flat overall ranging from up 3 to down 3, a much tighter range than we have experienced in recent quarters.
In the quarter we saw a double-digit growth in Asia and Latin America as well as reasonable growth in our UK retail business where we are benefiting from our expansion outside of London.  Our Ace International A&H business also returned to very good growth in the quarter, 14%, driven by strong double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America.  And for that matter, our brokerage driven A&H business in Ace USA was up double-digit as well.
You will remember we began to see growth pick up in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and these divisions and that trend continued into the first quarter.  We believe the business is now well-positioned for further growth 2011.  Now this contrasts with the combined, which continues to struggle with the economic impact of recession in its target markets and regulatory related issues in our UK and Ireland business.
Turning to our reinsurance business, Global REs premium as measured on an underwriting year basis shrank 11%, roughly in line with what we experienced at January 1 due to competition in both property cat and casualty related business.  We consider this simply good cycle management if we want to maintain a reasonable return on capital and a combined ratio under 100%.  Premiums for our global personal lines business were up double digit in both our US and international operations.
And finally, premiums in our international life insurance business were also up in the quarter.  In April our acquisition of New York Life's Hong Kong operation closed and this completes the transaction we announced last year to acquire both their Korea and Hong Kong Life companies.  I should point out that all three of our recent acquisitions - Rain and Hail, Jerneh in Malaysia and New York Life Korea and Hong Kong - are on track and we expect them to do as well or better than we planned for their first full year of operations.
To sum, while obviously the cats cast a shadow over the first quarter as you can see the underlying health and results of our business are very good.  We have a lot of good activity going on across our businesses and we are optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and I will come back and take your questions.

Our balance sheet continued to grow stronger during the quarter in spite of the significant level of cat activity. Cash and invested assets grew by almost 1.7 billion to 53.8 billion, our tangible book value per share increased 1% and our operating cash flow was very strong at over $1 billion.  Evan mentioned that our underlying business excluding cat losses performed quite well in the quarter and that there are a number of areas where we are seeing stronger revenue and earnings growth.
Accordingly, when we look at the quarter with our originally expected level of cat losses we would have produced an ROE of 12% with an EPS of $1.95 and our tangible book value would have grown by 3.4%.  Investment income was 544 million for the quarter, up 8% benefiting from private equity distributions.  About 2/3 of the increase relates to income or new cash flow.  The remainder relates to these distributions.
The current quarterly investment income rate is about 530-535 million. Current new money rates are 3.5% if we invested in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio.  Our net loss reserves were up 2.3% for the quarter while our paid-to-incurred ratio was 86.7.  We had favorable prior period development of 93 million pre-tax primarily related to short tail lines.  This compares with 96 million last year.
There were items affecting the year-on-year comparisons for the first quarter's written premium.  Last year's quarter included a large risk management contract and this year's quarter had significantly more reinstatement premiums paid.  Adjusting for these items, written premiums are about flat.  Our P&C expense ratio for the quarter is 31.6%.
It's inflated by the payment of reinstatement premiums and the shift in mix to A&H, which has a higher expense ratio.  Adjusting for these items, the ratio would be about a point lower.  In our 2011 guidance issued in January we said we expected operating income to range between $6.10-6.50 per share.  Catastrophe losses included in net estimate were $370 million pre-tax or $300 million after-tax.
Our operating income projections included in guidance, remember, were for current accident year results only and by definition did not include any estimate for prior period development.  In light of the level of first quarter catastrophe losses we are adjusting guidance for the year.  Operating income is now expected to range between $5.40-5.70 per share for the full year.
This includes 443 million in catastrophe losses for the first quarter plus 250 million after-tax in catastrophe losses for the balance of the year.  The guidance also includes 74 million of after-tax positive prior period development reflected in the first quarter as well as an adjustment for the estimated increase to the investment income run rate.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Helen.

So I don't see deterioration in our cat estimates coming.  When it comes to our own protections look, I don't think there is anything unusual in Ace's cat losses from a reinsurer of Ace's perspective.
In fact, I think that all the reinsurers who audit our portfolios for quality and see how we manage, the losses that we have generated to reinsurers are well within what they would've expected from Ace - no real surprise.  So I think any changes in our program in terms of pricing that we have to pay or attachment points are just going to be as a result of generally driven market changes nothing Ace specific.

And so their need is translating in their own minds to reality and I think that's just ahead of themselves.  I think what you're experiencing right now when you see the ups and downs of the pricing you're seeing better stability and retention rate.
You're seeing a rate of decrease in casualty pricing that is ameliorating and you see some classes where you can start getting a little bit of pricing and that all points to me - I mean, if you look at that messy picture and that says to me when you read through it that we're likely bouncing around the bottom right now with some up and down.
And I believe that is where we will be for a period of time.  It might get modestly better.  Do I believe that the theory that we're just going to come to an orderly place where pricing will modestly rise in an orderly way and kind of sit there where you won't get a real hard market, it won't be soft, it will just get to adequate?  I don't believe it happens that way.
In my own mind I see too much that it sounds good, it doesn't happen.  So I think you need pain. Yes, these cat events get you closer to a capital event that could more broadly impact.  But you need a lot more of that in my mind before it really has a serious impact on casualty.  Otherwise, if its going to run its course we are going to bounce around roughly where we are, where it’s soft.
It will be a little more orderly and then it’ll tighten up a little bit as we go along.  But a broad change, you need more pain.  And I sit with the notion as we plan around here that it's the next couple of years before you've dug that hole deep enough.

In North America the first quarter property pricings were heading down.  In April most April 1st first accounts were quoted prior to the Japanese earthquake and we finished April property prices were down about 1%.
Then we get to our May renewals and we had just over a 100 or so renewals in May and not a single one of those accounts renewed at a rate reduction.  About 30% were flat, 50% of the accounts had increases between 5-30% and we lost about 20% of our accounts.  Frankly companies cut our existing pricing.
So we're starting to see signs that the pricing pressure is growing and where we're seeing it most is on the global accounts that have a large national catastrophe exposure and you need a whole panel of insurers to fill it out.  And then on North America only accounts, it's those accounts that have a wind not a quake base of exposure (unintelligible) is we're starting to definitely see the model changes starting to take effect into the market.
And wind driven accounts, the pricing is moving in North America more than the earthquake.  And then lastly, I just got that from REMS this morning and there is definitely a tone change with customers, brokers and other insurers that people are now pretty expecting price increases in property and that wasn't true three weeks ago.

I'll just add maybe some color in the international market.  It’s the same theme that Brian just articulated and Evan has commented on which is we're seeing an improved underwriting environment in the loss affected geographies as well as the loss affected classes of business.
But more specifically if you take it by territory, then Japan hasn't had a lot of renewals since the quake and tsunami.  That's in front of us but what we're seeing currently in terms of what's being quoted, our rate increase is anywhere from 25-50% and we're seeing a pretty significant pullback in terms of appetite for new business by the local Japanese companies.
New Zealand, probably not surprising there, we're seeing significant rate increases on our property business, business not affected by loss, 30% rate increases, loss affected business up to 300% rate increases.  Australia - that’s really in front of us, it's a big 630 renewal book for the Australian market.  The few renewals we have seen go through have moved from beginning of the year where the market was offering slight decreases on our property.
We're now seeing slight increases of circa 10% on loss free accounts and larger increases on accounts that have been affected by the floods.  In Chile before Japan you were seeing some rate decreases being asked for on top of significant rate increases last year.  That's all gone away.  In London where we do see US cat exposed business coming into market we've seen a change there from the beginning of the year where rates were going down anywhere from 5-15%.
We're now seeing rate increases on that business of around 10% and probably moving forward we're expecting that to get stronger.  As Brian noted, a lot of that really being driven by not so much the quake activity internationally but what's going on in terms of a re-evaluation based on modeling.  On the lines of market in general I would note is holding line of rate decreases.  We're seeing a lot of our competitors in London walk away on accounts they're offering rate decreases.
In energy property as Evan noted in his commentary, that market has suffered not just from cat but from some very significant large events in the first quarter in terms of loss activity.  And there we're seeing the magnitude of rate decreases diminish significantly, probably still not where we think it needs to be but we're seeing rate decreases on onshore that were at 20% at the start of the year now down to single-digit.
And the offshore market has moved from slight decreases to slight increases over the last 30-60 days.  And then finally, I would note on the marine market we are seeing some limited reaction to loss activity driven by both cat and large events.  Rate reductions that were prevalent at the beginning of the year have disappeared and we're starting to see slight rate decreases on cat exposed marine business.

So therefore we can identify we think with reasonable precision what could be our exposure in any one area of our business to Japan because we have Japan exposure not just from our business in Japan but from our businesses outside of Japan.  And I think we are pretty good at tracking that as part of risk management and therefore when it comes to loss I'm estimating.
And finally, what I’d say is reinsurance protections kick in and that does put a ceiling and particularly if you have a lot of head room above that.  And that's both on the insurance side and then on the reinsurance side well, we do cat excess and that has defined limits.  So I can't speak to others.  I can only describe Ace.

One thing you know is our portfolio management is intense and so therefore within any class of business there are areas where we need to get rate or hold the line on rate and we are able to maintain our renewals on that in many instances.

So most companies like us have been focused on the renewal books and trying to retain that book.
And there is frankly, actually while broker competition remains robust and then after a couple of years of very heavy marketing we are actually seeing a slowdown in new business submission activity.  As you know most brokers, most customers, most markets realize they have more or less hit the bottom.  So there is actually less activity in the market and we have a very disciplined approach to new business.
It has got to be priced at least the same price adequacy as a renewal book.  We wrote about half of what we wrote last year as Evan mentioned and our new business was down on almost every line except for our Ace Private Risk Services, which was only up about 6%.  So it gives you a feel for that most lines are at that place where the pricing availability and the number of submissions don't add up to write a lot of new business.
So I think to move new business you’ve still got to be 20-30% off and it just doesn't hit our pricing hurdles.

As you saw from the numbers, ACE had an excellent second quarter, in fact, for the first six months, given the extraordinary number in size of natural catastrophes, the competitive insurance market and sluggish economic conditions in develop",1440,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, ACE had an excellent second quarter, in fact, for the first six months, given the extraordinary number in size of natural catastrophes, the competitive insurance market and sluggish economic conditions in developed markets are persistent and long-term strategy to build the global diversified company. And our use of capital have distinguished our results in terms of revenue growth, earnings, and risk management.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $686 million or $2.01 people share. All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to the quarter's results. For the quarter, per share book value grew 3% and now stands at $71.36 and our ROE was about 12.5%.
The source in balance of our earnings in our judgment was simply outstanding. Underwriting income of $245 million contributed 36% in net operating income with balance contributions from both the current accident year and favorable reserve development.
Net investment income was up 10% in the quarter, reflecting both growth in our portfolio and a number of other favorable dynamics, which Phil will discuss. Our high-quality, conservatively managed investment portfolio continues to perform well and is generating substantial investment income.
Our P&C combined ratio was 92.6%, which included net catastrophe losses of just over $100 million, the vast majority of which came from the U.S. tornadoes and Mississippi flooding. We also had a reserve takedown from the first quarter cat estimates based on an updated view of those events. Our overall cat impact was reasonably modest given the severity of the U.S. cats in the quarter and again is a direct results of our global spread of business, lack of over concentration in any one business region or product line.
Our balance sheet is in great shape, with the capital position now exceeding $29 billion; vested assets have increased 7% during the year to more than $56 billion, which again speaks to future earning power.
I want to make a few comments about revenue growth, pricing, and the general insurance market environment. Total company P&C net premiums were up 15% in the quarter, with premiums up 21% in North America and up 14% in Overseas General. We benefitted in the quarter from a combination of our recent acquisitions, growth in our A&H and personal lines businesses globally and modestly improving exposure growth and better pricing in commercial P&C, particularly in a number of property and energy lines and certain causality classes.
Our long-term and patience strategy to pursue product and geographic diversification and invest for growth both organically and through acquisition is paying us back in terms of revenue growth and earnings.
This is clearly visible in the substantial contributions to our growth and net premiums written from areas such as crop insurance, which was up 400%, personal lines globally, which was up 42%, and internationally A&H up 20%, as well as, P&C in Asia and Latin America, which were up 27% and 13% respectively.
Foreign exchange benefited our overseas business by 5% to 10% depending on the currency where the business is located.
Our Life business also the beneficiary of recent investments experienced double-digit revenue growth, as well as growth and earnings. All of these businesses were major contributors to revenue and earnings in the quarter. We also saw positive exposure growth as a result, it gradually improving with sluggish economic growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Payroll, sales, and inventories are all growing though anemically. This contributed to our revenue growth as well.
Lastly, we benefited from better pricing both as a result of a modestly improving pricing environment and our continued disciplined approach to underwriting portfolio management. We saw single and double-digit price increases in certain classes of property business, such as such as single peril cat expose risks and large account property requiring significant cat capacity.
We also saw a double-digit price improvement in certain international marine and energy markets both of which have sustained large losses this year and are losing money for the industry. While we are seeing price increases in certain classes and this is an encouraging sign, it is not broad-based, in general we think the market is moving far more slowly than the fundamental say it should be. Not only in causality related classes of business, but also many of those property classes where we're getting rate.
For causality the good news is, that the floor under pricing has firmed and we’re clearly bouncing along the bottom. In my judgment, I believe we will continue to benefit from the three drivers of growth for the balance of the year.
Given our second quarter results and our momentum, it is frankly exceeding both the industry and our own plans, we're quite bullish about the second half of the year, remembering though that we're in the risk business and there is always the potential for unanticipated volatility. From where I sit today, we are quite confident about our prospects for double-digit revenue growth and our ability to meet or exceed our earnings projections in the second half of the year.
Turning to North America more specifically, growth primarily came from those P&C specialty lines I mentioned earlier, such as crop and high net worth personal lines, while retail, commercial P&C was down about 10% due mostly to underwriting discipline and the absence of any large one-off transactions this quarter compared to prior. New business was down by a third though renewal retention rates as measured by premium were the highest day of win for some time, benefiting from both rate and exposure change.
Prices for our entire renewal book were up on average for the first time in a long time, about 1%. We saw the biggest price increases in the property areas I referenced earlier ranging from 5% to 10%, but we also saw an improving trend in casualty pricing, again affirming floor. We saw a sequential price increases in our casualty book in June over May and May over April.
In our international Commercial P&C business retail net written premiums were up 20%, while wholesale was down one, both benefited from favorable foreign exchange. Market conditions varied widely by region; premiums were up double digit in Asia, Latin America, UK, Ireland and even on the Continent. In Australia, prices were up substantially for cat expose lines, as you would expect, but essentially flat in other property and casualty lines. A good example of an orderly but hardly rational market response to loss activity with overall pricing impacted by an abundance of capacity, chasing business.
For our international Commercial P&C renewal book, rates were up 2% overall. We have for example distressed property up 20 to 30, large cat expose multinational up 10, and our wholesale power book up about 20%. Renewal retention rates held steady, John Keogh and Brian Dowd are with me here and can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends.
Our International A&H business continued its return to steady and improving growth, up 19% in the quarter with a 10% benefit for foreign exchange. Asia-Pacific and Latin America both produced excellent double-digit performance.
Operating income for International A&H was also well ahead of prior year, up 30%. By the way, income for all of A&H was up on the order of 23% as combined also contributed a double-digit increase in income, a really good performance.
A&H’s underwriting results across the board were simply great in the quarter, a product focused underwriting and claims actions we have been taking over the past two years to improve our portfolio management.
Turning to reinsurance, while premiums is measured on an underwriting year basis shrank 2% mostly due to underwriting discipline. Global Re produced the combined ratio of 67.9% for the quarter benefiting from relatively modest cat losses and the reduction in their first quarter cat estimates. Again, in the context of this year's extraordinary level of natural catastrophe activity Global Re's combined ratio of 99.1% for the first six months is truly a testament to their risk management skills and conservative approach to underwriting.
In closing, we are optimistic about our growth prospects for the balance of the year. Ours is a winning strategy. We're growing our businesses and following a strategic path of diversification where we see opportunity around the globe while at the same time maintaining tight underwriting discipline and trading market share where we can't make an underwriting profit. Our recent acquisitions are paying us revenue and earnings dividends right now and we will continue to do so into the future.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Phil and then we will be back to take your questions.

203028,128119934,146985,"ACE Limited, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Thank you, Evan. We had a very strong quarter. Cash and invested assets grew by almost $2.2 billion to over $56 billion. Our tangible book value per share increased 3% and our operating cash flow was strong at over $1 billion.Investment income was $569",667,"Thank you, Evan. We had a very strong quarter. Cash and invested assets grew by almost $2.2 billion to over $56 billion. Our tangible book value per share increased 3% and our operating cash flow was strong at over $1 billion.
Investment income was $569 million, up 10% over last year's quarter. This increase was stronger than we anticipated as our book yield stabilized despite the lower interest rate environment due to a slower rate of turnover in our portfolio. This was especially true for our mortgage portfolio where prepayments slowed significantly.
We also benefited from a positive impact from foreign exchange and distributions from our private equity portfolio. We expect our current quarterly run rate for investment income to be in the range of $550 million to $560 million. It’s subject to variability in the portfolio turnover rates, PE distributions and FX.
Current new money rates are 3.4% if we invest in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio. Our current book yield is 4.3%.
As you can see on page 21 of the financial supplement, we’ve provided additional disclosure on our European debt holdings. We have no exposure to the sovereign debt of troubled European countries and our European corporate bond portfolio is highly rated. Our exposure to European banks is rated AA on average and totals $1.2 billion or 2% of our investment portfolio. Of that total, over $700 million is rated AA. Our operating cash flow include about $300 million of cash collateral we received related to a large one off transaction.
Our net loss reserves were up 2% for the quarter and are now up approximately $1 billion for the year. Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 83%. We had favorable prior period development of $146 million pre-tax, which is about flat with last year. Almost half of the development is short tail and the casualty development is predominantly from years ’06 and prior.
Cat losses were $101 million after-tax. The losses from second quarter cat events were $136 million and we had favorable development of $35 million from first quarter events principally, the Japanese earthquake and primarily in our reinsurance business.
Expense ratio was 29.7% down from 30.9% last year due primary to a changing mix of business especially crop. Our accident year combined ratio was up in line with rate and trend and again the impact of crop.
Our acquisition of the Hong Kong operations of New York Life closed on April 1 and it's been consolidated in the quarter. The operating income of our recent acquisitions of Rain and Hail, the Hong Kong and Korean life operations and the Malaysia P&C operation is in line with our expectations.
In our 2011 guidance discussed in the first quarter call, we said we expected operating income to range between $5.40 and $5.70 per share. Catastrophe losses included in that estimate were $693 million after-tax. Our operating income projections included in guidance remember were for current accident year results only and by definition did not include any estimate for prior period reserve development in future quarters.
In light of the level of first half catastrophic losses, prior period development, higher investment income and what we project as a slight improvement to current accident year underwriting for the balance of the year, we are increasing our guidance for the full year.
Operating income is now expected to range between $6 and $6.20 per share for the full year. This includes $544 million after tax in catastrophe losses for the first half plus $200 million after tax in catastrophe losses for the balance of the year. The guidance also includes $187 of after-tax favorable prior period development reflected in the first-half. There is no prior period development included in our guidance for the second half.
As announced last year, ACE plans to repurchase, during the balance of the year, enough common shares to offset the dilution from the incentive competition based increase in our share count.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Helen.

And now with casualty, as I said, it’s bouncing along the bottom. There is a firming floor and so you're seeing, you’re able to get some price increase, but you’re hardly able to write new business which speaks to the competitive market when business does comes to market. So it's bouncing along there, it's hardly a trend of a seriously firming market. But the first thing you have to do is find a floor before it, as it starts to reverse direction and move up, but prices in casualty that the market is securing overall hardily don't match trend and so it continues to erode. Current accident, you will put pressure on current accident year.

The more macro-oriented trends that you see in financial services broadly that also I believe drive insurance M&A on a global basis. Those trends remain whether it is regulatory pressures on those that have insurance companies and capital requirement on whether it’s their own, the results of their basic business. And what you see is a sluggish economic growth that also creates pressure. So in my mind, you stay patient, you stay very fundamental and over time there is plenty of opportunity.

Number one, international regulation and globally of insurance and particularly the International Association of Insurance Supervisors doing something called Com Frame, where they are trying to wrestle that, like battle through a sort of a uniform global standard of regulation of insurance. And they are looking at it in the vision of European Solvency II. And I think that is a mistake, the U.S. system of regulation put aside 50 states, which is how we administer it, but our fundamental system of regulation is different from Solvency II. The U.S., our system is geared to protect policyholders. Policyholders only and that there is minimum capital and management to protect that and meet the obligations.
Solvency II is fundamentally different. It's designed to protect policyholders, shareholders, bondholders and employees, keep a company from ever failing. There is the contrast of the two systems. The U.S. is 40% of the world insurance market, every jurisdiction is informed by its culture and its history and what works best for it, there is not one system for the word. And I'm very focused on getting U.S. regulators and treasury together because of what Dodd-Frank creates in the world of treasury and insurance to show the world that there is another way and it isn’t simply one way. And that is very important because if they adopt one system, then I'll tell you what ultimately if that system is going to - we’re going to have a hard time not implementing it here and not be a mistake. We turn insurance companies into utilities. And if you don't have an ability to fail, you don't have an ability to succeed. So you get me going on that one as you can see, I feel strongly. And that is a big issue for this industry and we should be focused on it.

We produced record after-tax operating income of $759 million or 2.22 per share. All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to the quarter’s operating results.
The quality of our earnings was excellent with strong, balanced contributions for both underwriting and investments. Net operating income was up 10% over prior year with underwriting an investment income growing in the quarter by 11% and 9% respectively.
Underwriting income of $391 million benefited from both favorable current-accident year results and positive prior period development which was flat with last year. Our operating ROE was over 13.5% bringing the year-to-date to over 10%.
Net income and book value in the quarter were impacted by realized and unrealized losses of 838 million resulting from extreme financial market volatility and interest rates which fell to their lowest level in a century as well as equity and in foreign exchange markets.
Approximately $706 million was attributed for realized fair value related mark associated with our variable annuity reinsurance business. We also had pricing related realized and unrealized losses of 87 million in our investment portfolio.
Both of these marks we believe will be largely if not wholly transient and will be recovered overtime.
Concerning the VA mark we are required to mark-to-market these long-term liabilities using derivative accounting that we believe the mark is not a good representation of our company’s liabilities.
For operating income purposes, we use traditional life insurance GAAP accounting. And in our judgment this is more representative of our ultimate liabilities since this is a traditional buy-and-hold long-term insurance portfolio and not a trading business.
As I said we also believe while markets are unusually volatile and unpredictable at this time, majority of the mark will reverse overtime and accrete back benefiting book value and net income in the future.
In fact, as a point of reference, as of Monday’s market close the market improved by approximately 200 million illustrating the transient and volatile nature. Phil will go into more detail and we have included additional disclosure in our supplement which we hope you will find helpful.
Returning to the quarter’s operating performance, the P&C combined ratio was 90.3 which included pre-tax net cap losses of just over 120 million, the vast majority of which came from Hurricane Irene in the U.S.
Our overall cat impact was quite modest and, again, reflects good risk management as well as our spread of business globally and lack of over concentration in any one business.
Our earnings growth and balance of business both product and geography have been enhanced by the acquisitions we have made in the last year. All of which are on track and should achieve or exceed the current year targets we established at the time of each acquisition.
In particular given its size and importance I want to say a few words about our crop insurance business. The crop insurance loss ratios - as they were a function of yield at the time of harvest and commodity prices.
Our 2011 plan and calendar year-to-date book loss ratios contemplated an average to modestly worst than historical average loss ratio a year. At the same time, we wrote substantially more premium volume this year than we originally projected because of higher crop commodity prices.
Consequently from what we know now, our 2011 earnings from crop will be better than we originally projected when we acquired Rain & Hail. Financially Rain & Hail will produce an excellent return on investment to Ace.
And because of our deep national presence and expertise in this business, we expect we will have superior results relative to most peer companies engaged in this business.
As you know, we made a small specialty focused acquisition in the quarter that is complementary to our agricultural industry business strategy. Penn Millers is a good solid company that has served the agri-business market since 1887 and currently operates in 34 states. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2012.
We have a very strong balance sheet, great liquidity and plenty of capital flexibility. As a result of these stress times, we are seeing a greater pipeline of opportunity than in the recent past. And we are open to additional acquisitions where they further our strategy and are accreted financially.
I want to make a few comments about revenue growth, pricing and the general insurance market environments. Total company P&C net premiums were up 33% in the quarter with premiums up 53% in North America and up 19% in overseas general.
Growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains from Asia and Latin America. Excellent performance from our international A&H business and our personal lines business globally and improved pricing in the U.S. commercial P&C where prices are firming more broadly particularly in a number of property and casualty classes.
Our growth of course benefitted substantially from strong contributions from our recent acquisitions particularly our crop insurance business.
As I’ve mentioned on our previous call, our long-term impatient strategy to pursuit product and geographic diversification and invest for growth both organically and through acquisition is clearly paying dividends in terms of revenue growth and earnings.
Focusing on North America specifically, growth primarily came from crop, high net worth personal lines and our U.S. base wholesale business where we experience modest growth for the first time in many quarters due to improved business and net retentions and broad-based price increases of about 3%.
Our U.S. retail commercial P&C premiums were flat after adjusting for a one-time transaction we wrote last year. Our U.S. retail, again, achieved positive rates with standard lines, property and casualty rates up 3.2%. Property and energy rates were up mid-single digits while general and specialty casualty were up about 2.5% ranging from up six to down just one.
For our risk management business, rates were flat for the quarter. The first time in a long time that we haven’t experienced a rate decrease in that class. On the other side of the coin professional lines rates were down 5.5%.
The floor under pricing overall continues to firm. And more classes achieve positive rate while rate decreases were smaller. In fact September pricing was the best month of the quarter and the year.
Now whether this is a trend and continues or not, it remains to be seen.
Our premium renewal retention rates in U.S. retail were very good and benefitted from about three points of exposure increase as well as rate increase. Renewal of retention rates in terms of policy count were stable, but lower by three to four points than historical averages, and our new business ratings remain relatively low.
For me, all that adds up to the difference in underwriting discipline between Ace and the market in general as we continue to further refine and focus our data driven portfolio management in each class of business we write.
And our international commercial P&C business, retail network and premiums were up 24% or 12% in constant dollar, while our international wholesale was up 2%. Like our U.S. wholesale business, this is the first time we have seen growth in our wholesale business in some time.
International retail P&C premiums were flat to up in all territories. Our growth was especially strong in Asia, in Pacific in Latin America which registered gains of 25% and 18%. Again, in constant dollar. For our international commercial P&C renewal book, rate increases range from 2% in our London wholesale business to 1% in our Ace international business with a wide range of deviation around these numbers depending on the class and the territory.
Except for cat exposed property lines, pricing trends internationally lagged the U.S. and they remain soft. Renewal retention rates study. John Keogh John Lupica and Brian Dowd can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. Our international A&H business, led by Asia Pacific and Latin America, continues to produce strong double digit premium growth.
Up 25% in the quarter with a 12% benefit from foreign exchange. Operating income for A&H globally was up about 10% with good contributions from both Ace International and combined.
Combine these growth meanwhile continues to suffer from the economic climate in the U.S. and Western Europe. Global - we had another excellent quarter with combined ratio of 65% which reflects excellent underwriting discipline, both premium writings were down, a price we are willing to pay to maintain a reasonable underwriting risk reward.
In closing, our operating performance was simply excellent, though our book value suffered from the volatility of financial markets. The operating results are what endures, it highlights the strength and vitality of this organization. And I am very confident about our prospects for the fourth quarter and beyond.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Phil, and then we’ll be back to take your questions.

We had an excellent quarter in terms of underwriting and investment income and our balance sheet and capital position are very strong. Our financial and reinsurance recoverable average remains low, and cash flow was a strong 935 million. Investment income was 564 million for the quarter up 9% over last year’s quarter. This increase was driven by an increase in the portfolio’s cash flow, a positive impact from foreign exchange and a slower turnover rate in our portfolio.
We expect our current quarterly run rate for investment income to be in the range of 555 million to 565 million which is subject to variability and portfolio turnover rates, private equity distributions NFX. Currently money rates are 3.2% if we invest in a similar distribution through our existing portfolio.
Our current book yield, is 4.3%. On a pre-tax basis, unrealized and realized losses from our investment portfolio were about 87million resulting from the mark-to-market impact of credits spread widening in the quarter. Investment rate corporate credit spreads widened 100 basis points in the quarter while high yields spreads widened by 250 basis points.
The mark included a gain of about 360 million in our investment rate fixed income portfolio offset by a loss of about 450 million in our B - double B high yield bond and private equity portfolios. This is a high quality portfolio and a decline in value was entirely to market volatility.
We realize minimal credit losses. These portfolio movements are summarized on page 19 of our financial supplement. Our fixed income portfolio over all remains in an unrealized gain position of 1.3 billion. As of Monday night, approximately 80 million of this quarter’s portfolio mark had reversed.
Our investment portfolio continues to be predominantly invested and probably traded investment grade fixed income securities and is well diversified across geographies, sectors and issuers. The duration of the portfolio is 3.7 years.
We have no exposure to sovereign debt of distressed European countries and our exposure to Euro zone banks totals less than 1 billion or 2% of the portfolio. The overall credit quality of this bank portfolio is double A, with over 700 million rated triple A. In the third quarter, financial market volatility impacted our variable annuity reinsurance business resulting in a net loss of about 660 million which comprised a realized loss of 706 million related to the change in fair value liabilities offset by 45 million in operating income.
The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations in the market conditions, and we’re consistent with published guidance in our 10Q regarding how these liabilities behave under distressed market conditions. Approximately 50% of the realized loss was attributable to an extreme drop in interest rates but about 30% of the loss attributable to the decline in equity markets.
As we’ve explained on previous calls and in our disclosure, a technical provision in the accounting rules requires us to mark-to-market are variable annuity reinsurance liabilities like a derivative using fair value accounting even though this is a traditional insurance business that we intend to hold for the long term. Therefore if we believe traditional insurance reserve accounting provides a better reflection of the liabilities and long term performance of this insurance business.
For clarity - and a window to our thinking, I’d like to elaborate on these two methodologies while referring you to page 10 in the supplement. Accounting for derivative uses prescriptive assumptions that require us the value of the policy holder accounts as if they were invested in risk-free U.S. treasury securities when in reality, we invested primarily in equities for a long term.
Under derivative accounting, equity induces are assumed to have zero appreciation over the next 20 plus years, and interest rates remain depressed at the September 30th yield curve. When the 10-year U.S. Treasury rates were up 1.9%, and the S&P was at 11.31.
As of Monday, the S&P was a 12.54, a 10-year note was 2.2% and as Evan said earlier, the fair value of our VA liabilities have improved by approximately 200 million. By substituting a risk-free rate for a long term equity performance, and using the current interest rate curve for the long term, we think fair value accounting does not provide a good representation of our VA reinsurance liabilities.
In comparison, we believe traditional insurance accounting is a better approach and provides a more representative view of the business. We’ve provided data in what we believe is a very practical way on our insurance accounting assumptions for equities and interest rates for the next few years.
As you can see on page 10 of the supplement, the insurance model assumes the S&P grows at a moderate pace and while we’re in a very low interest rate environment, we expect the yield curve to begin to normalize over time.
You can see from the two scenarios we gave you, if the insurance model interest rate assumptions prove correct, a fair value mark would accrete back into book value in a reasonably short period of time. If the risk-free interest rates, under accounting for derivatives, are better representation of the future rate at a given point in time, there’d be a very modest impact to Ace’s operating income in these future years.
Under both scenarios, book value would increase in each year as some or all of the mark unwinds and accretes back to book value. Finally, the mark is not relevant to radiate and see a regulatory capital requirements. Neither use fair value for establishing required capital.
And as with all the other insurance business, our net loss reserves were up 1.1% for the quarter adjusted for foreign exchange and are now up approximately 1 billion for the year. Our pay to incur ratio was 86%, we have favorable prior period development of 194 million pre-tax, almost all of the development was long tail, predominantly from years 2006 and prior.
Cat losses were 86 million after tax most of which related to hurricane Irene. The expense ratio was 25.6% down from 30.2% last year due primarily to a changing mix of business especially crop while our accident year loss ratio was up all due to the impact of crop. Our growth to net written premiums was 33% excluding crop and adjusting for a large risk management contract in last year’s quarter the growth was 5.6%.
In our 2011 guidance discussed in our second quarter call, we simply expected operating income to range between $6 and $6.20 per share. Catastrophe loss is included in that estimate was 744 million after tax.
Our operating income projections included in guidance remember for accident year results only and by definition did not include any estimate for prior period reserved development in future quarters. In light of the level of year-to-date catastrophe losses, prior period development and higher investment income were increasing our guidance for the full year. Operating income is now expected to range between $6.55 and $6.75 cents per share for the full year.
This includes 630 million after tax and catastrophe losses for the first three quarters plus 75 million after tax and catastrophe losses for the fourth quarter. The guidance also includes 335 million of after tax positive prior period development reflected in the first three quarters. There is no prior period development included in our guidance for the fourth quarter.
We also repurchased 100 of shares in the quarter. With that, I’ll turn the call back to Helen.

Regarding loss cost, you know, look, it varies - it varies by product over and depending on how you view loss cost. When I look at short-tail business, any rate increases we’re receiving are greater than loss cost trend. On long-tail business, if you believe the past is an indicator of the future and inflation has been relatively benign except in healthcare cost.
Then, you know, some of the rate we’re seeing - rate we’re seeing in some of the classes is tracking loss cost. On the other side of the coin, that’s not how I view things. I don’t believe that the past is an indicator of the future, and I think that loss cost continue, you know, we continue to use loss cost trends that frankly are greater than the rate increase we’re receiving today.

We produced record after-tax operating income of $759 million or 2.22 per share. All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to the quarter’s operating results. The quality of our earnings was excellent with strong, balanced contributions for both underwriting and investments. Net operating income was up 10% over prior year with underwriting and investment income growing in the quarter by 11% and 9% respectively. Underwriting income of $391 million benefited from both favorable current-accident year results and positive prior period development which was flat with last year. Our operating ROE was over 13.5% bringing the year-to-date to over 10%. Net income and book value in the quarter were impacted by realized and unrealized losses of $838 million resulting from extreme financial market volatility and interest rates which fell to their lowest level in a century as well as equity and in foreign exchange markets. Approximately $706 million was attributed for realized fair value related mark associated with our variable annuity reinsurance business. We also had pricing-related realized and unrealized losses of $87 million in our investment portfolio. Both of these marks we believe will be largely if not wholly transient and will be recovered over time. Concerning the VA mark we are required to mark-to-market these long-term liabilities using derivative accounting that we believe the mark is not a good representation of our company’s liabilities. For operating income purposes, we use traditional life insurance GAAP accounting. And in our judgment this is more representative of our ultimate liabilities since this is a traditional buy-and-hold long-term insurance portfolio and not a trading business. As I said we also believe while markets are unusually volatile and unpredictable at this time, majority of the mark will reverse over time and accrete back benefiting book value and net income in the future. In fact, as a point of reference, as of Monday’s market close the market improved by approximately 200 million illustrating the transient and volatile nature. Phil will go into more detail and we have included additional disclosure in our supplement which we hope you will find helpful. Returning to the quarter’s operating performance, the P&C combined ratio was 90.3 which included pre-tax net cap losses of just over 120 million, the vast majority of which came from Hurricane Irene in the U.S. Our overall cat impact was quite modest and, again, reflects good risk management as well as our spread of business globally and lack of over concentration in any one business. Our earnings growth and balance of business both product and geography have been enhanced by the acquisitions we have made in the last year. All of which are on track and should achieve or exceed the current year targets we established at the time of each acquisition. In particular given its size and importance I want to say a few words about our crop insurance business. The crop insurance loss ratios are a function of yield at the time of harvest and commodity prices. Our 2011 plan and calendar year-to-date book loss ratios contemplate an average that are modestly worse than historical average loss ratio a year. At the same time, we wrote substantially more premium volume this year than we originally projected because of higher crop commodity prices. Consequently from what we know now, our 2011 earnings from crop will be better than we originally projected when we acquired Rain and Hail. Financially Rain and Hail will produce an excellent return on investment to Ace. And because of our deep national presence and expertise in this business, we expect we will have superior results relative to most peer companies engaged in this business. As you know, we made a small specialty-focused acquisition in the quarter that is complementary to our agricultural industry business strategy. Penn Millers is a good solid company that has served the agri-business market since 1887 and currently operates in 34 states. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2012. We have a very strong balance sheet, great liquidity and plenty of capital flexibility. As a result of these stressed times, we are seeing a greater pipeline of opportunity than in the recent past. And we are open to additional acquisitions where they further our strategy and are accretive financially. I want to make a few comments about revenue growth, pricing and the general insurance market environment. Total company P&C net premiums were up 33% in the quarter with premiums up 53% in North America and up 19% in overseas general. Growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains from Asia and Latin America. Excellent performance from our international A&H business and our Personal Lines business globally and improved pricing in the U.S. commercial P&C where prices are firming more broadly particularly in a number of property and casualty classes. Our growth of course benefitted substantially from strong contributions from our recent acquisitions particularly our crop insurance business. As I’ve mentioned on our previous call, our long-term and patient strategy to pursuit product and geographic diversification and invest for growth both organically and through acquisition is clearly paying dividends in terms of revenue growth and earnings. Focusing on North America specifically, growth primarily came from crop, high net worth personal lines and our U.S.-based wholesale business where we experience modest growth for the first time in many quarters due to improved business and net retentions and broad-based price increases of about 3%. Our U.S. retail commercial P&C premiums were flat after adjusting for a one-time transaction we wrote last year. Our U.S. retail, again, achieved positive rates with standard lines, property and casualty rates up 3.2%. Property and energy rates were up mid-single digits while general and specialty casualty were up about 2.5%, ranging from up 6 to down just 1. For our risk management business, rates were flat for the quarter. The first time in a long time that we haven’t experienced a rate decrease in that class. On the other side of the coin professional lines rates were down 5.5%.The floor under pricing overall continues to firm. And more classes achieve positive rate while rate decreases were smaller. In fact September pricing was the best month of the quarter and the year. Now whether this is a trend and continues or not, remains to be seen. Our premium renewal retention rates in U.S. retail were very good and benefitted from about 3 points of exposure increase as well as rate increase. Renewal of retention rates in terms of policy count were stable, but lower by 3 to 4 points than historical averages, and our new business ratings remain relatively low. For me, all that adds up to the difference in underwriting discipline between Ace and the market in general as we continue to further refine and focus our data-driven portfolio management in each class of business we write. In our international commercial P&C business, retail net written premiums were up 24%, or 12% in constant dollar, while our international wholesale was up 2%. Like our U.S. wholesale business, this is the first time we have seen growth in our wholesale business in some time. International retail P&C premiums were flat to up in all territories. Our growth was especially strong in Asia and Pacific and Latin America, which registered gains of 25% and 18%. Again, in constant dollar. For our international commercial P&C renewal book, rate increases range from 2% in our London wholesale business to 1% in our Ace International business with a wide range of deviation around these numbers depending on the class and the territory. Except for cat exposed property lines, pricing trends internationally lagged the U.S. and they remain soft. Renewal retention rates held steady. John Keogh, John Lupica and Brian Dowd can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. Our international A&H business, led by Asia Pacific and Latin America, continue to produce strong double-digit premium growth. Up 25% in the quarter with a 12% benefit from foreign exchange. Operating income for A&H globally was up about 10% with good contributions from both Ace International and Combined. Combined’s growth meanwhile continues to suffer from the economic climate in the U.S. and Western Europe. Global Re had another excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 65% which reflects excellent underwriting discipline, though premium writings were down, a price we are willing to pay to maintain a reasonable underwriting risk reward. In closing, our operating performance was simply excellent, though our book value suffered from the volatility of financial markets. The operating results are what endures, they highlight the strength and vitality of this organization. And I am very confident about our prospects for the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Phil, and then we’ll be back to take your questions."

We had an excellent quarter in terms of underwriting and investment income and our balance sheet and capital position are very strong. Our financial and reinsurance recoverable leverage remains low, and cash flow was a strong $935 million",1243,"Thank you, Evan. We had an excellent quarter in terms of underwriting and investment income and our balance sheet and capital position are very strong. Our financial and reinsurance recoverable leverage remains low, and cash flow was a strong $935 million. Investment income was $564 million for the quarter up 9% over last year’s quarter. This increase was driven by an increase in the portfolio’s cash flow, a positive impact from foreign exchange and a slower turnover rate in our portfolio. We expect our current quarterly run rate for investment income to be in the range of $555 million to $565 million which is subject to variability and portfolio turnover rates, private equity distributions and FX. Current new money rates are 3.2% if we invest in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio. Our current book yield, is 4.3%. On a pre-tax basis, unrealized and realized losses from our investment portfolio were about $87 million resulting from the mark-to-market impact of credit spread widening in the quarter. Investment rate corporate credit spreads widened 100 basis points in the quarter while high yields spreads widened by 250 basis points. The mark included a gain of about $360 million in our investment rate fixed income portfolio offset by a loss of about $450 million in our B double B high yield bond and private equity portfolios. This is a high-quality portfolio and a decline in value was related entirely to market volatility. We realized minimal credit losses. These portfolio movements are summarized on page 19 of our financial supplement. Our fixed income portfolio over all remains in an unrealized gain position of $1.3 billion. As of Monday night, approximately $80 million of this quarter’s portfolio mark had reversed. Our investment portfolio continues to be predominantly invested and publicly traded investment-grade fixed income securities and is well diversified across geographies, sectors and issuers. The duration of the portfolio is 3.7 years. We have no exposure to sovereign debt of distressed European countries and our exposure to euro zone banks totals less than $1 billion or 2% of the portfolio. The overall credit quality of this bank portfolio is double A, with over $700 million rated triple A. In the third quarter, financial market volatility impacted our variable annuity reinsurance business resulting in a net loss of about $660 million which comprised a realized loss of $706 million related to the change in fair value liabilities offset by $45 million in operating income. The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations given market conditions, and were consistent with published guidance in our 10-Q regarding how these liabilities behave under distressed market conditions. Approximately 50% of the realized loss was attributable to an extreme drop in interest rates but about 30% of the loss attributable to the decline in equity markets. As we’ve explained on previous calls and in our disclosure, a technical provision in the accounting rules requires us to mark-to-market our variable annuity reinsurance liabilities like a derivative using fair-value accounting even though this is a traditional insurance business that we intend to hold for the long term. Therefore if we believe traditional insurance reserve accounting provides a better reflection of the liabilities and long-term performance of this insurance business. For clarity and a window to our thinking, I’d like to elaborate on these two methodologies while referring you to page 10 in the supplement. Accounting for derivative uses prescriptive assumptions that require us to value the policy holder accounts as if they were invested in risk-free U.S. treasury securities when in reality, they’re invested primarily in equities for a long term. Under derivative accounting, equity induces are assumed to have 0 appreciation over the next 20-plus years, and interest rates remain depressed at the September 30 yield curve. When the 10-year U.S. Treasury rates were up 1.9%, and the S&P was at 11.31%. As of Monday, the S&P was at 12.54%, a 10-year note was 2.2% and as Evan said earlier, the fair value of our VA liabilities had improved by approximately $200 million. By substituting a risk-free rate for a long term equity performance, and using the current interest rate curve for the long term, we think fair value accounting does not provide a good representation of our VA reinsurance liabilities. In comparison, we believe traditional insurance accounting is a better approach and provides a more representative view of the business. We’ve provided data in what we believe is a very practical way on our insurance accounting assumptions for equities and interest rates for the next few years. As you can see on page 10 of the supplement, the insurance model assumes the S&P grows at a moderate pace and while we’re in a very low interest rate environment, we expect the yield curve to begin to normalize over time. You can see from the two scenarios we gave you, if the insurance model interest rate assumptions prove correct, the fair value mark would accrete back into book value in a reasonably short period of time. If the risk-free interest rates, under accounting for derivatives, are better representation of the future rate at a given point in time, there’d be a very modest impact to Ace’s operating income in these future years. Under both scenarios, book value would increase in each year as some or all of the mark unwinds and accretes back to book value. Finally, the mark is not relevant to radiate and see a regulatory capital requirements. Neither use [indiscernable] value for establishing required capital. In terms of [ph] all the other insurance business, our net loss reserves were up 1.1% for the quarter adjusted for foreign exchange and are now up approximately $1 billion for the year. Our paid to incurred ratio was 86%, we had favorable prior period development of $194 million pre-tax, almost all of the development was long tail, predominantly from years 2006 and prior. Cat losses were $86 million after tax most of which related to Hurricane Irene. The expense ratio was 25.6% down from 30.2% last year due primarily to a changing mix of business especially crop while our accident year loss ratio was up all due to the impact of crop. Our growth to net written premiums was 33% excluding crop and adjusting for a large risk management contract in last year’s quarter the growth was 5.6%. In our 2011 guidance discussed in our second quarter call, we said we expected operating income to range between $6 and $6.20 per share. Catastrophe losses included in that estimate was $744 million after tax. Our operating income projections included in guidance remember for accident year results only and by definition did not include any estimate for prior period reserved development in future quarters. In light of the level of year-to-date catastrophe losses, prior period development and higher investment income were increasing our guidance for the full year. Operating income is now expected to range between $6.55 and $6.75 cents per share for the full year. This includes $630 million after tax and catastrophe losses for the first three quarters plus $75 million after tax and catastrophe losses for the fourth quarter. The guidance also includes $335 million of after tax positive prior period development reflected in the first three quarters. There is no prior period development included in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We also repurchased 100 million of shares in the quarter. With that, I’ll turn the call back to Helen."

New business pricing and renewal pricing are actually tracking very closely right on each other.

Regarding loss cost, you know, look, it varies by product over and depending on how you view loss cost. When I look at short-tail business, any rate increases we’re receiving are greater than loss cost trend. On long-tail business, if you believe the past is an indicator of the future and inflation has been relatively benign except in health care cost. Then, you know, some of the rate we’re seeing -- rate we’re seeing in some of the classes is tracking loss cost. On the other side of the coin, that’s not how I view things.

And we’re even seeing that as I said, for September, the rate was even better and more classes are achieving that. What you’re finding is, the market place in general is unwilling -- less and less willing, there are always cowboys and outliers there, but less and less willing to go along with any rate decrease. And in fact, brokers, are less and less requesting rate decreases or bludgeoning the weak to give them. And that is, you know, that’s a favorable trend.

And when -- particularly in Korea, there is commitments to treat foreign participants same as you treat domestic participants and there’s greater transparency. That isn’t sea change, but it’s an incremental benefit. And it also increases trade which increases activity and that increases opportunity for insurance. In Columbia which is frankly, I think we’re almost -- we were almost fighting a defensive action as a country because Columbia which has been a long term ally of the United States, and very pro-American, was turning their gaze more towards other countries, China, Canada, and was becoming more disillusioned with America which makes it more difficult for American businesses when we go down there to generate opportunity. This is a reaffirmation though we certainly tried their patience in waiting all the years we did to do this and we certainly didn’t handle it I think in the best of ways and lost some political capital along the way with them, this definitely improves, it shows America’s commitment towards Latin America, and that is a benefit for American businesses. When it comes to -- but I don’t expect a sea change in Asia’s business, it’s all steady stuff by itself, another brick in the wall. Austerity and the United States and Europe, you know, look, first, it creates a drag on economic growth, and that will eventually show up and expose your growth for the industry which is the biggest impact. And then we know how much is being driven by the political environment right now whether it is Europe, whether it is the U.S. and our deficit and our inability to create confidence in business. Those really weigh on growth and they will weigh -- and the insurance industry is a reflection of that."

Underwriting income of $391 million benefited from both favorable current-accident year results and positive prior period development which was flat with last year. Our operating ROE was over 13.5% bringing the year-to-date to over 10%. 
Net income and book value in the quarter were impacted by realized and unrealized losses of $838 million resulting from extreme financial market volatility and interest rates which fell to their lowest level in a century as well as equity and in foreign exchange markets. Approximately $706 million was attributed for realized fair value related mark associated with our variable annuity reinsurance business. We also had pricing-related realized and unrealized losses of $87 million in our investment portfolio. Both of these marks we believe will be largely if not wholly transient and will be recovered over time. Concerning the VA mark we are required to mark-to-market these long-term liabilities using derivative accounting that we believe the mark is not a good representation of our company’s liabilities. For operating income purposes, we use traditional life insurance GAAP accounting. And in our judgment this is more representative of our ultimate liabilities since this is a traditional buy-and-hold long-term insurance portfolio and not a trading business. 
As I said we also believe while markets are unusually volatile and unpredictable at this time, majority of the mark will reverse over time and accrete back benefiting book value and net income in the future. In fact, as a point of reference, as of Monday’s market close the market improved by approximately 200 million illustrating the transient and volatile nature. Phil will go into more detail and we have included additional disclosure in our supplement which we hope you will find helpful. Returning to the quarter’s operating performance, the P&C combined ratio was 90.3 which included pre-tax net cap losses of just over 120 million, the vast majority of which came from Hurricane Irene in the U.S. Our overall cat impact was quite modest and, again, reflects good risk management as well as our spread of business globally and lack of over concentration in any one business. 
Our earnings growth and balance of business both product and geography have been enhanced by the acquisitions we have made in the last year. All of which are on track and should achieve or exceed the current year targets we established at the time of each acquisition. In particular given its size and importance I want to say a few words about our crop insurance business. The crop insurance loss ratios are a function of yield at the time of harvest and commodity prices. Our 2011 plan and calendar year-to-date book loss ratios contemplate an average that are modestly worse than historical average loss ratio a year. At the same time, we wrote substantially more premium volume this year than we originally projected because of higher crop commodity prices. Consequently from what we know now, our 2011 earnings from crop will be better than we originally projected when we acquired Rain and Hail. 
Financially, Rain and Hail will produce an excellent return on investment to Ace. And because of our deep national presence and expertise in this business, we expect we will have superior results relative to most peer companies engaged in this business. As you know, we made a small specialty-focused acquisition in the quarter that is complementary to our agricultural industry business strategy. Penn Millers is a good solid company that has served the agri-business market since 1887 and currently operates in 34 states. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2012. We have a very strong balance sheet, great liquidity and plenty of capital flexibility. As a result of these stressed times, we are seeing a greater pipeline of opportunity than in the recent past. And we are open to additional acquisitions where they further our strategy and are accretive financially. 
I want to make a few comments about revenue growth, pricing and the general insurance market environment. Total company P&C net premiums were up 33% in the quarter with premiums up 53% in North America and up 19% in overseas general. Growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains from Asia and Latin America. Excellent performance from our international A&H business and our Personal Lines business globally and improved pricing in the U.S. commercial P&C where prices are firming more broadly particularly in a number of property and casualty classes. Our growth of course benefitted substantially from strong contributions from our recent acquisitions particularly our crop insurance business. As I’ve mentioned on our previous call, our long-term and patient strategy to pursuit product and geographic diversification and invest for growth both organically and through acquisition is clearly paying dividends in terms of revenue growth and earnings. 
Focusing on North America specifically, growth primarily came from crop, high net worth personal lines and our U.S.-based wholesale business where we experience modest growth for the first time in many quarters due to improved business and net retentions and broad-based price increases of about 3%. Our U.S. retail commercial P&C premiums were flat after adjusting for a one-time transaction we wrote last year. Our U.S. retail, again, achieved positive rates with standard lines, property and casualty rates up 3.2%. Property and energy rates were up mid-single digits while general and specialty casualty were up about 2.5%, ranging from up 6 to down just 1. For our risk management business, rates were flat for the quarter. The first time in a long time that we haven’t experienced a rate decrease in that class. On the other side of the coin professional lines rates were down 5.5%.The floor under pricing overall continues to firm. And more classes achieve positive rate while rate decreases were smaller. In fact September pricing was the best month of the quarter and the year. Now whether this is a trend and continues or not, remains to be seen. 
Our premium renewal retention rates in U.S. retail were very good and benefitted from about 3 points of exposure increase as well as rate increase. Renewal of retention rates in terms of policy count were stable, but lower by 3 to 4 points than historical averages, and our new business ratings remain relatively low. For me, all that adds up to the difference in underwriting discipline between Ace and the market in general as we continue to further refine and focus our data-driven portfolio management in each class of business we write. 
In our international commercial P&C business, retail net written premiums were up 24%, or 12% in constant dollar, while our international wholesale was up 2%. Like our U.S. wholesale business, this is the first time we have seen growth in our wholesale business in some time. International retail P&C premiums were flat to up in all territories. Our growth was especially strong in Asia and Pacific and Latin America, which registered gains of 25% and 18%. Again, in constant dollar. For our international commercial P&C renewal book, rate increases range from 2% in our London wholesale business to 1% in our Ace International business with a wide range of deviation around these numbers depending on the class and the territory. Except for cat exposed property lines, pricing trends internationally lagged the U.S. and they remain soft. Renewal retention rates held steady. John Keogh, John Lupica and Brian Dowd can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. 
Our international A&H business, led by Asia Pacific and Latin America, continue to produce strong double-digit premium growth. Up 25% in the quarter with a 12% benefit from foreign exchange. Operating income for A&H globally was up about 10% with good contributions from both Ace International and Combined. Combined’s growth meanwhile continues to suffer from the economic climate in the U.S. and Western Europe. Global Re had another excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 65% which reflects excellent underwriting discipline, though premium writings were down, a price we are willing to pay to maintain a reasonable underwriting risk reward. 
In closing, our operating performance was simply excellent, though our book value suffered from the volatility of financial markets. The operating results are what endures, they highlight the strength and vitality of this organization. And I am very confident about our prospects for the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Phil, and then we’ll be back to take your questions."
203028,134157628,208484,"ACE Limited, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Thank you, Evan. We had an excellent quarter in terms of underwriting and investment income and our balance sheet and capital position are very strong. Our financial and reinsurance recoverable leverage remains low, and cash flow was a strong $935 million",1241,"Thank you, Evan. We had an excellent quarter in terms of underwriting and investment income and our balance sheet and capital position are very strong. Our financial and reinsurance recoverable leverage remains low, and cash flow was a strong $935 million. Investment income was $564 million for the quarter up 9% over last year’s quarter. This increase was driven by an increase in the portfolio’s cash flow, a positive impact from foreign exchange and a slower turnover rate in our portfolio. 
We expect our current quarterly run rate for investment income to be in the range of $555 million to $565 million which is subject to variability and portfolio turnover rates, private equity distributions and FX. Current new money rates are 3.2% if we invest in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio. Our current book yield, is 4.3%. On a pretax basis, unrealized and realized losses from our investment portfolio were about $87 million resulting from the mark-to-market impact of credit spread widening in the quarter. 
Investment rate corporate credit spreads widened 100 basis points in the quarter while high yields spreads widened by 250 basis points. The mark included a gain of about $360 million in our investment rate fixed income portfolio offset by a loss of about $450 million in our B double B high yield bond and private equity portfolios. This is a high-quality portfolio and a decline in value was related entirely to market volatility. We realized minimal credit losses. These portfolio movements are summarized on page 19 of our financial supplement. Our fixed income portfolio over all remains in an unrealized gain position of $1.3 billion. 
As of Monday night, approximately $80 million of this quarter’s portfolio mark had reversed. Our investment portfolio continues to be predominantly invested and publicly traded investment-grade fixed income securities and is well diversified across geographies, sectors and issuers. The duration of the portfolio is 3.7 years. We have no exposure to sovereign debt of distressed European countries and our exposure to euro zone banks totals less than $1 billion or 2% of the portfolio. The overall credit quality of this bank portfolio is AA, with over $700 million rated AAA. 
In the third quarter, financial market volatility impacted our variable annuity reinsurance business resulting in a net loss of about $660 million which comprised a realized loss of $706 million related to the change in fair value liabilities offset by $45 million in operating income. The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations given market conditions, and were consistent with published guidance in our 10-Q regarding how these liabilities behave under distressed market conditions. Approximately 50% of the realized loss was attributable to an extreme drop in interest rates but about 30% of the loss attributable to the decline in equity markets. 
As we’ve explained on previous calls and in our disclosure, a technical provision in the accounting rules requires us to mark-to-market our variable annuity reinsurance liabilities like a derivative using fair-value accounting even though this is a traditional insurance business that we intend to hold for the long term. Therefore if we believe traditional insurance reserve accounting provides a better reflection of the liabilities and long-term performance of this insurance business. For clarity and a window to our thinking, I’d like to elaborate on these 2 methodologies while referring you to page 10 in the supplement. 
Accounting for derivative uses prescriptive assumptions that require us to value the policy holder accounts as if they were invested in risk-free U.S. treasury securities when in reality, they’re invested primarily in equities for a long term. Under derivative accounting, equity induces are assumed to have 0 appreciation over the next 20-plus years, and interest rates remain depressed at the September 30 yield curve. When the 10-year U.S. Treasury rates were up 1.9%, and the S&P was at 11.31%. As of Monday, the S&P was at 12.54%, a 10-year note was 2.2% and as Evan said earlier, the fair value of our VA liabilities had improved by approximately $200 million. By substituting a risk-free rate for a long term equity performance, and using the current interest rate curve for the long term, we think fair value accounting does not provide a good representation of our VA reinsurance liabilities. In comparison, we believe traditional insurance accounting is a better approach and provides a more representative view of the business. We’ve provided data in what we believe is a very practical way on our insurance accounting assumptions for equities and interest rates for the next few years. 
As you can see on page 10 of the supplement, the insurance model assumes the S&P grows at a moderate pace and while we’re in a very low interest rate environment, we expect the yield curve to begin to normalize over time. You can see from the 2 scenarios we gave you, if the insurance model interest rate assumptions prove correct, the fair value mark would accrete back into book value in a reasonably short period of time. If the risk-free interest rates, under accounting for derivatives, are better representation of the future rate at a given point in time, there’d be a very modest impact to Ace’s operating income in these future years. Under both scenarios, book value would increase in each year as some or all of the mark unwinds and accretes back to book value. Finally, the mark is not relevant to radiate and see a regulatory capital requirements. Neither use [indiscernible] value for establishing required capital. In terms of [ph] all the other insurance business, our net loss reserves were up 1.1% for the quarter adjusted for foreign exchange and are now up approximately $1 billion for the year. 
Our paid to incurred ratio was 86%, we had favorable prior period development of $194 million pre-tax, almost all of the development was long tail, predominantly from years 2006 and prior. Cat losses were $86 million after tax most of which related to Hurricane Irene. The expense ratio was 25.6% down from 30.2% last year due primarily to a changing mix of business especially crop while our accident year loss ratio was up all due to the impact of crop. Our growth to net written premiums was 33% excluding crop and adjusting for a large risk management contract in last year’s quarter the growth was 5.6%. In our 2011 guidance discussed in our second quarter call, we said we expected operating income to range between $6 and $6.20 per share. Catastrophe losses included in that estimate was $744 million after tax. Our operating income projections included in guidance remember for accident year results only and by definition did not include any estimate for prior period reserved development in future quarters. 
In light of the level of year-to-date catastrophe losses, prior period development and higher investment income were increasing our guidance for the full year. Operating income is now expected to range between $6.55 and $6.75 cents per share for the full year. This includes $630 million after tax and catastrophe losses for the first 3 quarters plus $75 million after tax and catastrophe losses for the fourth quarter. The guidance also includes $335 million of after tax positive prior period development reflected in the first 3 quarters. There is no prior period development included in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We also repurchased 100 million of shares in the quarter. 
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Helen."

We’re just not going to write business that’s running 115% to 120%. And I might add that many of the rate increases I hear out in the market place right now overall are related to workers’ comp where maybe you’re getting 7% or 8% but you’re starting from 115 or 120 combined. We de-emphasized that class. And that plus the one-time transaction together when you adjust for that North America is flat. We’re receiving great, and as I said, we’re maintaining underwriting discipline, and we’re very portfolio focused. So while we’re achieving great, at the same, we’re not writing, you know -- new business writings are up in the quarter over last year, but they’re still relatively modest.

And when -- particularly in Korea, there is commitments to treat foreign participants same as you treat domestic participants and there’s greater transparency. That isn’t sea change, but it’s an incremental benefit. And it also increases trade which increases activity and that increases opportunity for insurance. In Columbia which is frankly, I think we’re almost -- we were almost fighting a defensive action as a country because Columbia which has been a long term ally of the United States, and very pro-American, was turning their gaze more towards other countries, China, Canada, and was becoming more disillusioned with America which makes it more difficult for American businesses when we go down there to generate opportunity. This is a reaffirmation though we certainly tried their patience in waiting all the years we did to do this and we certainly didn’t handle it I think in the best of ways and lost some political capital along the way with them, this definitely improves, it shows America’s commitment towards Latin America, and that is a benefit for American businesses. When it comes to -- but I don’t expect a sea change in Asia’s business, it’s all steady stuff by itself, another brick in the wall. Austerity and the United States and Europe, you know, look, first, it creates a drag on economic growth, and that will eventually show up and expose your growth for the industry which is the biggest impact. And then we know how much is being driven by the political environment right now whether it is Europe, whether it is the U.S. and our deficit and our inability to create confidence in business. Those really weigh on growth and they will weigh -- and the insurance industry is a reflection of that."
