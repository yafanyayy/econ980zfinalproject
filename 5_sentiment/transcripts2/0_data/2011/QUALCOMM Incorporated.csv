33493,113876103,95630,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Warren and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments in the quarter driven by increased demand for smartphone and data centric devices across an expanding number of region",903,"Thanks, Warren and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments in the quarter driven by increased demand for smartphone and data centric devices across an expanding number of regions and price points.
It's been a successful quarter and there really is a lot to be excited about. First and foremost, is the continued unabated demand for wireless data. Gartner expects sales of smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2010 to grow 15% sequentially, and over 70% year-over-year. Gartner forecast annual smartphone shipments to grow more than 50% year-over-year in 2011 to reach approximately 440 million units. And of course speaking of smartphones, we're happy to see the Verizon iPhone announcement because it's been a subject of intense speculation. I'd have to say, we have no other comments to make on that topic.
In addition to smartphones, we're now seeing increasing volumes of new 3G-enabled device types such as tablets and e-readers. Our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including our dual core products, are well-positioned to target the range of devices that we expect to be launched this year.
And to help support the traffic and provide higher data rates to consumers, operators are continuing to invest in the latest technologies and are purchasing additional spectrum. Adoption of advanced wireless technologies will continue to be catalyst for network and device upgrades in the coming year. Verizon launched in 38 cities operating data modems based on Qualcomm's multi mode solution. AT&T continues to promote its HSPA plus services announced that they'll be pulling in their launch plans for LCD. And furthermore, we've also demonstrated LTE TDD, in India. 
The evolution of 3G also continuous to be a Brightpoint power business with the TSA announcing that there are currently 103 commercial HSPA+ networks, 13 of these offering 42 megabit per second data rates with dual carrier HSPA+. According to CDG, three operators have launched networks while an additional four operators have announced plans to deploy the technology.
And our leading position in these technology and multi mode chipsets allows us to address the complexities these heterogenous networks create positioning us very well for the future.
As a further example of how our opportunities are expanding, Microsoft announced the next version of Windows will support Systems on a Chip architectures including armed-based systems for Qualcomm. We have a smart strong working relationship with Microsoft and at CES they demonstrated the next version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform.
We've also announced that we've entered into an agreement with Wyeth Aeros. You heard us talk about convergence of mobility computing consumer electronics. As we commented on our recent call, this announcement should be viewed as a statement about our commitment to provide a complete set of solutions to address this trend. This acquisition will allow us to build upon our capabilities, add to our suite of best-in-class technology assets, provide new sales channels. We're looking forward to the transaction closing and joining with a proven leader.
In addition, we announced the agreement to sell substantially all of our 700 megahertz spectrum to AT&T and wind-down the FLO TV connect network. It's a win-win outcome and we're excited that AT&T intends to use carrier aggregation technology to provide supplemental downlink capacity through to its customers. Our plans includes pouring these capabilities in our chipsets to support AT&T and other operators around the world looking to take advantage of additional unpaired spectrum to support their wireless data plans. Overall, 2G, the 3G migration remains healthy and vibrant as increased competition and wider variety of more affordable 3G devices are driving a shift to wireless data globally.
According to wireless intelligence, 3G connections are expected to grow more than 25% in 2011 to 1.6 billion. A big part of this growth will come from emerging regions that have been primarily driven by 2G in the past.
While China Telecom and China Unicom aggressively drove the uptake of 3G smartphones in the second half of calendar 2010 through the direct purchase and subsidy of these devices. As a result of these and other efforts, most operators are reporting significant growth in the EV-DO and USPS subscribe in the past two quarters. China Telecom reported approximately a 68% increase in EV-DO subscribers while China Unicom reported approximately 85% increase in WCDMA subscribers for the second half of 2010. And we see the same trend continuing through 2011 as bold operators continue to drive the uptake of mass-market smartphones. 
And in India, reliance and now more recently Airtel have all launched 3G services and we expect the remaining operators to launch services in the coming months.  And finally, on the licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved one of the disputes that we had previously disclosed. 
So to wrap up, we just completed the best quarter in the history of Qualcomm driven by strong demand and excellent execution. Our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap platform condition us well to take advantage of the many wireless opportunities ahead of us. And looking forward, I am pleased to be substantially raising our full year forecast for revenue and earnings driven by the many positive trends of the industry's shift to 3G, and the broad adoption of wireless data for mobile phones and new data-centric devices. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

As we expected when we presented in New York in November, we see favorable trends in the industry continuing to develop that will drive further growth in our Licensing business. In particular, we're seeing strength in ASPs in both developed and emerging regions. September quarter activity also ended up being a bit stronger than anticipated, driven by smartphone shipment strength in the developed regions in particular. This drove record total reported device sales and a strong sequential growth in average selling prices. I'm also pleased to report that we have now resolved one of the two license disputes that have been working to bring to a close. This is not Panasonic. It is the licensee that has been underpaying its royalties to us. We are pleased that we are able to resolve this dispute in a manner that is consistent with the established value of our patent portfolio and without the need for litigation or arbitration. The results of this resolution will start to be reflected in our fiscal second quarter results included a one-time catch-up for past periods.
As I discussed in New York in November, due to variety of factors including the fact that certain QTL revenue components such as fixed licensing fees and infrastructure royalties are growing at a slower more pace than subscriber royalties, the increasing diversity of incremental product types with nontraditional royalty structures contributing to our licensing revenues as well as the impact of intermittent licensee disputes, the implied royalty rate to calculate based on information we provide has become less reliable metric for measuring the performance of the QTL business.
Having said that, the resolution of this licensee dispute increases our estimate for what we expect your calculation of the implied royalty rate to be for fiscal 2011. We had previously said that we expected your calculation as the implied royalty rate based on the midpoint of our prior guidance for fiscal year 2011 to be approximately 3.3%, excluding amounts for prior periods. While we have not yet finalized the accounting for the license agreement that we recently signed to resolve this dispute, we now expect the implied royalty rate you will calculate for fiscal year 2011 to the approximately 3.5% including a one-time benefit in the second quarter for periods prior to fiscal 2011 as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011. And that we will exit the fiscal year with an implied royalty rate, as you calculate it, of approximately 3.4% to 3.5%. It is important to note that this updated outlook excludes any potential upside that may result from the arbitration with Panasonic. As we mentioned during our last call, we are very pleased with the outcome of the first phase of that process, as the arbitrator issued an interim order finding that Qualcomm did not breach its license agreement with Panasonic. This supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
In closing, I'm very pleased with the successful resolution we announced today and continue to feel QTL is well positioned for strong growth ahead in a very exciting global wireless industry. 
Thank you and I'll talk turn the call over to Steven Mollenkopf."
33493,113876103,95630,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered another strong quarter. We shipped a record 118 million MSMs and delivered both record revenues and record operating profit. We are seeing stronger demand for our integrated chipset",834,"Thank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered another strong quarter. We shipped a record 118 million MSMs and delivered both record revenues and record operating profit. We are seeing stronger demand for our integrated chipsets compared to our prior forecast and are pleased to be raising our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
Smartphone-driven demand for our solutions, particularly in North America, was very strong again this quarter and contributed to a favorable product mix.
Our leading roadmap, technology and integration capabilities are aligning well with industry trends. Shipments of our 7-K and 8-K integrated chipsets were up more than 40% sequentially and more than 150% year-over-year. Our leadership in LTE continues as we begin volume shipments of our multimode 3G LTE chipsets last quarter. There is a strong design activity in the pipeline which over 25 manufacturers more than 50 LTE including data modems, LT hotspots, smartphones and tablets.
Our support for multiple operating systems across multiple product tiers continue to position us well within the growing smartphone segment. We saw over 30 new devices announced by our partners including several industry firsts. A sharp Galapagos which is the first 3-D mobile phone with 3-D display and 3-D capture, the first HSPA+ phones including the iT-Mobile might touch 4G; and HTC Thunderbolt which is the first 4G LTE phone for Verizon Wireless. Windows Phone 7 devices began shipping this past quarter, all powered by Snapdragon with handsets from HTC, LG, Dell and Samsung.
We're also pleased to see Microsoft demonstrate a future version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform at CES. We believe our architectural advantages deliver high-performance computing and graphics at low power and will enable new and innovative device types in the computing ecosystem just as they have in the mobile ecosystem. This will open up significant new opportunities for our chipsets.
We continue to demonstrate our ability execute and scale this quarter which is required to exceed in such a large and expanding industry. We currently have more than 150 Snapdragon devices in development including more than 20 tablets. Our new, dual core MSM 8660 chipset is already being designed into over 60 devices by our partners. The performance and efficiency of this chipset make it well-suited to both tables and phones. It delivers console-quality graphics for rich, on-device gaming and high-definition video. The chipset also has integrated support for HDMI output which means you can plug your phone or tablet into a TV to share photos, play games, or even watch high-definition 3-D video.
Snapdragon's large install base, strong graphics capabilities and software development tools have attracted a sizable community of gaming developers. We currently have close to 100 casual and HD games optimized for our graphics processing Unit, which we believe is 2x to 3x the number optimized for any other mobile chipset. And we see this number growing quickly.
Our next-generation chipset architecture is on path to raise the bar for the industry again. This architecture delivers 5x the performance and uses 75% of the power of our previous generation, which was already industry-leading. As we had mentioned  previously, the MSM 8960 will be the first chipset with this new architecture and then integrated LT modem. It is sampling later this year.
We will also update the Snapdragon line to include this new architecture at all tiers. We will share more details of our plans at mobile world Congress in Barcelona.
As we have mentioned in November, during fiscal 2011, we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones. Specifically, a greater mix of  mass-market smartphones. In addition, increased chipset shipments in emerging regions will be driven by the transition of 2G to 3G technology. Our integrated solutions are particularly well-suited for these mass-market devices and will continue to price in order to grow share in this environment.
As we have commented on in the past, we also prepared to transition our progress towards our first 28 nanometer parts and continue to increase the focus on cost-optimized solutions.
In the nearer term, we do expect some seasonality in our fiscal second quarter consistent with prior years including the effects of annual pricing resets with our customers and MSM shipment levels a bit lower coming off a busy holiday season.
Finally, we are excited about the recently announced agreement to acquire Atheros. This acquisition significantly expands our opportunities as a semiconductor provider. With this incremental set of products, channels and customers, we can accelerate the extension of our technologies and platform beyond Soviet the computing, consumer electronics and networking. In closing, the QCT team is executing very well, driving our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We expect another wave of exciting devices based on our technology to be announced the quarter. We are in a unique position to lead the transition to smartphones and always on, always connected computing and entertainment devices. 
That concludes my. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876103,95630,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. We have another quarter of record results today pleased to be raising our estimates of fiscal 2011 revenue and earnings per share. The impact related to the recent license dispute resolution announced today will",1452,"Thanks, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. We have another quarter of record results today pleased to be raising our estimates of fiscal 2011 revenue and earnings per share. The impact related to the recent license dispute resolution announced today will be recorded in our second fiscal quarter and beyond. It is not reflected in our first fiscal quarter results.
Our fiscal first quarter revenues of $3.35 billion were a record high of 25% year-over-year and at the high-end of our prior guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were also a record $0.82 per share, up 32% year-over-year significantly exceeding the high-end of our product guidance. We shipped a record 118 million MSM chips during the quarter towards the high-end of our prior guidance, and average revenue per MSM increased sequentially consistent with our prior guidance. QCT's operating margin was 30% driven by a favorable mix of smartphone chipsets.
Total reported device sales by our licensees or a record $34 billion exceeding our prior expectations and driven by a greater than expected mix of licensee device shipments in developed regions, notably North America, Japan and Korea. We estimate that our licensees shipped approximately 165 to 169 million new CDMA devices in the September 2010 quarter, also a record. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA devices was approximately $201 to $207 per Unit, up approximately 12% sequentially driven by the greater mix of devices in developed regions as well as approximately $8 of favorable foreign exchange.
QTL's operating margin was 84% and the implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information that we provide was slightly lower sequentially, consistent with expectations and driven primarily by fixed revenue items and infrastructure royalties within QTL's total revenues.
Cash and marketable securities totaled $19 billion at the end of the first quarter, including $6 billion onshore and $13 billion offshore. During the first fiscal quarter, we paid cash dividends of $309 million or $0.19 per share. And on in January 14, we announced another cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on March 25, 2011. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% in the first fiscal quarter. We recorded a $32 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010 as a result of the retroactive reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit. To facilitate a better period-to-period comparisons, we excluded this tax benefit related to fiscal 2010 from our first quarter non-GAAP results.
Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.10 higher than our initial guidance midpoint of $0.72 at the outset of the quarter. QCT was approximately $0.04 higher, QTL was approximately $0.03 higher. The remaining $0.03 was a combination of the lower tax rate given by the fiscal 2011 portion of the federal R&D tax credit. And investment gains not included in our prior guidance.
We estimate that calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments were approximately 640 to 660 million devices. Based on the 650 million midpoint of our estimate, 2010 CDMA device shipments grew 28% year-over-year.
Now turning to our guidance. We're increasing our estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments. We estimate that between 750 and 800 million CDMA devices will ship in 2011 an increase of approximately 15% to 23% over the midpoint of our calendar 2010 estimate. Since I'm sure you know we are substantially raising our financial guidance for the fiscal year. Over the $1.2 billion increase to our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance, approximately $650 million is driven by an improved outlook for our chipset business and approximately $550 million is driven by an improved outlook in our licensing business. The approximate $550 million licensing improvement is due in part to the license dispute resolution and in part to a material increase in the base Licensing business independent of the license resolution. The $550 million is also a net increase on top of the amount we included in our fiscal 2011 guidance back in November for the potential resolution of one or both of our licensee disputes.
The new licensee amendment was just recently signed. Though the accounting treatment still needs to be finalized, we expect our fiscal 2011 will include revenues from this licensee for sales in the second fiscal quarter as well as for past sales in prior quarters. As Derek pointed out, we think that the implied royalty rate as you calculated has become a less reliable metric for modeling the licensing business. Having said that, we estimate that the implied rate for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2011 excluding the amounts related the periods prior than this will be relatively constant in the range of approximately 3.4% to 3.5%.
As Derek noted, although we remain confident in our position, the arbitration with Panasonic may not be decided until after our fiscal year and we therefore are not forecasting any amounts related to any resolution with Panasonic in this fiscal year at this time. We expect non-GAAP fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $13.6 billion to $14.2 billion as compared to our prior estimate of $12.4 billion to $13 billion. We are also raising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance by $0.28 per share. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 to $3.05, an increase of 18% to 24% year-over-year. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA-based devices to be approximately $190 to $200 for all of fiscal 2011.
In QCT, although the opportunity to be in the higher end of this range is now a bit better reflecting strong stronger volume and mix expectations, we are reaffirming our prior estimate that operating margins will be in the range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. The expected decrease in operating margins for the remainder of fiscal 2011 relative to last couple of quarters reflects our continued expectation of a greater mix of mass-market smartphones and our new chipset products to service demand. We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to increase approximately 12% year-over-year higher than our prior guidance of approximately 7%, reflecting variable cost related to our greater expected revenues as well as some foreign exchange impact. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, R&D expense will improve to approximately 17% of revenue, similar to the rate we experienced three or four years ago. And SG&A expense will improve approximately 10% of revenue, the lowest rate in the last five years.  We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 21%.
Now turning to the second fiscal quarter, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion. And non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.77 to $0.81. Based on the midpoints, we expect second quarter revenue and earnings per share to increase year-over-year by 35% and 34% respectively. We expect total reported device sales reported by our licensees to be approximately  $36.5 billion to $38.5 billion up 35% year-over-year based on the midpoint. We anticipate QCT shipments of approximately $113 million to $117 million MSM chips during the March quarter down a bit coming off the busy holiday quarter but up 24% year-over-year based on the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be down quarter-over-quarter driven by annual pricing resets with customers consistent with historical norms. And we expect lower operating margin sequentially.
Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations remaining at the low end of the historical range through fiscal 2011. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase approximately 11% sequentially reflecting normal increased seasonal expenses primarily related to employee payroll taxes. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance midpoint is $0.03 lower as compared to our first quarter. We expect QTL to the better $0.17 sequentially, driven by revenue related to the new license dispute resolution and increased device volumes reported by licensees for the busy holiday quarter. We estimate that the one-time revenue benefit related to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter will be approximately $250 million or $0.09 per share in the second fiscal quarter. We expect to QCT to be approximately $0.10 lower driven by the seasonal lower volumes and pricing resets mentioned earlier.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense accounts for approximately $0.05 and the remaining decrease is driven by the diluted impact of increased share count and lower sequential investment income as we do not include estimates for uncertain realized investment gains losses in our forecast. Net unrealized gains on marketable securities were $968 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

Again, consistent as what we expected at the time we were in New York three months ago. From that point, I would just say that at this early stage, we expect to be going out of the year, just a bit modestly higher on the margins, but of course that will be a function of volume and mix as we go. On the $250 million, I think what the key there is just to know when you look at Q2 in terms of comparing it to what you want to model for Q3 and forward, is that was an amount that really relates to prior periods. We haven't gotten into as of this early stage of how much of that might be Q1 versus prior periods. The deal was just recently signed, so we haven't gotten to that part yet.

So the back half of the year is going to do roughly $0.68 $0.69 at your guidance -- and then if you look at your guidance for Q2, the $0.79 at the midpoint of $0.79 to $0.81, take off the $0.09 from $250 million, next quarter's basically $0.70. So I'm I right to assume that your guidance is assuming basically on an apples to apples basis roughly $0.70 flat for the next three quarters with no growth is growth of the year? And why with that be as opposed to seeing some growth? And then just a quick question for Steve, when you're looking at the integrated chipsets you're selling, are you seeing a more 7000s and more 8000s, I'd imagine with the developed markets doing better now, that you're seeing more 8000s selling but do you expect more 7000s to sell as we get into the next few quarters and that's a source of margin pressure."

Your math is largely correct, I won't comment on whether it's approximately $0.70 for the next three quarters equal and I think there is -- mentioned earlier we are expecting a little bit better in the fourth fiscal quarter at this point but your math is correct, and a couple of the key drivers to in Qualcomm's first half of the fiscal year, we get the Christmas effect both in QCT and QTL. So over the years, the first half of the fiscal year does tend to be greater than the second half of the fiscal year, that's number one. Number two, as we pointed out, you do have this $250 million that does relate to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter, and so we won't see that in Q3 were Q4 in the second fiscal half. And then thirdly, as we went through in New York and in effect what we're reiterating here is that QCT is aggressively going after what we see is a fairly substantial smartphone mass-market. And we've got new products as well to go at that market. And for fiscal 2011, we expect the margin on those products to be lower than what we have historically seen with new products. And the target is that in fiscal '12, we follow on with replacements product, namely the 28-nanometer that brings those margins back to the level we want to see. So I think those are the key drivers.

But as we said, we do expect that trend to be shifting a bit here as the year progresses for QCT. So I think that's -- and that much traces back into the Licensing business as well. The other thing I do want to point out is in November we said we had an undisclosed amount, but we had an amount in our guidance that we thought was prudent, prudent based on our expectations of that time resolving one or both of the licensee disputes.

We're very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments in this quarter, driven by increased demand for smartphone and data-centric devices across an expanding number of regions and price points.
It's been a successful quarter and there really is a lot to be excited about. First and foremost is the continued unabated demand for wireless data. Gartner expects sales of smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2010 to grow 15% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year. Gartner forecast annual smartphone shipments to grow more than 50% year-over-year in 2011 to reach approximately 440 million units. And of course speaking of smartphones, we're happy to see the Verizon iPhone announcement because it's been a subject of intense speculation, but I have to say we have no other comments to make on that topic.
In addition to smartphones, we're now seeing increasing volumes of new 3G-enabled device types such as tablets and e-readers. Our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including our dual core products, are well-positioned to target the range of devices that we expect to be launched this year. 
To help support the traffic and provide higher data rates to consumers, operators are continuing to invest in the latest technologies and are purchasing additional spectrum. Adoption of advanced wireless technologies will continue to be a catalyst for network and device upgrades in the coming year. Verizon launched LTE in 38 cities and started offering data modems based on QUALCOMM'S multimode solution. AT&T continues to promote its HSPA+ service, has  they will be pulling in their launch plans for LTE. And furthermore, we've also demonstrated LTE TDD in India. 
The evolution of 3G also continues to be a bright point for our business with the GSA announcing that they are currently 103 commercial HSPA+ networks, 13 of these offering 42 megabit per second data rates with Dual-Carrier HSPA+. According to CDG, three operators have launched DO Rev. B networks while an additional four operators have announced plans to deploy the technology.
And our leading position in these technologies and multimode chipsets allows us to address the complexities these heterogenous networks create, positioning us very well for the future.
As a further example of how our opportunities are expanding, Microsoft announced that the next version of Windows will support Systems on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems for QUALCOMM. We have a strong working relationship with Microsoft. And at CES, they demonstrated the next version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform.
We've also announced that we've entered into an agreement to buy Aeros. You heard us talk about a vision around the convergence of mobility, computing, consumer electronics. As we commented on our recent call, this announcement should be viewed as a statement about our commitment to provide a complete set of solutions to address this trend. This acquisition will allow us to build upon our capabilities, add to our suite of best-in-class technology assets, provide new sales channels. We're looking forward to the transaction closing and joining with a proven leader.
In addition, we announced the agreement to sell substantially all of our 700 megahertz Spectrum to AT&T and wind down the FLO TV network. It's a win-win  outcome and we're excited that AT&T intends to use carrier aggregation technology to provide supplemental downlink capacity to its customers. Our plans include supporting these capabilities in our chipsets to support AT&T and other operators around the world, looking to take advantage of additional unpaired spectrum to support their wireless data plans. Overall, the 2G, the 3G migration remain healthy and vibrant as increased competition and wider variety of more affordable 3G devices are driving the shift to wireless data globally.
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G connections are expected to grow more than 25% in 2011 to 1.6 billion. A big part of this growth will come from emerging regions that have been primarily driven by 2G in the past.
Both China Telecom and China Unicom aggressively drove the uptake of 3G smartphones in the second half of calendar 2010 through the direct purchase and subsidy of these devices. As a result of these and other efforts, most operators are reporting significant growth in EV-DO and UMTS subscribe in the past two quarters. China Telecom reported approximately a 68% increase in EV-DO subscribers, while China Unicom reported an approximately 85% increase in WCDMA subscribers for the second half of 2010. And we see the same trend continuing through 2011 as bold operators continue to drive the uptake of mass-market smartphones. 
And in India, Reliance and Tata DOCOMO and now more recently, Airtel, have all launched 3G services and we expect remaining operators to launch services in the coming months.  
And finally, on the licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved one of the disputes that we had previously disclosed. 
So to wrap up, we just completed the best quarter in the history of QUALCOMM, driven by strong demand and excellent execution. Our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap platform condition us well to take advantage of the many wireless opportunities ahead of us. And looking forward, I am pleased to be substantially raising our full year forecast for revenue and earnings driven by the many positive trends of the industry's shift to 3G and the broad adoption of wireless data for mobile phones and new data-centric devices. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

As we expected when we presented in New York in November, we see favorable trends in the industry continuing to develop that will drive further growth in our Licensing business. In particular, we're seeing strength in ASPs in both developed and emerging regions. September quarter activity also ended up being a bit stronger than anticipated, driven by smartphone shipment strength in the developed regions in particular. This drove record total reported device sales and a strong sequential growth in average selling prices. I am also pleased to report that we have now resolved one of the two licensee disputes that we have been working to bring to a close. This is not Panasonic. It is the licensee that has been underpaying its royalties to us. We are pleased that we are able to resolve this dispute in a manner that is consistent with the established value of our patent portfolio and without the need for litigation or arbitration. The result of this resolution will start to be reflected in our fiscal second quarter results including a one-time catch-up for past periods.
As I discussed in New York in November, due to a variety of factors including the fact that certain QTL revenue components such as fixed licensing fees and infrastructure royalties are growing at a slower more pace than subscriber royalties, the increasing diversity of incremental product types with non-traditional royalty structures contributing to our Licensing revenues, as well as the impact of intermittent licensee disputes, the implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide has become a less reliable metric for measuring the performance of the QTL business.
Having said that, the resolution of this licensee dispute increases our estimate for what we expect your calculation of the implied royalty rate to be for fiscal 2011. We had previously said that we expected your calculation as the implied royalty rate based on the midpoint of our prior guidance for fiscal year 2011 to be approximately 3.3%, excluding amounts for prior periods. While we have not yet finalized the accounting for the license agreement that we recently signed to resolve this dispute, we now expect the implied royalty rate you will calculate for fiscal year 2011 to be approximately 3.5%, including a one-time benefit in the second quarter for periods prior to fiscal 2011, as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011. And that we will exit the fiscal year with an implied royalty rate, as you calculate it, of approximately 3.4% to 3.5%. It is important to note that this updated outlook excludes any potential upside that may result from the arbitration with Panasonic. As we mentioned during our last call, we are very pleased with the outcome of the first phase of that process as the arbitrator issued an interim order, finding that QUALCOMM did not breach its license agreement with Panasonic. This supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
In closing, I'm very pleased with the successful resolution we have announced today and continue to feel QTL is well-positioned for strong growth ahead in a very exciting global wireless industry. 
Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Steven Mollenkopf."

We shipped a record 118 million MSMs and delivered both record revenues and record operating profit. We are seeing stronger demand for our integrated chipsets compared to our prior forecast and are pleased to be raising our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
Smartphone-driven demand for our solutions, particularly in North America, was very strong again this quarter and contributed to a favorable product mix.  
Our leading roadmap, technology and integration capabilities are aligning well with industry trends. Shipments of our 7k and 8k integrated chipsets were up more than 40% sequentially and more than 150% year-over-year. Our leadership in LTE continues as we begin volume shipments of our multimode 3G LTE chipsets last quarter. There is a strong design activity in the pipeline with over 25 manufacturers developing more than 50 LTE devices, including data modems, LTE hotspots, smartphones and tablets.
Our support for multiple operating systems across multiple product tiers continues to position us well within the growing smartphone segment. We saw over 30 new devices announced by our partners including several industry firsts. The sharp Galapagos, which is the first 3D mobile phone with 3D display and 3D capture; the first HSPA+ phones including the T-Mobile myTouch 4G; and HTC Thunderbolt, which is the first 4G LTE phone for Verizon Wireless. Windows Phone 7 devices began shipping this past quarter, all powered by Snapdragon with handsets from HTC, LG, Dell and Samsung.
We are also pleased to see Microsoft demonstrate a future version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform at CES. We believe our architectural advantages deliver high-performance computing and graphics at low power and will enable new, innovative device types in the computing ecosystem just as they have in the mobile ecosystem. This will open up significant new opportunities for our chipsets.
We continue to demonstrate our ability to execute at scale this quarter, which is required to succeed in such a large and expanding industry. We currently have more than 150 Snapdragon devices in development including more than 20 tablets. Our new dual-core MSM 8660 chipset is already being designed into over 60 devices by our partners. The performance and efficiency of this chipset make it well-suited to both tables and phones. It delivers console-quality graphics for rich, on-device gaming and high-definition video. The chipset also has integrated support for HDMI output, which means you can plug your phone or tablet into a TV to share photos, play games, or even watch high-definition 3D video.
Snapdragon's large install base, strong graphics capabilities and software development tools have attracted a sizable community of gaming developers. We currently have closed 100 casual and HD games optimized for our graphics processing unit, which we believe is 2x to 3x the number optimized for any other mobile chipset. And we see this number growing quickly.
Our next-generation chipset architecture is on path to raise the bar for the industry again. This architecture delivers 5x the performance and uses 75% of the power of our previous generation, which was already industry-leading. As we have mentioned  previously, the MSM 8960 will be the first chipset with this new architecture and an integrated LTE modem. It is sampling later this year.
We will also update the Snapdragon line to include this new architecture at all tiers. We will share more details of our plans at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
As we mentioned in November, during fiscal 2011, we expect to see an increase in a variety and tiering of smartphones. Specifically, a greater mix of mass-market smartphones. In addition, increased chipset shipments in emerging regions will be driven by the transition of 2G to 3G technology. Our integrated solutions are particularly well-suited for these mass-market devices, and we will continue to price in order to grow share in this environment.
As we have commented on in the past, we also prepare to transition our product line towards our first 28 nanometer parts and continue to increase the focus on cost-optimized solutions.
In the nearer term, we do expect some seasonality in our fiscal second quarter, consistent with prior years including the effects of annual pricing resets with our customers and MSM shipment levels a bit lower coming off a busy holiday quarter.
Finally, we are excited about the recently announced agreement to acquire Atheros. This acquisition significantly expands our opportunities as a semiconductor provider. With this incremental set of products, channels and customers, we can accelerate the extension of our technologies and platforms beyond cellular to computing, consumer electronics and networking. In closing, the QCT team is executing very well, driving our technology and integration-leadership position in the industry. We expect another wave of exciting devices based on our technology to be announced this quarter. We are in a unique position to lead the transition to smartphones and always on, always connected computing and entertainment devices. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

We are pleased to be substantially raising our estimates for fiscal 2011 revenue and earnings per share. The impact related to the recent license dispute resolution announced today will be recorded in our second fiscal quarter and beyond. It is not reflected in our first fiscal quarter results.
Our fiscal first quarter revenues of $3.35 billion were a record high, up 25% year-over-year and at the high end of our prior guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were also a record $0.82 per share, up 32% year-over-year, significantly exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. We shipped a record 118 million MSM chips during the quarter towards the high end of our prior guidance and average revenue per MSM increased sequentially consistent with our prior guidance. QCT's operating margin was 30%, driven by a favorable mix of smartphone chipsets.
Total reported device sales by our licensees were a record $34 billion, exceeding our prior expectations and driven by a greater-than-expected mix of licensee device shipments in developed regions, notably North America, Japan and Korea. We estimate that our licensees shipped approximately 165 million to 169 million new CDMA devices in the September 2010 quarter, also a record. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA devices was approximately $201 to $207 per unit, up approximately 12% sequentially, driven by the greater mix of devices in developed regions, as well as approximately $8 of favorable foreign exchange.
QTL's operating margin was 84% and the implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide was slightly lower sequentially, consistent with expectations and driven primarily by fixed revenue items and infrastructure royalties within QTL's total revenues.
Cash and marketable securities totaled $19 billion at the end of the first quarter, including $6 billion onshore and $13 billion offshore. During the first fiscal quarter, we paid cash dividends of $309 million or $0.19 per share. And on January 14, we announced another cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on March 25, 2011. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% in the first fiscal quarter. We recorded a $32 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010 as a result of the retroactive reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit. To facilitate a better period-to-period comparison, we excluded this tax benefit related to fiscal 2010 from our first quarter non-GAAP results.
Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.10 higher than our initial guidance midpoint of $0.72 at the outset of the quarter. QCT was approximately $0.04 higher, QTL was approximately $0.03 higher. The remaining $0.03 was a combination of the lower tax rate driven by the fiscal 2011 portion of the federal R&D tax credit and investment gains not included in our prior guidance.
We estimate that calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments were approximately 640 million to 660 million new devices. Based on the 650 million midpoint of our estimate, 2010 CDMA device shipments grew 28% year-over-year.
Now turning to our guidance. We are increasing our estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments. We estimate that between 750 million and 800 million CDMA devices will ship in 2011, an increase of approximately 15% to 23% over the midpoint of our calendar 2010 estimate because I'm sure you know that we are substantially raising our financial guidance for the fiscal year. Of the $1.2 billion increase to our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance, approximately $650 million is driven by an improved outlook for our chipset business and approximately $550 million is driven by an improved outlook in our Licensing business. The approximate $550 million licensing improvement is due in part to the license dispute resolution and in part to a material increase in the base Licensing business independent of the license resolution. The $550 million is also a net increase on top of the amount we included in our fiscal 2011 guidance back in November for the potential resolution of one or both of our licensee disputes.
The new licensee amendment was just recently signed. Though the accounting treatment still needs to be finalized, we expect our fiscal second quarter will include revenues from this licensee, for sales in the second fiscal quarter, as well as for past sales in prior quarters. As Derek pointed out, we think that the implied royalty rate as you calculate it has become a less reliable metric for modeling the Licensing business. Having said that, we estimate that the implied rate for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2011 excluding the amounts related to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter will be relatively constant in the range of approximately 3.4% to 3.5%.  
As Derek noted, although we remain confident in our position, the arbitration with Panasonic may not be decided until after our fiscal year end, and we therefore are not forecasting any amounts related to any resolution with Panasonic in this fiscal year at this time. We expect non-GAAP fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $13.6 billion to $14.2 billion as compared to our prior estimate of $12.4 billion to $13 billion. We are also raising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance by $0.28 per share. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 to $3.05, an increase of 18% to 24% year-over-year. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA-based devices to be approximately $190 to $200 for all of fiscal 2011.
In QCT, although the opportunity to be in the higher end of this range is now a bit better, reflecting stronger volume and mix expectations, we are reaffirming our prior estimate that operating margins will be in the range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. The expected decrease in operating margins for the remainder of fiscal 2011 relative to the last couple of quarters reflects our continued expectation of a greater mix of mass-market smartphones and our new chipset products to service demand. 
We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to increase approximately 12% year-over-year, higher than our prior guidance of approximately 7%, reflecting variable cost related to our greater expected revenues, as well as some foreign exchange impact. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, R&D expense will improve to approximately 17% of revenue, similar to the rate we experienced three and four years ago. And SG&A expense will improve to approximately 10% of revenue, the lowest rate in the last five years.  We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 21%.
Now turning to the second fiscal quarter, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion. And non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.77 to $0.81. Based on the midpoints, we expect second quarter revenue and earnings per share to increase year-over-year by 35% and 34% respectively. We expect total reported device sales reported by our licensees to be approximately  $36.5 billion to $38.5 billion, up 35% year-over-year based on the midpoint. We anticipate QCT shipments of approximately 113 million to 117 million MSM chips during the March quarter, down a bit coming off the busy holiday quarter but up 24% year-over-year based on the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be down quarter-over-quarter driven by annual pricing resets with customers consistent with historical norms. And we expect lower operating margin sequentially.
Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations, remaining at the low end of the historical range through fiscal 2011. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase approximately 11% sequentially, reflecting normal increased seasonal expenses primarily related to employee payroll taxes. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance midpoint is $0.03 lower as compared to our first quarter. We expect QTL to be better $0.17 sequentially, driven by revenue related to the new license dispute resolution and increased device volumes reported by licensees for the busy holiday quarter. We estimate that the one-time revenue benefit related to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter will be approximately $250 million or $0.09 per share in the second fiscal quarter. We expect QCT to be approximately $0.10 lower, driven by the seasonal lower volumes and pricing resets mentioned earlier.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense growth accounts for approximately $0.05 and the remaining decrease is driven by the diluted impact of increased share count and lower sequential investment income as we do not include estimates for uncertain realized investment gains, losses in our forecast. Net unrealized gains on marketable securities were $968 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

From that point, I would just say that at this early stage, we expect to be going out of the year just a bit modestly higher on the margins, but of course that will be a function of volume and mix as we go. On the $250 million, I think the key there is just to know that when you look at Q2 in terms of comparing it to what you want to model for Q3 and forward is that, that was an amount that really relates to prior periods. We haven't gotten into, as of this early stage, of how much of that might be Q1 versus prior periods. The deal was just recently signed, so we haven't gotten to that part yet.

But stripping out the effect of tablets, it seems like the underlying rate did not change, so I just wanted to confirm that I have that roughly correctly. And then secondly, your comment that the royalty rate would exit at about 3.4% to 3.5% is about a 40 basis point acceleration of 3.1% that you just reported. But then the settlement only adds about 20 basis points to the full year royalty even including the catch-up. So to me that implies that the rate is actually accelerating from now through year end and that's despite the increasing tablet mix. So I just want to understand if that thought process is correct.

But then, we've given you the data so that you could pull out of that if you like the amount of that, that would be attributable to prior periods.

And if we take off the $0.82 you just did and the $0.79, which is the midpoint of your guidance for next quarter, I think you get $1.37 left over, which then if you divide by two is about $0.68, $0.69. So the back half of the year is going to do roughly $0.68, $0.69, but your guidance -- and then if you look at your guidance for Q2, the $0.79 at the midpoint of $0.77 to $0.81, take off the $0.09 from $250 million, next quarter is basically $0.70. So am I right to assume that your guidance is assuming basically on an apples-to-apples basis, roughly $0.70 flat for the next three quarters with no growth as you go through the year, and why would that be as opposed to seeing some growth? And then just a quick question for Steve, when you're looking at the integrated chipsets that you're selling, are you seeing a difference between more 7000s or more 8000s? I'd imagine with the developed markets doing better now that you're seeing more 8000s selling, but do you expect more 7000s to sell as we get into the next few quarters and that's a source of margin pressure?"

I won't comment on whether it's approximately $0.70 per quarter for the next three quarters equally. I think I did mention earlier we are expecting a little bit better in the fourth fiscal quarter at this point, but your math is correct. And a couple of key drivers there. In QUALCOMM'S first half of any fiscal year, we get the Christmas effect both in QCT and QTL. So over the years, the first half of the fiscal year does tend to be greater than the second half of the fiscal year, so that's number one. Number two, as we pointed out, you do have this $250 million that does relate to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter, and so we won't see that in Q3 or Q4 in the second fiscal half. And then thirdly, as we went through in New York and in effect what we're reiterating here is that QCT is aggressively going after what we see is a fairly substantial smartphone mass-market. And we've got new products as well to go at that market. And for fiscal 2011, we expect the margin on those products to be lower than what we have historically seen with new products. And the target is that in fiscal '12, we follow on with replacements product, namely the 28-nanometer, that brings those margins back to the level that we want to see. So I think those are the key drivers. But your math, Ehud, I mean it's basically correct, yes."

33493,113876103,95761,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments in this quarter, driven by increased demand for smartphone and data-centric devices across an expanding number of regi",914,"Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments in this quarter, driven by increased demand for smartphone and data-centric devices across an expanding number of regions and price points.
It's been a successful quarter and there really is a lot to be excited about. First and foremost is the continued unabated demand for wireless data. Gartner expects sales of smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2010 to grow 15% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year. Gartner forecast annual smartphone shipments to grow more than 50% year-over-year in 2011 to reach approximately 440 million units. And of course speaking of smartphones, we're happy to see the Verizon iPhone announcement because it's been a subject of intense speculation, but I have to say we have no other comments to make on that topic.
In addition to smartphones, we're now seeing increasing volumes of new 3G-enabled device types such as tablets and e-readers. Our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including our dual core products, are well-positioned to target the range of devices that we expect to be launched this year. 
To help support the traffic and provide higher data rates to consumers, operators are continuing to invest in the latest technologies and are purchasing additional spectrum. Adoption of advanced wireless technologies will continue to be a catalyst for network and device upgrades in the coming year. Verizon launched LTE in 38 cities and started offering data modems based on QUALCOMM'S multimode solution. AT&T continues to promote its HSPA+ service, has announced they will be pulling in their launch plans for LTE. And furthermore, we've also demonstrated LTE TDD in India. 
The evolution of 3G also continues to be a bright point for our business with the GSA announcing that there are currently 103 commercial HSPA+ networks, 13 of these offering 42 megabit per second data rates with Dual-Carrier HSPA+. According to CDG, three operators have launched DO Rev. B networks while an additional four operators have announced plans to deploy the technology.
And our leading position in these technologies and multimode chipsets allows us to address the complexities these heterogenous networks create, positioning us very well for the future.
As a further example of how our opportunities are expanding, Microsoft announced that the next version of Windows will support Systems on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems for QUALCOMM. We have a strong working relationship with Microsoft. And at CES, they demonstrated the next version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform.
We've also announced that we've entered into an agreement to buy Aeros. You heard us talk about a vision around the convergence of mobility, computing, consumer electronics. As we commented on our recent call, this announcement should be viewed as a statement about our commitment to provide a complete set of solutions to address this trend. This acquisition will allow us to build upon our capabilities, add to our suite of best-in-class technology assets, provide new sales channels. We're looking forward to the transaction closing and joining with a proven leader.
In addition, we announced the agreement to sell substantially all of our 700 megahertz Spectrum to AT&T and wind down the FLO TV network. This is a win-win outcome and we're excited that AT&T intends to use carrier aggregation technology to provide supplemental downlink capacity to its customers. Our plans include supporting these capabilities in our chipsets to support AT&T and other operators around the world, looking to take advantage of additional unpaired spectrum to support their wireless data plans. Overall, the 2G, the 3G migration remain healthy and vibrant as increased competition and wider variety of more affordable 3G devices are driving the shift to wireless data globally.
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G connections are expected to grow more than 25% in 2011 to 1.6 billion. A big part of this growth will come from emerging regions that have been primarily driven by 2G in the past.
Both China Telecom and China Unicom aggressively drove the uptake of 3G smartphones in the second half of calendar 2010 through the direct purchase and subsidy of these devices. As a result of these and other efforts, most operators are reporting significant growth in EV-DO and UMTS subscribed in the past two quarters. China Telecom reported approximately a 68% increase in EV-DO subscribers, while China Unicom reported an approximately 85% increase in WCDMA subscribers for the second half of 2010. And we see the same trend continuing through 2011 as bold operators continue to drive the uptake of mass-market smartphones. 
And in India, Reliance and Tata DOCOMO and now more recently, Airtel, have all launched 3G services and we expect remaining operators to launch services in the coming months.  
And finally, on the licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved one of the disputes that we had previously disclosed. 
So to wrap up, we just completed the best quarter in the history of QUALCOMM, driven by strong demand and excellent execution. Our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap platform condition us well to take advantage of the many wireless opportunities ahead of us. And looking forward, I am pleased to be substantially raising our full year forecast for revenue and earnings driven by the many positive trends of the industry's shift to 3G and the broad adoption of wireless data for mobile phones and new data-centric devices. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,113876103,95761,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As we expected when we presented in New York in November, we see favorable trends in the industry continuing to develop that will drive further growth in our Licensing business. In particular, we are seeing st",537,"Thank you Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As we expected when we presented in New York in November, we see favorable trends in the industry continuing to develop that will drive further growth in our Licensing business. In particular, we are seeing strength in ASPs in both developed and emerging regions. September quarter activity also ended up being a bit stronger than anticipated, driven by smartphone shipment strength in the developed regions in particular. This drove record total reported device sales and a strong sequential growth in average selling prices. I am also pleased to report that we have now resolved one of the two licensee disputes that we have been working to bring to a close. This is not Panasonic. It is the licensee that has been underpaying its royalties to us. 
We are pleased that we are able to resolve this dispute in a manner that is consistent with the established value of our patent portfolio and without the need for litigation or arbitration. The result of this resolution will start to be reflected in our fiscal second quarter results including a one-time catch-up for past periods.
As I discussed in New York in November, due to a variety of factors including the fact that certain QTL revenue components such as fixed licensing fees and infrastructure royalties are growing at a slower pace than subscriber royalties, the increasing diversity of incremental product types with non-traditional royalty structures contributing to our Licensing revenues, as well as the impact of intermittent licensee disputes, the implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide has become a less reliable metric for measuring the performance of the QTL business.
Having said that, the resolution of this licensee dispute increases our estimate for what we expect your calculation of the implied royalty rate to be for fiscal 2011. 
We had previously said that we expected your calculation as the implied royalty rate based on the midpoint of our prior guidance for fiscal year 2011 to be approximately 3.3%, excluding amounts for prior periods. While we have not yet finalized the accounting for the license agreement that we recently signed to resolve this dispute, we now expect the implied royalty rate you will calculate for fiscal year 2011 to be approximately 3.5%, including a one-time benefit in the second quarter for periods prior to fiscal 2011, as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011. And that we will exit the fiscal year with an implied royalty rate, as you calculated, of approximately 3.4% to 3.5%. 
It is important to note that this updated outlook excludes any potential upside that may result from the arbitration with Panasonic. As we mentioned during our last call, we are very pleased with the outcome of the first phase of that process as the arbitrator issued an interim order, finding that QUALCOMM did not breach its license agreement with Panasonic. This supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
In closing, I'm very pleased with the successful resolution we have announced today and continue to feel QTL is well-positioned for strong growth ahead in a very exciting global wireless industry. 
Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."
33493,113876103,95761,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered another strong quarter. We shipped a record 118 million MSMs and delivered both record revenues and record operating profits. We are seeing stronger demand for our integrated chips",837,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered another strong quarter. We shipped a record 118 million MSMs and delivered both record revenues and record operating profits. We are seeing stronger demand for our integrated chipsets compared to our prior forecast and are pleased to be raising our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
Smartphone-driven demand for our solutions, particularly in North America, was very strong again this quarter and contributed to a favorable product mix.  
Our leading roadmap, technology and integration capabilities are aligning well with industry trends. Shipments of our 7k and 8k integrated chipsets were up more than 40% sequentially and more than 150% year-over-year. Our leadership in LTE continues as we began volume shipments of our multimode 3G LTE chipsets last quarter. There is a strong design activity in the pipeline with over 25 manufacturers developing more than 50 LTE devices, including data modems, LTE hotspots, smartphones and tablets.
Our support for multiple operating systems across multiple product tiers continues to position us well within the growing smartphone segment. We saw over 30 new devices announced by our partners including several industry firsts. The sharp Galapagos, which is the first 3D mobile phone with 3D display and 3D capture; the first HSPA+ phones including the T-Mobile myTouch 4G; and the HTC Thunderbolt, which is the first 4G LTE phone for Verizon Wireless. Windows Phone 7 devices began shipping this past quarter, all powered by Snapdragon with handsets from HTC, LG, Dell and Samsung.
We are also pleased to see Microsoft demonstrate a future version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform at CES. We believe our architectural advantages deliver high-performance computing and graphics at low power and will enable new, innovative device types in the computing ecosystem just as they have in the mobile ecosystem. This will open up significant new opportunities for our chipsets.
We continue to demonstrate our ability to execute at scale this quarter, which is required to succeed in such a large and expanding industry. We currently have more than 150 Snapdragon devices in development, including more than 20 tablets. 
Our new dual-core MSM 8660 chipset is already being designed into over 60 devices by our partners. The performance and efficiency of this chipset make it well-suited to both tables and phones. It delivers console-quality graphics for rich, on-device gaming and high-definition video. The chipset also has integrated support for HDMI output, which means you can plug your phone or tablet into a TV to share photos, play games, or even watch high-definition 3D video.
Snapdragon's large install base, strong graphics capabilities and software development tools have attracted a sizable community of gaming developers. We currently have close to 100 casual and HD games optimized for our graphics processing unit, which we believe is 2x to 3x the number optimized for any other mobile chipset. And we see this number growing quickly.
Our next-generation chipset architecture is on path to raise the bar for the industry again. This architecture delivers 5x the performance and uses 75% of the power of our previous generation, which was already industry-leading. As we have mentioned  previously, the MSM 8960 will be the first chipset with this new architecture and an integrated LTE modem. It is sampling later this year.
We will also update the Snapdragon line to include this new architecture at all tiers. We will share more details of our plans at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
As we mentioned in November, during fiscal 2011, we expect to see an increase in a variety and tiering of smartphones. Specifically, a greater mix of mass-market smartphones. In addition, increased chipset shipments in emerging regions will be driven by the transition of 2G to 3G technology. Our integrated solutions are particularly well-suited for these mass-market devices, and we will continue to price in order to grow share in this environment.
As we have commented on in the past, we also prepare to transition our product line towards our first 28 nanometer parts and continue to increase the focus on cost-optimized solutions.
In the nearer term, we do expect some seasonality in our fiscal second quarter, consistent with prior years including the effects of annual pricing resets with our customers and MSM shipment levels a bit lower coming off a busy holiday quarter.
Finally, we are excited about the recently announced agreement to acquire Atheros. This acquisition significantly expands our opportunities as a semiconductor provider. With this incremental set of products, channels and customers, we can accelerate the extension of our technologies and platforms beyond cellular to computing, consumer electronics and networking. 
In closing, the QCT team is executing very well, driving our technology and integration-leadership position in the industry. We expect another wave of exciting devices based on our technology to be announced this quarter. We are in a unique position to lead the transition to smartphones and always on, always connected computing and entertainment devices. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876103,95761,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

We are pleased to be substantially raising our estimates for fiscal 2011 revenue and earnings per share. The impact related to the recent license dispute resolution announced today will be recorded in our second fiscal quarter and beyond. It is not reflected in our first fiscal quarter results.
Our fiscal first quarter revenues of $3.35 billion were a record high, up 25% year-over-year and at the high end of our prior guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were also a record $0.82 per share, up 32% year-over-year, significantly exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. We shipped a record 118 million MSM chips during the quarter towards the high end of our prior guidance and average revenue per MSM increased sequentially consistent with our prior guidance. QCT's operating margin was 30%, driven by a favorable mix of smartphone chipsets.
Total reported device sales by our licensees were a record $34 billion, exceeding our prior expectations and driven by a greater-than-expected mix of licensee device shipments in developed regions, notably North America, Japan and Korea. We estimate that our licensees shipped approximately 165 million to 169 million new CDMA devices in the September 2010 quarter, also a record. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA devices was approximately $201 to $207 per unit, up approximately 12% sequentially, driven by the greater mix of devices in developed regions, as well as approximately $8 of favorable foreign exchange.
QTL's operating margin was 84% and the implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide was slightly lower sequentially, consistent with expectations and driven primarily by fixed revenue items and infrastructure royalties within QTL's total revenues.
Cash and marketable securities totaled $19 billion at the end of the first quarter, including $6 billion onshore and $13 billion offshore. During the first fiscal quarter, we paid cash dividends of $309 million or $0.19 per share. And on January 14, we announced another cash dividend of $0.19 per share payable on March 25, 2011. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% in the first fiscal quarter. We recorded a $32 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010 as a result of the retroactive reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit. To facilitate a better period-to-period comparison, we excluded this tax benefit related to fiscal 2010 from our first quarter non-GAAP results.
Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.10 higher than our initial guidance midpoint of $0.72 at the outset of the quarter. QCT was approximately $0.04 higher, QTL was approximately $0.03 higher. The remaining $0.03 was a combination of the lower tax rate driven by the fiscal 2011 portion of the federal R&D tax credit and investment gains not included in our prior guidance.
We estimate that calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments were approximately 640 million to 660 million new devices. Based on the 650 million midpoint of our estimate, 2010 CDMA device shipments grew 28% year-over-year.
Now turning to our guidance. We are increasing our estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments. We estimate that between 750 million and 800 million CDMA devices will ship in 2011, an increase of approximately 15% to 23% over the midpoint of our calendar 2010 estimate because I'm sure you know that we are substantially raising our financial guidance for the fiscal year. 
Of the $1.2 billion increase to our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance, approximately $650 million is driven by an improved outlook for our Chipset business and approximately $550 million is driven by an improved outlook in our Licensing business. The approximate $550 million licensing improvement is due in part to the license dispute resolution and in part to a material increase in the base Licensing business independent of the license resolution. The $550 million is also a net increase on top of the amount we included in our fiscal 2011 guidance back in November for the potential resolution of one or both of our licensee disputes.
The new licensee amendment was just recently signed. Though the accounting treatment still needs to be finalized, we expect our fiscal second quarter will include revenues from this licensee, for sales in the second fiscal quarter, as well as for past sales in prior quarters. As Derek pointed out, we think that the implied royalty rate as you calculate it has become a less reliable metric for modeling the Licensing business. Having said that, we estimate that the implied rate for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2011, excluding the amounts related to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter, will be relatively constant in the range of approximately 3.4% to 3.5%.  
As Derek noted, although we remain confident in our position, the arbitration with Panasonic may not be decided until after our fiscal year end, and we therefore are not forecasting any amounts related to any resolution with Panasonic in this fiscal year at this time. 
We expect non-GAAP fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately$13.6 billion to $14.2 billion as compared to our prior estimate of $12.4 billion to $13 billion. We are also raising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance by $0.28 per share. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 to $3.05, an increase of 18% to 24% year-over-year. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA-based devices to be approximately $190 to $200 for all of fiscal 2011.
In QCT, although the opportunity to be in the higher end of this range is now a bit better, reflecting stronger volume and mix expectations, we are reaffirming our prior estimate that operating margins will be in the range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. 
The expected decrease in operating margins for the remainder of fiscal 2011 relative to the last couple of quarters reflects our continued expectation of a greater mix of mass-market smartphones and our new chipset products to service demand. 
We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to increase approximately 12% year-over-year, higher than our prior guidance of approximately 7%, reflecting variable cost related to our greater expected revenues, as well as some foreign exchange impact. 
Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, R&D expense will improve to approximately 17% of revenue, similar to the rate we experienced three and four years ago. And SG&A expense will improve to approximately 10% of revenue, the lowest rate in the last five years. We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 21%.
Now turning to the second fiscal quarter, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion. And non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.77 to $0.81. 
Based on the midpoints, we expect second quarter revenue and earnings per share to increase year-over-year by 35% and 34% respectively. We expect total reported device sales reported by our licensees to be approximately  $36.5 billion to $38.5 billion, up 35% year-over-year based on the midpoint. 
We anticipate QCT shipments of approximately 113 million to 117 million MSM chips during the March quarter, down a bit coming off the busy holiday quarter but up 24% year-over-year based on the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be down quarter-over-quarter driven by annual pricing resets with customers consistent with historical norms. And we expect lower operating margin sequentially.
Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations, remaining at the low end of the historical range through fiscal 2011. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase approximately 11% sequentially, reflecting normal increased seasonal expenses primarily related to employee payroll taxes. 
Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance midpoint is $0.03 lower as compared to our first quarter. We expect QTL to be better $0.17 sequentially, driven by revenue related to the new license dispute resolution and increased device volumes reported by licensees for the busy holiday quarter. 
We estimate that the one-time revenue benefit related to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter will be approximately $250 million or $0.09 per share in the second fiscal quarter. We expect QCT to be approximately $0.10 lower, driven by the seasonal lower volumes and pricing resets mentioned earlier.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense growth accounts for approximately $0.05 and the remaining decrease is driven by the dilutive impact of increased share count and lower sequential investment income as we do not include estimates for uncertain realized investment gains losses in our forecast. Net unrealized gains on marketable securities were $968 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

From that point, I would just say that at this early stage, we expect to be going out of the year just a bit modestly higher on the margins, but of course that will be a function of volume and mix as we go. On the $250 million, I think the key there is just to know that when you look at Q2 in terms of comparing it to what you want to model for Q3 and forward is that, that was an amount that really relates to prior periods. We haven't gotten into, as of this early stage, of how much of that might be Q1 versus prior periods. The deal was just recently signed, so we haven't gotten to that far yet.

First, I just wanted to confirm that my calculation basically points to a slight decrease sequentially to 3.1% to some 3.25% of the calculated rate. But stripping out the effect of tablets, it seems like the underlying rate did not change, so I just wanted to confirm that I have that roughly correctly. And then secondly, your comment that the royalty rate would exit at about 3.4% to 3.5% is about a 40 basis point acceleration of 3.1% that you just reported. But then the settlement only adds about 20 basis points to the full year royalty even including the catch-up. So to me that implies that the rate is actually accelerating from now through year end and that's despite the increasing tablet mix. So I just want to understand if that thought process is correct.

But then, we've given you the data so that you could pull out of that if you like the amount of that, that would be attributable to prior periods.

I won't comment on whether it's approximately $0.70 per quarter for the next three quarters equally. I think I did mention earlier we are expecting a little bit better in the fourth fiscal quarter at this point, but your math is correct. And a couple of key drivers there. In QUALCOMM'S first half of any fiscal year, we get the Christmas effect both in QCT and QTL. So over the years, the first half of the fiscal year does tend to be greater than the second half of the fiscal year, so that's number one. Number two, as we pointed out, you do have this $250 million that does relate to periods prior to the second fiscal quarter, and so we won't see that in Q3 or Q4 in the second fiscal half. And then thirdly, as we went through in New York and in effect what we're reiterating here is that QCT is aggressively going after what we see is a fairly substantial smartphone mass-market. And we've got new products as well to go at that market. And for fiscal 2011, we expect the margin on those products to be lower than what we have historically seen with new products. And the target is that in fiscal '12, we follow on with replacements product, namely the 28-nanometer, that brings those margins back to the level that we want to see. So I think those are the key drivers. But your math, Ehud, I mean it's basically correct, yes."

And I understand, I guess, the new products that you haven't been aggressive, but there still seems to be quite an unusually large drop and maybe conservative. And maybe if there's a shift to base band or some sort of a base band-only product, is that the big impact? If you can kind of walk us through that.

We did note that within that range, we are edging a little bit higher than where we were at the outset of this fiscal year. But that edging, so to speak, is not enough that we felt comfortable raising the 22% to 24% range. So obviously, to end up with an average of 22% to 24% after having just reported a quarter here of 30%, we expect a substantial decline. We do expect that, it is built into our guidance here for the second fiscal quarter. And it is just, it's the same drivers that we're seeing today as what we saw three months ago. We see a greater volume going forward relative to the recent couple of quarters of more developing market. And then we do see this opportunity to drive a mass market of smartphones and we're targeting that with new chipsets we have and those chipsets do have lower margin than traditionally we've seen in the past."

The other thing I do want to point out is in November we said we had an undisclosed amount, but we had an amount in our guidance that we thought was prudent, prudent based on our expectations at that time of resolving one or both of the licensee disputes.

We are very pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues as the demand for smartphones across an array of geographies and tiers continues to grow. Our product leadership and expanding set of industry partnerships position us to benefit from the strong secular trends in wireless. And as a consequence, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. It's been another very successful quarter for Qualcomm, and there's a lot to be excited about. At the mobile world congress, we announce a variety of industry-leading multimode modem and a new advanced microarchitecture for our Snapdragon family of processors, which we believe will continue to extend our power in performance leadership position in mobile computing. Our new architecture supports single, dual and quad core processor integrated solutions, as well as discrete application processor chipset, which will further expand addressable opportunity for our products. And as the first chipset provider for Windows Phone 7, we are pleased to see the announcement that Nokia would be adopting the Windows phone operating system and look forward to supporting that new collaboration.
Snapdragon family has been designed to help our customers efficiently support a range of device to tiers and the speed time market with features like software and hardware compatibility across chipsets. We're also pleased to be working closely with Microsoft on their announced plans to support the next version of Windows to arm, further evidencing the accelerating convergence of mobility and computing. 
On the licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved our dispute with Panasonic. We've now resolved the two disputes which had been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operational performance of QTL, and Derek will talk more about this later.
In terms of CDMA-based device demand trends, the key drivers remain healthy and intact for continued growth of our business. Demand for smartphones remains strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, in the fourth quarter of 2010, sales of smartphones exceeded all PC shipments for the first time in history. And looking ahead, they're forecasting that sales of smartphones will exceed 1 billion units in 2015. Driven by an increased demand for smartphones around the world, wireless data traffic continued to accelerate. According to strategy analytics, mobile data traffic more than doubled in 2010 and expected to grow by 10 to 12x through 2015. To address the growth in wireless data, operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, in the past year, commercial HSPA+ deployment rose 136%. The number of LTE commitments grew to almost 200, including the launch of 18 commercial LTE networks. According to the CDG, there are now 13 operators committed to launching EV-DO Rev. B networks. And the migration from 2G to 3G continues around the world with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of March, there are approximately 1.33 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong transfer smartphone adoptions. According to CTIA research, as of the fourth quarter of 2010, the number of smartphones reported on North American carriers network was approximately $78 million, representing a 57% increase from the year prior. Verizon Wireless recently launched the LTE capable HTC Thunderbolt demonstrating our leadership in LTE smartphones and multimode technology. And additionally in North America, we're beginning to see the influence of affordable smartphones in the prepaid segment and smartphone penetration rates ramped up leap in Metro PCS. According to GFK, in key Western European countries, smartphones with high-level operating systems accounted for 74% of 3G phones sold in December 2010, up from 44% a year ago. And in Korea, since the beginning of this year, each operator has announced plans to introduce 20 or more new smartphone models.
With respect to Japan, we're of course saddened by the recent tragic events. But despite this disruption, we have received reports that wireless technology, combined with social networking services and an early earthquake warning system, played a critical role for communication and safety of the people in the affected regions. Preliminary indications are that demand has held up fairly well, similar to what we've seen in other past events of this nature. So although there's some uncertainty, we do not foresee any significant impact on the overall demand profile for wireless devices.
Turning to China. China Telecom recently reached 100 million CDMA subscribers, and we expect that 50% of their new subscribers will use EV-DO this year, up from approximately 25% in 2010. Additionally, according to Sino MR, of that 3G phones, excluding one exponents sold in February in China, 46% we're smartphones, representing more than 300% increase from a year ago. In India, all operators with new 3G spectrum licenses have now launched with HSPA+ networks and together cover more than 100 mobile cities. Mobile broadband continue to gain momentum with expansion of EV-DO Revision A networks reaching more than 500 cities. And demand for smartphones in India continues to grow with 10 new Snapdragon-based smartphone launches in January and February alone.
And a couple of other items of note. We're pleased to announce the creation of the Qualcomm Foundation, a charitable organization which will focus on education, health services, sustainability and the arts. Qualcomm has a long history of philanthropy and service and the foundation is another way that we can give back to our communities around the world. And finally, we will be hosting our second annual uplink conference on June 1 and 2. And as many of you know, uplink's unique in the brings together developers, device manufacturers, mobile operators and technology providers to help identify opportunities across multiple operating systems. It should be another great event, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

We continue to see favorable industry trends that are driving growth in the Licensing business. These trends include solid unit shipments during the December quarter, positive handset ASP trends within both developed and emerging regions and growth in sales of incremental connected devices. These trends help drive record unit shipments and total reported device sales during the December quarter. Going forward, we expect to continue to see strength in handset ASPs in developed and emerging regions, driven by growth in smartphones, including greater penetration into mid and lower tiers. A richer mix of devices and emerging regions such as China and India and continued growth in tablet volumes. 
Accordingly, as Bill will discuss, we are raising our fiscal 2011 ASP estimate range from $190 to $200 to $199 to $209. We also expect the volume and breadth of the connected devices to continue to grow. In addition to tablets and e-readers, we are encouraged to see the emergence of new connected device categories such as the recently announced 3G-enabled Sony and GP gaming device. 
As Paul mentioned, we are pleased to report that we have now resolved our dispute with Panasonic. As you may recall, the arbitration have been proceeding in phases. In the first phase, which was the only phase that have been completed as of the time of the settlement, the arbitrator had rejected Panasonic's claims that Qualcomm breached the license agreement. We are pleased with the terms of the resolution, which reflect the established value of our patent portfolio.
Over the last few months, we have now successfully resolved both disputes that have been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operating performance of QTL. Accordingly, our second fiscal quarter results include the recognition of revenue attributable to these resolutions, including approximately $400 million in revenue related to prior periods. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the industry trends that are helping to drive our Licensing business, as well as the successful resolutions we have recently achieved. QTL continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead in a very dynamic global wireless industry.

The QCT business executed well and very much in line with our expectations this quarter. We shipped approximately 118 million MSMs, just above the high end of our prior guidance, driven by strong demand for products across the chipset portfolio. As we forecasted previously, our results this quarter show a trend very similar to last year with annual customer pricing resets and seasonal operating expense increases typical for this time of year. Consistent with this trend, both our average revenue per MSM and our operating margins were down sequentially. But in absolute terms, our revenue and earnings before tax were well above the same period last year with revenue up 28% and earnings up 21%.
The trends and requirements for OEMs to succeed in wireless are aligning well with the strengths of our business, particularly in the areas where we continue to make significant investments. First, our platform approach is a strategic advantage for us, and our broad chipset roadmap has helped us grow across multiple device tiers. Second, the importance of integrated chipset solutions for our OEM partners is clearly accelerating due to the superior performance, lower power consumption and time-to-market advantages it delivers. Our 7,000 and 8,000 series shipments are up 70% in the first half of this fiscal year as compared to the last half of fiscal 2010, growing faster than the Wireless Device segment and demonstrating that integration is the leading choice for mass-market and high-end smartphones.
The range of Snapdragon devices continues to grow as well. Our customers announced the 100 Snapdragon power device this quarter, and the pipeline of devices and design has increased to approximately 200. We continued to expand our portfolio in the growing Tablet category as well. There are now eight different Snapdragon power tablets announced from a ability and computing leaders like HTC, HP, Acer and Asus with approximately three additional designs in process. Our LTE solutions lead the industry and continued to build momentum. Our LTE chipsets powered the HTC Thunderbolt, various USB dongles and newly launched LTE hotspots from Samsung and Novotel, which also incorporate our wireless LAN products. We're also seeing many devices and design that are pairing our application processors and LTE technologies together, demonstrating that OEMs value a complete solution for processing and connectivity.
At mobile world congress, we announced eight new chipsets as we continue to quickly drive technology across our modems, application processors, graphics and connectivity solutions. We expanded our overall leadership in 3G and LTE multimode modems announcing several new chipsets that redefine performance at the high end and take the latest 3G and LTE technology to mass-market price points. We also announced our next-generation mobile application processor architecture for the Snapdragon family, which will again redefine performance for the industry by delivering 150% higher overall performance as well as 65% lower power and currently available RM-based CPU cores. This chipset architecture is based on 28-nanometer technology, which enables us to cost-effectively integrate LTE, 3G, wireless LAN, Bluetooth, FM and GPS in single, dual or quad core designs for smartphones and next-generation computing devices.
The first chipset in this next-generation Snapdragon architecture is our industry-leading multimode 3G, LTE, MSM, 8960 chipset, which is on track to sample this quarter. Our leadership in graphics and the strength of our gaming ecosystem continues to grow this quarter. We announced an agreement with SRS Labs, which allows us to bring HD and 3D audio to movies and games, as well as a strategic relationship with Game Loft to deliver an enhanced mobile gaming experience on Snapdragon devices for the top game titles. We now have over 100 HD and casual games optimized for our GPU and expect this number to continue to grow.
The year is progressing much as expected. As we commented on in the past two quarters, we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones, specifically a greater mix of mass-market smartphones. Our integrated solutions are well suited for these devices, and we continue to price in order to grow share in this environment. 
With respect to our semiconductor supply chain, we do not foresee any significant impact in our ability to supply product to our customers as a result of the recent events in Japan. Our scale and broad set of OEM customers provides us a unique perspective on industry trends and enables us to better address short-term fluctuations in demand. 
Finally, with respect to the Atheros acquisition, we met key milestones this quarter, including approval of the transaction by Atheros to shareholders, as well as the successful completion of Hart-Scott-Rodino review. We continue to expect the transaction to close this quarter subject to receiving one remaining foreign regulatory approval.
In summary, GTX executed well, this quarter. Our solutions approach and focus on integration across the broad roadmap of chipset products has enabled us to grow across multiple product categories and price points, as well as expand our pipeline of design wins. These wins are across an increasing variety of device segments, OEM customers and regions, positioning us to continue to grow share in this dynamic environment. 
That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876100,116090,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record revenues of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 for our fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal y",949,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record revenues of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 for our fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Our better-than-expected results were driven by a number of positive items. Most importantly, our core licensing and chip businesses contributed strong results. 3G device sales grew significantly with total reported device sales up 18% sequentially and with an average selling price per device of approximately $200 to $206. QCT's 118 million MSM chipset shipments were above the high end of our prior guidance.
During the second quarter, we resolved outstanding disputes with Panasonic and another licensee, which we discussed during last quarter's earnings call. Since our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 was significantly higher than the $0.79 midpoint of our previous guidance, I thought it would be helpful to provide an earnings walk of the $0.79 increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. First, stronger non-GAAP earnings per share were not entirely driven by the dispute resolutions, although they did contribute approximately $0.06 and were driven primarily by the Panasonic license dispute resolution. Recall that our prior guidance took into account resolution of the other license dispute.
Second, we achieved a further $0.06 of earnings improvement from our core operations, driven primarily by the strong demand for 3G devices and increased demand for our chipsets, as well as a bit stronger investment income. 
Third, we restructured our fire thorn business during the second quarter and significantly reduced the run rate of its operating expenses. As a result of the restructuring and the reappraisal of the fire foreign business, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $120 million. 
Fourth, we established a new Qualcomm charitable foundation, to which we made an initial $15 million contribution. The combination of the fire thorn impairment and charitable giving decreased earnings per share by approximately $0.05.
Investors can find this earnings walk on our Investor Relations website. You can also find on the website an earnings walk from the year ago quarter, that earnings walk distinguishes the approximately $400 million in QTL revenues related to the prior periods that were recognized this quarter due to the resolution of licensee disputes.
Now turning to our updated financial guidance. We estimate that approximately $646 million to $663 million CDMA-based devices shipped during calendar 2010, an increase of approximately 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales. And as you would expect, we are monitoring the events in Japan very closely. As you heard from Paul, we did not at this time see an impact on end consumer demand for CDMA-based wireless devices. It is worth noting that if not for the uncertainty of component supply from Japan for 3G device manufacturers, we would have an even greater upward bias in our calendar 2011 CDMA-based device estimates, giving improving trends on consumers upgrading their 3G devices.
As such, we are reaffirming our estimate of between $750 million and $800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011. Using the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate that in 2011, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% year-over-year. We now estimate the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $199 to $209. The $204 midpoint is above our prior year $195 midpoint estimate driven by the trends that Derek mentioned earlier and a couple of dollars of favorable foreign exchange impact.
We now expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.1 billion to $14.7 billion, up approximately 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $500 million increase in our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance range midpoint, approximately $200 million reflects additional QTL revenues attributable to our recently settled licensee disputes. Improved outlooks for QCT and QTL drove the remaining $300 million increase. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.13, up 26% year-over-year at the midpoint.
In QCT, our operating margin estimate is consistent with our previous guidance with a range of 22% to 24% expected fiscal 2011. We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 15% to 16% year-over-year. Specific to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.35 billion to $3.65 billion, up approximately 30% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.68 to $0.72, up approximately 23% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device else of approximately $35.5 billion to $38.5 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially, reflecting postholiday seasonality typical for this time of year. We anticipate shipments of approximately 115 million to 119 million MSM units during the June quarter, with revenue per MSM up a bit sequentially. And we expect a greater mix of chipsets targeted for mass-market smartphones consistent with our prior expectations. We believe our visibility on fiscal third quarter chipsets both supply and demand is relatively quite good.
We estimate the CDMA inventory channel exit the fiscal year at the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range consistent with our prior estimates. Our forecast anticipate a small believe of channel inventory in the short term, which we expect to be replenished prior to the end of our fiscal year.
We anticipate third fiscal quarter of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will decrease sequentially approximately 7%. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

I would say this we're very pleased with the trajectory of how things have gone particularly in the application processer business. If you look at where we were let's say in the 2007 timeframe, when we really started to start to ship our first 7,000-based devices to where we are now. We've grown quite strong in terms of using that technology. As you are aware, we have been investing both in additional application processor hardware designs but also into different software platforms, and that's really to enable us to continue to add new customers actually. So as things progress throughout the years, we are positive in terms of how things look for share in those areas. And I think that's really consistent with our view that the integrated approach is the one that we'll win long-term, particularly as a lot of the growth starts to happen in the more mass-market or the feature phone replacement tiers."

We are seeing, I think, some strong traction not just in the data-centric devices now but forward-looking in our product portfolio that combines both our application processor and our modem solutions. Just like with WCDMA, during the initial days, there were a number of folks who worked on initial designs. But it was I think difficult to say with the investment required in order to maintain really the feature roadmap that's required I think to deliver high-end modem. So we think that it'll probably play out in a similar way with this transition as well."

You've seen some of those already not gain traction, and people come to us to get support. You see some of the companies have started out, for example, in WiMAX trying to make their way into LTE and some acquisitions and consolidation happen because of that. And obviously, it's not just LTE that's causing it. It's just the pace of operator rollout of new technology, whether it's HSPA+ or LTE or as we drive forward on the new technologies supplemental downlink we've talked about, LTE advanced. We're going to try and keep the pressure on keeping investments going in those areas to make sure that we have a leadership position and just continue to force the competition to keep up and I do think it will crave the more difficult dynamic for them and which will certainly can lead to consolidation or those people from dropping out of the business."

We probably saw a little bit also at the end of this quarter where some customers were looking to get parts because of the events in Japan. That probably had a very small impact in terms of the audit of the numbers. I don't think it really had a great impact in terms of the financials, though."

As I'm sure you are aware, we actually feel that we're in the front in terms of the 28-nanometer transition. I should make sure everyone's aware, though, that we have the option to select even today and in the past more higher performing transistor if we need to. But we actually don't because we think that our combination of our mobile platforms or our mobile-centric solutions require a particular type of transistor that is a little bit different match between performance and power. And so we actually have the ability even within the notes that like the more powerful transistor and we don't because we think we have the right trade-off. So we feel very comfortable on that now. Of course, we are pushing very hard to continue to keep the fab list semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers moving along the node transition. And I would say over the last two years, the environment, with the addition of Samsung and Global Foundries to the fab list world really created I think much more investment in that area.

The second part that I think we're probably better positioned than other folks is we have a bit of a broader technology portfolio, and that means really two things to the OEM. The first thing is it means that they can deliver products across multiple tiers or different price points with the same or at least a very leveraged investment. The other thing that we have I think that's a bit unique is the ability to support CDMA, LTE and WCDMA ecosystems, either separately or in the same device. And so that those advantages really open up multiple markets with one investment, and it's really -- it's a statement of scale. So we think that in this account is a very key thing. And by the way, that's something that we use in many different accounts in order to grow our place there. So we think we're pretty well positioned there. But as I always tell the team internally, you have to earn it every day so we have to go through the launches and make sure that we keep our sales and our customers want to leave."

We're very pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues as the demand for smartphones across an array of geographies and tiers continues to grow. Our product leadership and expanding set of industry partnerships position us to benefit from the strong secular trends in wireless. And as a consequence, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. It's been another very successful quarter for Qualcomm, there's a lot to be excited about.
At the mobile world congress, we announced a variety of new industry-leading multi-mode modems and a new advanced microarchitecture for our Snapdragon family of processors, which we believe will continue to extend our power in performance leadership position in mobile computing. Our new architecture supports single-, dual- and quad-core processor-integrated solutions, as well as discrete application processor chipset, which will further expand addressable opportunity for our products. And as the first chipset provider for Windows Phone 7, we are pleased to see the announcement that Nokia would be adopting the Windows phone operating system and look forward to supporting that new collaboration.
Snapdragon family has been designed to help our customers efficiently support a range of device tiers and to speed time-to-market with features like software and hardware compatibility across chipsets. We're also pleased to be working closely with Microsoft on their announced plans to port the next version of Windows to ARM, further evidencing the accelerating convergence of mobility and computing.
On the Licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved our dispute with Panasonic. We've now resolved the two disputes which had been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operational performance of QTL, and Derek will talk more about this later.
In terms of CDMA-based device-demand trends, the key drivers remain healthy and intact for the continued growth of our business. Demand for smartphones remains strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, in the fourth quarter of 2010, sales of smartphones exceeded all PC shipments for the first time in history. And looking ahead, they're forecasting that sales of smartphones will exceed 1 billion units in 2015. Driven by an increased demand for smartphones around the world, wireless data traffic continued to accelerate.
According to Strategy Analytics, mobile data traffic more than doubled in 2010. They're expected to grow by 10x to 12x through 2015. To address the growth in wireless data, operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, in the past year, commercial HSPA+ deployments rose 136%, and the number of LTE commitments grew to almost 200%, including the launch of 18 commercial LTE networks. According to CDG, there are now 13 operators committed to launching EV-DO Rev. B networks. And the migration from 2G to 3G continues around the world with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of March, there are approximately 1.33 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong transfer smartphone adoption. According to CTIA research, as of the fourth quarter of 2010, the number of smartphones reported on North American carriers' network was approximately $78 million, representing a 57% increase from the year prior. Verizon Wireless recently launched the LTE-capable HTC Thunderbolt demonstrating our leadership in LTE smartphones and multi-mode technology. And additionally in North America, we're beginning to see the influence of affordable smartphones in the prepaid segment as smartphone penetration rates ramped at Leap and MetroPCS. According to GfK, in key Western European countries, smartphones with high-level operating systems accounted for 74% of 3G phones sold in December 2010, up from 44% a year ago. And in Korea, since the beginning of this year, each operator has announced plans to introduce 20 or more new smartphone models.
With respect to Japan, we're of course saddened by the recent tragic events. But despite this disruption, we have received reports that wireless technology, combined with social networking services and an early earthquake warning system, played a critical role for communication and safety of the people in the affected regions. Preliminary indications are that demand has held up fairly well, similar to what we have seen in other past events of this nature. So although there are some uncertainty, we do not foresee any significant impact on the overall demand profile for wireless devices.
Turning to China. China Telecom recently reached 100 million CDMA subscribers, and expect 50% of their new subscribers will use EV-DO this year, up from approximately 25% in 2010. Additionally, according to Sino MR, of the 3G phones, excluding 1X phones sold in February in China, 46% we're smartphones, representing more than 300% increase from a year ago.
In India, all operators with new 3G spectrum licenses have now launched with HSPA+ networks and together cover more than 100 cities. Mobile broadband continue to gain momentum with expansion of EV-DO Revision A networks reaching more than 500 cities. And demand for smartphones in India continues to grow with 10 new Snapdragon-based smartphone launches in January and February alone.
And a couple of other items of note. We're pleased to announce the creation of the Qualcomm Foundation, the charitable organization which will focus on education, health services, sustainability and the arts. Qualcomm has a long history of philanthropy and service and the foundation is another way that we can give back to our communities around the world. And finally, we will be hosting our second annual Uplinq conference on June 1 and 2. And as many of you know, Uplinq's unique in that it brings together developers, device manufacturers, mobile operators and technology providers to help identify opportunities across multiple operating systems. It should be another great event and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

We continue to see favorable industry trends that are driving growth in the Licensing business. These trends include solid unit shipments during the December quarter, positive handset ASP trends within both developed and emerging regions and growth in sales of incremental connected devices. These trends help drive record unit shipments and total reported device sales during the December quarter. Going forward, we expect to continue to see strength in handset ASPs in developed and emerging regions, driven by growth in smartphones, including greater penetration into mid and lower tiers; a richer mix of devices in emerging regions such as China and India; and continued growth in tablet volumes.
Accordingly, as Bill will discuss, we are raising our fiscal 2011 ASP estimate range from $190 to $200 to $199 to $209. We also expect the volume and breadth of new connected devices to continue to grow. In addition to tablets and e-readers, we are encouraged to see the emergence of new connected device categories such as the recently-announced 3G-enabled Sony NGP gaming device.
As Paul mentioned, we are pleased to report that we have now resolved our dispute with Panasonic. As you may recall, the arbitration have been proceeding in phases. In the first phase, which was the only phase that have been completed as of the time of the settlement, the arbitrator had rejected Panasonic's claims that Qualcomm breached the license agreement. We are pleased with the terms of the resolution, which reflect the established value of our patent portfolio.
Over the last few months, we have now successfully resolved both disputes that had been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operating performance of QTL. Accordingly, our second fiscal quarter results include the recognition of revenue attributable to these resolutions, including approximately $400 million in revenue related to prior periods.
In closing, we are very pleased with the industry trends that are helping to drive our Licensing business, as well as the successful resolutions we have recently achieved. QTL continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead in a very dynamic global wireless industry.

The QCT business executed well and very much in line with our expectations this quarter. We shipped approximately 118 million MSMs, just above the high end of our prior guidance, driven by strong demand for products across the chipset portfolio. As we forecasted previously, our results this quarter show a trend very similar to last year, with annual customer pricing resets and seasonal operating expense increases typical for this time of year. Consistent with this trend, both our average revenue per MSM and our operating margins were down sequentially. But in absolute terms, our revenue and earnings before tax were well above the same period last year, with revenue up 28% and earnings up 21%.
The trends and requirements for OEMs to succeed in wireless are aligning well with the strengths of our business, particularly in the areas where we continue to make significant investments. First, our platform approach is a strategic advantage for us and our broad chipset roadmap has helped us grow across multiple device tiers. Second, the importance of integrated chipset solutions for our OEM partners is clearly accelerating due to the superior performance, lower power consumption and time-to-market advantages it delivers. Our 7000- and 8000-series chip shipments are up 70% in the first half of this fiscal year as compared to the last half of fiscal 2010, growing faster than the Wireless Device segment and demonstrating an integration is the leading choice for mass-market and high-end smartphones.
The range of Snapdragon devices continues to grow as well. Our customers announced the 100th Snapdragon power device this quarter, and the pipeline of devices and design has increased to approximately 200. We continued to expand our portfolio in the growing Tablet category as well. There are now eight different Snapdragon power tablets announced from mobility and computing leaders like HTC, HP, Acer and ASUS with approximately 30 additional designs in process. Our LTE solutions lead the industry and continue to build momentum. Our LTE chipsets power the HTC Thunderbolt, various USB dongles and newly launched LTE hotspots from Samsung and NovAtel, which also incorporate our wireless LAN products. We're also seeing many devices and design that are pairing our application processors and LTE technologies together, demonstrating that OEMs value a complete solution for processing and connectivity.
At Mobile World Congress, we announced eight new chipsets as we continue to quickly drive technology across our modems, application processors, graphics and connectivity solutions. We expanded our overall leadership in 3G and LTE multi-mode modems announcing several new chipsets that redefine performance at the high end and take the latest 3G and LTE technology to mass-market price points. We also announced our next-generation mobile application processor architecture for the Snapdragon family, which will again redefine performance for the industry by delivering 150% higher overall performance as well as 65% lower power than currently available ARM-based CPU cores. This chipset architecture is based on 28-nanometer technology, which enables us to cost-effectively integrate LTE, 3G, wireless LAN, Bluetooth, FM and GPS in single-, dual- or quad-core designs for smartphones and next-generation computing devices.
The first chipset in this next-generation Snapdragon architecture is our industry-leading multi-mode 3G, LTE, MSM8960 chipset, which is on track to sample this quarter. Our leadership in graphics and the strength of our gaming ecosystem continues to grow this quarter. We announced an agreement with SRS Labs, which allows us to bring HD and 3D audio to movies and games, as well as a strategic relationship with Gameloft to deliver an enhanced mobile gaming experience on Snapdragon devices for the top game titles. We now have over 100 HD and casual games optimized for our GPU and expect this number to continue to grow.
The year is progressing much as expected. As we commented on in the past two quarters, we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones, specifically a greater mix of mass-market smartphones. Our integrated solutions are well suited for these devices, and we continue to price in order to grow share in this environment. 
With respect to our semiconductor supply chain, we do not foresee any significant impact in our ability to supply product to our customers as a result of the recent events in Japan. Our scale and broad set of OEM customers provides us a unique perspective on industry trends and enables us to better address short-term fluctuations in demand. 
Finally, with respect to the Atheros acquisition, we met key milestones this quarter, including approval of the transaction by Atheros to shareholders, as well as the successful completion of Hart-Scott-Rodino review. We continue to expect the transaction to close this quarter subject to receiving one remaining foreign regulatory approval.
In summary, QCT executed well this quarter. Our solutions approach and focus on integration across the broad roadmap of chipset products has enabled us to grow across multiple product categories and price points, as well as expand our pipeline of design wins. These wins are across an increasing variety of device segments, OEM customers and regions, positioning us to continue to grow share in this dynamic environment.
That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876100,116196,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record revenues of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 for our fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal y",947,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record revenues of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 for our fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Our better-than-expected results were driven by a number of positive items. Most importantly, our core licensing and chip businesses contributed strong results. 3G device sales grew significantly with total reported device sales up 18% sequentially and with an average selling price per device of approximately $200 to $206. QCT's 118 million MSM chipset shipments were above the high end of our prior guidance.
During the second quarter, we resolved outstanding disputes with Panasonic and another licensee, which we discussed during last quarter's earnings call. Since our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 was significantly higher than the $0.79 midpoint of our previous guidance, I thought it would be helpful to provide an earnings walk of the $0.07 increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. First, stronger non-GAAP earnings per share were not entirely driven by the dispute resolutions, although they did contribute approximately $0.06 and were driven primarily by the Panasonic license dispute resolution. Recall that our prior guidance took into account resolution of the other license dispute.
Second, we achieved a further $0.06 of earnings improvement from our core operations, driven primarily by the strong demand for 3G devices and increased demand for our chipsets, as well as a bit stronger investment income.
Third, we restructured our Firethorn business during the second quarter and significantly reduced the run rate of its operating expenses. As a result of the restructuring and the reappraisal of the Firethorn business, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $120 million.
Fourth, we established a new Qualcomm charitable foundation, to which we made an initial $50 million contribution. The combination of the Firethorn impairment and charitable-giving decreased earnings per share by approximately $0.05.
Investors can find this earnings walk on our Investor Relations website. You can also find on the website an earnings walk from the year-ago quarter, and that earnings walk distinguishes the approximately $400 million in QTL revenues related to the prior periods that were recognized this quarter due to the resolution of licensee disputes.
Now turning to our updated financial guidance. We estimate that approximately 646 million to 663 million CDMA-based devices shipped during calendar 2010, an increase of approximately 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales. And as you would expect, we are monitoring the events in Japan very closely. As you heard from Paul, we do not, at this time, see an impact on end consumer demand for CDMA-based wireless devices. It is worth noting that if not for the uncertainty of component supply from Japan for 3G device manufacturers, we would have an even greater upward bias in our calendar 2011 CDMA-based device estimates, given improving trends on consumers upgrading their 3G devices.
As such, we are reaffirming our estimate of between 750 million and 800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011. Using the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate that in 2011, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% year-over-year. We now estimate the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $199 to $209. The $204 midpoint is above our prior year $195 midpoint estimate, driven by the trends that Derek mentioned earlier and a couple of dollars of favorable foreign exchange impact.
We now expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.1 billion to $14.7 billion, up approximately 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $500 million increase in our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance range midpoint, approximately $200 million reflects additional QTL revenues attributable to our recently settled licensee disputes. Improved outlooks for QCT and QTL drove the remaining $300 million increase. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.13, up 26% year-over-year at the midpoint.
In QCT, our operating margin estimate is consistent with our previous guidance for the range of 22% to 24% expected fiscal 2011. We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 15% to 16% year-over-year. Specific to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.35 billion to $3.65 billion, up approximately 30% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.68 to $0.72, up approximately 23% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $35.5 billion to $38.5 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially, reflecting postholiday seasonality typical for this time of year. We anticipate shipments of approximately 115 million to 119 million MSM units during the June quarter, with revenue per MSM up a bit sequentially. And then we expect a greater mix of chipsets targeted for mass-market smartphones consistent with our prior expectations. We believe our visibility on fiscal third quarter chipsets, both supply and demand, is relatively quite good.
We estimate the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range consistent with our prior estimates. Our forecast anticipates a small breed of channel inventory in the short term, which we expect to be replenished prior to the end of our fiscal year. We anticipate third fiscal quarter of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will decrease sequentially approximately 7%.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

If you look at where we were, let's say, in the 2007 timeframe, when we really started to start to ship our first 7000-based devices to where we are now, we've grown quite strong in terms of using that technology. As you are aware, we have been investing both in additional application processor hardware designs but also into different software platforms, and that's really to enable us to continue to add new customers actually. So as things progress throughout the years, we are positive in terms of how things look for share in those areas.

We are seeing, I think, some strong traction not just in the data-centric devices now but forward-looking in our product portfolio that combines both our application processor and our modem solution. Just like with WCDMA, during the initial days, there were a number of folks who worked on initial designs.

And it's really -- it's going to be a function of what they see their opportunities to either capture or transition their fixed income investments. So it's pretty much in their hands. Other than that, I think as you know, on a forward-guidance basis, we only include a forecast of realized gains to the extent we're highly confident that they're going to happen.

So The unit volumes that you're forecasting are pretty flat for Q3. And yet, you guys have taken this big hit on margins. I think the strategy was to try to reduce margins in order to pump up the unit volume and get access to this rapidly growing market, particularly the lower-priced smartphones. But it doesn't -- if we just take the data you presented us with, it doesn't feel like that strategy is working. So I guess one or two think are going to happen, either Q4 we're going to see a very rapid ramp of unit volumes on QCT, which will make up for the difference or this pricing strategy is not working, maybe pricing is more aggressive out there from competitors than you guys had expected or something else is going on? So I just wonder if you guys could just talk through what is going on with chip pricing out there? Are people more aggressive than you expected?

You've got broken up a little bit, but I think the question was about our technology or node transition. And so we feel actually very confident in what we're getting from our fabless suppliers in terms of technology at the transistor level. As I'm sure you are aware, we actually feel that we're in the front in terms of the 28-nanometer transition. I should make sure everyone's aware, though, that we have the option to select, even today and in the past, more higher performing transistor if we need to. But we actually don't because we think that our combination of our mobile platforms or our mobile-centric solutions require a particular type of transistor that is a little bit different match between performance and power. And so we actually have the ability, even within the nodes that we're in today, is like the more powerful transistor and we don't, because we think we have the right trade-off. So we feel very comfortable on that. Now, of course, we are pushing very hard to continue to keep the fabless semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers moving along the node transition. And I would say over the last two years, the environment, with the addition of Samsung and Global Foundries to the fabless world, really created I think much more investment in that area. And we feel probably more comfortable about where we sit today than where we sat two years ago because of that edition. So we're getting good service, we think, from our fabless foundry partners and we continue to move forward with the system approach."

Then on top of that, you have transition to LTE depending on what their product strategy. Then you have the events in Japan. So it's not inconsistent with that to see some units move around from quarter-to-quarter. And so we don't -- I think it will be difficult for me to break them out. I think the one trend, though, that does tie them together to some degree is that we are seeing that broad demand across the portfolio and across different OEMs. It's just a barrier there.

The second part that I think we're probably better positioned than other folks is we have a bit of a broader technology portfolio, and that means really two things to the OEM. The first thing is it means that they can deliver products across multiple tiers or different price points with the same or at least a very leveraged investment. The other thing that we have I think that's a bit unique is the ability to support CDMA, LTE and WCDMA ecosystems, either separately or in the same device. And so that those advantages really open up multiple markets with one investment, and it's really -- it's a statement on scale. So we think that, in this account, is a very key thing.

We're very pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues as the demand for smartphones across an array of geographies and tiers continues to grow. Our product leadership and expanding set of industry partnerships position us to benefit from the strong secular trends in wireless. And as a consequence, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. It's been another very successful quarter for Qualcomm, there's a lot to be excited about.
At the Mobile World Congress, we announced a variety of new industry-leading multi-mode modems and a new advanced micro-architecture for our Snapdragon family of processors, which we believe will continue to extend our power in performance leadership position in mobile computing. Our new architecture supports single-, dual- and quad-core processor-integrated solutions, as well as discrete application processor chipset, which will further expand addressable opportunity for our products. And as the first chipset provider for Windows Phone 7, we are pleased to see the announcement that Nokia would be adopting the Windows phone operating system and look forward to supporting that new collaboration.
Snapdragon family has been designed to help our customers efficiently support a range of device tiers and to speed time-to-market with features like software and hardware compatibility across chipsets. We're also pleased to be working closely with Microsoft on their announced plans to port the next version of Windows to ARM, further evidencing the accelerating convergence of mobility and computing.
On the Licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved our dispute with Panasonic. We've now resolved the two disputes which had been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operational performance of QTL, and Derek will talk more about this later.
In terms of CDMA-based device-demand trends, the key drivers remain healthy and intact for the continued growth of our business. Demand for smartphones remains strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, in the fourth quarter of 2010, sales of smartphones exceeded all PC shipments for the first time in history. And looking ahead, they're forecasting that sales of smartphones will exceed 1 billion units in 2015. Driven by an increased demand for smartphones around the world, wireless data traffic continues to accelerate.
According to Strategy Analytics, mobile data traffic more than doubled in 2010. They're expected to grow by 10x to 12x through 2015. To address the growth in wireless data, operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, in the past year, commercial HSPA+ deployments rose 136%, and the number of LTE commitments grew to almost 200%, including the launch of 18 commercial LTE networks. According to CDG, there are now 13 operators committed to launching EV-DO Rev. B networks. And the migration from 2G to 3G continues around the world with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of March, there are approximately 1.3 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong transfer smartphone adoption. According to CTIA research, as of the fourth quarter of 2010, the number of smartphones reported on North American carriers' network was approximately $78 million, representing a 57% increase from the year prior. Verizon Wireless recently launched the LTE-capable HTC Thunderbolt demonstrating our leadership in LTE smartphones and multi-mode technology. And additionally in North America, we're beginning to see the influence of affordable smartphones in the prepaid segment as smartphone penetration rates ramped at Leap and MetroPCS. According to GfK, in key Western European countries, smartphones with high-level operating systems accounted for 74% of 3G phones sold in December 2010, up from 44% a year ago. And in Korea, since the beginning of this year, each operator has announced plans to introduce 20 or more new smartphone models.
With respect to Japan, we're of course saddened by the recent tragic events. But despite this disruption, we have received reports that wireless technology, combined with social networking services and an early earthquake warning system, played a critical role for communication and safety of the people in the affected regions. Preliminary indications are that demand has held up fairly well, similar to what we have seen in other past events of this nature. So although there is some uncertainty, we do not foresee any significant impact on the overall demand profile for wireless devices.
Turning to China. China Telecom recently reached 100 million CDMA subscribers, and expect that 50% of their new subscribers will use EV-DO this year, up from approximately 25% in 2010. Additionally, according to Sino MR, of the 3G phones, excluding 1X phones sold in February in China, 46% we're smartphones, representing more than 300% increase from a year ago.
In India, all operators with new 3G spectrum licenses have now launched with HSPA+ networks and together cover more than 100 cities. Mobile broadband continues to gain momentum with expansion of EV-DO Revision A networks reaching more than 500 cities. And demand for smartphones in India continues to grow with 10 new Snapdragon-based smartphone launches in January and February alone.
And a couple of other items of note. We're pleased to announce the creation of the Qualcomm Foundation, the charitable organization which will focus on education, health services, sustainability and the arts. Qualcomm has a long history of philanthropy and service and the foundation is another way that we can give back to our communities around the world. And finally, we will be hosting our second annual Uplinq conference on June 1 and 2. And as many of you know, Uplinq's unique in that it brings together developers, device manufacturers, mobile operators and technology providers to help identify opportunities across multiple operating systems. It should be another great event and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

We continue to see favorable industry trends that are driving growth in the Licensing business. These trends include solid unit shipments during the December quarter, positive handset ASP trends within both developed and emerging regions and growth in sales of incremental connected devices. These trends help drive record unit shipments and total reported device sales during the December quarter. Going forward, we expect to continue to see strength in handset ASPs in developed and emerging regions, driven by growth in smartphones, including greater penetration into mid and lower tiers; a richer mix of devices in emerging regions such as China and India; and continued growth in tablet volumes.
Accordingly, as Bill will discuss, we are raising our fiscal 2011 ASP estimate range from $190 to $200 to $199 to $209. We also expect the volume and breadth of new connected devices to continue to grow. In addition to tablets and e-readers, we are encouraged to see the emergence of new connected device categories such as the recently-announced 3G-enabled Sony NGP gaming device.
As Paul mentioned, we are pleased to report that we have now resolved our dispute with Panasonic. As you may recall, the arbitration had been proceeding in phases. In the first phase, which was the only phase that had been completed as of the time of the settlement, the arbitrator had rejected Panasonic's claims that Qualcomm breached the license agreement. We are pleased with the terms of the resolution, which reflect the established value of our patent portfolio.
Over the last few months, we have now successfully resolved both disputes that had been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operating performance of QTL. Accordingly, our second fiscal quarter results include the recognition of revenue attributable to these resolutions, including approximately $400 million in revenue related to prior periods.
In closing, we are very pleased with the industry trends that are helping to drive our Licensing business, as well as the successful resolutions we have recently achieved. QTL continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead in a very dynamic global wireless industry.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

The QCT business executed well and very much in line with our expectations this quarter. We shipped approximately 118 million MSMs, just above the high end of our prior guidance, driven by strong demand for products across the chipset portfolio. As we forecasted previously, our results this quarter show a trend very similar to last year, with annual customer pricing resets and seasonal operating expense increases typical for this time of year. Consistent with this trend, both our average revenue per MSM and our operating margins were down sequentially. But in absolute terms, our revenue and earnings before tax were well above the same period last year, with revenue up 28% and earnings up 21%.
The trends and requirements for OEMs to succeed in wireless are aligning well with the strengths of our business, particularly in the areas where we continue to make significant investments. First, our platform approach is a strategic advantage for us and our broad chipset roadmap has helped us grow across multiple device tiers. Second, the importance of integrated chipset solutions for our OEM partners is clearly accelerating due to the superior performance, lower power consumption and time-to-market advantages it delivers. Our 7000- and 8000-series chip shipments are up 70% in the first half of this fiscal year as compared to the last half of fiscal 2010, growing faster than the Wireless Device segment and demonstrating that integration is the leading choice for mass-market and high-end smartphones.
The range of Snapdragon devices continues to grow as well. Our customers announced the 100th Snapdragon power device this quarter, and the pipeline of devices and design has increased to approximately 200. We continued to expand our portfolio in the growing Tablet category as well. There are now eight different Snapdragon power tablets announced from mobility and computing leaders like HTC, HP, Acer and ASUS with approximately 30 additional designs in process. Our LTE solutions lead the industry and continue to build momentum. Our LTE chipsets power the HTC Thunderbolt, various USB dongles and newly launched LTE hotspots from Samsung and NovAtel, which also incorporate our wireless LAN products. We're also seeing many devices and design that are pairing our application processors and LTE technologies together, demonstrating that OEMs value a complete solution for processing and connectivity.
At Mobile World Congress, we announced eight new chipsets as we continue to quickly drive technology across our modems, application processors, graphics and connectivity solutions. We expanded our overall leadership in 3G and LTE multi-mode modems announcing several new chipsets that redefine performance at the high end and take the latest 3G and LTE technology to mass-market price points. We also announced our next-generation mobile application processor architecture for the Snapdragon family, which will again redefine performance for the industry by delivering 150% higher overall performance as well as 65% lower power than currently available ARM-based CPU cores. This chipset architecture is based on 28-nanometer technology, which enables us to cost-effectively integrate LTE, 3G, wireless LAN, Bluetooth, FM and GPS in single-, dual- or quad-core designs for smartphones and next-generation computing devices.
The first chipset in this next-generation Snapdragon architecture is our industry-leading multi-mode 3G, LTE, MSM8960 chipset, which is on track to sample this quarter. Our leadership in graphics and the strength of our gaming ecosystem continues to grow this quarter. We announced an agreement with SRS Labs, which allows us to bring HD and 3D audio to movies and games, as well as a strategic relationship with Gameloft to deliver an enhanced mobile gaming experience on Snapdragon devices for the top game titles. We now have over 100 HD and casual games optimized for our GPU and expect this number to continue to grow.
The year is progressing much as expected. As we commented on in the past two quarters, we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones, specifically a greater mix of mass-market smartphones. Our integrated solutions are well suited for these devices, and we continue to price in order to grow share in this environment. 
With respect to our semiconductor supply chain, we do not foresee any significant impact in our ability to supply product to our customers as a result of the recent events in Japan. Our scale and broad set of OEM customers provides us a unique perspective on industry trends and enables us to better address short-term fluctuations in demand. 
Finally, with respect to the Atheros acquisition, we met key milestones this quarter, including approval of the transaction by Atheros to shareholders, as well as the successful completion of Hart-Scott-Rodino review. We continue to expect the transaction to close this quarter subject to receiving one remaining foreign regulatory approval.
In summary, QCT executed well this quarter. Our solutions approach and focus on integration across the broad roadmap of chipset products has enabled us to grow across multiple product categories and price points, as well as expand our pipeline of design wins. These wins are across an increasing variety of device segments, OEM customers and regions, positioning us to continue to grow share in this dynamic environment.
That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876100,116210,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record revenues of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 for our fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal y",949,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record revenues of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 for our fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Our better-than-expected results were driven by a number of positive items. Most importantly, our core licensing and chip businesses contributed strong results. 3G device sales grew significantly with total reported device sales up 18% sequentially and with an average selling price per device of approximately $200 to $206. QCT's 118 million MSM chipset shipments were above the high end of our prior guidance.
During the second quarter, we resolved outstanding license disputes with Panasonic and another licensee, which we discussed during last quarter's earnings call. Since our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 was significantly higher than the $0.79 midpoint of our previous guidance, I thought it would be helpful to provide an earnings walk of the $0.07 increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. First, stronger non-GAAP earnings per share were not entirely driven by the dispute resolutions, although they did contribute approximately $0.06 and were driven primarily by the Panasonic license dispute resolution. Recall that our prior guidance took into account resolution of the other license dispute.
Second, we achieved a further $0.06 of earnings improvement from our core operations, driven primarily by the strong demand for 3G devices and increased demand for our chipsets, as well as a bit stronger investment income.
Third, we restructured our Firethorn business during the second quarter and significantly reduced the run rate of its operating expenses. As a result of the restructuring and the reappraisal of the Firethorn business, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $120 million.
Fourth, we established a new Qualcomm charitable foundation, to which we made an initial $50 million contribution. The combination of the Firethorn impairment and charitable-giving decreased earnings per share by approximately $0.05.
Investors can find this earnings walk on our Investor Relations website. You can also find on the website an earnings walk from the year-ago quarter, and that earnings walk distinguishes the approximately $400 million in QTL revenues related to the prior periods that were recognized this quarter due to the resolution of licensee disputes.
Now turning to our updated financial guidance. We estimate that approximately 646 million to 663 million CDMA-based devices shipped during calendar 2010, an increase of approximately 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales. And as you would expect, we are monitoring the events in Japan very closely. As you heard from Paul, we do not, at this time, see an impact on end consumer demand for CDMA-based wireless devices. It is worth noting that if not for the uncertainty of component supply from Japan for 3G device manufacturers, we would have an even greater upward bias in our calendar 2011 CDMA-based device estimates, given improving trends on consumers upgrading their 3G devices.
As such, we are reaffirming our estimate of between 750 million and 800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011. Using the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate that in 2011, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% year-over-year. We now estimate the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $199 to $209. The $204 midpoint is above our prior year $195 midpoint estimate, driven by the trends that Derek mentioned earlier and a couple of dollars of favorable foreign exchange impact.
We now expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.1 billion to $14.7 billion, up approximately 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $500 million increase in our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance range midpoint, approximately $200 million reflects additional QTL revenues attributable to our recently settled licensee disputes. Improved outlooks for QCT and QTL drove the remaining $300 million increase. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.13, up 26% year-over-year at the midpoint.
In QCT, our operating margin estimate is consistent with our previous guidance for the range of 22% to 24% expected for fiscal 2011. We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 15% to 16% year-over-year. Specific to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.35 billion to $3.65 billion, up approximately 30% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.68 to $0.72, up approximately 23% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $35.5 billion to $38.5 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially, reflecting postholiday seasonality typical for this time of year. We anticipate shipments of approximately 115 million to 119 million MSM units during the June quarter, with revenue per MSM up a bit sequentially. And then we expect a greater mix of chipsets targeted for mass-market smartphones consistent with our prior expectations. We believe our visibility on fiscal third quarter chipsets, both supply and demand, is relatively quite good.
We estimate the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range consistent with our prior estimates. Our forecast anticipates a small breed of channel inventory in the short term, which we expect to be replenished prior to the end of our fiscal year. We anticipate third fiscal quarter of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will decrease sequentially approximately 7%.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

If you look at where we were, let's say, in the 2007 timeframe, when we really started to start to ship our first 7000-based devices to where we are now, we've grown quite strong in terms of using that technology. As you are aware, we have been investing both in additional application processor hardware designs but also into different software platforms, and that's really to enable us to continue to add new customers actually.

And I would say over the last two years, the environment, with the addition of Samsung and Global Foundries to the fabless world, really created I think much more investment in that area. And we feel probably more comfortable about where we sit today than where we sat two years ago because of that addition. So we're getting good service, we think, from our fabless foundry partners and we continue to move forward with the system approach."

First, for you, Steve, you indicated that part of the reason why we're seeing flat sequential chipset shipment forecast for the June quarter was due to a little bit different seasonality of your customers and basically development of the global market.

And then maybe for you, Bill, in terms of the better ASP forecast for fiscal 2011, or I'm sorry, for calendar 2011, how much of that is due to better-than-expected upgrade activity, say, in developed markets versus the pricing environment and what consumers are willing to pay in the developing markets where you're seeing 3G handset buys for the first time?"

So it's not inconsistent with that to see some units move around from quarter-to-quarter. And so we don't -- I think it will be difficult for me to break them out.

The other thing that we have I think that's a bit unique is the ability to support CDMA, LTE and WCDMA ecosystems, either separately or in the same device. And so that those advantages really open up multiple markets with one investment, and it's really -- it's a statement of scale. So we think that, in this account, is a very key thing.

I'm happy to report that Qualcomm delivered very strong results again this quarter in addition to successfully completing the acquisition of Atheros. Our business performed well across all key guidance metrics. We're off to a strong start with Atheros. 
During this quarter, we sampled our Snapdragon MSM 8960 chipset based on 28-nanometer process technology. The MSM 8960 is a dual-core solution which uses our next-generation microarchitecture called the integrated multimode modem technology, including EV-DO, Dual-Carrier HSPA+ and both the TDD and FTP variances of LTE. 
As we've said in the past, only one of our licensees WCDMA subscriber unit royalty obligations would expire if not extended prior to late 2017. I'm pleased to report that we have now successfully completed this remaining renewal. The Licensing business continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead and this latest renewal again demonstrates the established value to the industry of Qualcomm's patented invention.
In June, we hosted our second annual Uplinq conference here in San Diego. The event was a success as it brought together industry leaders from across the ecosystem, including application developers, operators and device manufacturers. Our support of multiple operating systems is highlighted by keynote presentations delivered by HP, HTC and Nokia. The convergence of the mobile and computing ecosystem is accelerating as smartphones and tablets will becoming full-blown computing devices. Traditional computing device manufacturers are working on mobile devices, and developers are increasing their emphasis on mobile. According to Strategy Analytics, by 2012, the installed base of smartphones is estimated to exceed the installed base of PCs. Our collaboration with Microsoft to enable Windows 8 to run on our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including MSM 8960, further underscores the shift in computing. 
The migration from 2G to 3G continues as well, with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of June, there were approximately 1.4 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago. And Wireless Intelligence predicts that by the fourth quarter of this year, 3G will be contributing greater than 50% of net subscriber addition.
Driven by the increased demand for 3G and data capable devices, wireless data traffic continues to accelerate. Operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, the number of operators that have commercially launched HSPA+ now totals 136. 39 of these operators have commercially launched Dual-Carrier HSPA+, a 70% increase in the last 3 months. 
Additionally, there are now 218 operators that are investing in LTE, including 24 networks which have commercially launched. According to the CDG, there are currently 7 commercial EV-DO Rev. B networks with an additional 11 operators planning to launch or trial the technology. CDMA device trends are healthy and demand for smartphones are strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, global smartphone sales exceeded 100 million devices in the first quarter of 2011, representing 85% year-over-year growth. Also, Google recently announced that more than 550,000 Android devices are activated every day, up from 100,000 activations per day in May of last year.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong transfer smartphone adoption. According to Gartner, sales of smartphones in North America are expected to increase by approximately 41% from 2010 to 2011 and smartphone sales are expected to exceed 50% of the total handsets sold this year. In Europe, smartphones continue to expand into more affordable price tiers. Recently in the U.K., the Vodafone smart and the LG ego feature phone were both operated offered at GBP 75 as pay-as-you-go devices further blowing the lines between the pricing of smart and feature phones.
Additionally, operators such as SFR, Orange and in Belgium have each launched bundle data plans in which a second device can be added to an existing data plan as a means of increasingly wireless data subscriber base. We see positive trends in developing regions as well. I attended a CDMA industry summit and handset fair hosted by China Telecom in last month that attracted more than 11,000 attendees. According to press reports from the event, more than 50 EV-DO phones were now expect 20-plus manufacturers. It was also reported a China Telecom highlighted at 3G EV-DO handset sales are expected to reach 29 million units this year increasing by 190% over 2010. 
In May, China Unicom launched 21 megabit per second HSPA+ servicing 56 major cities. And in June according to MR data, the blade based on our 7,000 series chipsets at the daily sales record by a Chinese OEM and has become the second-highest selling 3G smartphone on Unicom's network. Earlier this week, I attended a China Unicom partner event in which China Unicom announced 15 new 3G devices, of which 13 were based on our chipset. 
In India, 3G networks have now been liked more than 6 months and operators are making plans to increase 3G coverage from over 100 cities today to over 1,000 towns by the end of the year. Country devices in India is also expected to meet new levels of affordability with HSPA+ devices such as the Spike G650 being offered at under $90. At the higher end, 21 smartphones have been launched to date based on Snapdragon. Including the HTC sensation based on our dual-core solution so as the first Snapdragon-based tablet in India, the HTC flier. 
So to conclude, while we've continued to execute on our strategic priorities, we've seen our opportunities extending an even greater rate than we have previously expected and accordingly, we're pleased to be raising our revenue non-GAAP earnings guidance for the fiscal year, driven by strong global smartphone adoption, as well as the addition of Atheros. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf"

QCT operating margins were in line with expectations. We continue to make significant investments in modem technology, application processing, connectivity, graphics and software. Our leadership position in combining these technologies into a platform of integrated tiered chipset solutions is unmatched in our industry and aligns with both industry trends and the business priorities and device requirements of our OEM partners.
We also continue to expand our support of multiple operating systems with the launch of the latest version of Web OS, as well as Blackberry 7. Customer traction for our first dual-core Snapdragon chipsets, the MSM 8660 dual core platform, continues to grow, and there are now more than 100 designs in development based on that platform in addition to 6 smartphones and 4 tablets previously announced or commercially available. 
Dual-core devices this quarter includes the HTC sensation, the HTC Evo 3G, Razor, T-Mobile myTouch 4G and HP Touchpad. Including both single core and dual core chipsets, our partners have now announced a total of 10 different Snapdragon-powered tablets and there are another 40 tablet designs in process. Our multimode 3G LTE solutions continue to lead the industry with several USB dongles and mobile router data devices based on our multimode 3G LTE chipsets launching this quarter. The complexity of supporting 2G, 3G and 4G standards across the proliferation of over 40 RF bands also plays well, with our system-level approach to integration and we are unique in our ability to support all these requirements.
As Paul mentioned, we sampled the Snapdragon MSM 8960 ahead of schedule this quarter, which is the industry's first multimode 3G LTE dual core chipset for handsets. This is the first of multiple 28-nanometer chipsets on our roadmap and it is designed to integrate seamlessly with our new connectivity solution, the WCM 3660, which supports dual band WiFi, Bluetooth and FM and is optimized for smartphone and tablet devices. As we announced at Computex, the MSM 8960 will be the first processor in the Snapdragon family to power devices using Windows 8.
The MSM 8960 and a broad platform of multimode 3G LTE chipsets on our roadmap will greatly expand the reach of LTE and take our high-performance high-efficiency design to the next wave of smartphones, tablets and upcoming generations of Windows computing devices. 
Demonstrating our potential expanded opportunities that the Atheros acquisition provides, since the deal closed in May, we have launched the industry's first FTC certified WiFi system in package for microcontroller based design to enable machine-to-machine communications and introduced the industry's lowest keep on solution for broadband over fiber networks and the power grid. We continue to leverage the strong distribution channels and product portfolio that Atheros developed over the past decade. Specific to wireless LAN, the adoption of 11 and across all channels continues with 11N now making up over 70% of this revenue. Sales to our PC OEMs increased significantly due to a strong adoption of our combination wireless LAN and Bluetooth products. Overall, we are excited about the platform and the business opportunities in front of us.
This year continues to progress much as we expected back in November. We are modestly increasing our R&D investments in the fiscal fourth quarter to support new process technologies, the commercialization of our expanding multicore and LTE product offerings and to support multiple new customer opportunities. Our strategic focus on integrated system solutions, leveraging our modem application processor connectivity graphics and software leadership is working well, and we expect to see strong volume growth in the coming quarters. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876095,143473,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Given the size of the Atheros tr",807,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. 
Given the size of the Atheros transaction and consistent with prevailing tech industry practice, we modified our non-GAAP reporting methodology. Starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we are supplementing our non-GAAP reporting by excluding the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets. 
Fiscal third quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, which was at the high-end of our prior guidance range. Atheros contributed less than $100 million, reflecting approximately 5 weeks activity since the acquisition closed in late May. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.73 for the quarter including approximately $0.50 attributable to Atheros exceeding the high end for prior guidance range. Our fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.03 better than the $0.70 midpoint of our prior guidance. Both QTL and QCT each added approximately $0.01 per share and investment income in Atheros each contributed approximately $0.50 per share. 
We estimate that approximately 170 million to 174 million CDMA-based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average selling price of $209 to $215, up approximately $9 sequentially, primarily due to increasing sales of smartphones. We are seeing handset strength handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed markets as well as increasing breadth of other connected devices such as tablets and e-readers. Our total cash position remains strong at approximately $20 billion despite using $3.1 billion of net cash to acquire Atheros. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are reaffirming our estimate of between $750 million and $800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011, up approximately 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $204 to $210 per unit. The $207 midpoint is $3 above our prior $204 midpoint estimate, primarily driven by greater adoption of higher-priced devices such as smartphones around the world.
We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, reflecting higher average selling prices for CDMA-based devices and the addition of the Atheros business. We expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.7 billion to $15 billion, up approximately 35% year-over-year at the midpoint, which includes approximately $350 million from Atheros. We anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20, up 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $0.09 non-GAAP earnings per share increase over our prior fiscal 2011 guidance range midpoint, approximately $0.06 reflects an improved outlook for QTL. Approximately $0.02 is related to Atheros and approximately $0.01 is the net benefit from greater investment income and modestly greater R&D expense.
We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year. As Steve Mollenkopf mentioned, we expect a modest increase in QCT R&D investment primarily related to new chipset and customer opportunities. 
In QCT, operating margins are largely consistent with our prior expectations. Excluding Atheros, we expect operating margins to be in line with our prior guidance range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. Including Atheros, we expect operating margins to be towards the low end of that range for the fiscal year.
Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues including Atheros to be in the range of approximately $3.86 billion to $4.16 billion, up approximately 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.80, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $38 billion to $41 billion in the September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 9% sequentially and approximately 40% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate shipments of approximately 120 million to 125 million MSM units during the September quarter with revenue per MSM up sequentially driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Atheros revenue and the particular mix of chipset products that we expect to ship.
We estimate that the CDMA inventory channel declined a bit in the June quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. For the September quarter, our forecast anticipates an additional small of channel inventory and we continue to estimate that the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at or slightly below the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range. 
We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially, approximately 9%, reflecting Atheros and the increased QCT R&D investments we've previously mentioned.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

We held our estimates for the year constant at that 750 to 800 million units for the calendar year. Specifically, I mean we actually had a debate on whether we should raise it a bit.

We won't to continue this going forward because our guidance from hereon will include Atheros. Specific to Atheros, for this fiscal year, again, you got about 5 weeks from the June quarter and a full quarter into September. That will add approximately $350 million of revenue to this fiscal year, of which a little less than $100 million was from the June quarter. So that's included as you would calculate revenue or MSM. Obviously, revenue per MSM includes a wide variety of different products from QCT already, and so you've got any number of different chipsets. So you could see a little variability in that average. It's an indicator, but it's one people should be cautious on to taking too directly and imputing what that might mean, that being revenue per MSM."

In some cases, it will be used for things like supplemental downlinks so that you use it in conjunction with other FTD systems. But there's pretty clearly going to be a strong demand for TDD capabilities. Obviously, what's going on in China right now we're still waiting to see and I think we'll wait for some time to see exactly when the government will provide the licenses. But there is work underway trials going on underway. And obviously, in India, things are going quite well on the LTE TDD side. So I do think that there'll be strong. But the mix will be really going to be driven I think mostly by how spectrum allocations get done. For us, we don't really care actually. We're happy to support both and we have been in the chips. And your question about having multimode support, I think it's going to be very important because most operators are looking to roll out LTE as supplemental data capacity in urban areas or in hotspots. And then over time, it will allow more broadly. The other issue is that there's quite a large number of frequency bands that are being spectrum for FTE, reflecting the fact that it's difficult to find spectrum for governments around the world. So then, you want to have the backwards compatibility to make sure that you have the global room and capability. We will, I think, see some single mode LTE rollout but I think the vast, vast majority of the device are going to be multimode and therefore having all that capability and there in the single chips going to be very, very important."

For fiscal Q3, the Atheros was about a -- it's about 500 basis points impact to our operating margin. That number should decrease a bit going into the next quarter but just modestly. For the quarter, look for operating margins in QCT to be in that similar range as Q3. As we commented, we're not, at this point, seeing a significant increase in the MSM volume. And as Steve noted, he's stepping up his R&D because of some opportunities that we see in the near term."

So very much on track in terms of how we guided you in terms of OpEx, op margin trajectory and what we expect. And then, looking into next year, we tend to invest into units a little bit ahead of more than one quarter ahead i think in terms of the volume ramp.

So the ASP strength that we saw in our fiscal Q3 that we're seeing in our fiscal Q4 that Derek talked about is a good part of that. It's just emerging markets where we're seeing ASPs, the average ASPs actually increase. So how long that holds? We'll see, but the appetite for smartphones across the world is quite strong and it's got ways to go in terms of penetration."

I'm happy to report that Qualcomm delivered very strong results again this quarter in addition to successfully completing the acquisition of Atheros. Our business performed well across all key guidance metrics. We're off to a strong start with Atheros. 
During this quarter, we sampled our Snapdragon MSM 8960 chipset based on 28-nanometer process technology. The MSM 8960 is a dual-core solution which uses our next-generation micro-architecture called Krait with integrated multimode modem technology, including EV-DO, Dual-Carrier HSPA+ and both the TDD and FDD variances LTE. 
As we've said in the past, only one of our licensees WCDMA subscriber unit royalty obligations would expire, if not extended, prior to late 2017. I'm pleased to report that we have now successfully completed this remaining renewal. The Licensing business continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead and this latest renewal again demonstrates the established value to the industry of Qualcomm's patented invention.
In June, we hosted our second annual Uplinq conference here in San Diego. The event was a success as it brought together industry leaders from across the ecosystem, including application developers, operators and device manufacturers. Our support of multiple operating systems is highlighted by keynote presentations delivered by HP, HTC and Nokia. The convergence of the mobile and computing ecosystem is accelerating as smartphones and tablets are becoming full-blown computing devices. Traditional computing device manufacturers are working on mobile devices, and developers are increasing their emphasis on mobile. According to Strategy Analytics, by 2012, the installed base of smartphones is estimated to exceed the installed base of PCs. Our collaboration with Microsoft to enable Windows 8 to run on our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including MSM 8960, further underscores a shift in computing. 
The migration from 2G to 3G continues as well, with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of June, there were approximately 1.4 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago. And Wireless Intelligence predicts that by the fourth quarter of this year, 3G will be contributing greater than 50% of net subscriber addition.
Driven by the increased demand for 3G and data-capable devices, wireless data traffic continues to accelerate. Operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, the number of operators that have commercially launched HSPA+ now totals 136. 39 of these operators have commercially launched Dual-Carrier HSPA+, a 70% increase in the last 3 months. Additionally, there are now 218 operators that are investing in LTE, including 24 networks which have commercially launched. 
According to the CDG, there are currently 7 commercial EV-DO Rev. B networks with an additional 11 operators planning to launch or trial the technology. CDMA device trends are healthy and demand for smartphones remain strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, global smartphone sales exceeded 100 million devices in the first quarter of 2011, representing 85% year-over-year growth. Also, Google recently announced that more than 550,000 Android devices are activated every day, up from 100,000 activations per day in May of last year.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong trends for smartphone adoption. According to Gartner, sales of smartphones in North America are expected to increase by approximately 41% from 2010 to 2011 and smartphone sales are expected to exceed 50% of the total handsets sold this year. In Europe, smartphones continue to expand into more affordable price tiers. Recently in the U.K., the Vodafone smart and the LG ego feature phone were both operated -- both offered at GBP 75 as pay-as-you-go devices, further blurring the lines between the pricing of smart and feature phones.
Additionally, operators such as SFR, Orange and Mobistar in Belgium have each launched bundled data plans in which a second device can be added to an existing data plan as a means of increasingly wireless data subscriber base. We see positive trends in developing regions as well. I attended a CDMA industry summit and handset fair hosted by China Telecom in Guangzhou last month that attracted more than 11,000 attendees. According to press reports from the event, more than 50 EV-DO phones were announced by 20-plus manufacturers. It was also reported a China Telecom highlighted that 3G EV-DO handset sales are expected to reach 29 million units this year, increasing by 190% over 2010. 
In May, China Unicom launched 21 megabit per second HSPA+ servicing 56 major cities. And in June, according to Sino MR [ph] data, the ZTE Blade, based on our 7,000 series chipset, set a daily sales record by a Chinese OEM and has become the second-highest selling 3G smartphone on Unicom's network. Earlier this week, I attended a China Unicom partner event in which China Unicom announced 15 new 3G devices, of which 13 were based on our chipset.
In India, 3G networks have now been live more than 6 months and operators are making plans to increase 3G coverage from over 100 cities today to over 1,000 towns by the end of the year. 3G devices in India is also expected to meet new levels of affordability with HSPA+ devices, such as the Spice G-6550 being offered at under $90. At the higher end, 21 smartphones have been launched to date based on Snapdragon, including the HTC sensation based on our dual-core solution, so is the first Snapdragon-based tablet in India, the HTC Flyer. 
So to conclude, while we've continued to execute on our strategic priorities, we've seen our opportunities expand at an even greater rate than we have previously expected. And accordingly, we're pleased to be raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the fiscal year driven by strong global smartphone adoption, as well as the addition of Atheros. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf"
33493,113876095,143614,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.

Our QCT business executed very well again this quarter. We shipped a record 120 million MSMs above our prior guidance range, reflecting strong demand for our integrated 7xxx and 8xxx series chipsets which were up 32% over last quarter. Our supply chain responded very well to the events in Japan, fulfilling all customer orders during the quarter, including a small amount of unexpected buffer demand, which we forecast will be worked off in the September quarter. 
We also completed our acquisition of Atheros and the integration into QCT is progressing well. The team is executing according to its roadmap having already announced 3 new connectivity products and we are excited to welcome Craig and the entire Atheros team to Qualcomm. 
Our average revenue per MSM in the third fiscal quarter was higher sequentially as expected, reflecting a richer mix of integrated smartphone chipsets, as well as approximately 5 weeks of Atheros revenues post acquisition close. QCT operating margins were in line with expectations. We continue to make significant investments in modem technology, application processing, connectivity, graphics and software. 
Our leadership position in combining these technologies into a platform of integrated tiered chipset solutions is unmatched in our industry and aligns with both industry trends and the business priorities and device requirements of our OEM partners.
We also continue to expand our support of multiple operating systems with the launch of the latest version of webOS, as well as BlackBerry 7. Customer traction for our first dual-core Snapdragon chipsets, the MSM8660 dual-core platform, continues to grow, and there are now more than 100 designs in development based on that platform in addition to 6 smartphones and 4 tablets previously announced or commercially available. 
Dual-core devices this quarter include the HTC Sensation, the HTC EVO 3D, Pantech Vega Racer, T-Mobile myTouch 4G and HP TouchPad. Including both single core and dual-core chipsets, our partners have now announced a total of 10 different Snapdragon-powered tablets and there are another 40 tablet designs in process. Our multimode 3G LTE solutions continue to lead the industry with several USB dongles and mobile router data devices based on our multimode 3G LTE chipsets launching this quarter. The complexity of supporting 2G, 3G and 4G standards across the proliferation of over 40 RF bands also plays well with our system-level approach to integration and we are unique in our ability to support all these requirements.
As Paul mentioned, we sampled the Snapdragon MSM 8960 ahead of schedule this quarter, which is the industry's first multimode 3G LTE dual core chipset for handsets. This is the first of multiple 28-nanometer chipsets on our roadmap and it is designed to integrate seamlessly with our new connectivity solution, the WCN3660, which supports dual band WiFi, Bluetooth and FM and is optimized for smartphone and tablet devices. As we announced at Computex, the MSM 8960 will be the first processor in the Snapdragon family to power devices using Windows 8.
The MSM 8960 and a broad platform of multimode 3G LTE chipsets on our roadmap will greatly expand the reach of LTE and take our high-performance high-efficiency design to the next wave of smartphones, tablets and upcoming generations of Windows computing devices. 
Demonstrating our potential expanded opportunities that the Atheros acquisition provides, since the deal closed in May, we have launched the industry's first FTC-certified WiFi system and package for microcontroller-based designs to enable machine-to-machine communications and introduced the industry's lowest keep on [ph] solutions for broadband over fiber networks and the power grid. 
We continue to leverage the strong distribution channels and product portfolio that Atheros developed over the past decade. Specific to wireless LAN, the adoption of 11n and across all channels continues with 11n now making up over 70% of this revenue. 
Sales to our PC OEMs increased significantly due to a strong adoption of our combination wireless LAN and Bluetooth products. Overall, we are excited about the platform and the business opportunities in front of us.
This year continues to progress much as we expected back in November. We are modestly increasing our R&D investments in the fiscal fourth quarter to support new process technologies, the commercialization of our expanding multi-core and LTE product offerings and to support multiple new customer opportunities. Our strategic focus on integrated system solutions, leveraging our modem application processor connectivity graphics and software leadership is working well, and we expect to see strong volume growth in the coming quarters. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876095,143614,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Given the size of the Atheros tr",808,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. 
Given the size of the Atheros transaction and consistent with prevailing tech industry practice, we modified our non-GAAP reporting methodology. Starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we are supplementing our non-GAAP reporting by excluding the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets. 
Fiscal third quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, which was at the high-end of our prior guidance range. Atheros contributed less than $100 million, reflecting approximately 5 weeks activity since the acquisition closed in late May. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.73 for the quarter including approximately $0.50 attributable to Atheros exceeding the high end of our prior guidance range. Our fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.03 better than the $0.70 midpoint of our prior guidance. Both QTL and QCT each added approximately $0.01 per share and investment income in Atheros each contributed approximately $0.50 per share.
We estimate that approximately 170 million to 174 million CDMA-based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average selling price of $209 to $215, up approximately $9 sequentially, primarily due to increasing sales of smartphones. We are seeing handset strength, handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed markets as well as increasing breadth of other connected devices such as tablets and e-readers. Our total cash position remains strong at approximately $20 billion despite using $3.1 billion of net cash to acquire Atheros. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are reaffirming our estimate of between $750 million and $800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011, up approximately 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $204 to $210 per unit. The $207 midpoint is $3 above our prior $204 midpoint estimate, primarily driven by greater adoption of higher-priced devices such as smartphones around the world.
We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, reflecting higher average selling prices for CDMA-based devices and the addition of the Atheros business. We expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.7 billion to $15 billion, up approximately 35% year-over-year at the midpoint, which includes approximately $350 million from Atheros. 
We anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20, up 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $0.09 non-GAAP earnings per share increase over our prior fiscal 2011 guidance range midpoint, approximately $0.06 reflects an improved outlook for QTL. Approximately $0.02 is related to Atheros and approximately $0.01 is the net benefit from greater investment income and modestly greater R&D expense.
We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year. As Steve Mollenkopf mentioned, we expect a modest increase in QCT R&D investment primarily related to new chipset and customer opportunities. 
In QCT, operating margins are largely consistent with our prior expectations. Excluding Atheros, we expect operating margins to be in line with our prior guidance range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. Including Atheros, we expect operating margins to be towards the low end of that range for the fiscal year.
Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues including Atheros to be in the range of approximately $3.86 billion to $4.16 billion, up approximately 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.80, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $38 billion to $41 billion in the September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 9% sequentially and approximately 40% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate shipments of approximately 120 million to 125 million MSM units during the September quarter with revenue per MSM up sequentially driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Atheros revenue and the particular mix of chipset products we expect to ship.
We estimate that the CDMA inventory channel declined a bit in the June quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. For the September quarter, our forecast anticipates an additional small bleed of channel inventory and we continue to estimate that the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at or slightly below the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range. 
We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially, approximately 9%, reflecting Atheros and the increased QCT R&D investments we've previously mentioned.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

First question here, what's your outlook for TD-LTE versus FDD globally? Will TDD grow meaningfully outside of China and East Asia? And then second, strategically, how much of an advantage is it to support both modes and offer backward compatibility with CDMA and HSPA+?"

In some cases, it will be used for things like supplemental downlinks so that you use it in conjunction with other FDD systems. But there's pretty clearly going to be a strong demand for TDD capabilities. Obviously, what's going on in China right now, we're still waiting to see and I think we'll wait for some time to see exactly when the government will provide the licenses. But there is work underway, trials going on underway. And obviously, in India, things are going quite well on the LTE TDD side. So I do think that'll be strong. But the mix will be -- it's really going to be driven, I think, mostly by how spectrum allocations get done. For us, we don't really care, actually. We're happy to support both and we have them in the chips. And your question about having multimode support, I think it's going to be very important because most operators are looking to roll out LTE as a supplemental data capacity in urban areas or in hotspots. And then over time, it will allow more broadly. The other issue is that there's quite a large number of frequency bands that are being spec-ed for LTE, reflecting the fact that it's difficult to find spectrum for governments around the world. So then, you want to have the backwards compatibility to make sure that you have the global room and capability. We will, I think, see some single mode LTE rollout but I think the vast, vast majority devices are going to be multimode. And therefore having all that capability and there in the single chips going to be very, very important."

China, the strength is with 3G, and Southeast Asia, Middle East Africa, we're seeing a GSM migration to 3G pick up pace. Although we're seeing that uplift there, we saw from the bit forecast for WCDMA Europe, I think the economic troubles there are holding back the consumer a bit. And then, it's similar for India. We softened that a bit. But in total, we're holding that. So it gives you a little bit more color maybe by region of what we're seeing happening.

We have recently added both of those tiers into our roadmap. The difference between them may be a small amount of performance delta but also different interfaces that are required in a tablet, perhaps, than a phone depending on the class of tablet. In terms of the overall market, our perspective is quite bullish over the long term. If you look at mobile computing, we think that will really grow up and take a fairly significant share of the traditional laptop space really driven by the software that's been driven on phones. That software is getting better every day and I think, as that happens, you'll see I think a little bit more diversity in terms of supply base for suppliers into that market as well as the market itself growing. Both of those things being good things for Qualcomm and the industry."

I'm happy to report that Qualcomm delivered very strong results again this quarter in addition to successfully completing the acquisition of Atheros. Our business performed well across all key guidance metrics. We're off to a strong start with Atheros. 
During this quarter, we sampled our Snapdragon MSM 8960 chipset based on 28-nanometer process technology. The MSM 8960 is a dual-core solution which uses our next-generation micro-architecture called Krait with integrated multimode modem technology, including EV-DO, Dual-Carrier HSPA+ and both the TDD and FDD variances LTE. 
As we've said in the past, only one of our licensees WCDMA subscriber unit royalty obligations would expire, if not extended, prior to late 2017. I'm pleased to report that we have now successfully completed this remaining renewal. The Licensing business continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead and this latest renewal again demonstrates the established value to the industry of Qualcomm's patented inventions.
In June, we hosted our second annual Uplinq conference here in San Diego. The event was a success as it brought together industry leaders from across the ecosystem, including application developers, operators and device manufacturers. Our support of multiple operating systems is highlighted by keynote presentations delivered by HP, HTC and Nokia. The convergence of the mobile and computing ecosystem is accelerating as smartphones and tablets are becoming full-blown computing devices. Traditional computing device manufacturers are working on mobile devices, and developers are increasing their emphasis on mobile. According to Strategy Analytics, by 2012, the installed base of smartphones is estimated to exceed the installed base of PCs. Our collaboration with Microsoft to enable Windows 8 to run on our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including MSM 8960, further underscores a shift in computing. 
The migration from 2G to 3G continues as well, with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of June, there were approximately 1.4 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago. And Wireless Intelligence predicts that by the fourth quarter of this year, 3G will be contributing greater than 50% of net subscriber addition.
Driven by the increased demand for 3G and data-capable devices, wireless data traffic continues to accelerate. Operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, the number of operators that have commercially launched HSPA+ now totals 136. 39 of these operators have commercially launched Dual-Carrier HSPA+, a 70% increase in the last 3 months. Additionally, there are now 218 operators that are investing in LTE, including 24 networks which have commercially launched. 
According to the CDG, there are currently 7 commercial EV-DO Rev. B networks with an additional 11 operators planning to launch or trial the technology. CDMA device trends are healthy and demand for smartphones remain strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, global smartphone sales exceeded 100 million devices in the first quarter of 2011, representing 85% year-over-year growth. Also, Google recently announced that more than 550,000 Android devices are activated every day, up from 100,000 activations per day in May of last year.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong trends for smartphone adoption. According to Gartner, sales of smartphones in North America are expected to increase by approximately 41% from 2010 to 2011 and smartphone sales are expected to exceed 50% of the total handsets sold this year. In Europe, smartphones continue to expand into more affordable price tiers. Recently in the U.K., the Vodafone smart and the LG ego feature phone were both operated -- both offered at GBP 75 as pay-as-you-go devices, further blurring the lines between the pricing of smart and feature phones.
Additionally, operators such as SFR, Orange and Mobistar in Belgium have each launched bundled data plans in which a second device can be added to an existing data plan as a means of increasing their wireless data subscriber base. We see positive trends in developing regions as well. I attended a CDMA industry summit and handset fair hosted by China Telecom in Guangzhou last month that attracted more than 11,000 attendees. According to press reports from the event, more than 50 EV-DO phones were announced by 20-plus manufacturers. It was also reported that China Telecom highlighted that 3G EV-DO handset sales are expected to reach 29 million units this year, increasing by 190% over 2010. 
In May, China Unicom launched 21 megabit per second HSPA+ service 56 major cities. And in June, according to Sino MR [ph] data, the ZTE Blade, based on our 7,000 series chipset, set a daily sales record by a Chinese OEM and has become the second-highest selling 3G smartphone on Unicom's network. Earlier this week, I attended a China Unicom partner event in which China Unicom announced 15 new 3G devices, of which 13 were based on our chipset.
In India, 3G networks have now been live more than 6 months and operators are making plans to increase 3G coverage from over 100 cities today to over 1,000 towns by the end of the year. 3G devices in India is also expected to meet new levels of affordability with HSPA+ devices, such as the Spice G-6550 being offered at under $90. At the higher end, 21 smartphones have been launched to date based on Snapdragon, including the HTC sensation based on our dual-core solution, so is the first Snapdragon-based tablet in India, the HTC Flyer. 
So to conclude, while we've continued to execute on our strategic priorities, we've seen our opportunities expand at an even greater rate than we have previously expected. And accordingly, we're pleased to be raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the fiscal year driven by strong global smartphone adoption, as well as the addition of Atheros. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf"

Our QCT business executed very well again this quarter. We shipped a record 120 million MSMs above our prior guidance range, reflecting strong demand for our integrated 7xxx and 8xxx series chipsets which were up 32% over last quarter. Our supply chain responded very well to the events in Japan, fulfilling all customer orders during the quarter, including a small amount of unexpected buffer demand, which we forecast will be worked off in the September quarter. 
We also completed our acquisition of Atheros and the integration into QCT is progressing well. The team is executing according to its roadmap having already announced 3 new connectivity products and we are excited to welcome Craig and the entire Atheros team to Qualcomm. 
Our average revenue per MSM in the third fiscal quarter was higher sequentially as expected, reflecting a richer mix of integrated smartphone chipsets, as well as approximately 5 weeks of Atheros revenues post acquisition close. QCT operating margins were in line with expectations. We continue to make significant investments in modem technology, application processing, connectivity, graphics and software. 
Our leadership position in combining these technologies into a platform of integrated tiered chipset solutions is unmatched in our industry and aligns with both industry trends and the business priorities and device requirements of our OEM partners.
We also continue to expand our support of multiple operating systems with the launch of the latest version of webOS, as well as BlackBerry 7. Customer traction for our first dual-core Snapdragon chipsets, the MSM8660 dual-core platform, continues to grow, and there are now more than 100 designs in development based on that platform in addition to 6 smartphones and 4 tablets previously announced or commercially available. 
Dual-core devices this quarter include the HTC Sensation, the HTC EVO 3D, Pantech Vega Racer, T-Mobile myTouch 4G and HP TouchPad. Including both single core and dual-core chipsets, our partners have now announced a total of 10 different Snapdragon-powered tablets and there are another 40 tablet designs in process. Our multimode 3G LTE solutions continue to lead the industry with several USB dongles and mobile router data devices based on our multimode 3G LTE chipsets launching this quarter. The complexity of supporting 2G, 3G and 4G standards across the proliferation of over 40 RF bands also plays well with our system-level approach to integration and we are unique in our ability to support all these requirements.
As Paul mentioned, we sampled the Snapdragon MSM 8960 ahead of schedule this quarter, which is the industry's first multimode 3G LTE dual core chipset for handsets. This is the first of multiple 28-nanometer chipsets on our roadmap and it is designed to integrate seamlessly with our new connectivity solution, the WCN3660, which supports dual band WiFi, Bluetooth and FM and is optimized for smartphone and tablet devices. As we announced at Computex, the MSM 8960 will be the first processor in the Snapdragon family to power devices using Windows 8.
The MSM 8960 and a broad platform of multimode 3G LTE chipsets on our roadmap will greatly expand the reach of LTE and take our high-performance high-efficiency designs to the next wave of smartphones, tablets and upcoming generations of Windows computing devices. 
Demonstrating our potential expanded opportunities that the Atheros acquisition provides, since the deal closed in May, we have launched the industry's first FTC-certified WiFi system and package for microcontroller-based designs to enable machine-to-machine communications and introduced the industry's lowest ePon [ph] solutions for broadband over fiber networks and the power grid. 
We continue to leverage the strong distribution channels and product portfolio that Atheros developed over the past decade. Specific to wireless LAN, the adoption of 11n and across all channels continues with 11n now making up over 70% of this revenue. 
Sales to our PC OEMs increased significantly due to a strong adoption of our combination wireless LAN and Bluetooth products. Overall, we are excited about the platform and the business opportunities in front of us.
This year continues to progress much as we expected back in November. We are modestly increasing our R&D investments in the fiscal fourth quarter to support new process technologies, the commercialization of our expanding multi-core and LTE product offerings and to support multiple new customer opportunities. Our strategic focus on integrated system solutions, leveraging our modem application processor connectivity graphics and software leadership is working well, and we expect to see strong volume growth in the coming quarters. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

Starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we are supplementing our non-GAAP reporting by excluding the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets. 
Fiscal third quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, which was at the high-end of our prior guidance range. Atheros contributed less than $100 million, reflecting approximately 5 weeks activity since the acquisition closed in late May. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.73 for the quarter including approximately $0.50 attributable to Atheros exceeding the high end of our prior guidance range. Our fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.03 better than the $0.70 midpoint of our prior guidance. Both QTL and QCT each added approximately $0.01 per share and investment income in Atheros each contributed approximately $0.50 per share.
We estimate that approximately 170 million to 174 million CDMA-based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average selling price of $209 to $215, up approximately $9 sequentially, primarily due to increasing sales of smartphones. We are seeing handset strength, handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed markets as well as increasing breadth of other connected devices such as tablets and e-readers. Our total cash position remains strong at approximately $20 billion despite using $3.1 billion of net cash to acquire Atheros. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are reaffirming our estimate of between $750 million and $800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011, up approximately 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $204 to $210 per unit. The $207 midpoint is $3 above our prior $204 midpoint estimate, primarily driven by greater adoption of higher-priced devices such as smartphones around the world.
We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, reflecting higher average selling prices for CDMA-based devices and the addition of the Atheros business. We expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.7 billion to $15 billion, up approximately 35% year-over-year at the midpoint, which includes approximately $350 million from Atheros. 
We anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20, up 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $0.09 non-GAAP earnings per share increase over our prior fiscal 2011 guidance range midpoint, approximately $0.06 reflects an improved outlook for QTL. Approximately $0.02 is related to Atheros and approximately $0.01 is the net benefit from greater investment income and modestly greater R&D expense.
We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year. As Steve Mollenkopf mentioned, we expect a modest increase in QCT R&D investment primarily related to new chipset and customer opportunities. 
In QCT, operating margins are largely consistent with our prior expectations. Excluding Atheros, we expect operating margins to be in line with our prior guidance range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. Including Atheros, we expect operating margins to be towards the low end of that range for the fiscal year.
Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues including Atheros to be in the range of approximately $3.86 billion to $4.16 billion, up approximately 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.80, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $38 billion to $41 billion in the September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 9% sequentially and approximately 40% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate shipments of approximately 120 million to 125 million MSM units during the September quarter with revenue per MSM up sequentially driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Atheros revenue and the particular mix of chipset products we expect to ship.
We estimate that the CDMA inventory channel declined a bit in the June quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. For the September quarter, our forecast anticipates an additional small bleed of channel inventory and we continue to estimate that the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at or slightly below the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range. 
We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially, approximately 9%, reflecting Atheros and the increased QCT R&D investments we've previously mentioned.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

That will add approximately $350 million of revenue to this fiscal year, of which a little less than $100 million was from the June quarter. So that's included as you would calculate revenue per MSM. Obviously, revenue per MSM includes a wide variety of different products from QCT already, and so you've got any number of different chipsets. So you could see a little variability in that average. It's an indicator, but it's one people should be cautious on to taking too directly and imputing what that might mean, that being revenue per MSM."

In some cases, it will be used for things like supplemental downlinks so that you use it in conjunction with other FDD systems. But there's pretty clearly going to be a strong demand for TDD capabilities. Obviously, what's going on in China right now, we're still waiting to see and I think we'll wait for some time to see exactly when the government will provide the licenses. But there is work underway, trials going on underway. And obviously, in India, things are going quite well on the LTE TDD side. So I do think that'll be strong. What the mix will be -- it's really going to be driven, I think, mostly by how spectrum allocations get done. For us, we don't really care, actually. We're happy to support both and we have them in the chips. And your question about having multimode support, I think it's going to be very important because most operators are looking to roll out LTE as a supplemental data capacity in urban areas or in hotspots. And then over time, it will roll out more broadly. The other issue is that there's quite a large number of frequency bands that are being spec-ed for LTE, reflecting the fact that it's difficult to find spectrum for governments around the world. So then, you want to have the backwards compatibility to make sure that you have the global room and capability. We will, I think, see some single mode LTE rollout but I think the vast, vast majority of devices are going to be multimode. And therefore having all that capability and there in the single chips going to be very, very important."

We think going out of the fiscal year, we'll just be a nod below that average 15- to 20-week channel inventory level that we've seen for several years. I think it's best to assume that, that channel holds it down at a relatively low level. This has been in line with our forecast all year that the global economy is a bit stronger but it's not certainly not that robust level that I think a lot of vendors are going to want to step up too much on inventory. Frankly, I hope it holds at this level. I hope maybe overall, the channels maybe just got a little more efficient since the 2008, 2009 crisis. But for the time being, I would -- I think it's best to assume that it stays at that lower level. We'll share our updates what we see for fiscal '12 when we're in New York in November."

I think it's a big portion of our business and I think recently here and then with the launch of 3G over the last several years, it's become more of a domestic-produced, domestic-consumed type of product for us, which is very good. We also, over the last year, augmented our product to support I think a different class of customer, a customer that has less R&D in China primarily for the emerging markets as well as China. And we've seen a fair amount of traction in those customer channels primarily coinciding with the advent of mass market smartphone happening with the rollout of 3G in some of these regions. So it's been -- I think it's been a real strong success for us over the last several years and over different types of products and we were pretty bullish about it moving forward."

I'm happy to report that Qualcomm delivered very strong results again this quarter in addition to successfully completing the acquisition of Atheros. Our business performed well across all key guidance metrics. We're off to a strong start with Atheros. 
During this quarter, we sampled our Snapdragon MSM 8960 chipset based on 28-nanometer process technology. The MSM 8960 is a dual-core solution which uses our next-generation micro-architecture called Krait with integrated multimode modem technology, including EV-DO, Dual-Carrier HSPA+ and both the TDD and FDD variances LTE. 
As we've said in the past, only one of our licensees WCDMA subscriber unit royalty obligations would expire, if not extended, prior to late 2017. I'm pleased to report that we have now successfully completed this remaining renewal. The Licensing business continues to be well positioned for strong growth ahead and this latest renewal again demonstrates the established value to the industry of Qualcomm's patented inventions.
In June, we hosted our second annual Uplinq conference here in San Diego. The event was a success as it brought together industry leaders from across the ecosystem, including application developers, operators and device manufacturers. Our support of multiple operating systems is highlighted by keynote presentations delivered by HP, HTC and Nokia. The convergence of the mobile and computing ecosystem is accelerating as smartphones and tablets are becoming full-blown computing devices. Traditional computing device manufacturers are working on mobile devices, and developers are increasing their emphasis on mobile. According to Strategy Analytics, by 2012, the installed base of smartphones is estimated to exceed the installed base of PCs. Our collaboration with Microsoft to enable Windows 8 to run on our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including MSM 8960, further underscores a shift in computing. 
The migration from 2G to 3G continues as well, with Wireless Intelligence reporting that at the end of June, there were approximately 1.4 billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago. And Wireless Intelligence predicts that by the fourth quarter of this year, 3G will be contributing greater than 50% of net subscriber addition.
Driven by the increased demand for 3G and data-capable devices, wireless data traffic continues to accelerate. Operators continue to make network investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According to the GSA, the number of operators that have commercially launched HSPA+ now totals 136. 39 of these operators have commercially launched Dual-Carrier HSPA+, a 70% increase in the last 3 months. Additionally, there are now 218 operators that are investing in LTE, including 24 networks which have commercially launched. 
According to the CDG, there are currently 7 commercial EV-DO Rev. B networks with an additional 11 operators planning to launch or trial the technology. CDMA device trends are healthy and demand for smartphones remain strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to Gartner, global smartphone sales exceeded 100 million devices in the first quarter of 2011, representing 85% year-over-year growth. Also, Google recently announced that more than 550,000 Android devices are activated every day, up from 100,000 activations per day in May of last year.
In developed regions, we continue to see strong trends for smartphone adoption. According to Gartner, sales of smartphones in North America are expected to increase by approximately 41% from 2010 to 2011 and smartphone sales are expected to exceed 50% of the total handsets sold this year. In Europe, smartphones continue to expand into more affordable price tiers. Recently in the U.K., the Vodafone smart and the LG ego feature phone were both operated -- both offered at GBP 75 as pay-as-you-go devices, further blurring the lines between the pricing of smart and feature phones.
Additionally, operators such as SFR, Orange and Mobistar in Belgium have each launched bundled data plans in which a second device can be added to an existing data plan as a means of increasing their wireless data subscriber base. We see positive trends in developing regions as well. I attended a CDMA industry summit and handset fair hosted by China Telecom in Guangzhou last month that attracted more than 11,000 attendees. According to press reports from the event, more than 50 EV-DO phones were announced by 20-plus manufacturers. It was also reported that China Telecom highlighted that 3G EV-DO handset sales are expected to reach 29 million units this year, increasing by 190% over 2010. 
In May, China Unicom launched 21 megabit per second HSPA+ service 56 major cities. And in June, according to Sino MR [ph] data, the ZTE Blade, based on our 7,000 series chipset, set a daily sales record by a Chinese OEM and has become the second-highest selling 3G smartphone on Unicom's network. Earlier this week, I attended a China Unicom partner event in which China Unicom announced 15 new 3G devices, of which 13 were based on our chipset.
In India, 3G networks have now been live more than 6 months and operators are making plans to increase 3G coverage from over 100 cities today to over 1,000 towns by the end of the year. 3G devices in India is also expected to meet new levels of affordability with HSPA+ devices, such as the Spice G-6550 being offered at under $90. At the higher end, 21 smartphones have been launched to date based on Snapdragon, including the HTC sensation based on our dual-core solution, so is the first Snapdragon-based tablet in India, the HTC Flyer. 
So to conclude, while we've continued to execute on our strategic priorities, we've seen our opportunities expand at an even greater rate than we have previously expected. And accordingly, we're pleased to be raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the fiscal year driven by strong global smartphone adoption, as well as the addition of Atheros. 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf"

Our QCT business executed very well again this quarter. We shipped a record 120 million MSMs above our prior guidance range, reflecting strong demand for our integrated 7xxx and 8xxx series chipsets which were up 32% over last quarter. Our supply chain responded very well to the events in Japan, fulfilling all customer orders during the quarter, including a small amount of unexpected buffer demand, which we forecast will be worked off in the September quarter. 
We also completed our acquisition of Atheros and the integration into QCT is progressing well. The team is executing according to its roadmap having already announced 3 new connectivity products and we are excited to welcome Craig and the entire Atheros team to Qualcomm. 
Our average revenue per MSM in the third fiscal quarter was higher sequentially as expected, reflecting a richer mix of integrated smartphone chipsets, as well as approximately 5 weeks of Atheros revenues post acquisition close. QCT operating margins were in line with expectations. We continue to make significant investments in modem technology, application processing, connectivity, graphics and software. 
Our leadership position in combining these technologies into a platform of integrated tiered chipset solutions is unmatched in our industry and aligns with both industry trends and the business priorities and device requirements of our OEM partners.
We also continue to expand our support of multiple operating systems with the launch of the latest version of webOS, as well as BlackBerry 7. Customer traction for our first dual-core Snapdragon chipsets, the MSM8660 dual-core platform, continues to grow, and there are now more than 100 designs in development based on that platform in addition to 6 smartphones and 4 tablets previously announced or commercially available. 
Dual-core devices this quarter include the HTC Sensation, the HTC EVO 3D, Pantech Vega Racer, T-Mobile myTouch 4G and HP TouchPad. Including both single core and dual-core chipsets, our partners have now announced a total of 10 different Snapdragon-powered tablets and there are another 40 tablet designs in process. Our multimode 3G LTE solutions continue to lead the industry with several USB dongles and mobile router data devices based on our multimode 3G LTE chipsets launching this quarter. The complexity of supporting 2G, 3G and 4G standards across the proliferation of over 40 RF bands also plays well with our system-level approach to integration and we are unique in our ability to support all these requirements.
As Paul mentioned, we sampled the Snapdragon MSM 8960 ahead of schedule this quarter, which is the industry's first multimode 3G LTE dual core chipset for handsets. This is the first of multiple 28-nanometer chipsets on our roadmap and it is designed to integrate seamlessly with our new connectivity solution, the WCN3660, which supports dual band WiFi, Bluetooth and FM and is optimized for smartphone and tablet devices. As we announced at Computex, the MSM 8960 will be the first processor in the Snapdragon family to power devices using Windows 8.
The MSM 8960 and a broad platform of multimode 3G LTE chipsets on our roadmap will greatly expand the reach of LTE and take our high-performance high-efficiency designs to the next wave of smartphones, tablets and upcoming generations of Windows computing devices. 
Demonstrating our potential expanded opportunities that the Atheros acquisition provides, since the deal closed in May, we have launched the industry's first FTC-certified WiFi system and package for microcontroller-based designs to enable machine-to-machine communications and introduced the industry's lowest EPON solutions for broadband over fiber networks and the power grid. 
We continue to leverage the strong distribution channels and product portfolio that Atheros developed over the past decade. Specific to wireless LAN, the adoption of 11n and across all channels continues with 11n now making up over 70% of this revenue. 
Sales to our PC OEMs increased significantly due to a strong adoption of our combination wireless LAN and Bluetooth products. Overall, we are excited about the platform and the business opportunities in front of us.
This year continues to progress much as we expected back in November. We are modestly increasing our R&D investments in the fiscal fourth quarter to support new process technologies, the commercialization of our expanding multi-core and LTE product offerings and to support multiple new customer opportunities. Our strategic focus on integrated system solutions, leveraging our modem application processor connectivity graphics and software leadership is working well, and we expect to see strong volume growth in the coming quarters. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876095,143804,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

Given the size of the Atheros tr",808,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. 
Given the size of the Atheros transaction and consistent with prevailing tech industry practice, we modified our non-GAAP reporting methodology. Starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we are supplementing our non-GAAP reporting by excluding the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets. 
Fiscal third quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, which was at the high-end of our prior guidance range. Atheros contributed less than $100 million, reflecting approximately 5 weeks activity since the acquisition closed in late May. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.73 for the quarter including approximately $0.50 attributable to Atheros exceeding the high end of our prior guidance range. Our fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.03 better than the $0.70 midpoint of our prior guidance. Both QTL and QCT each added approximately $0.01 per share and investment income in Atheros each contributed approximately $0.50 per share.
We estimate that approximately 170 million to 174 million CDMA-based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average selling price of $209 to $215, up approximately $9 sequentially, primarily due to increasing sales of smartphones. We are seeing handset strength, handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed markets as well as increasing breadth of other connected devices such as tablets and e-readers. Our total cash position remains strong at approximately $20 billion despite using $3.1 billion of net cash to acquire Atheros. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are reaffirming our estimate of between $750 million and $800 million CDMA-based device shipments in calendar 2011, up approximately 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2011 will be approximately $204 to $210 per unit. The $207 midpoint is $3 above our prior $204 midpoint estimate, primarily driven by greater adoption of higher-priced devices such as smartphones around the world.
We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, reflecting higher average selling prices for CDMA-based devices and the addition of the Atheros business. We expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately $14.7 billion to $15 billion, up approximately 35% year-over-year at the midpoint, which includes approximately $350 million from Atheros. 
We anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20, up 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. Of the approximate $0.09 non-GAAP earnings per share increase over our prior fiscal 2011 guidance range midpoint, approximately $0.06 reflects an improved outlook for QTL. Approximately $0.02 is related to Atheros and approximately $0.01 is the net benefit from greater investment income and modestly greater R&D expense.
We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year. As Steve Mollenkopf mentioned, we expect a modest increase in QCT R&D investment primarily related to new chipset and customer opportunities. 
In QCT, operating margins are largely consistent with our prior expectations. Excluding Atheros, we expect operating margins to be in line with our prior guidance range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. Including Atheros, we expect operating margins to be towards the low end of that range for the fiscal year.
Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues including Atheros to be in the range of approximately $3.86 billion to $4.16 billion, up approximately 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.80, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $38 billion to $41 billion in the September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 9% sequentially and approximately 40% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate shipments of approximately 120 million to 125 million MSM units during the September quarter with revenue per MSM up sequentially driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Atheros revenue and the particular mix of chipset products we expect to ship.
We estimate that the CDMA inventory channel declined a bit in the June quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. For the September quarter, our forecast anticipates an additional small bleed of channel inventory and we continue to estimate that the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at or slightly below the low end of the historical 15- to 20-week range. 
We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially, approximately 9%, reflecting Atheros and the increased QCT R&D investments we've previously mentioned.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

In some cases, it will be used for things like supplemental downlinks so that you use it in conjunction with other FDD systems. But there's pretty clearly going to be a strong demand for TDD capabilities. Obviously, what's going on in China right now, we're still waiting to see and I think we'll wait for some time to see exactly when the government will provide the licenses. But there is work underway, trials going on underway. And obviously, in India, things are going quite well on the LTE TDD side. So I do think that'll be strong. What the mix will be -- it's really going to be driven, I think, mostly by how spectrum allocations get done. For us, we don't really care, actually. We're happy to support both and we have them in the chips. And your question about having multimode support, I think it's going to be very important because most operators are looking to roll out LTE as a supplemental data capacity in urban areas or in hotspots. And then over time, it will roll out more broadly. The other issue is that there's quite a large number of frequency bands that are being spec-ed for LTE, reflecting the fact that it's difficult to find spectrum for governments around the world. So then, you want to have the backwards compatibility to make sure that you have the global room and capability. We will, I think, see some single mode LTE rollout but I think the vast, vast majority of devices are going to be multimode. And therefore having all that capability and there in the single chips going to be very, very important."

Let me try and give you a little more color around your question. For this year, this calendar year, if you look on our website, you'll see a little more detail of what we're seeing by region. We called up a category that we've been identifying for WCDMA Asia, called up pretty substantially. We're seeing really good strength in China and then across Southeast Asia, Middle East Africa. China, the strength is with 3G, and Southeast Asia, Middle East Africa, we're seeing a GSM migration to 3G pick up pace. Although we're seeing that uplift there, we soften a bit our forecast for WCDMA Europe, I think the economic troubles there are holding back the consumer a bit. And then, it's similar for India. We softened that a bit. But in total, we're holding that. So it gives you a little bit more color maybe by region of what we're seeing happening. On the modules and data devices, that continues at a strong pace. We're seeing embedded being a little bit stronger than the dongles themselves. So but overall -- e-books as well coming on strong. So overall, we think the market there is pretty strong. There are a number of -- a pretty wide number of product launches that are scheduled for later this quarter, early in what would be our first fiscal quarter.

So I want to make sure that we're still -- or just understand that the trajectory of that is going forward.

And then secondly, I wanted to kind of follow up on the last question as it relates to competition.

The combination of those has led us to a lower op margin than what we've historically seen. As we said in New York back in November, we are targeting to improve that operating margin in the out years. We'll give a refresher on that at New York, but I don't think you're going to see much of a different outlook going forward that we do expect in the out years to be improving that operating margin for QCT."

At the outset of the year, we established a plan to expand our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses, and that's exactly what we've done. Our revenues grew to a record $15 b",989,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. At the outset of the year, we established a plan to expand our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses, and that's exactly what we've done. 
Our revenues grew to a record $15 billion in fiscal 2011, and we delivered record earnings in MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, we expect strong revenue and earnings growth again in fiscal 2012. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments despite the macroeconomic slowdown. Smartphones will lead the way, along with the continued mobile adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. 
A number highlights this year. We had strong growth in our Licensing business both record revenues and earnings. We successfully resolved 2 licensee disputes and completing the last of the WCDMA subscriber unit renewals we highlighted some years ago. We now have over 200 royalty bearing 3G licenses and 13 single-mode OFDM licensees around the world. 
During fiscal 2011, we also continue to expand our licensee base in China, adding more than 20 new Chinese licensees. Through our Licensing program, we continue to foster innovation and support the ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide, and QCT continue to execute well. We believe our Snapdragon family of chipsets has established the industry standard in mobile, allowing us to expand our partnerships with several of customers. We've sampled the industry's first integrated application processor and multi-mode LTE platform for handsets. The breadth and depth of our product portfolio is unparalleled, and we believe that our WCDMA chipset volumes are growing faster than the competition.
We completed our largest acquisition to date with the addition of Atheros. The integration process has gone very well, and we're starting to see that progress on our combined road map and expanded channel opportunities. In India, we work hard to ensure LTE TDD was adopted, and we're pleased to see the initial buildout contracts being awarded. And according to GSA, there 2 commercial LTE TDD networks in Saudi Arabia with an additional 27 operators, making LTE TDD network investments around the world. 
We've collaborated with several OEMs on the launch of multi-mode 3G LTE TDD devices, demonstrating the ecosystem's readiness for deployment. QIS successfully launched the QChat push to talk platform with both Sprint and Nextel International with handsets provided by multiple OEM partners. With respect to Mirasol, we continue to work with partners on low volume projects as we await the completion of our new fab. And as planned, we have executed on our restructuring plan for FLO TV and have agreed to sell the related spectrum to AT&T, and we believe that regulatory approval should be granted as expeditiously as possible as our proposed spectrum sale furthers many of the key policy goals that the SEC is actively promoting. 
Specifically, the deal will ensure that our unpaired spectrum is put to its highest and best use as soon as possible, putting up much needed spectrum for mobile broadband just as the SEC is striving to address the spectrum crunch that we're all facing, and then will result in the world's first deployment of supplemental technology, thereby promoting mobile innovation. 
Furthermore, there is going to be significant tax revenue generated for the government once that transaction closes. So overall, we delivered very strong earnings and operating cash flow growth in fiscal 2011. We increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividend. And we ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including approximately $21 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to calendar 2012. We expect CDMA-based device shipments to grow approximately 16% year-over-year based on the 900 million unit midpoint of our forecast. And when we look at our business, we see 5 key drivers for growth. First is the continued mass adoption of smartphones. According to Gartner, global smartphone shipments reached 108 million units in the second quarter of 2011, representing a 74% year-over-year increase and are expected to surpass 1 billion units annually by 2015. Second is the growth of 3G in emerging region. According to Wireless Intelligence, approximately 67 million 3G connections were added in emerging regions this past quarter, representing a 38% year-over-year increase, and greater than 1.5 billion new 3G connections are expected to be added in these regions through the end of 2015. 
A third catalyst is the opportunity for mobile computing and the expansion of 3G connectivity in the device types beyond the handset. Microsoft's demonstration of Windows 8 on Snapdragon at a recent developer conference underscores this shift in the computing landscape. Further, as an indication of this trend, AT&T recently reported that nearly half their third quarter net wireless additions came from devices other than handsets. 
The fourth key driver is the continued deployment of advanced network technologies to handle the accelerating demand for data. According to the GSA, there are now 152 HSPA+ and 35 LTE commercial networks throughout the globe. According to CDG, there are also 129 EBD EV-DO Rev. A and 10 Rev. B networks. 
And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as a growth driver of our business. We believe in Internet of everything where we'll be surrounded by an increasing number of connected devices and the combination of Atheros with QCT position us well for that opportunity. We'll explore these key drivers in more details in our upcoming New York Analyst Day, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
To wrap up, we've completed another outstanding year at Qualcomm, and I would, once again, like to thank all of our employees and partners for their ingenuity, effort and support. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook for continued strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President and COO-elect, Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business delivered strong results again this year, reflecting increased demand across our broad product portfolio, particularly for smartphone chipsets. 
We had another record year, shipping approximately 483 million MSMs, up 21% year-over-year. We just completed our highest volume quarter in history with approximately 127 million MSM shipped. We are extremely pleased to have completed the Atheros acquisition and are off to strong start in providing our customers best-in-class connectivity and networking solutions, expanding our business beyond Mobile into consumer electronics, computing and networking. 
We also made a number of other targeted acquisitions that added to our technology portfolio to enable new opportunities. Our integration strategy continues to win in mobile wireless and is a clear driver of our strong results. Shipments of our integrated Snapdragon chipsets grew more than 4x this year. The cost, size and performance advantages of our integrated approach position us to grow faster than our competitors. We expect the demand for integrated chipsets to increase at both high end and mass market smartphone sales growth, particularly in developing regions. 
We have worked hard to extend our customer footprint, and you can see the results in the marketplace. Nokia just launched their first Windows Phone 7 Devices based on our silicon. The BlackBerry 7 base launches used our products globally, and we have grown and diversified our OEM partnerships in China. Our extensive tier chipset products are clearly aligned with the needs of device OEMs, and we are now providing solutions to all the leading device manufacturers in our industry. 
There are now more than 300 Snapdragon-based devices announced and more than 350 additional devices in development. New Snapdragon-based devices launched this quarter include the HTC Jetstream LTE tablet for AT&T, the BlackBerry Torch 9850 and the Samsung GALAXY SII for T-Mobile USA and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 LTE for NTT DOCOMO. We have made tremendous progress with the move to 28-nanometer, and the Snapdragon MSM 8960 is seeing very strong design activity across our customer base. 
LTE is increasingly becoming a design requirement, and our time-to-market advantage with integrated LTE multi-mode in the MSM 8960 is valued by our customers. In addition, the global connectivity in the 8960, we continue to lead and computing and graphics with our new Krait CPU micro architecture and next-generation graphic system. The Qualcomm Atheros team is also executing well with quarter-over-quarter growth across all channels and geographic regions as wireless attach rates continue to increase in consumer electronics and QTAs comprehensive networking platforms consisting of WiFi, plc and ethernet drive greater value. 
We continue to invest in the Windows computing platform and associated ecosystem to address the device categories beyond traditional cellular. Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 running on Snapdragon at their BUILD conference and highlighted how our mobile architecture enables a feature called connected standby. This feature enables a Windows 8 PC to run on low-power mode and remain connected to the network and always up to the date, much like smartphones do today. This underscores the advantages our mobile architecture does in bringing the computing realm and demonstrate the natural advantages of a Snapdragon-based solution. We expect Windows 8 to be a significant opportunity for us beyond this fiscal year. 
As we move forward, we continue to expect our operating margins to reflect the growing mix of mass-market smartphones, continued investment in mobile computing and the full year effect of the acquisitions we made this year. Even with this, we are expecting fiscal 2012 revenue and operating income to grow at a rate in excess of CDMA device growth. Further, we are expecting to get off to a strong start with MSM shipments estimated to be between 146 million and 154 million units in the first fiscal quarter. 
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed very well in fiscal 2011 and continue to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow and to lead the transition to smartphones across all tiers in regions, as well as the growth of mobile computing. 
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

Non-GAA",1142,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial results to report to you again today. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record $4.1 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income grew 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, up 18% year-over-year.
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues reached a new record, growing 39% year-over-year on the strength of record MSM shipments, reflecting strong demand for our integrated Snapdragon chipsets for the growing smartphone segment, as well as a full quarter of Atheros revenues. QTL revenues grew 48% year-over-year, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $39.1 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, up 38% year-over-year driven by strength in both emerging and developed regions.
We estimate that approximately 187 million to 191 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $204 to $210. We continue to sea handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed regions, as well as increasing breadth of connected devices. We paid $361 million in cash dividends this quarter. And in response to the volatility and decline in global stock markets, we engaged in $827 million of activity related to our stock repurchase program. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 and to date through fiscal 2012, we have repurchased $241 million of our common stock and sold 3 put options that will expire at different times in the latter half of fiscal 2012 when we expect to have higher domestic cash balances.
If these puts are exercised, we will repurchase approximately $511 million of our common stock, net of option premiums, at an average net price of $43.30 per share. Whether or not the puts are exercised, we will retain $75 million of cash premiums and therefore, believe our stockholders will benefit in either case.
Turning to our results for the full fiscal 2011 year. Revenues were a record $15 billion, up 36% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution by our QTL and QCT businesses and continued smartphone adoption and 2G to 3G migration. GAAP earnings were a record $2.52 per share, up 29% year-over-year. Record non-GAAP operating income was more than $6 billion, up 41% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.20, up 30% year-over-year.
QCT's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record and grew 32% year-over-year with an operating margin of 23%, consistent with our original guidance range at the outset of the fiscal year. QCT's operating income grew 21% year-over-year. QTL's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record, up 48% year-over-year, and the operating margin improved to 88% of revenue. We estimate that the fiscal 2011 device average selling price as reported by our licensees was approximately $203 to $209, above our initial expectations at the outset of this year, reflecting strong adoption of smartphones around the globe.
We are reaffirming our 775 million unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA-based device shipments, up approximately 18% year-over-year. Now turning to next year. We've incorporated in our forecast the most recent consensus worldwide economic forecast, which takes into account the serious concerns for Europe and very low GDP growth in the U.S. We estimate calendar 2012 CDMA-based device shipments will grow approximately 12% to 21% year-over-year. We anticipate fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of approximately $18 billion to $19 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion, an increase of approximately 14% at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.62, an increase of approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We expect that the acquisitions that Steve just mentioned will be modestly dilutive to fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share, and this has been included in our guidance. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our cash and marketable securities portfolio unless such gains or losses are reasonably certain, which, in turn, impacts the year-over-year earnings per share growth comparison.
We expect QTL operating margins to be in the range of 86% to 88% for fiscal 2012. For the QCT segment, as Steve mentioned, we expect strong year-over-year growth in revenue and operating income, leveraging the fiscal 2011 strategy, which we think has been successfully executed. We expect QCT operating margins to be approximately 20% to 22% for fiscal 2012. We estimate that the fiscal 2012 device ASP reported to us by our licensees for the QTL business will be approximately $197 to $209, reflecting continued option of smartphones at multiple tiers around the globe, and a greater percentage of total device volume coming from lower-priced regions such as China and India. 
We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 15% year-over-year plus or minus a couple of points and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense and a full year of Atheros. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 18% to 19% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We estimate revenues to be approximately $4.35 billion to $4.75 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal first quarter non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $1.67 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate the non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.86 to $0.92, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 146 million to 154 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter, reflecting strong sequential growth and successful execution on QCT strategy. We expect total reported device sales of approximately $37.5 billion to $41.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting strong handset volume growth expected in emerging and developed regions, as well as increased non-handset device shipments. 
We expect the small build in the CDMA channel inventory in the December quarter, as is typical for the holiday season, and we estimate the CDMA inventory channel will remain at the low end of the historic 15- to 20-week band throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. We expect a modest sequential increase in non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the first fiscal quarter to be approximately 18% to 19%. 
We look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 16, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2012 guidance. In the meantime, the Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes a thorough slide presentation on the data points included on today's call. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

Specific to our fiscal Q1 guidance relative to the fiscal Q4, if you recall, the QTL revenues are recorded one quarter in arrears. And so what we'll report in our fiscal Q1 will be shipments for fiscal Q4. Fiscal Q4, we don't think had a significant growth over fiscal Q3 in the market whereas for the market as a whole, we are seeing strong growth in this first fiscal quarter, which QTL we expect will reflect next quarter."

But if you can give us a sense as to what's in the 350. My other question for Bill was on the QCT margin. In next year, I think you guided to 20% to 22% for the year. It looks like that you didn't guide fiscal Q1. It looks like we're going to start the year somewhat on the hotter side of that. I would imagine 22% or higher in fiscal Q1. And with the 8960 coming in the back half of the fiscal year, I've always thought that to be a higher operating margin product. So I'm just wondering how do we get into the 20% to 22% range?

You're seeing a lot of designing activity in those mass-market areas. We're also starting to see I think more penetration of LTE and the leading AP processor going together. I think we talked a little bit about this throughout the year in 2011 how we thought the second half of 2011 calendar would include products that had both high-performing application processor coming alongside with the LTE chipset as well again, multi-mode LTE chipset. And we're seeing that play out. It's a good on-ramp I think into the 8960. So it's very, very mixed. And I think it reflects the market outlook if you look at the mix of Snapdragon products.

On your point on the margin guidance and EPS, I mean, I think we're a bit higher. Our EPS midpoint anyway is a bit higher than where the street average was. I don't know how much was being imputed in for these acquisitions we completed in just in the fiscal fourth quarter, which degraded that by a bit. But beyond that, as I did say on my opening comments, we do expect QCT operating margins to be in the range of 20% to 22%, which to put a little perspective to it, you do get a full year Atheros in here and Atheros operating margin operated a few hundred basis points below what we typically operated that. So number one. Number two, I'm already getting into a bit of what we're going to share in New York, but I'll just touch on it. The operating expenses growth that we expect for fiscal '12 will be heavily weighted towards QCT again. So that's putting a little pressure on the operating margin as well.

This is Bill. My first thought is that it mirrors much of what we commented earlier on with respect to QTL ASPs that we're expecting much faster growth in the emerging world relative to the developed world, and the emerging world typically is a bit lower solutions than what we see in developed world. But similarly with the Licensing business, where we're seeing -- we think we'll continue to see a strong acceleration in smartphones penetration. That is playing pretty well I think into our capabilities and our strategy on the QCT side. But I would say it's more developed versus emerging. That would be the key theme there."

But anyways, I will look back and say that we're successful if we see a strong launch and adoption of ARM-based devices, significant number of application developers, both on new type of applications and reporting applications and also that we get stronger adoption of mobile broadband into those devices. In terms of numbers, you can look at the size of shipments of laptops. You won't see us driving into things like workstations high-performance computing. There are companies that are talking about servers based on ARM. That's not our initial targets. So I think that you see really kind of the market of tablets, clamshells and convertible devices and really focus in on lightweight, long battery life, instant on, always on. We've done some really interesting demonstrations about how Microsoft's been able to turn off a lot of the parts of the system and really drive the power consumption down and yet have it turn on real quickly. So having all of those kinds of functionality come to market I think that will be really a good definition of success. And then as time goes on, we will see how much of that market we're able to take.

We've found over the years a pretty good correlation between GDP growth in a region and the rate at which new wireless devices are bought by the end consumer. So we've successfully used that correlation in our forecasting. We're continuing to use that correlation. I expect -- I don't see major reason that would suddenly change. Then what helps Qualcomm is this continuing migration from 2G to 3G. So although we see a fairly lackluster world economy next year, we expect 3G will do a bit other than mobile devices as a whole because of the 2G to 3G transition. And then thirdly, the specifics we have seen, how we adjust our forecast, we typically see in a lower GDP growth environment is that replacement rate consumers tend to hold on to their devices a little bit longer. So we've incorporated a little lower replacement rate forecast than what we otherwise would have done. And then also just the new device volume gets impacted as well. So that's kind of how we work through our forecast on that macro. It really leverages from this correlation we found between total mobile devices and GDP growth region by region. On Mirasol, we did give an indication of the outset of 2011 that we expected I think it was, if I remember correctly, we said about a $225 million operating loss. I expect we'll update that in New York, and at this point, but with the business progressing, the R&D continuing and starting to bring more fat capacity online, we have a larger operating loss built into our guidance. So we will share more color on that in New York."

With respect to your question on the standalone apps processor. Yes, we do have a standalone AP product, and we really did that because we had customers asking us for it, which I think is a great statement about the quality of the product. But by and large, the majority of the customer requests have been to have the integrated product. And I think there are 2 dynamics which are pulling that through. The first one is at the high end, the high end application processor tends to travel with the leading edge modem, and we deliver those products together, and I think it's a very competitive offering. You see that in the 8960, but you've also seen that in our Fusion product line where we have really made it very easy for the OEMs to integrate together the LTE product and the dual-core application processor. Now in the low tier, it tends to be that cost is a big driver. So integration tends to rule the day there. And so the majority of our shipments there tend to be in the integrated fashion, but we'll do whatever the market asks us to do in this case."

I guess just what surprises me a little bit is that compared to previous downturns, handset demand has only got impact quite quickly. I don't think we've seen that third quarter there's also handset vendors have actually reported. All what they're talking about for Q4, in fact, if you aggregate the top 7 or 8 vendors. So if it hasn't come through now, what makes you think you may come through not just good old-fashioned Qualcomm conservatism. And then the other thing about the 16% growth I would have thought in their you would have also a tablet growth. And the tablet market depending on whose estimates you look at is very immature could almost double next year. So that means that the underlying handset growth rate in your estimate is probably even lower than 16%.

On your point about the overall forecast, I'll just put an overall perspective to it to begin with. First of all, I mean, for this year, I think the midpoint of our estimates all year has been 775 million units, and we'll see. But all data points, at this point, suggest that that's going to be pretty close to the actual. Last year, I think our total markets estimate was off low single digit relative to what we started our guidance with. The year before, 2009, a very difficult environment for anybody to forecast in. I believe we were still single digit within our forecast actual. It was higher single digits but nonetheless, so overall, I feel pretty good about the teams that put a lot of effort into the forecasting of that. I think we've done pretty good. But obviously, we have to stay very focused going forward. Then on the market, recall that not all OEMs report or report in the same breakout as compared to what we get. And the OEM base and licensee base, for that matter, too has grown substantially here even in this last year, particularly in the last couple of years. So there's -- I think we get a little bit better visibility than what many others can get as to what's actually happening and that I think helps us on the forward outlook."

At the outset of the year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done. Our revenues grew to a record $15 billi",984,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. At the outset of the year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done. 
Our revenues grew to a record $15 billion in fiscal 2011, and we delivered record earnings and MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, we expect strong revenue and earnings growth again in fiscal 2012. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments despite the macroeconomic slowdown. Smartphones will lead the way, along with the continued global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. 
We had a number highlights this year. We had strong growth in our Licensing business, delivering both record revenues and earnings. We've successfully resolved 2 licensee disputes and completed the last of the WCDMA subscriber unit renewals we highlighted some years ago. We now have over 200 royalty-bearing 3G licenses and 13 single-mode OFDM licensees around the world. 
During fiscal 2011, we also continued to expand our licensee base in China, adding more than 20 new Chinese licensees. Through our licensing program, we continue to foster innovation and support the ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide. 
And QCT continued to execute well. We believe our Snapdragon family of chipsets has established the industry standard in mobile, allowing us to expand our partnerships with several new customers. We've sampled the industry's first integrated application processor and multimode LTE platform for handsets. The breadth and depth of our product portfolio is unparalleled, and we believe that our WCDMA chipset volumes are growing faster than the competition.
We completed our largest acquisition to date with the addition of Atheros. The integration process has gone very well, and we're starting to see good progress on our combined road map and expanded channel opportunities. 
In India, we worked hard to ensure LTE TDD was adopted, and we're pleased to see the initial build out contracts being awarded. And according to GSA, there are 2 commercial LTE TDD networks in Saudi Arabia with an additional 27 operators making LTE TDD network investments around the world. We've collaborated with several OEMs on the launch of multimode 3G LTE TDD devices, demonstrating the ecosystem's readiness for deployment. 
QIS successfully launched the QChat push-to-talk platform with both Sprint and Nextel International with handsets provided by multiple OEM partners. With respect to mirasol, we continue to work with partners on low-volume projects as we await the completion of our new fab. 
And as planned, we have executed on our restructuring plan for FLO TV and have agreed to sell the related spectrum to AT&T. And we believe that regulatory approval should be granted as expeditiously as possible as our proposed spectrum sale furthers many of the key policy goals that the SEC is actively promoting. 
Specifically, the deal will ensure that our unpaired spectrum is put to its highest and best use as soon as possible, putting up much needed spectrum for mobile broadband just as the SEC is striving to address the spectrum crunch that we're all facing and will result in the world's first deployment of supplemental downlink technology, thereby promoting mobile innovation. Furthermore, there is going to be significant tax revenue generated for the government once that transaction closes. 
So overall, we delivered very strong earnings and operating cash flow growth in fiscal 2011. We increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including approximately $21 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to calendar 2012. We expect CDMA-based device shipments to grow approximately 16% year-over-year based on the 900 million-unit midpoint of our forecast. And when we look at our business, we see 5 key drivers for growth. 
First is the continued mass adoption of smartphones. According to Gartner, global smartphone shipments reached 108 million units in the second quarter of 2011, representing a 74% year-over-year increase and are expected to surpass 1 billion units annually by 2015. 
Second is the growth of 3G in emerging regions. According to Wireless Intelligence, approximately 67 million 3G connections were added in emerging regions this past quarter, representing a 38% year-over-year increase, and greater than 1.5 billion new 3G connections are expected to be added in these regions through the end of 2015. 
A third catalyst is the opportunity for mobile computing and the expansion of 3G connectivity into device types beyond the handset. Microsoft's demonstration of Windows 8 on Snapdragon at their recent developer conference underscores this shift in the computing landscape. Further, as an indication of this trend, AT&T recently reported that nearly half their third quarter net wireless additions came from devices other than handsets. 
The fourth key driver is the continued deployment of advanced network technologies to handle the accelerating demand for data. According to the GSA, there are now 152 HSPA+ and 35 LTE commercial networks throughout the globe. According to CDG, there are also 129 EV-DO Rev. A and 10 Rev. B networks. 
And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as a growth driver for our business. We believe in an Internet of everything where we'll be surrounded by an increasing number of connected devices, and the combination of Atheros with QCT positioned us well for that opportunity. We'll explore these key drivers in more detail during our upcoming New York Analyst Day, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
To wrap up, we've completed another outstanding year at Qualcomm and once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their ingenuity, effort and support. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook for continued strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President and COO-elect, Steve Mollenkopf."

The cost, size and performance advantages of our integrated approach position us to grow faster than our competitors. We expect the demand for integrated chipsets to increase at both high end and mass market smartphone sales growth, particularly in developing regions. 
We have worked hard to extend our customer footprint, and you can see the results in the marketplace. Nokia just launched their first Windows Phone 7 devices based on our silicon. The BlackBerry 7 base launches use our products globally, and we have grown and diversified our OEM partnerships in China. Our extensive tier chipset products are clearly aligned with the needs of device OEMs, and we are now providing solutions to all the leading device manufacturers in our industry. 
There are now more than 300 Snapdragon-based devices announced and more than 350 additional devices in development. New Snapdragon-based devices launched this quarter include the HTC Jetstream LTE tablet for AT&T, the BlackBerry Torch 9850 and the Samsung GALAXY S II for T-Mobile USA and the Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1 LTE for NTT DOCOMO. We have made tremendous progress with the move to 28-nanometer, and the Snapdragon MSM8960 is seeing very strong design activity across our customer base. 
LTE is increasingly becoming a design requirement, and our time-to-market advantage with integrated LTE multimode in the MSM8960 is valued by our customers. In addition to global connectivity in the 8960, we continue to lead in computing and graphics with our new Krait CPU micro-architecture and next-generation Endrino [ph] graphics system. The Qualcomm Atheros team is also executing well with quarter-over-quarter growth across all channels and geographic regions as wireless attach rates continue to increase in consumer electronics and QCA's  comprehensive networking platforms, consisting of WiFi, PLC and ethernet, drive greater value. 
We continue to invest in the Windows computing platform and associated ecosystem to address new device categories beyond traditional cellular. Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 running on Snapdragon at their BUILD conference and highlighted how our mobile architecture enables a feature called connected standby. This feature enables a Windows 8 PC to run on low-power mode and remain connected to the network and always up to the date, much like smartphones do today. This underscores the advantages our mobile architecture does in bringing the computing realm and demonstrates the natural advantages of a Snapdragon-based solution. We expect Windows 8 to be a significant opportunity for us beyond this fiscal year. 
As we move forward, we continue to expect our operating margins to reflect the growing mix of mass-market smartphones, continued investment in mobile computing and the full year effect of the acquisitions we made this year. Even with this, we are expecting fiscal 2012 revenue and operating income to grow at a rate in excess of CDMA device growth. Further, we are expecting to get off to a strong start with MSM shipments estimated to be between 146 and 154 million units in the first fiscal quarter. 
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed very well in fiscal 2011 and continue to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow and to lead the transition to smartphones across all tiers and regions, as well as the growth of mobile computing. 
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

We have strong financial results to report to you again today. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record $4.1 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income grew 44% year-over-year. Non-GAA",1140,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial results to report to you again today. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record $4.1 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income grew 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, up 18% year-over-year.
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues reached a new record, growing 39% year-over-year on the strength of record MSM shipments, reflecting strong demand for our integrated Snapdragon chipsets for the growing smartphone segment, as well as a full quarter of Atheros revenues. 
QTL revenues grew 48% year-over-year, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $39.1 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, up 38% year-over-year driven by strength in both emerging and developed regions. 
We estimate that approximately 187 million to 191 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $204 to $210. We continue to see handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed regions, as well as increasing breadth of connected devices. 
We paid $361 million in cash dividends this quarter. And in response to the volatility and declining global stock markets, we engaged in $827 million of activity related to our stock repurchase program. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 and to date through fiscal 2012, we have repurchased $241 million of our common stock and sold 3 put options that will expire at different times in the latter half of fiscal 2012 when we expect to have higher domestic cash balances. If these puts are exercised, we will repurchase approximately $511 million of our common stock, net of option premiums, at an average net price of $43.30 per share. Whether or not the puts are exercised, we will retain $75 million of cash premiums and therefore believe our stockholders will benefit in either case.
Turning to our results for the full fiscal 2011 year. Revenues were a record $15 billion, up 36% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution by our QTL and QCT businesses and continued smartphone adoption and 2G to 3G migration. GAAP earnings were a record $2.52 per share, up 29% year-over-year. Record non-GAAP operating income was more than $6 billion, up 41% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.20, up 30% year-over-year.
QCT's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record and grew 32% year-over-year with an operating margin of 23%, consistent with our original guidance range at the outset of the fiscal year. QCT's operating income grew 21% year-over-year. 
QTL's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record, up 48% year-over-year, and the operating margin improved to 88% of revenue. We estimate that the fiscal 2011 device average selling price, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $203 to $209, above our initial expectations at the outset of this year, reflecting strong adoption of smartphones around the globe. We are reaffirming our 775 million-unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA-based device shipments, up approximately 18% year-over-year. 
Now turning to next year. We've incorporated in our forecast the most recent consensus worldwide economic forecast, which takes into account the serious concerns for Europe and very low GDP growth in the U.S. We estimate calendar 2012 CDMA-based device shipments will grow approximately 12% to 21% year-over-year. We anticipate fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of approximately $18 billion to $19 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion, an increase of approximately 14% at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.62, an increase of approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We expect that the acquisitions that Steve just mentioned will be modestly dilutive to fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share, and this has been included in our guidance. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our cash and marketable securities portfolio unless such gains or losses are reasonably certain, which, in turn, impacts the year-over-year earnings per share growth comparison.
We expect QTL operating margins to be in the range of 86% to 88% for fiscal 2012. For the QCT segment, as Steve mentioned, we expect strong year-over-year growth in revenue and operating income, leveraging the fiscal 2011 strategy, which we think has been successfully executed. We expect QCT operating margins to be approximately 20% to 22% for fiscal 2012. We estimate that the fiscal 2012 device ASP reported to us by our licensees for the QTL business will be approximately $197 to $209, reflecting continued adoption of smartphones at multiple tiers around the globe and a greater percentage of total device volume coming from lower-priced regions such as China and India. 
We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 15% year-over-year, plus or minus a couple of points, and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense and a full year of Atheros. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 18% to 19% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We estimate revenues to be approximately $4.35 billion to $4.75 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal first quarter non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $1.67 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.86 to $0.92, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 146 million to 154 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter, reflecting strong sequential growth and successful execution on QCT's strategy. We expect total reported device sales of approximately $37.5 billion to $41.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting strong handset volume growth expected in emerging and developed regions, as well as increased non-handset device shipments. 
We expect a small build in the CDMA channel inventory in the December quarter, as is typical for the holiday season, and we estimate that CDMA inventory channel will remain at the low end of the historic 15- to 20-week band throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. We expect a modest sequential increase in non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the first fiscal quarter to be approximately 18% to 19%. 
We look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 16 where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2012 guidance. In the meantime, the Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes a thorough slide presentation on the data points included on today's call. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

So we've triangulated that CDMA-based unit shipment forecast for next year to a rather low global GDP growth estimate, again particularly for Europe but also for the U.S. The strength we're seeing, if anywhere, on global GDP would be in the emerging markets. Specific to our fiscal Q1 guidance relative to the fiscal Q4, if you'll recall, the QTL revenues are recorded one quarter in arrears. And so what we'll report in our fiscal Q1 will be shipments for fiscal Q4. Fiscal Q4 we don't think had a significant growth over fiscal Q3 in the market, whereas for the market as a whole, we are seeing strong growth in the -- in this first fiscal quarter, which QTL, we expect, will reflect next quarter."

On top of that, we are forecasting stronger growth in the emerging markets relative to developed markets. So that would be, I think, the second most significant variable.

It looks like that you didn't guide fiscal Q1. It looks like we're going to start the year somewhat on the hotter side of that, I would imagine 22% or higher in fiscal Q1.

You're seeing a lot of designing activity in those mass-market areas. We're also starting to see, I think, more penetration of LTE and the leading AP processor coming together. I think we talked a little bit about this throughout the year in 2011 how we thought the second half of 2011 calendar would include products that had both high-performing application processor coming alongside with the LTE chipset as well, again multimode LTE chipset. And we're seeing that play out. It's a good on-ramp, I think, into the 8960. So it's very, very mixed, and I think it reflects the market outlook if you look at the mix of Snapdragon products.

And second, with respect to QCT margins again, now that the Atheros is in the mix and you're going deeper into the meatier of the market, Steve, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, is your path here again somehow into the mid-20s? Or is this going to be a very long-term kind of margin target out there?"

I wonder if you guys could comment on what the revenue contribution was in the quarter and what you're expecting growth to look like next year, that being the first one.

So that's good news. EPS, though, coming in pretty close to -- in line with what we were thinking, and I guess the extra revenue looks like, based on your unit guidance for devices or handsets, it's coming mostly from QCT. But I think that the EPS suggests that the margins really aren't as good there. So I'm just trying to figure out how -- why that's the case because we do expect that mix to be shifting up towards Snapdragon and would have expected that Snapdragon mix to augment those margins."

I'll contribute some comments to your questions. Maybe others would have a few other thought. On the Atheros one, we gave a lot of detail on Atheros last quarter because we had guided fiscal Q3 without Atheros and then, of course, we closed on the acquisition. So we gave extra detail on Atheros. We're going to refrain from that for the most part, going forward, other than just reiterate Steve's comments that we have seen good growth from the Atheros business, and we expect strong growth next year as well. On the -- now your point on the margin guidance and the EPS, we are -- yes, I mean, I think we're a bit higher. Our EPS midpoint anyway is a bit higher than where the Street average was. I don't know how much was being imputed in for these acquisitions we completed in -- just completed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which degraded that by a bit. But beyond that, as I did say on my opening comments, we do expect QCT operating margins to be in a range of 20% to 22%, which, put a little perspective to it, you do have a -- you get a full year Atheros in there, and Atheros operating margin operated a few hundred basis points below what we typically operated at. So number one. Number two, I'm already getting into a bit of what we're going to share in New York, but I'll just touch on it. The operating expense growth that we expect for fiscal '12 will be heavily weighted towards QCT again. So that's putting a little pressure on the operating margin as well. But other than that, I would just say again I think -- as Steve said it, I think if we can execute in the 20% to 22% range operating margin for QCT at the kind of growth we expect and with the substantial investments that we're making for the future, I think we feel pretty good about that."

There are companies that are talking about servers based on ARM. That's not our initial target. So I think that you'll see really kind of a market of tablets, clamshells and convertible devices and really focused in on lightweight, long battery life, instant on, always on. We've done some really interesting demonstrations about how Microsoft's been able to turn off a lot of the parts of their system and really drive the power consumption down and yet have it turn on real quickly.

So we've successfully used that correlation in our forecasting, and we're continuing to use that correlation. I expect it is -- I don't see a major reason that would suddenly change. The -- then what helps Qualcomm is this continuing migration from 2G to 3G. So although we see a fairly lackluster world economy next year, we expect 3G will do a bit better than mobile devices as a whole because of the 2G to 3G transition. And then thirdly, the specifics we have seen, how we adjust our forecast, we typically see in a lower-GDP-growth environment is that replacement rate. Consumers tend to hold on to their devices a little bit longer. So we've incorporated a little lower replacement rate forecast than what we otherwise would have done. And then also, just the new device volume gets impacted as well. So that's kind of how we work through our forecast on that macro. It really leverages from this correlation we found between total mobile devices and GDP growth region by region. On mirasol, we did give an indication at the outset of 2011 that we expected -- I think it was -- if I remember correctly, we said about a $225 million operating loss. I expect we'll update that in New York. And at this point -- but with the business progressing, the R&D continuing and starting to bring more fab capacity online, we have a larger operating loss built into our guidance.

And we deliver those products together, and I think it's a very competitive offering. You see that in the 8960, but you've also seen that in our Fusion product line where we have really made it very easy for the OEMs to integrate together the LTE product and the dual-core application processor. Now in the low tier, it tends to be that cost is a big driver. So integration tends to rule the day there. And so majority of our shipments there tend to be in the integrated fashion.

All what they're talking about for Q4, in fact, if you aggregate the top 7 or 8 vendors. So if it hasn't come through now, what makes you think that you may come through? We're talking not just good old-fashioned Qualcomm conservatism. And the other thing about the 16% growth, I would have thought in there you would have also tablet growth. And the tablet market, depending on whose estimates you look at, is very immature it could almost double next year.

First of all, I mean, for this year, I think the midpoint of our estimates all year has been 775 million units, and we'll see.

Last year, I think our total market estimate was off low single digit relative to what we started our guidance with. The year before, 2009, a very difficult environment for anybody to forecast in. I believe we were still single digit within our forecast to actual. It was higher single digits but nonetheless. So I -- overall, I feel pretty good about the teams that put a lot of effort into the forecasting of that. I think we've done pretty good.

At the outset of the year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done. Our revenues grew to a record $15 billi",986,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. At the outset of the year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done. 
Our revenues grew to a record $15 billion in fiscal 2011, and we delivered record earnings and MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, we expect strong revenue and earnings growth again in fiscal 2012. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments despite the macroeconomic slowdown. Smartphones will lead the way, along with the continued global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. 
We had a number highlights this year. We had strong growth in our Licensing business, delivering both record revenues and earnings. We successfully resolved 2 licensee disputes and completed the last of the WCDMA subscriber unit renewals we highlighted some years ago. We now have over 200 royalty-bearing 3G licenses and 13 single-mode OFDM licensees around the world. 
During fiscal 2011, we also continued to expand our licensee base in China, adding more than 20 new Chinese licensees. Through our licensing program, we continue to foster innovation and support the ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide. 
And QCT continued to execute well. We believe our Snapdragon family of chipsets has established the industry standard in mobile, allowing us to expand our partnerships with several new customers. We've sampled the industry's first integrated application processor and multimode LTE platform for handsets. The breadth and depth of our product portfolio is unparalleled, and we believe that our WCDMA chipset volumes are growing faster than the competition.
We completed our largest acquisition to date with the addition of Atheros. The integration process has gone very well, and we're starting to see good progress on our combined road map and expanded channel opportunities. 
In India, we worked hard to ensure LTE TDD was adopted, and we're pleased to see the initial build out contracts being awarded. And according to GSA, there are 2 commercial LTE TDD networks in Saudi Arabia, with an additional 27 operators making LTE TDD network investments around the world. We've collaborated with several OEMs on the launch of multimode 3G LTE TDD devices, demonstrating the ecosystem's readiness for deployment. 
QIS successfully launched the QChat push-to-talk platform with both Sprint and Nextel International with handsets provided by multiple OEM partners. With respect to mirasol, we continue to work with partners on low-volume projects as we await the completion of our new fab. 
And as planned, we have executed on our restructuring plan for FLO TV and have agreed to sell the related spectrum to AT&T. And we believe that regulatory approval should be granted as expeditiously as possible as our proposed spectrum sale furthers many of the key policy goals that the SEC is actively promoting. 
Specifically, the deal will ensure that our unpaired spectrum is put to its highest and best use as soon as possible, putting up much needed spectrum for mobile broadband just as the SEC is striving to address the spectrum crunch that we're all facing. And it will result in the world's first deployment of supplemental downlink technology, thereby promoting mobile innovation. Furthermore, there is going to be significant tax revenue generated for the government once that transaction closes. 
So overall, we delivered very strong earnings and operating cash flow growth in fiscal 2011. We increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including approximately $21 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to calendar 2012. We expect CDMA-based device shipments to grow approximately 16% year-over-year based on the 900 million-unit midpoint of our forecast. And when we look at our business, we see 5 key drivers for growth. 
First is the continued mass adoption of smartphones. According to Gartner, global smartphone shipments reached 108 million units in the second quarter of 2011, representing a 74% year-over-year increase and are expected to surpass 1 billion units annually by 2015. 
Second is the growth of 3G in emerging regions. According to Wireless Intelligence, approximately 67 million 3G connections were added in emerging regions this past quarter, representing a 38% year-over-year increase, and greater than 1.5 billion new 3G connections are expected to be added in these regions through the end of 2015. 
A third catalyst is the opportunity for mobile computing and the expansion of 3G connectivity into device types beyond the handset. Microsoft's demonstration of Windows 8 on Snapdragon at their recent developer conference underscores this shift in the computing landscape. Further, as an indication of this trend, AT&T recently reported that nearly half their third quarter net wireless additions came from devices other than handsets. 
The fourth key driver is the continued deployment of advanced network technologies to handle the accelerating demand for data. According to the GSA, there are now 152 HSPA+ and 35 LTE commercial networks throughout the globe. According to CDG, there are also 129 EV-DO Rev. A and 10 Rev. B networks. 
And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as a growth driver for our business. We believe in an Internet of everything where we'll be surrounded by an increasing number of connected devices, and the combination of Atheros with QCT positions us well for that opportunity. We'll explore these key drivers in more detail during our upcoming New York analyst day, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
To wrap up, we've completed another outstanding year at Qualcomm, and I'd once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their ingenuity, effort and support. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook for continued strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President and COO-elect, Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business delivered strong results again this year, reflecting increased demand across our broad product portfolio, particularly for smartphone chipsets. 
We had another record year, shipping approximately 483 million MSMs, up 21% year-over-year. We just completed our highest-volume quarter in history with approximately 127 million MSMs shipped. We are extremely pleased to have completed the Atheros acquisition and are off to strong start in providing our customers best-in-class connectivity and networking solutions, expanding our business beyond mobile into consumer electronics, computing and networking. 
We also made a number of other targeted acquisitions that added to our technology portfolio to enable new opportunities. Our integration strategy continues to win in mobile wireless and is a clear driver of our strong results. Shipments of our integrated Snapdragon chipsets grew more than 4x this year. The cost, size and performance advantages of our integrated approach position us to grow faster than our competitors. We expect the demand for integrated chipsets to increase at both high end and mass market smartphone sales growth, particularly in developing regions. 
We have worked hard to extend our customer footprint, and you can see the results in the marketplace. Nokia just launched their first Windows Phone 7 devices based on our silicon. The BlackBerry 7 base launches use our products globally, and we have grown and diversified our OEM partnerships in China. Our extensive tier chipset products are clearly aligned with the needs of device OEMs, and we are now providing solutions to all the leading device manufacturers in our industry. 
There are now more than 300 Snapdragon-based devices announced and more than 350 additional devices in development. New Snapdragon-based devices launched this quarter include the HTC Jetstream LTE tablet for AT&T, the BlackBerry Torch 9850, and the Samsung GALAXY S II for T-Mobile USA and the Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1 LTE for NTT DOCOMO. We have made tremendous progress with the move to 28-nanometer, and the Snapdragon MSM8960 is seeing very strong design activity across our customer base. 
LTE is increasingly becoming a design requirement, and our time-to-market advantage with integrated LTE multimode in the MSM8960 is valued by our customers. In addition to global connectivity in the 8960, we continue to lead in computing and graphics with our new Krait CPU micro-architecture and next-generation Adreno graphics system. The Qualcomm Atheros team is also executing well with quarter-over-quarter growth across all channels and geographic regions as wireless attach rates continue to increase in consumer electronics and QCA's  comprehensive networking platforms, consisting of WiFi, PLC and ethernet, drive greater value. 
We continue to invest in the Windows computing platform and associated ecosystem to address new device categories beyond traditional cellular. Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 running on Snapdragon at their BUILD conference and highlighted how our mobile architecture enables a feature called connected standby. This feature enables a Windows 8 PC to run on low-power mode and remain connected to the network and always up-to-the-date, much like smartphones do today. This underscores the advantages our mobile architecture does in bringing the computing realm and demonstrates the natural advantages of a Snapdragon-based solution. We expect Windows 8 to be a significant opportunity for us beyond this fiscal year. 
As we move forward, we continue to expect our operating margins to reflect the growing mix of mass-market smartphones, continued investment in mobile computing and the full year effect of the acquisitions we made this year. Even with this, we are expecting fiscal 2012 revenue and operating income to grow at a rate in excess of CDMA device growth. Further, we are expecting to get off to a strong start with MSM shipments estimated to be between 146 and 154 million units in the first fiscal quarter. 
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed very well in fiscal 2011 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow and to lead the transition to smartphones across all tiers and regions, as well as the growth of mobile computing. 
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,113876089,183740,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

Non-GAA",1140,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial results to report to you again today. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record $4.1 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income grew 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, up 18% year-over-year.
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues reached a new record, growing 39% year-over-year on the strength of record MSM shipments, reflecting strong demand for our integrated Snapdragon chipsets for the growing smartphone segment, as well as a full quarter of Atheros revenues. 
QTL revenues grew 48% year-over-year, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $39.1 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, up 38% year-over-year driven by strength in both emerging and developed regions. 
We estimate that approximately 187 million to 191 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $204 to $210. We continue to see handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed regions, as well as increasing breadth of connected devices. 
We paid $361 million in cash dividends this quarter. And in response to the volatility and declining global stock markets, we engaged in $827 million of activity related to our stock repurchase program. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 and to date through fiscal 2012, we have repurchased $241 million of our common stock and sold 3 put options that will expire at different times in the latter half of fiscal 2012 when we expect to have higher domestic cash balances. If these puts are exercised, we will repurchase approximately $511 million of our common stock, net of option premiums, at an average net price of $43.30 per share. Whether or not the puts are exercised, we will retain $75 million of cash premiums and therefore believe our stockholders will benefit in either case.
Turning to our results for the full fiscal 2011 year. Revenues were a record $15 billion, up 36% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution by our QTL and QCT businesses and continued smartphone adoption and 2G to 3G migration. GAAP earnings were a record $2.52 per share, up 29% year-over-year. Record non-GAAP operating income was more than $6 billion, up 41% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.20, up 30% year-over-year.
QCT's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record and grew 32% year-over-year with an operating margin of 23%, consistent with our original guidance range at the outset of the fiscal year. QCT's operating income grew 21% year-over-year. 
QTL's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record, up 48% year-over-year, and the operating margin improved to 88% of revenue. We estimate that the fiscal 2011 device average selling price, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $203 to $209 above our initial expectations at the outset of this year, reflecting strong adoption of smartphones around the globe. We are reaffirming our 775 million-unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA-based device shipments up approximately 18% year-over-year. 
Now turning to next year. We've incorporated in our forecast the most recent consensus worldwide economic forecast, which takes into account the serious concerns for Europe and very low GDP growth in the U.S. We estimate calendar 2012 CDMA-based device shipments will grow approximately 12% to 21% year-over-year. We anticipate fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of approximately $18 billion to $19 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion, an increase of approximately 14% at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.62, an increase of approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We expect that the acquisitions that Steve just mentioned will be modestly dilutive to fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share, and this has been included in our guidance. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our cash and marketable securities portfolio unless such gains or losses are reasonably certain, which, in turn, impacts the year-over-year earnings per share growth comparison.
We expect QTL operating margins to be in the range of 86% to 88% for fiscal 2012. For the QCT segment, as Steve mentioned, we expect strong year-over-year growth in revenue and operating income, leveraging the fiscal 2011 strategy, which we think has been successfully executed. We expect QCT operating margins to be approximately 20% to 22% for fiscal 2012. We estimate that the fiscal 2012 device ASP reported to us by our licensees for the QTL business will be approximately $197 to $209, reflecting continued adoption of smartphones at multiple tiers around the globe and a greater percentage of total device volume coming from lower-priced regions such as China and India. 
We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 15% year-over-year, plus or minus a couple of points, and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense and a full year of Atheros. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 18% to 19% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We estimate revenues to be approximately $4.35 billion to $4.75 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal first quarter non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $1.67 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.86 to $0.92, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 146 million to 154 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter, reflecting strong sequential growth and successful execution on QCT's strategy. 
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $37.5 billion to $41.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting strong handset volume growth expected in emerging and developed regions, as well as increased non-handset device shipments. 
We expect a small build in the CDMA channel inventory in the December quarter, as is typical for the holiday season, and we estimate that CDMA inventory channel will remain at the low end of the historic 15- to 20-week band throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. We expect a modest sequential increase in non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the first fiscal quarter to be approximately 18% to 19%. 
We look forward to seeing you in New York for our analyst day meeting on November 16 where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2012 guidance. In the meantime, the Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes a thorough slide presentation on the data points included on today's call. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

And we've just upgraded that product line and the 27A [ph], and that was actually our fastest product to go from tapeout to products-in-stores ever. So it's -- we feel that's been a good product for us, and we feel pretty well positioned. Those markets, though, are new areas for us in terms of their transitions to smartphones, and we look at that really as an opportunity versus a risk."

But if you can give us a sense as to what's in those 350. My other question for Bill was on the QCT margin, on linearity next year. I think you guided to 20% to 22% for the year. It looks like lead-in guide fiscal Q1, it looks like we're going to start the year somewhat on the hotter side of that. I would imagine 22% or higher in fiscal Q1. And with the 8960 coming in the back half of the fiscal year, I've always thought that to be a higher-operating-margin product. So I'm just wondering, how do we get into the 20% to 22% range?

You're seeing a lot of designing activity in those mass-market areas. We're also starting to see, I think, more penetration of LTE and the leading AP processor coming together. I think we talked a little bit about this throughout the year in 2011, how we thought the second half of 2011 calendar would include products that had both high-performing application processor coming alongside with the LTE chipset, as well. Again, multimode LTE chipset. And we're seeing that play out. It's a good on-ramp, I think, into the 8960. So it's very, very mixed, and I think it reflects the market outlook, if you look at the mix of Snapdragon products.

On the -- your point on the margin guidance and the EPS, we are -- yes, I mean, I think we're a bit higher. Our EPS midpoint, anyway, is a bit higher than where the Street average was. I don't know how much was being imputed in for these acquisitions we completed in -- just completed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which degraded that by a bit. But beyond that, as I did say on my opening comments, we do expect QCT operating margins to be in a range of 20% to 22%, which -- put a little perspective to it. You do have a -- you get a full year Atheros in there, and Atheros operating margin operated a few hundred basis points below what we typically operated at. So number one. Number two -- I'm already getting into a bit of what we're going to share in New York, but I'll just touch on it. The operating expense growth that we expect for fiscal '12 will be heavily weighted towards QCT again. So that's putting a little pressure on the operating margin as well. But other than that, I would just say, I think, as Steve said it, I think if we can execute in a 20% to 22% range operating margin for QCT at the kind of growth we expect and with the substantial investments that we're making for the future, I think we feel pretty good about that."

We've found over the years a pretty good correlation between GDP growth in a region and the rate at which new wireless devices are bought by the end consumer. So we've successfully used that correlation in our forecasting. We're continuing to use that correlation. I expect -- it is -- I don't see a major reason that would suddenly change. Then what helps Qualcomm is this continuing migration from 2G to 3G. So although we see a fairly lackluster world economy next year, we expect 3G will do a bit better than mobile devices as a whole because of the 2G to 3G transition. And then thirdly, the specifics we have seen, how we adjust our forecast. We typically see in a lower-GDP-growth environment is that replacement rate. Consumers tend to hold on to their devices a little bit longer. So we've incorporated a little lower replacement rate forecast than what we otherwise would have done. And then also, just the new device volume gets impacted as well. So that's kind of how we work through our forecast on that macro. It really leverages from this correlation we found between total mobile devices and GDP growth region by region. On mirasol, we did give an indication at the outset of 2011 that we expected -- I think it was -- if I remember correctly, we said about a $225 million operating loss. I expect we'll update that in New York. And at this point -- but with the business progressing, the R&D continuing and starting to bring more fab capacity online, we have a larger operating loss built into our guidance. So we will share more color on that in New York."

With respect to your question on the stand-alone apps processor. Yes, we do have a stand-alone AP product. And we really did that because we had customers asking us for it, which I think is a great statement about the quality of the product. But by and large, the majority of the customer requests have been to have the integrated product. And I think there are 2 dynamics which are pulling that through. The first one is at the high end, it tends -- the high-end application processor tends to travel with the leading-edge modem. And we deliver those products together, and I think it's a very competitive offering. You see that in the 8960, but you've also seen that in our Fusion product line where we have really made it very easy for the OEMs to integrate together the LTE product and the dual-core application processor. Now in the low tier, it tends to be that cost is a big driver. So integration tends to rule the day there. And so majority of our shipments there tend to be in the integrated fashion. But we'll do whatever the market asks us to do in this case."

Belying the standard statements you made around trying to factor in the weaker macro environment, I guess, just what surprises me a little bit is that compared to previous downturns, handset demand has normally got impacted quite quickly. I don't think we've seen in either the third quarter results or that most of the handset vendors have actually reported, all what they're talking about for Q4, in fact, if you aggregate the top 7 or 8 vendors. So if it hasn't come through now, what makes you think that you may come through later, and that just good old-fashioned Qualcomm conservatism? And the other thing about the 16% growth, I would have thought in there you would have also tablet growth. And the tablet market, depending on whose estimates you look at, is very immature. It could almost double next year. So that means that the underlying handset growth rate in your estimates is probably even lower than 16%. And so I'm just trying to square all this together in terms of what you see your customers in the chipset and licensee side say about demand in the near term that makes you flirt [ph] this conservatism as well as how you factor tablets into that number as well."

We are looking for strong growth in tablets, but it's a relatively small base relative to -- when compared to handsets. So I think we're as top -- on top of that forecast as we can be. On your point about the overall forecast, I'll just put an overall perspective to it to begin with. First of all, I mean, for this year, I think the midpoint of our estimates all year has been 775 million units, and we'll see. But all data points at this point suggest that that's going to be pretty close to the actual. Last year, I think our total market estimate was off low single digit relative to what we started our guidance with. The year before, 2009, a very difficult environment for anybody to forecast in. I believe we were still single digit within our forecast to actual. It was higher single digits but nonetheless. So I -- overall, I feel pretty good about the teams that put a lot of effort into the forecasting of that. I think we've done pretty good, but obviously we have to stay very focused for the -- going forward. On the -- now on the market, recall that not all OEMs report, or report in the same breakout as compared to what we get. And the OEM base and licensee base, for that matter, too, has grown substantially here, even in this last year, particularly in the last couple of years. So there's -- I think we get a little bit better visibility than what many others can get as to what's actually happening, and that, I think, helps us on the forward outlook."

At the outset of the year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done. Our revenues grew to a record $15 billi",986,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. At the outset of the year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done. 
Our revenues grew to a record $15 billion in fiscal 2011, and we delivered record earnings and MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, we expect strong revenue and earnings growth again in fiscal 2012. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments despite the macroeconomic slowdown. Smartphones will lead the way, along with the continued global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. 
We had a number highlights this year. We had strong growth in our Licensing business, delivering both record revenues and earnings. We successfully resolved 2 licensee disputes and completed the last of the WCDMA subscriber unit renewals we highlighted some years ago. We now have over 200 royalty-bearing 3G licenses and 13 single-mode OFDM licensees around the world. 
During fiscal 2011, we also continued to expand our licensee base in China, adding more than 20 new Chinese licensees. Through our licensing program, we continue to foster innovation and support the ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide. 
And QCT continued to execute well. We believe our Snapdragon family of chipsets has established the industry standard in mobile, allowing us to expand our partnerships with several new customers. We've sampled the industry's first integrated application processor and multimode LTE platform for handsets. The breadth and depth of our product portfolio is unparalleled, and we believe that our WCDMA chipset volumes are growing faster than the competition.
We completed our largest acquisition to date with the addition of Atheros. The integration process has gone very well, and we're starting to see good progress on our combined road map and expanded channel opportunities. 
In India, we worked hard to ensure LTE TDD was adopted, and we're pleased to see the initial build out contracts being awarded. And according to GSA, there are 2 commercial LTE TDD networks in Saudi Arabia, with an additional 27 operators making LTE TDD network investments around the world. We've collaborated with several OEMs on the launch of multimode 3G LTE TDD devices, demonstrating the ecosystem's readiness for deployment. 
QIS successfully launched the QChat push-to-talk platform with both Sprint and Nextel International with handsets provided by multiple OEM partners. With respect to mirasol, we continue to work with partners on low-volume projects as we await the completion of our new fab. 
And as planned, we have executed on our restructuring plan for FLO TV and have agreed to sell the related spectrum to AT&T. And we believe that regulatory approval should be granted as expeditiously as possible as our proposed spectrum sale furthers many of the key policy goals that the SEC is actively promoting. 
Specifically, the deal will ensure that our unpaired spectrum is put to its highest and best use as soon as possible, putting up much needed spectrum for mobile broadband just as the SEC is striving to address the spectrum crunch that we're all facing. And it will result in the world's first deployment of supplemental downlink technology, thereby promoting mobile innovation. Furthermore, there is going to be significant tax revenue generated for the government once that transaction closes. 
So overall, we delivered very strong earnings and operating cash flow growth in fiscal 2011. We increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including approximately $21 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to calendar 2012. We expect CDMA-based device shipments to grow approximately 16% year-over-year based on the 900 million-unit midpoint of our forecast. And when we look at our business, we see 5 key drivers for growth. 
First is the continued mass adoption of smartphones. According to Gartner, global smartphone shipments reached 108 million units in the second quarter of 2011, representing a 74% year-over-year increase and are expected to surpass 1 billion units annually by 2015. 
Second is the growth of 3G in emerging regions. According to Wireless Intelligence, approximately 67 million 3G connections were added in emerging regions this past quarter, representing a 38% year-over-year increase, and greater than 1.5 billion new 3G connections are expected to be added in these regions through the end of 2015. 
A third catalyst is the opportunity for mobile computing and the expansion of 3G connectivity into device types beyond the handset. Microsoft's demonstration of Windows 8 on Snapdragon at their recent developer conference underscores this shift in the computing landscape. Further, as an indication of this trend, AT&T recently reported that nearly half their third quarter net wireless additions came from devices other than handsets. 
The fourth key driver is the continued deployment of advanced network technologies to handle the accelerating demand for data. According to the GSA, there are now 152 HSPA+ and 35 LTE commercial networks throughout the globe. According to CDG, there are also 129 EV-DO Rev. A and 10 Rev. B networks. 
And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as a growth driver for our business. We believe in an Internet of everything where we'll be surrounded by an increasing number of connected devices, and the combination of Atheros with QCT positions us well for that opportunity. We'll explore these key drivers in more detail during our upcoming New York Analyst Day, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
To wrap up, we've completed another outstanding year at Qualcomm, and I'd once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their ingenuity, effort and support. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook for continued strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President and COO-elect, Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business delivered strong results again this year, reflecting increased demand across our broad product portfolio, particularly for smartphone chipsets. 
We had another record year, shipping approximately 483 million MSMs, up 21% year-over-year. We just completed our highest-volume quarter in history with approximately 127 million MSMs shipped. We are extremely pleased to have completed the Atheros acquisition and are off to strong start in providing our customers best-in-class connectivity and networking solutions, expanding our business beyond mobile into consumer electronics, computing and networking. 
We also made a number of other targeted acquisitions that added to our technology portfolio to enable new opportunities. Our integration strategy continues to win in mobile wireless and is a clear driver of our strong results. Shipments of our integrated Snapdragon chipsets grew more than 4x this year. The cost, size and performance advantages of our integrated approach position us to grow faster than our competitors. We expect the demand for integrated chipsets to increase at both high end and mass market smartphone sales growth, particularly in developing regions. 
We have worked hard to extend our customer footprint, and you can see the results in the marketplace. Nokia just launched their first Windows Phone 7 devices based on our silicon. The BlackBerry 7 base launches use our products globally, and we have grown and diversified our OEM partnerships in China. Our extensive tier chipset products are clearly aligned with the needs of device OEMs, and we are now providing solutions to all the leading device manufacturers in our industry. 
There are now more than 300 Snapdragon-based devices announced and more than 350 additional devices in development. New Snapdragon-based devices launched this quarter include the HTC Jetstream LTE tablet for AT&T, the BlackBerry Torch 9850, and the Samsung GALAXY S II for T-Mobile USA and the Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1 LTE for NTT DOCOMO. We have made tremendous progress with the move to 28-nanometer, and the Snapdragon MSM8960 is seeing very strong design activity across our customer base. 
LTE is increasingly becoming a design requirement, and our time-to-market advantage with integrated LTE multimode in the MSM8960 is valued by our customers. In addition to global connectivity in the 8960, we continue to lead in computing and graphics with our new Krait CPU micro-architecture and next-generation Adreno graphics system. The Qualcomm Atheros team is also executing well with quarter-over-quarter growth across all channels and geographic regions as wireless attach rates continue to increase in consumer electronics and QCA's  comprehensive networking platforms, consisting of WiFi, PLC and ethernet, drive greater value. 
We continue to invest in the Windows computing platform and associated ecosystem to address new device categories beyond traditional cellular. Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 running on Snapdragon at their BUILD conference and highlighted how our mobile architecture enables a feature called connected standby. This feature enables a Windows 8 PC to run on low-power mode and remain connected to the network and always up to the date, much like smartphones do today. This underscores the advantages our mobile architecture does in bringing the computing realm and demonstrates the natural advantages of a Snapdragon-based solution. We expect Windows 8 to be a significant opportunity for us beyond this fiscal year. 
As we move forward, we continue to expect our operating margins to reflect the growing mix of mass-market smartphones, continued investment in mobile computing and the full year effect of the acquisitions we made this year. Even with this, we are expecting fiscal 2012 revenue and operating income to grow at a rate in excess of CDMA device growth. Further, we are expecting to get off to a strong start with MSM shipments estimated to be between 146 and 154 million units in the first fiscal quarter. 
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed very well in fiscal 2011 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow and to lead the transition to smartphones across all tiers and regions, as well as the growth of mobile computing. 
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

Non-GAA",1140,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial results to report to you again today. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record $4.1 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income grew 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, up 18% year-over-year.
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues reached a new record, growing 39% year-over-year on the strength of record MSM shipments, reflecting strong demand for our integrated Snapdragon chipsets for the growing smartphone segment, as well as a full quarter of Atheros revenues. 
QTL revenues grew 48% year-over-year, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $39.1 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, up 38% year-over-year driven by strength in both emerging and developed regions. 
We estimate that approximately 187 million to 191 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $204 to $210. We continue to see handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed regions, as well as increasing breadth of connected devices. 
We paid $361 million in cash dividends this quarter. And in response to the volatility and declining global stock markets, we engaged in $827 million of activity related to our stock repurchase program. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 and to date through fiscal 2012, we have repurchased $241 million of our common stock and sold 3 put options that will expire at different times in the latter half of fiscal 2012 when we expect to have higher domestic cash balances. If these puts are exercised, we will repurchase approximately $511 million of our common stock, net of option premiums, at an average net price of $43.30 per share. Whether or not the puts are exercised, we will retain $75 million of cash premiums and therefore believe our stockholders will benefit in either case.
Turning to our results for the full fiscal 2011 year. Revenues were a record $15 billion, up 36% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution by our QTL and QCT businesses and continued smartphone adoption and 2G to 3G migration. GAAP earnings were a record $2.52 per share, up 29% year-over-year. Record non-GAAP operating income was more than $6 billion, up 41% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.20, up 30% year-over-year.
QCT's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record and grew 32% year-over-year with an operating margin of 23%, consistent with our original guidance range at the outset of the fiscal year. QCT's operating income grew 21% year-over-year. 
QTL's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record, up 48% year-over-year, and the operating margin improved to 88% of revenue. We estimate that the fiscal 2011 device average selling price, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $203 to $209 above our initial expectations at the outset of this year, reflecting strong adoption of smartphones around the globe. We are reaffirming our 775 million-unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2011 CDMA-based device shipments up approximately 18% year-over-year. 
Now turning to next year. We've incorporated in our forecast the most recent consensus worldwide economic forecast, which takes into account the serious concerns for Europe and very low GDP growth in the U.S. We estimate calendar 2012 CDMA-based device shipments will grow approximately 12% to 21% year-over-year. We anticipate fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of approximately $18 billion to $19 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion, an increase of approximately 14% at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.62, an increase of approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We expect that the acquisitions that Steve just mentioned will be modestly dilutive to fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share, and this has been included in our guidance. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our cash and marketable securities portfolio unless such gains or losses are reasonably certain, which, in turn, impacts the year-over-year earnings per share growth comparison.
We expect QTL operating margins to be in the range of 86% to 88% for fiscal 2012. For the QCT segment, as Steve mentioned, we expect strong year-over-year growth in revenue and operating income, leveraging the fiscal 2011 strategy, which we think has been successfully executed. We expect QCT operating margins to be approximately 20% to 22% for fiscal 2012. We estimate that the fiscal 2012 device ASP reported to us by our licensees for the QTL business will be approximately $197 to $209, reflecting continued adoption of smartphones at multiple tiers around the globe and a greater percentage of total device volume coming from lower-priced regions such as China and India. 
We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 15% year-over-year, plus or minus a couple of points, and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense and a full year of Atheros. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 18% to 19% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We estimate revenues to be approximately $4.35 billion to $4.75 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal first quarter non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $1.67 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.86 to $0.92, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 146 million to 154 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter, reflecting strong sequential growth and successful execution on QCT's strategy. 
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $37.5 billion to $41.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting strong handset volume growth expected in emerging and developed regions, as well as increased non-handset device shipments. 
We expect a small build in the CDMA channel inventory in the December quarter, as is typical for the holiday season, and we estimate that CDMA inventory channel will remain at the low end of the historic 15- to 20-week band throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. We expect a modest sequential increase in non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the first fiscal quarter to be approximately 18% to 19%.

It looks like lead-in guide fiscal Q1, it looks like we're going to start the year somewhat on the hotter side of that. I would imagine 22% or higher in fiscal Q1. And with the 8960 coming in the back half of the fiscal year, I've always thought that to be a higher-operating-margin product. So I'm just wondering, how do we get into the 20% to 22% range?

And what we're seeing in terms of forward-looking mix is, I would say, tremendous growth in the mass-market smartphones around the world. You're seeing a lot of designing activity in those mass-market areas. We're also starting to see, I think, more penetration of LTE and the leading AP processor coming together. I think we talked a little bit about this throughout the year in 2011, how we thought the second half of 2011 calendar would include products that had both high-performing application processor coming alongside with the LTE chipset, as well. Again, multimode LTE chipset. And we're seeing that play out. It's a good on-ramp, I think, into the 8960. So it's very, very mixed, and I think it reflects the market outlook, if you look at the mix of Snapdragon products.

On the -- your point on the margin guidance and the EPS, we are -- yes, I mean, I think we're a bit higher. Our EPS midpoint, anyway, is a bit higher than where the Street average was. I don't know how much was being imputed in for these acquisitions we completed in -- just completed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which degraded that by a bit. But beyond that, as I did say on my opening comments, we do expect QCT operating margins to be in a range of 20% to 22%, which -- put a little perspective to it. You do have a -- you get a full year Atheros in there, and Atheros operating margin operated a few hundred basis points below what we typically operated at. So number one. Number two -- I'm already getting into a bit of what we're going to share in New York, but I'll just touch on it. The operating expense growth that we expect for fiscal '12 will be heavily weighted towards QCT again. So that's putting a little pressure on the operating margin as well.

That is playing pretty well, I think, into our capabilities and our strategy on the QCT side. But I would say it's more developed versus emerging that would be the key theme there."

So the question is what would you consider to be a successful entry into the market as we -- 12 months from now looking back, what will you define as success? And then second, market share-wise, where do you want to be in 2 to 3 years in PCs? Or is there a specific segment where you think you'll be most competitive?"

I will look back and say that we're successful if we see a strong launch and adoption of ARM-based devices, a significant number of application developers, both on new types of applications and porting applications, and also that we get strong adoption of mobile broadband into those devices. In terms of numbers, you can go -- you can look at the size of shipments of laptops. You won't see us driving into things like workstations, high-performance computing. There are companies that are talking about servers based on ARM. That's not our initial target. So I think that you'll see really kind of a market of tablets, clamshells and convertible devices, and really focused in on lightweight, long battery life, instant on, always on. We've done some really interesting demonstrations about how Microsoft's been able to turn off a lot of the parts of the system and really drive the power consumption down and yet have it turn on real quickly. So having all those kinds of functionality come to market, I think that will be, really, a good definition of success. And then as time goes on, we will see how much of that market we're able to take. And then as time goes on even farther, how ARM-based devices can push up into those higher-performance computing classes."

So that typically shows through in our QCT results. Whereas, on the QTL side, our -- the -- when we report March quarter, obviously that is December shipments of our licensees. So you get the Christmas effect in the Licensing side in the March quarter. The last couple of years, those 2 things have pretty well offset, and March has been a very -- I think, quite respectable.

We've found over the years a pretty good correlation between GDP growth in a region and the rate at which new wireless devices are bought by the end consumer. So we've successfully used that correlation in our forecasting. We're continuing to use that correlation. I expect -- it is -- I don't see a major reason that would suddenly change. Then what helps Qualcomm is this continuing migration from 2G to 3G. So although we see a fairly lackluster world economy next year, we expect 3G will do a bit better than mobile devices as a whole because of the 2G to 3G transition. And then thirdly, the specifics we have seen, how we adjust our forecast. We typically see in a lower-GDP-growth environment is that replacement rate. Consumers tend to hold on to their devices a little bit longer. So we've incorporated a little lower replacement rate forecast than what we otherwise would have done. And then also, just the new device volume gets impacted as well. So that's kind of how we work through our forecast on that macro. It really leverages from this correlation we found between total mobile devices and GDP growth region by region. On mirasol, we did give an indication at the outset of 2011 that we expected -- I think it was -- if I remember correctly, we said about a $225 million operating loss. I expect we'll update that in New York. And at this point -- but with the business progressing, the R&D continuing and starting to bring more fab capacity online, we have a larger operating loss built into our guidance. So we will share more color on that in New York."

And we really did that because we had customers asking us for it, which I think is a great statement about the quality of the product. But by and large, the majority of the customer requests have been to have the integrated product. And I think there are 2 dynamics which are pulling that through. The first one is at the high end, it tends -- the high-end application processor tends to travel with the leading-edge modem. And we deliver those products together, and I think it's a very competitive offering. You see that in the 8960, but you've also seen that in our Fusion product line where we have really made it very easy for the OEMs to integrate together the LTE product and the dual-core application processor. Now in the low tier, it tends to be that cost is a big driver. So integration tends to rule the day there. And so majority of our shipments there tend to be in the integrated fashion.

Belying the standard statements you made around trying to factor in the weaker macro environment, I guess, just what surprises me a little bit is that compared to previous downturns, handset demand has normally got impacted quite quickly. I don't think we've seen in either the third quarter results or that most of the handset vendors have actually reported, all what they're talking about for Q4, in fact, if you aggregate the top 7 or 8 vendors. So if it hasn't come through now, what makes you think that you may come through later, and that just good old-fashioned Qualcomm conservatism? And the other thing about the 16% growth, I would have thought in there you would have also tablet growth. And the tablet market, depending on whose estimates you look at, is very immature. It could almost double next year. So that means that the underlying handset growth rate in your estimates is probably even lower than 16%. And so I'm just trying to square all this together in terms of what you see your customers in the chipset and licensee side say about demand in the near term that makes you flirt [ph] this conservatism as well as how you factor tablets into that number as well."

We are looking for strong growth in tablets, but it's a relatively small base relative to -- when compared to handsets. So I think we're as top -- on top of that forecast as we can be. On your point about the overall forecast, I'll just put an overall perspective to it to begin with. First of all, I mean, for this year, I think the midpoint of our estimates all year has been 775 million units, and we'll see. But all data points at this point suggest that that's going to be pretty close to the actual. Last year, I think our total market estimate was off low single digit relative to what we started our guidance with. The year before, 2009, a very difficult environment for anybody to forecast in. I believe we were still single digit within our forecast to actual. It was higher single digits but nonetheless. So I -- overall, I feel pretty good about the teams that put a lot of effort into the forecasting of that. I think we've done pretty good, but obviously we have to stay very focused for the -- going forward. On the -- now on the market, recall that not all OEMs report, or report in the same breakout as compared to what we get. And the OEM base and licensee base, for that matter, too, has grown substantially here, even in this last year, particularly in the last couple of years. So there's -- I think we get a little bit better visibility than what many others can get as to what's actually happening, and that, I think, helps us on the forward outlook."
