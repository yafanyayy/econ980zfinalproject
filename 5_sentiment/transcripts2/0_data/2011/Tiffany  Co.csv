Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now we can proceed. Tiffany performed strongly in 2010, and we presume you will agree with that assessment. It was a year in which we saw solid sales growth across most regions, with the strongest growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions leading to a sales mix where non-U.S. sales slightly exceeded U.S. sales in the year.
In 2010, we also achieved excellent gross margin gains and maintained prudent expense control, and net earnings increased 39% to $2.87 per diluted share. However, excluding non-recurring items, net earnings came in at $2.93 per diluted share, which was above the outlook of $2.83 to $2.88 that we provided when we reported holiday sales due to stronger-than-expected results in January. 
For one additional perspective, note that EPS came in considerably higher than the initial outlook of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share that we provided a year ago, and our balance sheet remained very strong.
Let's begin by reviewing sales by region. In the Americas, sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter as an increase in the average price per unit sold was partly offset by a small decline in units due to lower silver jewelry sales. Comp store sales were up 8% on top of the 10% increase last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the fourth quarter, while brand store comps rose 9% due to generally broad-based increases, as well as outside increases in Hawaii and Guam due to strong tourist spending.
For the full year, sales rose 12% in the Americas, representing 51% of worldwide sales and increased 11% on a constant exchange rate basis due to comp growth of 8% on top of a 14% decline last year and the incremental sales from new stores. Just to remind you, Americas comps by quarter rose 15%, 5% and 5% in the first, second and third quarters versus declines in the first three quarters of 2009 of 32%, 25% and 10%.
Full year sales in our New York flagship store rose 6% and represented 8% of worldwide sales. Americas brand store comps rose 8%. You might be interested to know that outside of the New York flagship store, the five largest volume brand stores in the Americas in 2010 were in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California; San Francisco; Chicago; Street in Toronto; and Washington, D.C. In terms of customer mix, sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven more by local customer sales and to a lesser degree, by foreign tourist sales.
Full year sales growth was skewed more towards foreign tourists spending with local customer sales increasing to a smaller extent. Sales to foreign tourists in 2010 represented 17% of U.S. retail store sales versus 15% in 2009 and 16% in 2008. I should add that the 17% of U.S. sales made to foreign tourists are to a diverse mix of customers, with more than a quarter of those sales made to European tourists and a bit less than a quarter to Japanese visitors.
We finished 2010 with 84 U.S. stores, which included five new stores opened in the second half of the year in Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; a second store in Houston, Texas in The Woodlands; and two additional stores in the Los Angeles market in the Beverly Center in L.A.; and in Santa Monica. We're pleased to report that they've all performed well in their initial months. 
In the Americas, we also have 12 Tiffany stores spread among Canada, Mexico and Brazil. All three countries posted solid sales growth in the fourth quarter and full year, and we have some exciting store expansion plans.
Rounding out the Americas, our Tiffany's e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 8% in both the fourth quarter and the year, did increase spending per order. We continue to believe that Tiffany's Internet presence and the increasing use of digital and mobile technology, as well as catalogs serve as effective sales vehicles and as important marketing tools to attract customers into our stores. We increased catalog circulation by about 10% to 14 million books in 2010 and intend to increase mailings by about 5% in 2011.
Let's now look at sales performance in the other half of our business. Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific where business was strong all year. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 25% due to increased average price per unit sold, and jewelry unit volume also increased.
On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales in the quarter rose 21%, and comps rose 16% on top of a huge 24% comp increase last year. The strongest comps were in Hong Kong and Macau. Asia-Pacific comps in the first three quarters of 2010 had increased 21%, 7% and 11% compared with 2009 when comps declined 5% in the first quarter and then increased 5% and 9% in the second and third quarters.
For the full year, Asia-Pacific sales rose 29% and represented 18% of worldwide sales. Total sales in local currencies increased 22% and comp store sales increased 14% on top of an 8% increase in 2009. Performance within the region was strong in most countries throughout the year, although sales growth was strongest in the Greater China market. In addition, Greater China represented slightly more than half of the Asia-Pacific regions sales, while sales in Mainland China alone represented about 10% of the region.
You might be interested to know that the three highest volume stores in Asia-Pacific in 2010 were in Singapore's Niam City, in Australia in Sydney and in Hong Kong on Canton Road. At year end, we operated 52 Tiffany stores in Asia-Pacific, which included seven new stores opened in 2010, ranging from four new stores in China, one in Beijing, one in Kunming and two in Shanghai to one each in Seoul, Singapore and Taipei. We also focused a considerable amount of marketing spending on China to build brand awareness in that increasingly important country. That growing awareness is not only resulting in increased customer purchasing in China but also an increased spending by Chinese tourists when they visit other countries in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe.
The next region to review is Japan, which represented 18% of worldwide sales in 2010. Total sales rose 7% in 2010, but all of the increase was attributable to the translation effect from a stronger yen, which was 8% stronger than the prior year. On a constant exchange rate basis, total Japan sales in the year declined 1%, and comp store sales declined 4%. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 11% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold partly offset by lower units. We began to see improved results in Japan in the last several months of 2010. Specifically, local currency total sales in Japan rose 2% in the fourth quarter, and comps rose 1% versus a 9% decline last year. Comparable store sales in Japan, which turned positive in October, were also up in November and December then dipped in January but were then positive until the earthquake and tsunami March 11.
Comps in Japan by quarter had declined 10%, 7% and 2% in the first, second and third quarters compared with prior year declines of 13%, 11% and 13%. We opened one new department store boutique and closed two locations in 2010 as part of our long-term plan to address some underperforming locations and maintain strong profitability, and we operated 56 locations at year end.
We are saddened by the recent earthquake and tsunami, and our thoughts are with the people of Japan. We are pleased to report that all of our more than 700 Tiffany colleagues are safe. As noted in today's news release, most stores in the Kanto and Tohoku regions, which include Sendai and Tokyo, were closed last week but reopened over the past weekend. We have adjusted our financial expectations only for the first quarter based on assumptions of some continued business disruptions through the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to Europe, which posted excellent results in the fourth quarter. Total European sales rose 14% in the fourth quarter due to increased unit volume. However, on the more meaningful constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 21%, and comp store sales increased 16%, which was on top of a 14% increase last year, and resulted from strong growth in the U.K. and across most of the continent.
Sales growth was consistently strong throughout the fourth quarter. In the full year, European sales rose 18% and represented 12% of worldwide sales. In constant currencies, total sales in the year rose 23%, and comp store sales rose 18% due to solid growth in most markets. European comps were strong all year with increases of 14%, 21% and 24% in the first, second and third quarters on top of prior year increases of 3%, 5% and 9%. We currently operate 29 Tiffany stores in Europe, including new stores we opened in the second half of 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona.
Retail store sales in the U.K. were about 45% of European retail store sales in 2010. The three highest volume European stores in 2010 were on London's Old Bond Street and in Italy and Milan and Rome. We introduced e-commerce in eight continental European countries in mid-2010 and are very pleased with sales results and with the enhanced brand awareness that we derived from a stronger Internet presence.
So we finished 2010 operating 233 Tiffany stores versus 220 in the prior year. Worldwide gross square footage in 2010 rose 5% to slightly over 1 million square feet. We achieved higher sales productivity in all regions in 2010. Sales per gross square foot in the Americas rose to $2,100 in 2010 from $1,900, which included sales productivity of $5,400 per square foot in the New York flagship store. In Japan, sales productivity rose to $3,500 from $3,300. In Asia-Pacific, it increased to $4,000 from $3,800. In Europe, it increased to $3,000 from $2,700. For the total company, sales per gross square foot rose to $2,600 from $2,400 in 2009. 
And beyond our stores worldwide e-commerce included in our four segments has become a meaningful contributor to our overall sales. In fact, total e-commerce sales represented 6% of worldwide sales in 2010 and 2009 and accounted for 8% of total sales in the countries where we have an Internet presence. We continue to believe that the percentage can move a bit higher in the future. 
Rounding out the sales review is our Other segment in which sales declined 30% in the quarter and rose 2% in the year. This segment is largely composed of two pieces: wholesale sales of products to third parties to operate Tiffany stores, mostly in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, as well as wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program. The 30% decline in other sales in the quarter was more than entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. The 2% increase in the year reflected an increase in emerging market sales, mostly offset by a decline in diamond sales. 
One cannot fully review the year without highlighting some of our merchandising successes in 2010. We were pleased to see relatively broad-based sales growth across most product categories. Diamond engagement jewelry sales were strong. Fine and fashion gold jewelry such as Tiffany's Victoria collection, celebration rings and our Metro collection performed well, reflecting strength of higher-end transactions in diamonds, platinum and gold. We are very pleased with the introduction and success of the new and extraordinary yellow diamond collection, which we expect will be successful for many years, as well as Tiffany's new Garden jewelry collection. 
Worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly due to what we think as macro-related softness in the Americas. In fact, the weakness in silver jewelry sales in the U.S. was the reason that the under $500 price strata declined in the U.S., while all of the higher price point strata rose. Our Keys Collection, which spans multiple materials and prices, remained very popular, and we added new styles as well, although overall growth was muted by comparisons to the incredibly strong launch in 2009. The designer jewelry category did well, reflecting the success of Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh collection and the ongoing popularity of Elsa Peretti's Diamonds by the Yard collection, among many others. 
We are very pleased with the initial success of our new leather collection, and Tiffany brand watch sales grew more than 30% in our own stores. So that covers the sales review. I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a look at the rest of the earnings statement and specifically the components of stronger growth in the operating margin."
35576,118106788,111825,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2011",2011-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continue to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60.",1928,"Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continue to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60.9% compared with 58.7% last year. For the full year, gross margin increased 260 basis points to 59.1%. In both the quarter and year, the increased gross margins were primarily due to the recapture of two years of higher product costs through retail price increases early in 2010, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales.
Those fixed costs included distribution centers in our merchandising and diamond sourcing organizations. We also increased prices in January of 2011 in many categories to offset cost increases, but we expect that much more modest rate of gross margin improvement in 2011 that would be consistent with our long-term goals.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12% in the fourth quarter and rose 13% in the full year. Much of the increase was due to higher staffing and occupancy costs, fixed and variable in new and existing stores, but marketing spending also increased substantially as we had planned throughout the year. In fact, the marketing to sales ratio increased as we had expected from 5.9% in 2009 to 6.4% in 2010. SG&A growth also included $6.1 million in the quarter and $16.6 million in the year of non-recurring expenses related to the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. 
Excluding the non-recurring expenses, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 35.1% in the quarter and 39.2% in the year, both of which represented improvement from 35.8% and 40.2% in 2009. Approximately 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, so strong sales growth provides us with the ability to leverage those costs and further improve the expense ratio.
Adding this up, Tiffany's operating margin in the full year increased 300 basis points to 19.3% in 2010 and was 19.8% when excluding non-recurring items. Other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, declined modestly in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Tiffany's effective tax rate was 32.1% in the fourth quarter versus 34.2% last year. For the year, the rate came in at 32.7% due to some non-recurring items versus 31.9% last year, which had also included the recorded in favorable tax reserve adjustments. Bottom line, Tiffany's net earnings from continuing operations increased 31% in the fourth quarter and rose 39% to $368 million or $2.87 per diluted share in the year.
Excluding non-recurring items in 2010 and 2009, net earnings rose 47% in the year. We achieved an 18% return on average stockholders' equity and a 10% return on average assets, both of which achieved our performance objectives, and we are confident in our long-term ability to sustain strong returns.
Strong sales growth requires an efficient infrastructure behind the scenes to support that expansion, and most of you know that we have made substantial investments over the past decade, which continue to benefit us in 2010. Our internal manufacturing facilities produced approximately 60% of Tiffany merchandise sold. We've expanded our U.S.-based manufacturing operations into Lexington, Kentucky in temporary space and will soon open a 25,000 square-foot facility that will employ 125 skilled craftspeople and provide us with increased jewelry production capacity beyond the facilities we have in New York and Rhode Island.
Our two major distribution centers in New Jersey are also working very well, with one that is efficiently handling worldwide store replenishment and the other that processes direct-to-customer shipments. There is room for additional capacity utilization in both facilities, which will contribute to improved profitability. And our diamond sourcing organization is successfully operating globally to source and fulfill Tiffany's steadily increasing requirements for high quality diamond supply. 
We finished the year with a strong balance sheet that positions us very well competitively. In fact, cash and short-term investments exceeded total debt. At January 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $741 million versus $786 million at the prior year end. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $688 million at January 31 versus $754 million a year ago. During the year, we paid off $219 million of maturing long-term debt and entered into $118 million at issuance of new long-term debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. Stockholders' equity rose to almost $2.2 billion at the end of 2010 from almost $1.9 billion a year ago. And that put the debt to equity ratio at 32% at year end versus 40% a year ago. And in 2010, Tiffany generated $172 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures.
Reflecting that financial strength, Tiffany's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend twice in 2010 for a cumulative increase of 47%. The board also recently approved the new share repurchase plan to replace a plan that was set to expire, authorizing repurchases of up to $400 million through January of 2013. In 2010, we spent $81 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares at an average cost of $43.83 per share, with most of that spending occurring under the expiring plan. At January 31, $392 million remained available for future repurchases.
Net inventories increased 14% in 2010. That was comprised of a 9% increase in finished goods inventories and a 22% increase in raw material and work-in-process inventories to support sales growth, new stores, new product launches and higher product acquisition costs. Foreign currency translation was a small portion of the overall 14% inventory increase, and we intend to maintain very high inventory availability in our stores going forward.
For 2011, our plans call for net inventories to increase by more than 15% for several reasons. First, to support planned sales growth. Second, for new store openings; third for additional investments in high-end statement jewelry; and fourth, to further increase purchases of rough diamonds as we pursue our vertical integration strategy that provides supply and related cost benefits.
Accounts receivable rose 17% in 2010 with about five points of the increase due to foreign currency translation. Receivables turnover stayed at a healthy 18x per year. Capital expenditures in 2010 came in at $127 million or 4.1% of net sales, which was up from depressed spending of $75 million in 2009 when we cut back on all nonessential spending. However, CapEx in 2010 was lower than our initial projection of $200 million mostly due to delayed spending on certain projects, especially on the New York relocation that will be incurred in 2011. Therefore, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million in 2011, which would represent 7% to 8% of total sales and is relative to our long-term projected CapEx of 6% to 7% of sales. 
We are now providing you with our first outlook for 2011. Now let's look at the components of our annual sales and earnings guidance for 2011. I should begin by pointing out that the financial projections for the year that we are sharing with you today incorporate some effect in the first quarter from the devastating events in Japan on March 11. Specifically, we are projecting worldwide net sales to increase 12% to 14% in 2011. 
Looking at it by geographic region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage with comps up high single digits, and combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas also increasing by a high single-digit percentage. We expect sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a mid-teens percentage. In Japan, we are projecting total and comp store sales to decline by a mid-single digit percentage for the year in dollars and yen, factoring in the current events in Japan that are affecting our first quarter sales there. And in Europe, we expect sales to increase by more than 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a low double-digit percentage.
In addition, we are projecting other sales to increase by more than 30% due to strong growth in wholesale sales to distributors, primarily in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, while we expect only a modest increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. We are not looking for any significant differences in total sales growth by quarter except for slightly stronger growth in the second quarter as we consider the year-over-year comparisons. In addition, these sales projections assume no meaningful changes in foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar from the rates at the start of the year.
Moving down the earnings statement, we are looking for gross margin to increase by a couple of tenths of a point. We have addressed higher product costs with recent retail price increases in many product categories, and there could be other increases later in the year as well, if necessary. We cannot identify any meaningful resistance to the price increases in that customers our knowledgeable of higher costs and understand the need for us to address it. Other jewelers have also been affected by higher costs, and we assume they're also increasing their prices, so Tiffany's competitive position remains strong.
We are also looking for SG&A expenses to increase about 12% to 13% in total 2011. This excludes non-recurring items related to the upcoming New York headquarters staff relocation. These items specifically relate to incremental rental costs and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets, as well as a charge associated with the non-cancelable obligations remaining under the existing leases, which are expected to total about $40 million or $0.19 per diluted share after-tax, with most of the charge being recorded in the second quarter when we relocate. 
SG&A expense growth also reflects marketing spending that will increase somewhat faster than sales growth, so that the marketing to sales ratio continues to move higher. With the sales growth that we are projecting, this should result in a few point improvement in the expense ratio excluding non-recurring items, and this will take the operating margin to just above 20% when excluding non-recurring items.
We are projecting other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, to be relatively unchanged at about $46 million for the year. We expect Tiffany's effective tax rate to come in at about 34% for the full year. Therefore, we are now projecting net earnings, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 14% to 18%, and earnings per diluted share increasing to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. 
As you know, we typically do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis. But we'll do so for this first quarter in light of these significant events in Japan. As such, we expect that first quarter earnings per diluted share, excluding non-recurring items, will be reduced by approximately $0.05 per share from our initial expectation of $0.62 per diluted share to approximately $0.57 per diluted share versus $0.48 per share in last year's first quarter excluding non-recurring items. We cannot provide any forecast for Japan for subsequent quarters, so our expectation for the second, third and fourth quarter continues to call for sales roughly equal to the prior year in Japan. 
Lastly, we are assuming that the share count will roughly unchanged in about 128 million shares as share repurchases also offset the effect of option exercises. We believe that Tiffany has the necessary ingredients to achieve solid performance in 2011, and now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mike."

At the risk of repeating what's already been said, Tiffany truly prospered in 2010, achieving strong and better-than-expected sale and earnings growth. Our business began to strengthen in the latter part of 2009, and the rebound gained moment",983,"Thanks, Jim. At the risk of repeating what's already been said, Tiffany truly prospered in 2010, achieving strong and better-than-expected sale and earnings growth. Our business began to strengthen in the latter part of 2009, and the rebound gained momentum in 2010. We are immensely proud of the accomplishments of the more than 9,050 [ph] employees who are responsible for that success. Our results clearly demonstrate the power of a global expansion program that has provided a platform for robust and sustainable growth as an international luxury brand. In 2010, we expanded our store base, increased our e-commerce reach and communicated today's message across an ever wider global audience.
For the first time, worldwide sales are now essentially equally divided between the United States and the rest of the world, with 233 company-operated stores in 22 countries along with independently operated locations in additional 30 countries, we have a solid base of distribution to serve increasing numbers of global customers, and that base will continue to grow. 
Specifically, in 2011, we are planning to open 21 stores. This will include eight stores in the Americas with plans for four United States stores. We've already announced Northbrook, Illinois in Richmond Virginia, three in Canada and Calgary and two additional cities, and we hope to finalize plans for store to expand our growing presence in the important market of Brazil. We are planning to open eight stores in Asia-Pacific, including four stores in China, three in Korea and one in Taiwan. And we are planning five stores in Europe, including both in Zürich and Frankfurt airports, along with additional stores in France and Italy. In total, this will represent a 9% increase in the number of company-operated locations and a 5% increase in square footage. 
We also expected to derive continuing sales benefits from Tiffany's expanded Internet presence. This will enable us to reach customers who appreciate e-commerce convenience, whether they live far or near to our store recognizing however that no online experience however extraordinary can replicate the outstanding Tiffany in-store experience.
In addition, we believe there's important growth potential in emerging markets like the Middle East and in Russia where Tiffany's distribution is currently managed through third parties. Our total wholesale sales of products in those markets and other markets in 2010 represented only 3% of worldwide sales, and we believe there is much untapped growth potential. And we hope to soon finalize plans for Tiffany to enter India.
We have a very full pipeline of exciting new designs for 2011 in a full range of material and price points. A few highlights include our new collection of locks, pendants and bracelets executed in silver, gold and platinum with prices ranging from $100 to $10,000. We are also excited with this year Elsa Peretti is reintroducing and expanding her collection, an iconic pendant design that dates back more than 30 years. We are also looking forward to important new collection from Paloma Picasso. There will, of course, be many, many additional new jewelry designs introduced in 2011. There will also be expanded assortment in personal accessories building on the successful launch of our handbag collection, as well as in sunglasses. 
Regarding watches while sales in Tiffany's stores have been strong, we have been disappointed with the slower-than-expected rollout of wholesale watch distribution. As we have indicated for some time while over the short to medium term we expected contribution to sale from earnings from watch is minimal over the long term, we remain hopeful about the ultimate potential of the Watch business. We are also hopeful that our differences with our watch partner can be resolved collaboratively and professionally. 
Finally, we continue to look to grow our high end statement business by strengthening and strategically redeploying our inventory assortment with a special emphasis on taking maximum advantage of the newly completed jewel salon in our flagship store as a global destination for the most spectacularly crafted jewelry in the world. Regarding margins, Tiffany and the entire jewelry industry are continuing to deal with higher product input costs for precious metals and diamond. However, we have successfully increased retail prices to offset those costs, and we believe that the combination of Tiffany's pricing power and strong competitive position will allow us to do so if necessary again in the future. 
Our marketing communications will reach a growing base of potential customers around the world through print media and various forms of electronic negations, and we are beginning to formulate our plans to commemorate in 2012 the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding in 1837. We continue to monitor the events in Japan and the continued safety of our more than 700 employees and their families there. Our thoughts are with all of the people of Japan.
On a worldwide basis, I believe we have planned our business prudently for all of 2011 with a healthy rate of store expansion into attractive new markets and underserved existing markets and with a rate of spending to support that growth and further investments strengthening Tiffany's worldwide competitive position. And of course, given our organization and financial strength, we will maintain our long-term strategic focus of continuing to build upon the foundation of one of the world's great brands. 
Lastly, we are excited about relocating our New York headquarters staff in the coming months to our location at 5 Avenue 23rd Street. As we previously said, it will provide organizational efficiencies and substantial long term cost savings. We look forward to welcoming many of you there. Thank you for listening to our review of 2010 and our plans for 2011. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year. Please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 26. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions. That concludes today's call. Thank you for your ongoing interest."

Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now we can proceed. Tiffany performed strongly in 2010, and we presume you will agree with that assessment. It was a year in which we saw solid sales growth across most regions, with the strongest growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, leading to a sales mix where non-U.S. sales slightly exceeded U.S. sales in the year.
In 2010, we also achieved excellent gross margin gains and maintained prudent expense control, and net earnings increased 39% to $2.87 per diluted share. However, excluding non-recurring items, net earnings came in at $2.93 per diluted share, which was above the outlook of $2.83 to $2.88 that we provided when we reported holiday sales due to stronger-than-expected results in January. 
For one additional perspective, note that EPS came in considerably higher than the initial outlook of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share that we provided a year ago, and our balance sheet remain very strong.
Let's begin by reviewing sales by region. In the Americas, sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter as an increase in the average price per unit sold was partly offset by a small decline in units due to lower silver jewelry sales. Comp store sales were up 8% on top of the 10% increase last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the fourth quarter, while brand store comps rose 9% due to generally broad-based increases as well as outside increases in Hawaii and Guam due to strong tourist spending.
For the full year, sales rose 12% in the Americas, representing 51% of worldwide sales, and increased 11% on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to comp growth of 8% on top of a 14% decline last year and the incremental sales from new stores. Just to remind you, Americas' comps by quarter rose 15%, 5% and 5% in the first, second and third quarters versus declines in the first three quarters of 2009 of 32%, 25% and 10%.
Full year sales in our New York flagship store rose 6% and represented 8% of worldwide sales. Americas' brand store comps rose 8%. You might be interested to know that outside of the New York flagship store, the five largest volume branch stores in the Americas in 2010 were in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California; San Francisco; Chicago; Bloor Street in Toronto; and Washington, D.C. In terms of customer mix, sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven more by local customer sales and, to a lesser degree, by foreign tourist sales.
Full year sales growth was skewed more towards foreign tourist spending, with local customer sales increasing to a smaller extent. Sales to foreign tourists in 2010 represented 17% of U.S. retail store sales versus 15% in 2009 and 16% in 2008. I should add that the 17% of U.S. sales made to foreign tourists are to a diverse mix of customers, with more than a quarter of those sales made to European tourists and a bit less than a quarter to Japanese visitors.
We finished 2010 with 84 U.S. stores, which included five new stores opened in the second half of the year in Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; a second store in Houston, Texas in The Woodlands; and two additional stores in the Los Angeles market in the Beverly Center in L.A.; and in Santa Monica. We're pleased to report that they've all performed well in their initial months. 
In the Americas, we also have 12 Tiffany stores spread among Canada, Mexico and Brazil. All three countries posted solid sales growth in the fourth quarter and full year, and we have some exciting store expansion plans.
Rounding out the Americas, our Tiffany's e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 8% in both the fourth quarter and the year due to increased spending per order. We continue to believe that Tiffany's Internet presence and the increasing use of digital and mobile technology as well as catalogs, serve as effective sales vehicles and as important marketing tools to attract customers into our stores. We increased catalog circulation by about 10% to 14 million books in 2010 and intend to increase mailings by about 5% in 2011.
Let's now look at sales performance in the other half of our business. Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific where business was strong all year. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 25% due to increased average price per unit sold, and jewelry unit volume also increased.
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the quarter rose 21%, and comps rose 16% on top of a huge 24% comp increase last year. The strongest comps were in Hong Kong and Macau. Asia-Pacific comps in the first three quarters of 2010 had increased 21%, 7% and 11% compared with 2009 when comps declined 5% in the first quarter and then increased 5% and 9% in the second and third quarters.
For the full year, Asia-Pacific sales rose 29% and represented 18% of worldwide sales. Total sales in local currencies increased 23%, and comp store sales increased 14% on top of an 8% increase in 2009. Performance within the region was strong in most countries throughout the year, although sales growth was strongest in the Greater China market. In addition, Greater China represented slightly more than half of the Asia-Pacific region sales, while sales in Mainland China alone represented about 10% of the region.
You might be interested to know that the three highest volume stores in Asia-Pacific in 2010 were in Singapore's Ngee Ann City, in Australia in Sydney and in Hong Kong on Canton Road. At year end, we operated 52 Tiffany stores in Asia-Pacific, which included seven new stores opened in 2010, ranging from four new stores in China, one in Beijing, one in Kunming and two in Shanghai, to one each in Seoul, Singapore and Taipei. We also focused a considerable amount of marketing spending on China to build brand awareness in that increasingly important country. That growing awareness is not only resulting in increased customer purchasing in China but also an increased spending by Chinese tourists when they visit other countries in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe.
The next region to review is Japan, which represented 18% of worldwide sales in 2010. Total sales rose 7% in 2010, but all of the increase was attributable to the translation effect from a stronger yen, which was 8% stronger than the prior year. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Japan sales in the year declined 1%, and comp store sales declined 4%. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 11% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold partly offset by lower units. We began to see improved results in Japan in the last several months of 2010. Specifically, local currency total sales in Japan rose 2% in the fourth quarter, and comps rose 1% versus a 9% decline last year. Comparable store sales in Japan, which turned positive in October, were also up in November and December then dipped in January but were then positive until the earthquake and tsunami on March 11.
Comps in Japan by quarter had declined 10%, 7% and 2% in the first, second and third quarters compared with prior-year declines of 13%, 11% and 13%. We opened one new department store boutique and closed two locations in 2010 as part of our long-term plan to address some underperforming locations and maintain strong profitability, and we operated 56 locations at year end.
We are saddened by the recent earthquake and tsunami, and our thoughts are with the people of Japan. We are pleased to report that all of our more than 700 Tiffany colleagues are safe. As noted in today's news release, most stores in the Kanto and Tohoku regions, which include Sendai and Tokyo, were closed last week but reopened over the past weekend. We have adjusted our financial expectations only for the first quarter based on assumptions of some continued business disruptions through the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to Europe, which posted excellent results in the fourth quarter. Total European sales rose 14% in the fourth quarter due to increased unit volume. However, on the more meaningful constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 21%, and comp store sales increased 16%, which was on top of a 14% increase last year, and resulted from the strong growth in the U.K. and across most of the continent.
Sales growth was consistently strong throughout the fourth quarter. In the full year, European sales rose 18% and represented 12% of worldwide sales. In constant currencies, total sales in the year rose 23%, and comp store sales rose 18% due to solid growth in most markets. European comps were strong all year with increases of 14%, 21% and 24% in the first, second and third quarters on top of prior-year increases of 3%, 5% and 9%. We currently operate 29 Tiffany stores in Europe, including new stores we opened in the second half of 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona.
Retail store sales in the U.K. were about 45% of European retail store sales in 2010. The three highest volume European stores in 2010 were on London's Old Bond Street, and in Italy in Milan and Rome. We introduced e-commerce in eight continental European countries in mid-2010 and are very pleased with sales results and with the enhanced brand awareness that we derived from a stronger Internet presence.
So we finished 2010 operating 233 Tiffany stores versus 220 in the prior year. Worldwide gross square footage in 2010 rose 5% to slightly over 1 million square feet. We achieved higher sales productivity in all regions in 2010. Sales per gross square foot in the Americas rose to $2,100 in 2010 from $1,900, which included sales productivity of $5,400 per square foot in the New York flagship store. In Japan, sales productivity rose to $3,500 from $3,300. In Asia-Pacific, it increased to $4,000 from $3,800. And in Europe, it increased to $3,000 from $2,700. For the total company, sales per gross square foot rose to $2,600 from $2,400 in 2009. 
And beyond our stores, worldwide e-commerce included in our four segments has become a meaningful contributor to our overall sales. In fact, total e-commerce sales represented 6% of worldwide sales in 2010 and 2009 and accounted for 8% of total sales in the countries where we have an Internet presence. We continue to believe that the percentage can move a bit higher in the future. 
Rounding out the sales review is our Other segment in which sales declined 30% in the quarter and rose 2% in the year. This segment is largely composed of two pieces: wholesale sales of products to third parties who operate Tiffany stores, mostly in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, as well as wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program. The 30% decline in Other sales in the quarter was more than entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. The 2% increase in the year reflected an increase in emerging market sales, mostly offset by a decline in diamond sales. 
One cannot fully review the year without highlighting some of our merchandising successes in 2010. We were pleased to see relatively broad-based sales growth across most product categories. Diamond engagement jewelry sales were strong. Fine and fashion gold jewelry, such as Tiffany Victoria collection, Celebration Rings and our Metro collection performed well, reflecting strength of higher-end transactions in diamonds, platinum and gold. We are very pleased with the introduction and success of the new and extraordinary yellow diamond collection, which we expect will be successful for many years, as well as Tiffany's new Garden jewelry collection. 
Worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly due to what we think is macro-related softness in the Americas. In fact, the weakness in silver jewelry sales in the U.S. was the reason that the under-$500 price strata declined in the U.S., while all of the higher price point strata rose. Our Keys Collection, which spans multiple materials and prices, remained very popular, and we added new styles as well, although overall growth was muted by comparison to the incredibly strong launch in 2009. The designer jewelry category did well, reflecting the success of Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh collection and the ongoing popularity of Elsa Peretti's Diamonds by the Yard collection, among many others. 
We are very pleased with the initial success of our new leather collection, and Tiffany brand watch sales grew more than 30% in our own stores. So that covers the sales review. I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a look at the rest of the earnings statement and specifically the components of stronger growth in the operating margin."
35576,118106788,111840,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2011",2011-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continued to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60",1929,"Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continued to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60.9% compared with 58.7% last year. For the full year, gross margin increased 260 basis points to 59.1%. In both the quarter and year, the increased gross margins were primarily due to the recapture of two years of higher product costs through retail price increases early in 2010, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales.
Those fixed costs included distribution centers in our merchandising and diamond sourcing organizations. We also increased prices in January of 2011 in many categories to offset cost increases, but we expect a much more modest rate of gross margin improvement in 2011 that would be consistent with our long-term goals.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12% in the fourth quarter and rose 13% in the full year. Much of the increase was due to higher staffing and occupancy costs, fixed and variable in new and existing stores, but marketing spending also increased substantially as we had planned throughout the year. In fact, the marketing-to-sales ratio increased as we had expected from 5.9% in 2009 to 6.4% in 2010. SG&A growth also included $6.1 million in the quarter and $16.6 million in the year of non-recurring expenses related to the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. 
Excluding the non-recurring expenses, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 35.1% in the quarter and 39.2% in the year, both of which represented improvement from 35.8% and 40.2% in 2009. Approximately 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, so strong sales growth provides us with the ability to leverage those costs and further improve the expense ratio.
Adding this up, Tiffany's operating margin in the full year increased 300 basis points to 19.3% in 2010 and was 19.8% when excluding non-recurring items. Other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, declined modestly in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Tiffany's effective tax rate was 32.1% in the fourth quarter versus 34.2% last year. For the year, the rate came in at 32.7% due to some non-recurring items versus 31.9% last year, which had also included the recording of some favorable tax reserve adjustments. Bottom line, Tiffany's net earnings from continuing operations increased 31% in the fourth quarter and rose 39% to $368 million or $2.87 per diluted share in the year.
Excluding non-recurring items in 2010 and 2009, net earnings rose 47% in the year. We achieved an 18% return on average stockholders' equity and a 10% return on average assets, both of which achieved our performance objectives, and we are confident in our long-term ability to sustain strong returns.
Strong sales growth requires an efficient infrastructure behind the scenes to support that expansion, and most of you know that we have made substantial investments over the past decade, which continued to benefit us in 2010. Our internal manufacturing facilities produced approximately 60% of Tiffany merchandise sold. We've expanded our U.S.-based manufacturing operations into Lexington, Kentucky in temporary space and will soon open a 25,000 square-foot facility that will employ 125 skilled craftspeople and provide us with increased jewelry production capacity beyond the facilities we have in New York and Rhode Island.
Our two major distribution centers in New Jersey are also working very well, with one that is efficiently handling worldwide store replenishment and the other that processes direct-to-customer shipments. There is room for additional capacity utilization in both facilities, which will contribute to improved profitability. And our diamond sourcing organization is successfully operating globally to source and fulfill Tiffany's steadily increasing requirements for high quality diamond supply. 
We finished the year with a strong balance sheet that positions us very well competitively. In fact, cash and short-term investments exceeded total debt. At January 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $741 million versus $786 million at the prior year end. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $688 million at January 31 versus $754 million a year ago. During the year, we paid off $219 million of maturing long-term debt and entered into $118 million at issuance of new long-term debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. Stockholders' equity rose to almost $2.2 billion at the end of 2010 from almost $1.9 billion a year ago. And that put the debt-to-equity ratio at 32% at year end versus 40% a year ago. And in 2010, Tiffany generated $172 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures.
Reflecting that financial strength, Tiffany's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend twice in 2010 for a cumulative increase of 47%. The board also recently approved the new share repurchase plan to replace a plan that was set to expire, authorizing repurchases of up to $400 million through January of 2013. In 2010, we spent $81 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares at an average cost of $43.83 per share, with most of that spending occurring under the expiring plan. At January 31, $392 million remained available for future repurchases.
Net inventories increased 14% in 2010. That was comprised of a 9% increase in finished goods inventories and a 22% increase in raw material and work-in-process inventories to support sales growth, new stores, new product launches and higher product acquisition costs. Foreign currency translation was a small portion of the overall 14% inventory increase, and we intend to maintain very high inventory availability in our stores going forward.
For 2011, our plans call for net inventories to increase by more than 15% for several reasons: First, to support planned sales growth; second, for new store openings; third, for additional investments in high-end statement jewelry; and fourth, to further increase purchases of rough diamonds as we pursue our vertical integration strategy that provides supply and related cost benefits.
Accounts receivable rose 17% in 2010 with about five points of the increase due to foreign currency translation. Receivables turnover stayed at a healthy 18x per year. Capital expenditures in 2010 came in at $127 million or 4.1% of net sales, which was up from depressed spending of $75 million in 2009 when we cut back on all nonessential spending. However, CapEx in 2010 was lower than our initial projection of $200 million mostly due to delayed spending on certain projects, especially on the New York relocation that will be incurred in 2011. Therefore, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million in 2011, which would represent 7% to 8% of total sales and is relative to our long-term projected CapEx of 6% to 7% of sales. 
We are now providing you with our first outlook for 2011. Now let's look at the components of our annual sales and earnings guidance for 2011. I should begin by pointing out that the financial projections for the year that we are sharing with you today incorporate some effect in the first quarter from the devastating events in Japan on March 11. Specifically, we are projecting worldwide net sales to increase 12% to 14% in 2011. 
Looking at it by geographic region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage with comps up high single digits and combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas also increasing by a high single-digit percentage. We expect sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a mid-teens percentage. In Japan, we are projecting total and comp store sales to decline by a mid-single digit percentage for the year in dollars and yen, factoring in the current events in Japan that are affecting our first quarter sales there. And in Europe, we expect sales to increase by more than 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a low double-digit percentage.
In addition, we are projecting Other sales to increase by more than 30% due to strong growth in wholesale sales to distributors, primarily in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, while we expect only a modest increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. We are not looking for any significant differences in total sales growth by quarter except for slightly stronger growth in the second quarter as we consider the year-over-year comparisons. In addition, these sales projections assume no meaningful changes in foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar from the rates at the start of the year.
Moving down the earnings statement, we are looking for gross margin to increase by a couple of tenths of a point. We have addressed higher product costs with recent retail price increases in many product categories, and there could be other increases later in the year as well, if necessary. We cannot identify any meaningful resistance to the price increases in that customers are knowledgeable of higher costs and understand the need for us to address it. Other jewelers have also been affected by higher costs, and we assume they are also increasing their prices, so Tiffany's competitive position remains strong.
We are also looking for SG&A expenses to increase about 12% to 13% in total 2011. This excludes non-recurring items related to the upcoming New York headquarters staff relocation. These items specifically relate to incremental rental costs and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets, as well as a charge associated with the non-cancelable obligations remaining under the existing leases, which are expected to total about $40 million or $0.19 per diluted share after-tax, with most of the charge being recorded in the second quarter when we relocate. 
SG&A expense growth also reflects marketing spending that will increase somewhat faster than sales growth, so that the marketing to sales ratio continues to move higher. With the sales growth that we are projecting, this should result in a few tenths of a point improvement in the expense ratio excluding non-recurring items, and this will take the operating margin to just above 20% when excluding non-recurring items.
We are projecting other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, to be relatively unchanged at about $46 million for the year. We expect Tiffany's effective tax rate to come in at about 34% for the full year. Therefore, we are now projecting net earnings, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 14% to 18%, and earnings per diluted share increasing to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. 
As you know, we typically do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis but will do so for this first quarter in light of the significant events in Japan. As such, we expect that first quarter earnings per diluted share, excluding non-recurring items, will be reduced by approximately $0.05 per share from our initial expectation of $0.62 per diluted share to approximately $0.57 per diluted share versus $0.48 per share in last year's first quarter excluding non-recurring items. We cannot provide any forecast for Japan for subsequent quarters, so our expectation for the second, third and fourth quarter continues to call for sales roughly equal to the prior year in Japan. 
Lastly, we are assuming that the share count will be roughly unchanged at about 128 million shares as share repurchases offset the effect of option exercises. We believe that Tiffany has the necessary ingredients to achieve solid performance in 2011, and now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mike."

At the risk of repeating what's already been said, Tiffany truly prospered in 2010, achieving strong and better-than-expected sale and earnings growth. Our business began to strengthen in the latter part of 2009, and the rebound gained moment",988,"Thanks, Jim. At the risk of repeating what's already been said, Tiffany truly prospered in 2010, achieving strong and better-than-expected sale and earnings growth. Our business began to strengthen in the latter part of 2009, and the rebound gained momentum during 2010. We're immensely proud of the accomplishments of the more than 9,000 Tiffany employees who are responsible for that success. Our results clearly demonstrate the power of a global expansion program that has provided a platform for robust and sustainable growth as an international luxury brand. In 2010, we expanded our store base, increased our e-commerce reach and communicated Tiffany's message across an ever wider global audience.
For the first time, worldwide sales are now essentially equally divided between the United States and the rest of the world. With 233 company-operated stores in 22 countries along with independently operated locations in additional 30 countries, we have a solid base of distribution to serve increasing numbers of global customers, and that base will continue to grow. 
Specifically, in 2011, we are planning to open 21 stores. This will include eight stores in the Americas, with plans for four United States stores. We've already announced Northbrook, Illinois in Richmond, Virginia, three in Canada in Calgary and two additional cities, and we hope to finalize plans for a store in Brasilia to expand our growing presence in the important market of Brazil. We are planning to open eight stores in Asia-Pacific, including four stores in China, three in Korea and one in Taiwan. And we are planning five stores in Europe, including both in Zürich and Frankfurt Airports, along with additional stores in France and Italy. In total, this will represent a 9% increase in the number of company-operated locations and a 5% increase in square footage. 
We also expect to derive continuing sales benefits from Tiffany's expanded Internet presence. This will enable us to reach customers who appreciate e-commerce convenience, whether they live far or near to our store, recognizing, however, that no online experience, however extraordinary, can replicate the outstanding Tiffany in-store experience.
In addition, we believe there's important growth potential in emerging markets like the Middle East and in Russia where Tiffany's distribution is currently managed through third parties. Our total wholesale sales of products in those markets and other markets in 2010 represented only 3% of worldwide sales, and we believe there is much untapped growth potential. And we hope to soon finalize plans for Tiffany to enter India.
We have a very full pipeline of exciting new designs for 2011 in a full range of material and price points. A few highlights include our new collection of locks, pendants and bracelets executed in silver, gold and platinum, with prices ranging from $100 to $10,000. We are also excited that this year, Elsa Peretti is reintroducing and expanding her bottle collection, an iconic pendant design that dates back more than 30 years. We are also looking forward to an important new collection from Paloma Picasso. There will, of course, be many, many additional new jewelry designs introduced in 2011. There will also be expanded assortments in personal accessories, building on the successful launch of our handbag collection, as well as in sunglasses. 
Regarding watches, while sales in Tiffany's own stores have been strong, we have been disappointed with the slower-than-expected rollout of wholesale watch distribution. As we have indicated for some time, while over the short to medium term we expected contribution to sales and earnings from watches is minimal, over the long term, we remain hopeful about the ultimate potential of the Watch business. We are also hopeful that our differences with our watch partner can be resolved collaboratively and professionally. 
Finally, we continue to look to grow our high-end Statement business by strengthening and strategically redeploying our inventory assortment with a special emphasis on taking maximum advantage of the newly completed jewel salon in our flagship store as a global destination for the most spectacularly crafted jewelry in the world.
Regarding margins, Tiffany and the entire jewelry industry are continuing to deal with higher product input costs for precious metals and diamond. However, we have successfully increased retail prices to offset those costs, and we believe that the combination of Tiffany's pricing power and strong competitive position will allow us to do so, if necessary, again in the future. 
Our marketing communications will reach a growing base of potential customers around the world through print media and various forms of electronic communication, and we are beginning to formulate our plan to commemorate in 2012 the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding in 1837. We continue to monitor the events in Japan and the continued safety of our more than 700 employees and their families there. Our thoughts are with all of the people of Japan.
On a worldwide basis, I believe we have planned our business prudently for all of 2011 with a healthy rate of store expansion into attractive new markets and underserved existing markets and with a rate of spending to support that growth and further invest in strengthening Tiffany's worldwide competitive position. And of course, given our organization and financial strength, we will maintain our long-term strategic focus of continuing to build upon the foundation of one of the world's great brands. 
Lastly, we are excited about relocating our New York headquarters staff in the coming months to a location at Fifth Avenue in 23rd Street. As we previously said, it will provide organizational efficiencies with substantial long-term cost savings. We look forward to welcoming many of you there. 
Thank you for listening to our review of 2010 and our plans for 2011. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year. Please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 26. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions. That concludes today's call. Thank you for your ongoing interest."

Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now we can proceed. Tiffany performed strongly in 2010, and we presume you will agree with that assessment. It was a year in which we saw solid sales growth across most regions, with the strongest growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, leading to a sales mix where non-U.S. sales slightly exceeded U.S. sales in the year.
In 2010, we also achieved excellent gross margin gains and maintained prudent expense control, and net earnings increased 39% to $2.87 per diluted share. However, excluding non-recurring items, net earnings came in at $2.93 per diluted share, which was above the outlook of $2.83 to $2.88 that we provided when we reported holiday sales due to stronger-than-expected results in January. 
For one additional perspective, note that EPS came in considerably higher than the initial outlook of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share that we provided a year ago, and our balance sheet remained very strong.
Let's begin by reviewing sales by region. In the Americas, sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter as an increase in the average price per unit sold was partly offset by a small decline in units due to lower silver jewelry sales. Comp store sales were up 8% on top of the 10% increase last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the fourth quarter, while brand store comps rose 9% due to generally broad-based increases as well as outside increases in Hawaii and Guam due to strong tourist spending.
For the full year, sales rose 12% in the Americas, representing 51% of worldwide sales, and increased 11% on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to comp growth of 8% on top of a 14% decline last year and the incremental sales from new stores. Just to remind you, Americas' comps by quarter rose 15%, 5% and 5% in the first, second and third quarters versus declines in the first three quarters of 2009 of 32%, 25% and 10%.
Full year sales in our New York flagship store rose 6% and represented 8% of worldwide sales. Americas' brand store comps rose 8%. You might be interested to know that outside of the New York flagship store, the five largest volume branch stores in the Americas in 2010 were in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California; San Francisco; Chicago; Bloor Street in Toronto; and Washington, D.C. In terms of customer mix, sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven more by local customer sales and, to a lesser degree, by foreign tourist sales.
Full year sales growth was skewed more towards foreign tourist spending, with local customer sales increasing to a smaller extent. Sales to foreign tourists in 2010 represented 17% of U.S. retail store sales versus 15% in 2009 and 16% in 2008. I should add that the 17% of U.S. sales made to foreign tourists are to a diverse mix of customers, with more than a quarter of those sales made to European tourists and a bit less than a quarter to Japanese visitors.
We finished 2010 with 84 U.S. stores, which included five new stores opened in the second half of the year in Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; a second store in Houston, Texas in The Woodlands; and two additional stores in the Los Angeles market in the Beverly Center in L.A.; and in Santa Monica. We're pleased to report that they've all performed well in their initial months. 
In the Americas, we also have 12 Tiffany stores spread among Canada, Mexico and Brazil. All three countries posted solid sales growth in the fourth quarter and full year, and we have some exciting store expansion plans.
Rounding out the Americas, our Tiffany's e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 8% in both the fourth quarter and the year due to increased spending per order. We continue to believe that Tiffany's Internet presence and the increasing use of digital and mobile technology as well as catalogs, serve as effective sales vehicles and as important marketing tools to attract customers into our stores. We increased catalog circulation by about 10% to 14 million books in 2010 and intend to increase mailings by about 5% in 2011.
Let's now look at sales performance in the other half of our business. Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific, where business was strong all year. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 25% due to increased average price per unit sold, and jewelry unit volume also increased.
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the quarter rose 21%, and comps rose 16% on top of a huge 24% comp increase last year. The strongest comps were in Hong Kong and Macau. Asia-Pacific comps in the first three quarters of 2010 had increased 21%, 7% and 11% compared with 2009 when comps declined 5% in the first quarter and then increased 5% and 9% in the second and third quarters.
For the full year, Asia-Pacific sales rose 29% and represented 18% of worldwide sales. Total sales in local currencies increased 23%, and comp store sales increased 14% on top of an 8% increase in 2009. Performance within the region was strong in most countries throughout the year, although sales growth was strongest in the Greater China market. In addition, Greater China represented slightly more than half of the Asia-Pacific region sales, while sales in Mainland China alone represented about 10% of the region.
You might be interested to know that the three highest volume stores in Asia-Pacific in 2010 were in Singapore's Ngee Ann City, in Australia in Sydney and in Hong Kong on Canton Road. At year end, we operated 52 Tiffany stores in Asia-Pacific, which included seven new stores opened in 2010, ranging from four new stores in China, one in Beijing, one in Kunming and two in Shanghai, to one each in Seoul, Singapore and Taipei. We also focused a considerable amount of marketing spending on China to build brand awareness in that increasingly important country. That growing awareness is not only resulting in increased customer purchasing in China but also an increased spending by Chinese tourists when they visit other countries in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe.
The next region to review is Japan, which represented 18% of worldwide sales in 2010. Total sales rose 7% in 2010, but all of the increase was attributable to the translation effect from a stronger yen, which was 8% stronger than the prior year. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Japan sales in the year declined 1%, and comp store sales declined 4%. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 11% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold partly offset by lower units. We began to see improved results in Japan in the last several months of 2010. Specifically, local currency total sales in Japan rose 2% in the fourth quarter, and comps rose 1% versus a 9% decline last year. Comparable store sales in Japan, which turned positive in October, were also up in November and December then dipped in January but were then positive until the earthquake and tsunami on March 11.
Comps in Japan by quarter had declined 10%, 7% and 2% in the first, second and third quarters compared with prior-year declines of 13%, 11% and 13%. We opened one new department store boutique and closed two locations in 2010 as part of our long-term plan to address some underperforming locations and maintain strong profitability, and we operated 56 locations at year end.
We are saddened by the recent earthquake and tsunami, and our thoughts are with the people of Japan. We are pleased to report that all of our more than 700 Tiffany colleagues are safe. As noted in today's news release, most stores in the Kanto and Tohoku regions, which include Sendai and Tokyo, were closed last week but reopened over the past weekend. We have adjusted our financial expectations only for the first quarter based on assumptions of some continued business disruptions through the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to Europe, which posted excellent results in the fourth quarter. Total European sales rose 14% in the fourth quarter due to increased unit volume. However, on the more meaningful constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 21%, and comp store sales increased 16%, which was on top of a 14% increase last year, and resulted from strong growth in the U.K. and across most of the continent.
Sales growth was consistently strong throughout the fourth quarter. In the full year, European sales rose 18% and represented 12% of worldwide sales. In constant currencies, total sales in the year rose 23%, and comp store sales rose 18% due to solid growth in most markets. European comps were strong all year with increases of 14%, 21% and 24% in the first, second and third quarters on top of prior-year increases of 3%, 5% and 9%. We currently operate 29 Tiffany stores in Europe, including new stores we opened in the second half of 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona.
Retail store sales in the U.K. were about 45% of European retail store sales in 2010. The three highest volume European stores in 2010 were on London's Old Bond Street, and in Italy in Milan and Rome. We introduced e-commerce in eight continental European countries in mid-2010 and are very pleased with sales results and with the enhanced brand awareness that we derived from a stronger Internet presence.
So we finished 2010 operating 233 Tiffany stores versus 220 in the prior year. Worldwide gross square footage in 2010 rose 5% to slightly over 1 million square feet. We achieved higher sales productivity in all regions in 2010. Sales per gross square foot in the Americas rose to $2,100 in 2010 from $1,900, which included sales productivity of $5,400 per square foot in the New York flagship store. In Japan, sales productivity rose to $3,500 from $3,300. In Asia-Pacific, it increased to $4,000 from $3,800. And in Europe, it increased to $3,000 from $2,700. For the total company, sales per gross square foot rose to $2,600 from $2,400 in 2009. 
And beyond our stores, worldwide e-commerce included in our four segments has become a meaningful contributor to our overall sales. In fact, total e-commerce sales represented 6% of worldwide sales in 2010 and 2009 and accounted for 8% of total sales in the countries where we have an Internet presence. We continue to believe that the percentage can move a bit higher in the future. 
Rounding out the sales review is our Other segment in which sales declined 30% in the quarter and rose 2% in the year. This segment is largely composed of two pieces: wholesale sales of products to third parties who operate Tiffany stores, mostly in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, as well as wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program. The 30% decline in Other sales in the quarter was more than entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. The 2% increase in the year reflected an increase in emerging market sales, mostly offset by a decline in diamond sales. 
One cannot fully review the year without highlighting some of our merchandising successes in 2010. We were pleased to see relatively broad-based sales growth across most product categories. Diamond engagement jewelry sales were strong. Fine and fashion gold jewelry, such as Tiffany’s Victoria collection, Celebration Rings and our Metro collection performed well, reflecting strength of higher-end transactions in diamonds, platinum and gold. We are very pleased with the introduction and success of the new and extraordinary yellow diamond collection, which we expect will be successful for many years, as well as Tiffany's new Garden jewelry collection. 
Worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly due to what we think is macro-related softness in the Americas. In fact, the weakness in silver jewelry sales in the U.S. was the reason that the under-$500 price strata declined in the U.S., while all of the higher price point strata rose. Our Keys Collection, which spans multiple materials and prices, remained very popular, and we added new styles as well, although overall growth was muted by comparison to the incredibly strong launch in 2009. The designer jewelry category did well, reflecting the success of Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh collection and the ongoing popularity of Elsa Peretti's Diamonds by the Yard collection, among many others. 
We are very pleased with the initial success of our new leather collection, and Tiffany brand watch sales grew more than 30% in our own stores. So that covers the sales review. I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a look at the rest of the earnings statement and specifically the components of stronger growth in the operating margin."
35576,118106788,111851,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2011",2011-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continued to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60",1929,"Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continued to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60.9% compared with 58.7% last year. For the full year, gross margin increased 260 basis points to 59.1%. In both the quarter and year, the increased gross margins were primarily due to the recapture of two years of higher product costs through retail price increases early in 2010, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales.
Those fixed costs include distribution centers and our merchandising and diamond sourcing organizations. We also increased prices in January of 2011 in many categories to offset cost increases, but we expect a much more modest rate of gross margin improvement in 2011 that would be consistent with our long-term goals.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12% in the fourth quarter and rose 13% in the full year. Much of the increase was due to higher staffing and occupancy costs, fixed and variable, in new and existing stores, but marketing spending also increased substantially as we had planned throughout the year. In fact, the marketing-to-sales ratio increased as we had expected from 5.9% in 2009 to 6.4% in 2010. SG&A growth also included $6.1 million in the quarter and $16.6 million in the year of non-recurring expenses related to the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. 
Excluding the non-recurring expenses, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 35.1% in the quarter and 39.2% in the year, both of which represented improvement from 35.8% and 40.2% in 2009. Approximately 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, so strong sales growth provides us with the ability to leverage those costs and further improve the expense ratio.
Adding this up, Tiffany's operating margin in the full year increased 300 basis points to 19.3% in 2010 and was 19.8% when excluding non-recurrent items. Other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, declined modestly in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Tiffany's effective tax rate was 32.1% in the fourth quarter versus 34.2% last year. For the year, the rate came in at 32.7% due to some non-recurring items versus 31.9% last year, which had also included the recording of some favorable tax reserve adjustments. Bottom line, Tiffany's net earnings from continuing operations increased 31% in the fourth quarter and rose 39% to $368 million or $2.87 per diluted share in the year.
Excluding non-recurring items in 2010 and 2009, net earnings rose 47% in the year. We achieved an 18% return on average stockholders' equity and a 10% return on average assets, both of which achieved our performance objectives, and we are confident in our long-term ability to sustain strong returns.
Strong sales growth requires an efficient infrastructure behind the scenes to support that expansion, and most of you know that we have made substantial investments over the past decade, which continued to benefit us in 2010. Our internal manufacturing facilities produced approximately 60% of Tiffany merchandise sold. We've expanded our U.S.-based manufacturing operations into Lexington, Kentucky in temporary space and will soon open a 25,000 square-foot facility that will employ 125 skilled craftspeople and provide us with increased jewelry production capacity beyond the facilities we have in New York and Rhode Island.
Our two major distribution centers in New Jersey are also working very well, with one that is efficiently handling worldwide store replenishment and the other that processes direct-to-customer shipments. There is room for additional capacity utilization in both facilities, which will contribute to improved profitability. And our diamond sourcing organization is successfully operating globally to source and fulfill Tiffany's steadily increasing requirements for high quality diamond supply. 
We finished the year with a strong balance sheet that positions us very well competitively. In fact, cash and short-term investments exceeded total debt. At January 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $741 million versus $786 million at the prior year end. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $688 million at January 31 versus $754 million a year ago. During the year, we paid off $219 million of maturing long-term debt and entered into $118 million at issuance of new long-term debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. Stockholders' equity rose to almost $2.2 billion at the end of 2010 from almost $1.9 billion a year ago. And that put the debt-to-equity ratio at 32% at year end versus 40% a year ago. And in 2010, Tiffany generated $172 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures.
Reflecting that financial strength, Tiffany's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend twice in 2010 for a cumulative increase of 47%. The board also recently approved the new share repurchase plan to replace a plan that was set to expire, authorizing repurchases of up to $400 million through January of 2013. In 2010, we spent $81 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares at an average cost of $43.83 per share, with most of that spending occurring under the expiring plan. At January 31, $392 million remained available for future repurchases.
Net inventories increased 14% in 2010. That was comprised of a 9% increase in finished goods inventories and a 22% increase in raw material and work-in-process inventories to support sales growth, new stores, new product launches and higher product acquisition costs. Foreign currency translation was a small portion of the overall 14% inventory increase, and we intend to maintain very high inventory availability in our stores going forward.
For 2011, our plans call for net inventories to increase by more than 15% for several reasons: First, to support planned sales growth; second, for new store openings; third, for additional investments in high-end statement jewelry; and fourth, to further increase purchases of rough diamonds as we pursue our vertical integration strategy that provides supply and related cost benefits.
Accounts receivable rose 17% in 2010 with about five points of the increase due to foreign currency translation. Receivables turnover stayed at a healthy 18x per year. Capital expenditures in 2010 came in at $127 million or 4.1% of net sales, which was up from depressed spending of $75 million in 2009 when we cut back on all nonessential spending. However, CapEx in 2010 was lower than our initial projection of $200 million, mostly due to delayed spending on certain projects, especially on the New York relocation that will be incurred in 2011. Therefore, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million in 2011, which would represent 7% to 8% of total sales and is relative to our long-term projected CapEx of 6% to 7% of sales. 
We are now providing you with our first outlook for 2011. Now let's look at the components of our annual sales and earnings guidance for 2011. I should begin by pointing out that the financial projections for the year that we are sharing with you today incorporate some effect in the first quarter from the devastating events in Japan on March 11. Specifically, we are projecting worldwide net sales to increase 12% to 14% in 2011. 
Looking at it by geographic region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage with comps up high single digits and combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas also increasing by a high single-digit percentage. We expect sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a mid-teens percentage. In Japan, we are projecting total and comp store sales to decline by a mid-single digit percentage for the year in dollars and yen, factoring in the current events in Japan that are affecting our first quarter sales there. And in Europe, we expect sales to increase by more than 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a low double-digit percentage.
In addition, we are projecting Other sales to increase by more than 30% due to strong growth in wholesale sales to distributors, primarily in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, while we expect only a modest increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. We are not looking for any significant differences in total sales growth by quarter except for slightly stronger growth in the second quarter as we consider the year-over-year comparisons. In addition, these sales projections assume no meaningful changes in foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar from the rates at the start of the year.
Moving down the earnings statement, we are looking for gross margin to increase by a couple of tenths of a point. We have addressed higher product costs with recent retail price increases in many product categories, and there could be other increases later in the year as well, if necessary. We cannot identify any meaningful resistance to the price increases in that customers are knowledgeable of higher costs and understand the need for us to address it. Other jewelers have also been affected by higher costs, and we assume they are also increasing their prices, so Tiffany's competitive position remains strong.
We are also looking for SG&A expenses to increase about 12% to 13% in total 2011. This excludes non-recurring items related to the upcoming New York headquarters staff relocation. These items specifically relate to incremental rental costs and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets, as well as a charge associated with the non-cancelable obligations remaining under the existing leases, which are expected to total about $40 million or $0.19 per diluted share after-tax, with most of the charge being recorded in the second quarter when we relocate. 
SG&A expense growth also reflects marketing spending that will increase somewhat faster than sales growth, so that the marketing to sales ratio continues to move higher. With the sales growth that we are projecting, this should result in a few tenths of a point improvement in the expense ratio excluding non-recurring items, and this would take the operating margin to just above 20% when excluding non-recurring items.
We are projecting other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, to be relatively unchanged at about $46 million for the year. We expect Tiffany's effective tax rate to come in at about 34% for the full year. Therefore, we are now projecting net earnings, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 14% to 18%, and earnings per diluted share increasing to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. 
As you know, we typically do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis but will do so for this first quarter in light of the significant events in Japan. As such, we expect that first quarter earnings per diluted share, excluding non-recurring items, will be reduced by approximately $0.05 per share from our initial expectation of $0.62 per diluted share to approximately $0.57 per diluted share versus $0.48 per share in last year's first quarter excluding non-recurring items. We cannot provide any forecast for Japan for subsequent quarters, so our expectation for the second, third and fourth quarter continues to call for sales roughly equal to the prior year in Japan. 
Lastly, we are assuming that the share count will be roughly unchanged at about 128 million shares as share repurchases offset the effect of option exercises. We believe that Tiffany has the necessary ingredients to achieve solid performance in 2011, and now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mike."

At the risk of repeating what's already been said, Tiffany truly prospered in 2010, achieving strong and better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. Our business began to strengthen in the latter part of 2009, and the rebound gained momentum during 2010. We're immensely proud of the accomplishments of the more than 9,000 Tiffany employees who are responsible for that success. Our results clearly demonstrate the power of a global expansion program that has provided a platform for robust and sustainable growth as an international luxury brand. In 2010, we expanded our store base, increased our e-commerce reach and communicated Tiffany's message across an ever wider global audience.
For the first time, worldwide sales are now essentially equally divided between the United States and the rest of the world. With 233 company-operated stores in 22 countries along with independently operated locations in additional 30 countries, we have a solid base of distribution to serve increasing numbers of global customers, and that base will continue to grow. 
Specifically, in 2011, we are planning to open 21 stores. This will include eight stores in the Americas, with plans for four United States stores. We've already announced Northbrook, Illinois and Richmond, Virginia; three in Canada, in Calgary and two additional cities; and we hope to finalize plans for a store in Brasilia to expand our growing presence in the important market of Brazil. We are planning to open eight stores in Asia-Pacific, including four stores in China, three in Korea and one in Taiwan. And we are planning five stores in Europe, including both the Zürich and Frankfurt Airports, along with additional stores in France and Italy. In total, this will represent a 9% increase in the number of company-operated locations and a 5% increase in square footage. 
We also expect to derive continuing sales benefits from Tiffany's expanded Internet presence. This will enable us to reach customers who appreciate e-commerce convenience, whether they live far or near to our store, recognizing, however, that no online experience, however extraordinary, can replicate the outstanding Tiffany in-store experience.
In addition, we believe there's important growth potential in emerging markets like the Middle East and in Russia where Tiffany's distribution is currently managed through third parties. Our total wholesale sales of products in those markets and other markets in 2010 represented only 3% of worldwide sales, and we believe there is much untapped growth potential. And we hope to soon finalize plans for Tiffany to enter India.
We have a very full pipeline of exciting new designs for 2011 in a full range of materials and price points. A few highlights include our new collection of locks, pendants and bracelets executed in silver, gold and platinum, with prices ranging from $100 to $10,000. We are also excited that this year, Elsa Peretti is reintroducing and expanding her bottle collection, an iconic pendant design that dates back more than 30 years. We are also looking forward to an important new collection from Paloma Picasso. There will, of course, be many, many additional new jewelry designs introduced in 2011. There will also be expanded assortments in personal accessories, building on the successful launch of our handbag collection, as well as in sunglasses. 
Regarding watches, while sales in Tiffany's own stores have been strong, we have been disappointed with the slower-than-expected rollout of wholesale watch distribution. As we have indicated for some time, while over the short to medium term, the expected contribution to sales and earnings from watches is minimal. Over the long term, we remain hopeful about the ultimate potential of the Watch business. We are also hopeful that our differences with our watch partner can be resolved collaboratively and professionally. 
Finally, we continue to look to grow our high-end Statement business by strengthening and strategically redeploying our inventory assortment with a special emphasis on taking maximum advantage of the newly completed jewel salon in our flagship store as a global destination for the most spectacularly crafted jewelry in the world.
Regarding margins, Tiffany and the entire jewelry industry are continuing to deal with higher product input costs for precious metals and diamonds. However, we have successfully increased retail prices to offset those costs, and we believe that the combination of Tiffany's pricing power and strong competitive position will allow us to do so, if necessary, again in the future. 
Our marketing communications will reach a growing base of potential customers around the world through print media and various forms of electronic communication, and we are beginning to formulate our plan to commemorate in 2012 the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding in 1837. We continue to monitor the events in Japan and the continued safety of our more than 700 employees and their families there. Our thoughts are with all of the people of Japan.
On a worldwide basis, I believe we have planned our business prudently for all of 2011 with a healthy rate of store expansion into attractive new markets and underserved existing markets and with a rate of spending to support that growth and further invest in strengthening Tiffany's worldwide competitive position. And of course, given our organization and financial strength, we will maintain our long-term strategic focus of continuing to build upon the foundation of one of the world's great brands. 
Lastly, we are excited about relocating our New York headquarters staff in the coming months to a location at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. As we previously said, it will provide organizational efficiencies with substantial long-term cost savings. We look forward to welcoming many of you there. 
Thank you for listening to our review of 2010 and our plans for 2011. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year. Please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 26. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions. That concludes today's call. Thank you for your ongoing interest."

Now we can proceed. In our opinion, Tiffany's first quarter results were nothing short of outstanding. Sales growth was strong in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific while sales in Japan were better than expected after the tragic earthquake and tsunami. And strong sales growth contributed to a higher than expected operating margin and net earnings, which led us to increase our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's begin by looking at sales in our geographical segment. Starting with the Americas, total sales increased 19% in the quarter, primarily due to, an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as higher unit volumes especially in engagement jewelry and other high end jewelry. Comparable store sales and constant currency rose 17% on top of a 15% increase last year. We achieved double digit comps in all 3 months, and the trend strengthened as the quarter progressed.
Geographically, we achieved solid sales growth in the U.S. as well as growth in Canada and Latin America. Sales in our New York flagship store rose by a strong 23%, which was on top of a 26% sales increase in last year's first quarter. Comparable Americas brand store sale rose 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. U.S. sales growth was solid from coast-to-coast. Interestingly, despite some speculation that sales in Hawaii and Guam would suffer from a decline in Japanese tourism following the earthquake, sales in that 6 store region rose more than 30% in the quarter. And from a customer mix perspective, the sales increase in the Americas came from higher spending by domestic customers and foreign visitors, which results are true in the New York flagship store. The 5 new stores opened in the past year in the Americas are performing well. We did not add any new stores in the first quarter although earlier this month, we opened a store in Northbrook, Illinois, representing our fourth store in the important Chicago market and a store in Calgary, Alberta, which represents our fourth company operated store in Canada. 
Our direct marketing sales in the Americas also did well in the quarter. Combined e-commerce and catalog sales rose 14% due to similar increases in the number of orders and in the average size per order. That was on top of a 23% sales increase last year.
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where sales rose 37% in the quarter due to increases both in the average price per unit sold and in the number of jewelry unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 31% and comparable store sales rose 26%, which was on top of a 21% comp last year. This was substantially better than we expected. Sales were consistently strong in most markets throughout the quarter, with noteworthy strength in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. 
I should also mentioned that we are pleased with the overall initial performance of the 7 new stores that we opened over the past year in that region. 
Now let's look at Japan, which has been a concern since the tragic earthquake and tsunami on March 11. Tiffany's business has improved there although the total sales increase of 7% was due to the translation of the end, which at 82 to the dollar in the quarter was 10% stronger than last year. We are currently forecasting the yen to remain in the 80s for the rest of the year. 
Excluding the translation effects, sales in Japan in yen in the quarter declined 3% both in total and on a comparable store basis, which compared with a 10% comp decline last year. This was still much better than what we expected when we last reported to you on March 21 during the time of considerable uncertainty. The sales trend in Japan during the quarter was understandably very volatile, with almost half of our stores closed for about a week after the earthquake. In fact, comps in Japan in yen increased 3% in February then declined 16% in March and finished the quarter with a 6% increase in April. This compared with declines of 10%, 10% and 9% in February, March and April of last year. Not surprisingly, sales were softer in the Northern Tohoku and centrally located Kanto regions, which were more directly affected by the earthquake and its aftereffects as opposed to the southwestern Kansai region. We would not be surprised with continued volatility in Japan sales for a while.
During the first quarter, we opened a new department store boutique in Hakata, and closed 2 department store boutiques in Kokura and Wakayama as we have planned and finished the quarter operating 55 locations in Japan. 
Now turning to Europe. Total sales increased 25% due to strong unit volume growth that exceeded an increase in the average price per unit sold. On the constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 19% and comparable store sales rose 15% on top of a 14% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This was slightly better than we expected and the intra quarter trend was strongest in April.
Geographically, we strong saw sales growth in most continental European countries with the greatest gains in France, Germany and Italy. Sales growth was more modest in the U.K. although sales there did strengthened later in the quarter. In the new stores we opened late last year in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona are exceeding our expectations.
Lastly, other sales declined 18% in the first quarter due to a decline as we expected in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. However, wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets rose strongly in the quarter.
Turning to some first quarter product highlights, the broad-based strength in our geographic segments was also true across most product categories. On a worldwide basis, all major jewelry categories posted double digit percentage growth in the quarter. At the high end, statement jewelry had a good increase. The fine and fashion jewelry categories performed very well, highlighted by Celebration Rings, the Metro and Victoria collections, Keys, Return to Tiffany and the relatively new Garden and Yellow Diamond collection. Engagement jewelry sales were strong as were gold jewelry sales.
There was also decent growth in silver jewelry sales for Tiffany's own designs, and we were pleased to see some growth in silver jewelry sales in the Americas as well. Sales of the design of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso rose nicely too. But the U.S. economic environment that is affecting spending by some of our silver jewelry customers at entry-level price points will likely remain challenging for a while.
In other categories, watch sales continued to post 30-plus percent growth in our own stores, and we're pleased with the Tiffany Leather collection. In fact, this year, we are expanding leather distribution into more of our stores in the Americas and to some stores in other regions. As an example, we launched the Leather Collection in a few stores and in Japan in April and are quite pleased with initial results. So that covers the sales review. 
Looking at the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin in the first quarter rose to 5.10% to 58.3% from 57.8% last year, primarily due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and sales leverage on fixed costs. Conversely, changes in product mix and higher product costs had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. As we previously reported we raised retail prices in many product categories earlier in the year to mitigate substantial increases in precious metal and diamond costs. You should of course keep in mind that the labor costs component is increasing to a lesser degree. In any case, customers are certainly aware of rising commodity costs, and we have not experienced any meaningful resistance to higher prices.
SG&A expenses rose 18% in the quarter, largely due to higher occupancy costs for new and existing stores, increased staffing and increased marketing spending.
SG&A expenses also included $8 million or $0.04 per share after-tax of non-recurring items for the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Those expense relate to accelerated depreciation and property and equipment, incremental rent during this transition period until they move occurs in the second quarter and payments related to terminating leases for certain floors that we will soon be vacating. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved by 0.7 to 40.4% in the quarter versus 41.1% last year. However, if you exclude the non-recurring items from SG&A expenses the ratio would've improved the year-over-year by 1.6 points. 
Based on the strong sales growth and our gross margin and SG&A expense performance, we achieved a substantial increase in operating margin in the quarter. In fact, the operating improved 1.3 points over last year and excluding non-recurring items, it improved at even greater 2.1 points over last year.
Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense was slightly lower in the quarter, in the effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter. 
Last year's effective tax rate of 30.9% reflected in non-recurring net tax benefit primarily related to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries, which had benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in the first quarter of last year. 
Adding it all up, Tiffany's net earnings increased 26% in the quarter, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. Excluding non-recurring items in both years, net earnings rose 39% and EPS was $0.67. This was above our previously stated guidance of $0.57 per share for the first quarter, which also excluded non-recurring items.
Lastly, return on average assets and return on average stockholders equity are 11% and 18%, respectively. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jim."

I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business",1426,"Thanks, Mark. I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business. I'd like to address both these areas.
Tiffany finished the quarter with $622 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total short-term and long-term debt was $687 million. 
In April, we paid off a JPY 5 billion or $59 million, 4.5% long term loan that matured. Total debt to stockholders' equity was 30% at April 30
versus 39% at April 30, 2010. We are using Tiffany's strong balance sheet to expand our business while also returning some of the cash to stockholders. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 17% higher than a year ago due to sales growth, new stores, new products and higher product acquisition costs. I should also add that about a quarter of the inventory increase was due to foreign exchange translation. We are projecting inventories to increase at least 15% this year to support anticipated sales demand and the 19 new stores we plan to open.
In addition, we are increasing our statement jewelry inventory to strengthen our assortments in key markets around the world, and we intend to opportunistically increase our purchases of rough diamonds. 
Accounts receivable at April 30 were up 26% from a year ago, primarily due to the strong sales growth as well as some effects from foreign currency translation. Receivables continue to turn at a high 18x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million in the first quarter versus $26 million last year. We expect that CapEx will increase to approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010 due to a variety of factors including a higher number of store openings this year, renovations of existing stores, which in some cases reflect the catch up for 2 years of deferred spending; and lastly, the relocation of our New York headquarters staff to a new office facility. 
In our share buyback program we spent $28 million in the first quarter to repurchase approximately 453,000 shares at an average cost of $61.68 per share. And that leaves us with $364 million of remaining capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January of 2013.
Last week, Tiffany's Board of Directors expressed its confidence by approving a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. Taking the rate to $0.29 per share or an annual rate of $1.16 per share. That represented the ninth dividend increase in the past 9 years. 
I alluded earlier to Tiffany's infrastructure because it places a key role in the execution of our growth plans. Our centralized distribution centers are very effectively hemming worldwide shipments of products to our stores and our customers. Our internal manufacturing facilities in New York and Rhode Island last year produced 60% of the products we sold. We have recently expanded our U.S. production capacity in Lexington, Kentucky with the hiring of skilled workers and will soon move from the temporary space there to a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility. 
And our diamond sourcing organization has developed a global reach to ensure that Tiffany has the necessary supply of the highest quality diamonds for our customers. We are excited about the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff in a few weeks to 200 Fifth Avenue on 23rd Street. The new location will allow us to operate more efficiently and we anticipate meaningful cost savings over the lease term. 
Now let's turn to our financial outlook. The results we reported today unquestionably represented a terrific start to the year and we have factored them into our thought process for the rest of the year. At the same time, the first quarter represents a small sales quarter of the year and with lingering macroeconomic uncertainties we do not want to get ahead of ourselves in our full year outlook.
Our initial plan for the year included solid sales growth in all regions except Japan and we continue to expect that. 
For the full year by region, we look for sales in the Americas to increase by a mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low double digit percentage; in Asia-Pacific, we expect sales to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up about 20%. We are also looking for sales in Europe to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up by a low double digit percentage. For Japan, we were previously expecting a mid-single digit decline for the year as we expected, a substantial decline in the first quarter as a result of the earthquake. We truly appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in Japan during such a challenging experience. There obviously still uncertainties in Japan and the potential for disruptions and reduced store hours in the coming months related to any power shortages, as well as economic challenges. But based on the better than expected results we saw in the first quarter, our Japan sales plan for the year now calls for just a modest total sales decline in dollars and a roughly similar decline in comps in yen with no significant variability in the second, third and fourth quarters.
And we expect that other sales to increase about 25%. We are now planning to open 19 new customer operated stores this year and in Japan we reduced our locations by one, representing an overall 8% increase in our worldwide store base. We were previously forecasting 21 new stores for this year, but one in the U.S. and one in Europe have been delayed until next year. In Europe, we now plan to open 4 stores this year including second stores in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as a store in Nice. In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open 8 stores and in the Americas, we plan to open 7 stores including a recently opened stores in Calgary and North Brook, as well as stores in Richmond and the fashion show mall in Las Vegas among others. 
Also in the U.S., later this year, we are planning to relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to a smaller and we believe better location at the nearby mall at Chestnut Hill. 
In terms of margin assumptions for the full year, we expect the operating margins to improve about 0.5 point excluding non-recurring items coming from improvement in both the SG&A ratio and gross margin primarily type to sales leverage on fixed costs. 
As everyone knows precious metal and diamond costs increased dramatically in 2010 and it continues to move higher this year. We plan to continue to take price increases in various categories and across varies country locations to offset the higher costs, and we also expect other expenses net for about $45 million an effective tax rate of 34%. But based on these better-than-expected first quarter results, our full year outlook now calls for our earnings per diluted share to increase 18% to 21% to a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, not including the non-recurring expenses of about $0.19 per share. 
Our previous outlook calls for EPS in a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, which also does not include the non-recurring expenses. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the second quarter is continuing to exceed our expectation with a solid performance in those regions. 
In addition to the new store openings I mentioned, we will have an active line up of new product introductions highlighted by the new Tiffany locks collection, which is enjoying a very strong start. Other new designs include Tiffany twist, a new collection in 18 karat gold and sterling silver and we are excited about the revival of Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of pendants, which was our first jewelry designed is now offered an expanded and distinctive assortment. And we will continue to expand our marketing communications to customers and reinforce Tiffany's brand message, an exciting in new markets for both print and digital media. 
I'll close by saying that these first quarter results were a great way to start the year and we certainly have reasons to be optimistic about the future. 
Thank you for listening to our call today and please feel free to call Mark with any questions and please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's Second Quarter Results on Friday, August 26. And that concludes today's call."

Now we can proceed. In our opinion, Tiffany's first quarter results were nothing short of outstanding. Sales growth was strong in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific while sales in Japan were better than expected after the tragic earthquake and tsunami. And strong sales growth contributed to a higher than expected operating margin and net earnings, which led us to increase our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's begin by looking at sales in our geographical segment. Starting with the Americas, total sales increased 19% in the quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as higher unit volumes, especially in engagement jewelry and other high-end jewelry. Comparable store sales and constant currency rose 17% on top of a 15% increase last year. We achieved double-digit comps in all 3 months, and the trend strengthened as the quarter progressed.
Geographically, we achieved solid sales growth in the U.S. as well as growth in Canada and Latin America. Sales in our New York flagship store rose by a strong 23%, which was on top of a 26% sales increase in last year's first quarter. Comparable Americas brand store sale rose 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. U.S. sales growth was solid from coast-to-coast. Interestingly, despite some speculation that sales in Hawaii and Guam would suffer from a decline in Japanese tourism following the earthquake, sales in that 6 store region rose more than 30% in the quarter. And from a customer mix perspective, the sales increase in the Americas came from higher spending by domestic customers and foreign visitors, which results are true in the New York flagship store. The 5 new stores opened in the past year in the Americas are performing well. We did not add any new stores in the first quarter, although earlier this month, we opened a store in Northbrook, Illinois, representing our fourth store in the important Chicago market and a store in Calgary, Alberta, which represents our fourth company operated store in Canada. 
Our direct marketing sales in the Americas also did well in the quarter. Combined e-commerce and catalog sales rose 14% due to similar increases in the number of orders and in the average size per order. That was on top of a 23% sales increase last year.
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where sales rose 37% in the quarter due to increases both in the average price per unit sold and in the number of jewelry unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 31% and comparable store sales rose 26%, which was on top of a 21% comp last year. This was substantially better than we expected. Sales were consistently strong in most markets throughout the quarter, with noteworthy strength in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. 
I should also mentioned that we are pleased with the overall initial performance of the 7 new stores that we opened over the past year in that region. 
Now let's look at Japan, which has been of concern since the tragic earthquake and tsunami on March 11. Tiffany's business has improved there, although the total sales increase of 7% was due to the translation of the yen, which at JPY 82 to the $1 in the quarter was 10% stronger than last year. We are currently forecasting the yen to remain in the 80s for the rest of the year. 
Excluding the translation effect, sales in Japan in yen in the quarter declined 3% both in total and on a comparable store basis, which compared with a 10% comp decline last year. This was still much better than what we expected when we last reported to you on March 21 during the time of considerable uncertainty. The sales trend in Japan during the quarter was understandably very volatile, with almost half of our stores closed for about a week after the earthquake. In fact, comps in Japan in yen increased 3% in February then declined 16% in March and finished the quarter with a 6% increase in April. This compared with declines of 10%, 10% and 9% in February, March and April of last year. Not surprisingly, sales were softer in the Northern Tohoku and centrally located Kanto regions, which were more directly affected by the earthquake and its aftereffects as opposed to the Southwestern Kansai region. We would not be surprised with continued volatility in Japan sales for a while.
During the first quarter, we opened a new department store boutique in Hakata, and closed 2 department store boutiques in Kokura and Wakayama as we have planned and finished the quarter operating 55 locations in Japan. 
Now turning to Europe. Total sales increased 25% due to strong unit volume growth that exceeded an increase in the average price per unit sold. On the constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 19% and comparable store sales rose 15% on top of a 14% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This was slightly better than we expected and the intra quarter trend was strongest in April.
Geographically, we strong saw sales growth in most continental European countries with the greatest gains in France, Germany and Italy. Sales growth was more modest in the U.K., although sales there did strengthened later in the quarter. And the new stores we opened late last year in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona are exceeding our expectations.
Lastly, other sales declined 18% in the first quarter due to a decline as we expected in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. However, wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets rose strongly in the quarter.
Turning to some first quarter product highlights. The broad-based strength in our geographic segments was also true across most product categories. On a worldwide basis, all major jewelry categories posted double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. At the high end, statement jewelry had a good increase. The fine and fashion jewelry categories performed very well, highlighted by Celebration Rings, the Metro and Victoria collections, Keys, Return to Tiffany and the relatively new Garden and yellow diamond collection. Engagement jewelry sales were strong as were gold jewelry sales.
There was also a decent growth in silver jewelry sales for Tiffany's own designs, and we were pleased to see some growth in silver jewelry sales in the Americas as well. Sales of the design of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso rose nicely too. But the U.S. economic environment that is affecting spending by some of our silver jewelry customers at entry-level price points will likely remain challenging for a while.
In other categories, watch sales continued to post 30-plus percent growth in our own stores, and we're pleased with the Tiffany Leather collection. In fact, this year, we are expanding leather distribution into more of our stores in the Americas and to some stores in other regions. As an example, we launched the Leather Collection in a few stores in Japan in April, and are quite pleased with initial results. So that covers the sales review. 
Looking at the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin in the first quarter rose 0.5 point to 58.3% from 57.8% last year, primarily due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and sales leverage on fixed costs. Conversely, changes in product mix and higher product costs had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. As we previously reported, we raised retail prices in many product categories earlier in the year to mitigate substantial increases in precious metal and diamond costs. You should, of course, keep in mind that the labor costs component is increasing to a lesser degree. In any case, customers are certainly aware of rising commodity costs, and we have not experienced any meaningful resistance to higher prices.
SG&A expenses rose 18% in the quarter, largely due to higher occupancy costs for new and existing stores, increased staffing and increased marketing spending.
SG&A expenses also included $8 million or $0.04 per share after-tax of non-recurring items for the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Those expenses relate to accelerated depreciation and property and equipment, incremental rent during this transition period until the move occurs in the second quarter and payments related to terminating leases for certain floors that we will soon be vacating. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved by 0.7 point to 40.4% in the quarter versus 41.1% last year. However, if you exclude the nonrecurring items from SG&A expenses, the ratio would have improved year-over-year by 1.6 points. 
Based on the strong sales growth and our gross margin and SG&A expense performance, we achieved a substantial increase in operating margin in the quarter. In fact, the operating improved 1.3 points over last year and excluding nonrecurring items, it improved at even greater 2.1 points over last year.
Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was slightly lower in the quarter, and the effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter. 
Last year's effective tax rate of 30.9% reflected a nonrecurring net tax benefit, primarily related to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries, which had benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in the first quarter of last year. 
Adding it all up, Tiffany's net earnings increased 26% in the quarter, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings rose 39% and EPS was $0.67. This was above our previously stated guidance of $0.57 per share for the first quarter, which also excluded nonrecurring items.
Lastly, return on average assets and return on average stockholder's equity are 11% and 18%, respectively. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jim."

I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business",1432,"Thanks, Mark. I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business. I'd like to address both these areas.
Tiffany finished the quarter with $622 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total short-term and long-term debt was $687 million. 
In April, we paid off a JPY 5 billion or $59 million, 4.5% long-term loan that matured. Total debt to stockholders' equity was 30% at April 30 versus 39% at April 30, 2010. We are using Tiffany's strong balance sheet to expand our business while also returning some of the cash to stockholders. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 17% higher than a year ago due to sales growth, new stores, new products and higher product acquisition costs. I should also add that about a quarter of the inventory increase was due to foreign exchange translation. We are projecting inventories to increase at least 15% this year to support anticipated sales demand and the 19 new stores we plan to open.
In addition, we are increasing our statement jewelry inventory to strengthen our assortments in key markets around the world, and we intend to opportunistically increase our purchases of rough diamonds. 
Accounts receivable at April 30 were up 26% from a year ago, primarily due to the strong sales growth as well as some effects from foreign currency translation. Receivables continue to turn at a high 18x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million in the first quarter versus $26 million last year. We expect that CapEx will increase to approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010 due to a variety of factors including a higher number of store openings this year, renovations of existing stores, which is in some cases reflect the catch up for 2 years of deferred spending; and lastly, the relocation of our New York headquarters staff to a new office facility. 
In our share buyback program we spent $28 million in the first quarter to repurchase approximately 453,000 shares at an average cost of $61.68 per share. And that leaves us with $364 million of remaining capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January of 2013.
Last week, Tiffany's Board of Directors expressed its confidence by approving a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. Taking the rate to $0.29 per share or an annual rate of $1.16 per share. That represented the 9th dividend increase in the past 9 years. 
I alluded earlier to Tiffany's infrastructure because it places a key role in the execution of our growth plans. Our centralized distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide shipments of products to our stores and our customers. Our internal manufacturing facilities in New York and Rhode Island last year produced 60% of the products we sold. We have recently expanded our U.S. production capacity in Lexington, Kentucky with the hiring of skilled workers and will soon move from the temporary space there to a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility. 
And our diamond sourcing organization has developed a global reach to ensure that Tiffany has the necessary supply of the highest quality diamonds for our customers. We are excited about the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff in a few weeks to 200 Fifth Avenue on 23rd Street. The new location will allow us to operate more efficiently and we anticipate meaningful cost savings over the lease term. 
Now let's turn to our financial outlook. The results we reported today unquestionably represented a terrific start to the year and we have factored them into our thought process for the rest of the year. At the same time, the first quarter represents a small sales quarter of the year and with lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, we do not want to get ahead of ourselves in our full year outlook.
Our initial plan for the year included solid sales growth in all regions except Japan and we continue to expect that. 
For the full year by region, we look for sales in the Americas to increase by a mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low double digit percentage; in Asia-Pacific, we expect sales to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up about 20%. We are also looking for sales in Europe to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up by a low double digit percentage. For Japan, we were previously expecting a mid-single digit decline for the year. As we expected, a substantial decline in the first quarter as a result of the earthquake. We truly appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in Japan during such a challenging experience. There obviously still uncertainties in Japan and the potential for disruptions and reduced store hours in the coming months related to any power shortages, as well as economic challenges. But based on the better-than-expected results we saw in the first quarter, our Japan sales plan for the year now calls for just a modest total sales decline in dollars and a roughly similar decline in comps in yen with no significant variability in the second, third and fourth quarters.
And we expect October sales -- others, I'm sorry, our other sales to increase about 25%. We are now planning to open 19 new customer operated stores this year and in Japan, we reduced our locations by one, representing an overall 8% increase in our worldwide store base. We were previously forecasting 21 new stores for this year, but one in the U.S. and one in Europe have been delayed until next year. In Europe, we now plan to open 4 stores this year including second stores in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as a store in Neuss. In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open 8 stores and in the Americas, we plan to open 7 stores including a recently opened stores in Calgary and Northbrook, as well as stores in Richmond and the fashion show mall in Las Vegas among others. 
Also in the U.S., later this year, we are planning to relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to a smaller and we believe better location at the nearby mall at Chestnut Hill. 
In terms of margin assumptions for the full year, we expect the operating margins to improve about 0.5 point, excluding non-recurring items, coming from improvement in both the SG&A ratio and gross margin, primarily tied to sales leverage on fixed costs. 
As everyone knows precious metal and diamond costs increased dramatically in 2010, and it continues to move higher this year. We plan to continue to take price increases in various categories and across various country locations to offset the higher costs, and we also expect other expenses, net, for about $45 million and an effective tax rate of 34%. But based on these better-than-expected first quarter results, our full year outlook now calls for our earnings per diluted share to increase 18% to 21% to a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, not including the nonrecurring expenses of about $0.19 per share. 
Our previous outlook calls for EPS in a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, which also does not include the nonrecurring expenses. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the second quarter is continuing to exceed our expectation with a solid performance in those regions. 
In addition to the new store openings I mentioned, we will have an active line up of new product introductions highlighted by the new Tiffany locks collection, which is enjoying a very strong start. Other new designs include Tiffany Twist, a new collection in 18 karat gold and sterling silver, and we are excited about the revival of Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of pendants, which was our first jewelry designed and is now offered in an expanded and distinctive assortment. And we will continue to expand our marketing communications to customers and reinforce Tiffany's brand message, an exciting and new markets for both print and digital media. 
I'll close by saying that these first quarter results were a great way to start the year and we certainly have reasons to be optimistic about the future. 
Thank you for listening to our call today and please feel free to call Mark with any questions and please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on Friday, August 26. And that concludes today's call."

Now we can proceed. In our opinion, Tiffany's first quarter results were nothing short of outstanding. Sales growth was strong in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific while sales in Japan were better than expected after the tragic earthquake and tsunami. That strong sales growth contributed to a higher than expected operating margin and net earnings, which led us to increase our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's begin by looking at sales in our geographical segments. Starting with the Americas, total sales increased 19% in the quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as higher unit volumes, especially in engagement jewelry and other high-end jewelry. Comparable store sales in constant currency rose 17% on top of a 15% increase last year. We achieved double-digit comps in all 3 months, and the trend strengthened as the quarter progressed.
Geographically, we achieved solid sales growth in the U.S. as well as growth in Canada and Latin America. Sales in our New York flagship store rose by a strong 23%, which was on top of a 26% sales increase in last year's first quarter. Comparable Americas brand store sale rose 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. U.S. sales growth was solid from coast-to-coast. Interestingly, despite some speculation that sales in Hawaii and Guam would suffer from a decline in Japanese tourism following the earthquake, sales in that 6 store region rose more than 30% in the quarter. And from a customer mix perspective, the sales increase in the Americas came from higher spending by domestic customers and foreign visitors, which was also true in the New York flagship store. The 5 new stores opened in the past year in the Americas are performing well. We did not add any new stores in the first quarter, although earlier this month, we opened a store in Northbrook, Illinois, representing our fourth store in the important Chicago market and a store in Calgary, Alberta, which represents our fourth company operated store in Canada. 
Our direct marketing sales in the Americas also did well in the quarter. Combined e-commerce and catalog sales rose 14% due to similar increases in the number of orders and in the average size per order. That was on top of a 23% sales increase last year.
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where sales rose 37% in the quarter due to increases both in the average price per unit sold and in the number of jewelry unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 31% and comparable store sales rose 26%, which was on top of a 21% comp last year. This was substantially better than we expected. Sales were consistently strong in most markets throughout the quarter, with noteworthy strength in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. 
I should also mention that we are pleased with the overall initial performance of the 7 new stores that we opened over the past year in that region. 
Now let's look at Japan, which has been of concern since the tragic earthquake and tsunami on March 11. Tiffany's business has improved there, although the total sales increase of 7% was due to the translation of the yen, which at JPY 82 to the $1 in the quarter was 10% stronger than last year. We are currently forecasting the yen to remain in the 80s for the rest of the year. 
Excluding the translation effect, sales in Japan in yen in the quarter declined 3% both in total and on a comparable store basis, which compared with a 10% comp decline last year. This was still much better than what we expected when we last reported to you on March 21 during the time of considerable uncertainty. The sales trend in Japan during the quarter was understandably very volatile, with almost 1/2 of our stores closed for about a week after the earthquake. In fact, comps in Japan in yen increased 3% in February then declined 16% in March and finished the quarter with a 6% increase in April. This compared with declines of 10%, 10% and 9% in February, March and April of last year. Not surprisingly, sales were softer in the Northern Tohoku and centrally located Kanto regions, which were more directly affected by the earthquake and its aftereffects as opposed to the Southwestern Kansai region. We would not be surprised with continued volatility in Japan sales for a while.
During the first quarter, we opened a new department store boutique in Hakata, and closed 2 department store boutiques in Kokura and Wakayama as we have planned and finished the quarter operating 55 locations in Japan. 
Now turning to Europe. Total sales increased 25% due to strong unit volume growth that exceeded an increase in the average price per unit sold. On the constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 19% and comparable store sales rose 15% on top of a 14% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This was slightly better than we expected and the intra-quarter trend was strongest in April.
Geographically, we strong saw sales growth in most continental European countries with the greatest gains in France, Germany and Italy. Sales growth was more modest in the U.K., although sales there did strengthen later in the quarter. And the new stores we opened late last year in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona are exceeding our expectations.
Lastly, other sales declined 18% in the first quarter due to a decline as we expected in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. However, wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets rose strongly in the quarter.
Turning to some first quarter product highlights. The broad-based strength in our geographic segments was also true across most product categories. On a worldwide basis, all major jewelry categories posted double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. At the high end, statement jewelry had a good increase. The fine and fashion jewelry categories performed very well, highlighted by Celebration Rings, the Metro and Victoria collections, Keys, Return to Tiffany and the relatively new Garden and yellow diamond collection. Engagement jewelry sales were strong as were gold jewelry sales.
There was also a decent growth in silver jewelry sales for Tiffany's own designs, and we were pleased to see some growth in silver jewelry sales in the Americas as well. Sales of the design of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso rose nicely too. But the U.S. economic environment that is affecting spending by some of our silver jewelry customers at entry-level price points will likely remain challenging for a while.
In other categories, watch sales continued to post 30-plus percent growth in our own stores, and we're pleased with the Tiffany Leather collection. In fact, this year, we are expanding leather distribution into more of our stores in the Americas and to some stores in other regions. As an example, we launched the Leather Collection in a few stores in Japan in April, and are quite pleased with initial results. So that covers the sales review. 
Looking at the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin in the first quarter rose 0.5 point to 58.3% from 57.8% last year, primarily due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and sales leverage on fixed costs. Conversely, changes in product mix and higher product costs had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. As we previously reported, we raised retail prices in many product categories earlier in the year to mitigate substantial increases in precious metal and diamond costs. You should, of course, keep in mind that the labor costs component is increasing to a lesser degree. In any case, customers are certainly aware of rising commodity costs, and we have not experienced any meaningful resistance to higher prices.
SG&A expenses rose 18% in the quarter, largely due to higher occupancy costs for new and existing stores, increased staffing and increased marketing spending.
SG&A expenses also included $8 million or $0.04 per share after-tax of non-recurring items for the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Those expenses relate to accelerated depreciation in property and equipment, incremental rent during this transition period until the move occurs in the second quarter and payments related to terminating leases for certain floors that we will soon be vacating. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved by 0.7 point to 40.4% in the quarter versus 41.1% last year. However, if you exclude the nonrecurring items from SG&A expenses, the ratio would have improved year-over-year by 1.6 points. 
Based on the strong sales growth and our gross margin and SG&A expense performance, we achieved a substantial increase in operating margin in the quarter. In fact, the operating improved 1.3 points over last year and excluding nonrecurring items, it improved an even greater 2.1 points over last year.
Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was slightly lower in the quarter, and the effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter. 
Last year's effective tax rate of 30.9% reflected a nonrecurring net tax benefit, primarily related to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries, which had benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in the first quarter of last year. 
Adding it all up, Tiffany's net earnings increased 26% in the quarter, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings rose 39% and EPS was $0.67. This was above our previously stated guidance of $0.57 per share for the first quarter, which also excluded nonrecurring items.
Lastly, return on average assets and return on average stockholder's equity are 11% and 18%, respectively. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jim."

I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business. I'd like to address both these areas.
Tiffany finished the quarter with $622 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total short-term and long-term debt was $687 million. 
In April, we paid off a JPY 5 billion or $59 million, 4.50% long-term loan that matured. Total debt to stockholders' equity was 30% at April 30 versus 39% at April 30, 2010. We are using Tiffany's strong balance sheet to expand our business while also returning some of the cash to stockholders. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 17% higher than a year ago due to sales growth, new stores, new products and higher product acquisition costs. I should also add that about a quarter of the inventory increase was due to foreign exchange translation. We are projecting inventories to increase at least 15% this year to support anticipated sales demand and the 19 new stores we plan to open.

Last week, Tiffany's Board of Directors expressed its confidence by approving a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. Taking the rate to $0.29 per share or an annual rate of $1.16 per share. That represented the 9th dividend increase in the past 9 years.

We truly appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in Japan during such a challenging experience. There are obviously still uncertainties in Japan and the potential for disruptions and reduced store hours in the coming months related to any power shortages, as well as economic challenges. But based on the better-than-expected results we saw in the first quarter, our Japan sales plan for the year now calls for just a modest total sales decline in dollars and a roughly similar decline in comps in yen with no significant variability in the second, third and fourth quarters.
And we expect October sales -- others, I'm sorry, our other sales to increase about 25%. We are now planning to open 19 new customer operated stores this year and in Japan, we reduced our locations by one, representing an overall 8% increase in our worldwide store base. We were previously forecasting 21 new stores for this year, but one in the U.S. and one in Europe have been delayed until next year. In Europe, we now plan to open 4 stores this year including second stores in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as a store in Neuss. In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open 8 stores and in the Americas, we plan to open 7 stores including a recently opened stores in Calgary and Northbrook, as well as stores in Richmond and the fashion show mall in Las Vegas among others.

We plan to continue to take price increases in various categories and across various country locations to offset the higher costs, and we also expect other expenses, net, of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of 34%. But based on these better-than-expected first quarter results, our full year outlook now calls for our earnings per diluted share to increase 18% to 21% to a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, not including the nonrecurring expenses of about $0.19 per share. 
Our previous outlook calls for EPS in a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses.

Now we can proceed. In our opinion, Tiffany's first quarter results were nothing short of outstanding. Sales growth was strong in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific while sales in Japan were better than expected after the tragic earthquake and tsunami. And strong sales growth contributed to a higher than expected operating margin and net earnings, which led us to increase our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's begin by looking at sales in our geographical segments. Starting with the Americas, total sales increased 19% in the quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as higher unit volume, especially in engagement jewelry and other high-end jewelry. Comparable store sales in constant currency rose 17% on top of a 15% increase last year. We achieved double-digit comps in all 3 months, and the trend strengthened as the quarter progressed.
Geographically, we achieved solid sales growth in the U.S. as well as growth in Canada and Latin America. Sales in our New York flagship store rose by a strong 23%, which was on top of a 26% sales increase in last year's first quarter. Comparable Americas brand store sale rose 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. U.S. sales growth was solid from coast-to-coast. Interestingly, despite some speculation that sales in Hawaii and Guam would suffer from a decline in Japanese tourism following the earthquake, sales in that 6 store region rose more than 30% in the quarter. And from a customer mix perspective, the sales increase in the Americas came from higher spending by domestic customers and foreign visitors, which was also true in the New York flagship store. The 5 new stores opened in the past year in the Americas are performing well. We did not add any new stores in the first quarter, although earlier this month, we opened a store in Northbrook, Illinois, representing our fourth store in the important Chicago market and a store in Calgary, Alberta, which represents our fourth company operated store in Canada. 
Our direct marketing sales in the Americas also did well in the quarter. Combined e-commerce and catalog sales rose 14% due to similar increases in the number of orders and in the average size per order. That was on top of a 23% sales increase last year.
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where sales rose 37% in the quarter due to increases both in the average price per unit sold and in the number of jewelry units sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 31% and comparable store sales rose 26%, which was on top of a 21% comp last year. This was substantially better than we expected. Sales were consistently strong in most markets throughout the quarter, with noteworthy strength in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. 
I should also mention that we are pleased with the overall initial performance of the 7 new stores that we opened over the past year in that region. 
Now let's look at Japan, which has been of concern since the tragic earthquake and tsunami on March 11. Tiffany's business has improved there, although the total sales increase of 7% was due to the translation of the yen, which at JPY 82 to the $1 in the quarter was 10% stronger than last year. We are currently forecasting the yen to remain in the 80s for the rest of the year. 
Excluding the translation effect, sales in Japan in yen in the quarter declined 3% both in total and on a comparable store basis, which compared with a 10% comp decline last year. This was still much better than what we expected when we last reported to you on March 21 during a time of considerable uncertainty. The sales trend in Japan during the quarter was understandably very volatile, with almost 1/2 of our stores closed for about a week after the earthquake. In fact, comps in Japan in yen increased 3% in February then declined 16% in March and finished the quarter with a 6% increase in April. This compared with declines of 10%, 10% and 9% in February, March and April of last year. Not surprisingly, sales were softer in the Northern Tohoku and centrally located Kanto regions, which were more directly affected by the earthquake and its aftereffects as opposed to the Southwestern Kansai region. We would not be surprised with continued volatility in Japan sales for a while.
During the first quarter, we opened a new department store boutique in Hakata, and closed 2 department store boutiques in Kokura and Wakayama as we have planned and finished the quarter operating 55 locations in Japan. 
Now turning to Europe. Total sales increased 25% due to strong unit volume growth that exceeded an increase in the average price per unit sold. On the constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 19% and comparable store sales rose 15% on top of a 14% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This was slightly better than we expected and the intra-quarter trend was strongest in April.
Geographically, we strong saw sales growth in most continental European countries with the greatest gains in France, Germany and Italy. Sales growth was more modest in the U.K., although sales there did strengthen later in the quarter. And the new stores we opened late last year in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona are exceeding our expectations.
Lastly, other sales declined 18% in the first quarter due to a decline as we expected in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. However, wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets rose strongly in the quarter.
Turning to some first quarter product highlights. The broad-based strength in our geographic segments was also true across most product categories. On a worldwide basis, all major jewelry categories posted double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. At the high end, statement jewelry had a good increase. The fine and fashion jewelry categories performed very well, highlighted by Celebration Rings, the Metro and Victoria collections, Keys, Return to Tiffany and the relatively new Garden and yellow diamond collection. Engagement jewelry sales were strong as were gold jewelry sales.
There was also a decent growth in silver jewelry sales for Tiffany's own designs, and we were pleased to see some growth in silver jewelry sales in the Americas as well. Sales of the design of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso rose nicely too. But the U.S. economic environment that is affecting spending by some of our silver jewelry customers at entry-level price points will likely remain challenging for a while.
In other categories, watch sales continued to post 30-plus percent growth in our own stores, and we're pleased with the Tiffany Leather collection. In fact, this year, we are expanding leather distribution into more of our stores in the Americas and to some stores in other regions. As an example, we launched the Leather Collection in a few stores in Japan in April, and are quite pleased with initial results. So that covers the sales review. 
Looking at the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin in the first quarter rose 0.5 point to 58.3% from 57.8% last year, primarily due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and sales leverage on fixed costs. Conversely, changes in product mix and higher product costs had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. As we previously reported, we raised retail prices in many product categories earlier in the year to mitigate substantial increases in precious metal and diamond costs. You should, of course, keep in mind that the labor costs component is increasing to a lesser degree. In any case, customers are certainly aware of rising commodity costs, and we have not experienced any meaningful resistance to higher prices.
SG&A expenses rose 18% in the quarter, largely due to higher occupancy costs for new and existing stores, increased staffing and increased marketing spending.
SG&A expenses also included $8 million or $0.04 per share after-tax of non-recurring items for the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Those expenses relate to accelerated depreciation in property and equipment, incremental rent during this transition period until the move occurs in the second quarter and payments related to terminating leases for certain floors that we will soon be vacating. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved by 0.7 point to 40.4% in the quarter versus 41.1% last year. However, if you exclude the nonrecurring items from SG&A expenses, the ratio would have improved year-over-year by 1.6 points. 
Based on the strong sales growth and our gross margin and SG&A expense performance, we achieved a substantial increase in operating margin in the quarter. In fact, the operating improved 1.3 points over last year and excluding nonrecurring items, it improved an even greater 2.1 points over last year.
Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was slightly lower in the quarter, and the effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter. 
Last year's effective tax rate of 30.9% reflected a nonrecurring net tax benefit, primarily related to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries, which had benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in the first quarter last year.
Adding it all up, Tiffany's net earnings increased 26% in the quarter, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings rose 39% and EPS was $0.67. This was above our previously stated guidance of $0.57 per share for the first quarter, which also excluded nonrecurring items.
Lastly, return on average assets and return on average stockholder's equity are 11% and 18%, respectively. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jim."

I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business",1429,"Thanks, Mark. I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business. I'd like to address both these areas.
Tiffany finished the quarter with $622 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total short-term and long-term debt was $687 million. 
In April, we paid off a JPY 5 billion or $59 million, 4.50% long-term loan that matured. Total debt to stockholders' equity was 30% at April 30 versus 39% at April 30, 2010. We are using Tiffany's strong balance sheet to expand our business while also returning some of the cash to stockholders. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 17% higher than a year ago due to sales growth, new stores, new products and higher product acquisition costs. I should also add that about 1/4 of the inventory increase was due to foreign exchange translation. We are projecting inventories to increase at least 15% this year to support anticipated sales demand and the 19 new stores we plan to open.
In addition, we are increasing our statement jewelry inventory to strengthen our assortments in key markets around the world, and we intend to opportunistically increase our purchases of rough diamonds. 
Accounts receivable at April 30 were up 26% from a year ago, primarily due to the strong sales growth as well as some effect from foreign currency translation. Receivables continue to turn at a high 18x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million in the first quarter versus $26 million last year. We expect that CapEx will increase to approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010 due to a variety of factors including a higher number of store openings this year, renovations of existing stores, which in some cases reflect the catch up for 2 years of deferred spending; and lastly, the relocation of our New York headquarters staff to a new office facility. 
In our share buyback program we spent $28 million in the first quarter to repurchase approximately 453,000 shares at an average cost of $61.68 per share. And that leaves us with $364 million of remaining capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January of 2013.
Last week, Tiffany's Board of Directors expressed its confidence by approving a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, taking the rate to $0.29 per share or an annual rate of $1.16 per share. That represented the 9th dividend increase in the past 9 years. 
I alluded earlier to Tiffany's infrastructure because it plays a key role in the execution of our growth plans. Our centralized distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide shipments of products to our stores and our customers. Our internal manufacturing facilities in New York and Rhode Island last year produced 60% of the products we sold. We have recently expanded our U.S. production capacity into Lexington, Kentucky with the hiring of skilled workers and will soon move from the temporary space there to a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility. 
And our diamond sourcing organization has developed a global reach to ensure that Tiffany has the necessary supply of the highest quality diamonds for our customers. We are excited about the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff in a few weeks to 200 Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. The new location will allow us to operate more efficiently and we anticipate meaningful cost savings over the lease term. 
Now let's turn to our financial outlook. The results we reported today unquestionably represented a terrific start to the year and we have factored them into our thought process for the rest of the year. At the same time, the first quarter represents the smallest sales quarter of the year and with lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, we do not want to get ahead of ourselves in our full year outlook.
Our initial plan for the year included solid sales growth in all regions except Japan and we continue to expect that. 
For the full year by region, we look for sales in the Americas to increase by a mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low-double digit percentage. In Asia-Pacific, we expect sales to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up about 20%. We are also looking for sales in Europe to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up by a low-double digit percentage. For Japan, we were previously expecting a mid-single digit decline for the year. As we expected, a substantial decline in the first quarter as a result of the earthquake. We truly appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in Japan during such a challenging experience. There are obviously still uncertainties in Japan and the potential for disruptions and reduced store hours in the coming months related to any power shortages, as well as economic challenges. But based on the better-than-expected results we saw in the first quarter, our Japan sales plan for the year now calls for just a modest total sales decline in dollars and a roughly similar decline in comps in yen with no significant variability in the second, third and fourth quarters.
And we expect October sales -- others, I'm sorry, our other sales to increase about 25%. We are now planning to open 19 new customer operated stores this year and in Japan, we reduced our locations by one, representing an overall 8% increase in our worldwide store base. We were previously forecasting 21 new stores for this year, but one in the U.S. and one in Europe have been delayed until next year. In Europe, we now plan to open 4 stores this year including second stores in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as a store in Neuss. In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open 8 stores and in the Americas, we plan to open 7 stores including a recently opened stores in Calgary and Northbrook, as well as stores in Richmond and the fashion show mall in Las Vegas among others. 
Also in the U.S., later this year, we are planning to relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to a smaller and we believe better location at the nearby mall at Chestnut Hill. 
In terms of margin assumptions for the full year, we expect the operating margins to improve about 0.5 point, excluding non-recurring items, coming from improvement in both the SG&A ratio and gross margin, primarily tied to sales leverage on fixed costs. 
As everyone knows precious metal and diamond costs increased dramatically in 2010, and it continued to move higher this year. We plan to continue to take price increases in various categories and across various country locations to offset the higher costs, and we also expect other expenses, net, of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of 34%. But based on these better-than-expected first quarter results, our full year outlook now calls for our earnings per diluted share to increase 18% to 21% to a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, not including the nonrecurring expenses of about $0.19 per share. 
Our previous outlook calls for EPS in a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the second quarter is continuing to exceed our expectation with a solid performance in those regions. 
In addition to the new store openings I mentioned, we will have an active line up of new product introductions highlighted by the new Tiffany locks collection, which is enjoying a very strong start. Other new designs include Tiffany Twist, a new collection in 18 karat gold and sterling silver, and we are excited about the revival of Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of pendants, which was her first jewelry design and is now offered in an expanded and distinctive assortment. And we will continue to expand our marketing communications to customers and reinforce Tiffany's brand message, in exciting and new markets through both print and digital media. 
I'll close by saying that these first quarter results were a great way to start the year and we certainly have reasons to be optimistic about the future. 
Thank you for listening to our call today and please feel free to call Mark with any questions and please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on Friday, August 26. And that concludes today's call."

Now we can proceed. On our conference call 3 months ago, we characterized Tiffany's first quarter results as outstanding due to 20% sales growth and 39% earnings growth, excluding nonrecurring items. Second quarter results that we reported today deserve at least a similar superlative description. We achieved strong and better-than-expected sales growth in all geographic regions with worldwide sales up 30%. That enabled us to gain considerable leverage on expenses and achieve a solid improvement in the operating margin when excluding nonrecurring charges and record a 58% increase in net earnings, excluding those nonrecurring items. 
EPS of $0.86, excluding the nonrecurring items, was well above our expectation and also of analysts' expectations. Please refer to today's news release for further details of those nonrecurring items. These results were further indication of strength in the luxury industry, and we again raised our full year outlook based on the better-than-expected results. 
Let's now review sales by segment. In the Americas, total sales rose 25% due to a higher average price per unit sold, as well as unit growth in most product categories. In fact, sales increased in all price strata above $250 with notable strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. On a constant exchange rate basis, comparable store sales rose 23% on top of a 5% increase last year. Comps increased by double-digit percentage in all 3 months. Please note that in the future while we will continue to disclose comps on a quarterly basis for each geographical segment, we will no longer discuss monthly intra-order trends because of our focus on longer-term performance.
Within the Americas, the sales growth was obviously led by our stores in the U.S., but we also had good growth in our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship stores surged 41% on top of an 8% increase last year, with a substantial increase in sales to foreign tourists and the remaining portion of the increase due to higher local customers sales. That 41% increase was sharply higher than the comps we saw in our 8 other New York area stores. Comparable Americas brand store sales increased 19% on top of a 4% increase last year. 
Geographically, U.S. sales growth was pretty broad-based, although there was greater strength in the Western half of the U.S., and our 6 stores in Hawaii and Guam continue to show very strong sales growth due to Japanese tourist spending. In fact, from a customer perspective, roughly half of our U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from higher spending by foreign visitors, increasingly led by Chinese travelers. The benefit from sales to foreign tourists is most meaningful in New York flagship store, as well as in certain of our stores in Florida, Las Vegas and California. 
During the quarter, we opened our fourth store in the important Chicago market in Northbrook, Illinois and our fourth company-operated store in Canada in Calgary, Alberta. Rounding out the Americas, our e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 16% on top of a 2% decline last year due to increases both in the number of orders and in the average size per order.
Turning to the Asia-Pacific region. Sales increased 55% in the quarter due to roughly equal increases in both the number of units sold and in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 45%, and comparable store sales rose 41% on top of a 7% comp increase last year. Sales were strong throughout the quarter and in most countries, with especially strong growth in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. We're also very pleased with performance from new stores. The store count was unchanged in the quarter, but we recently opened 2 new stores in Korea this month and had a number of openings scheduled for the next few months. And earlier this month, we completed a dramatic renovation and expansion of our store on Collins Street in Melbourne. 
Looking at Japan, our business there continue to show improvement that began a month after the tragic earthquake and tsunami in March. Total sales in Japan in yen in the quarter rose 8% entirely due to 8% comp growth that was on top of a 7% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, total sales in Japan rose 21% in the second quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, which benefited from the stronger yen, which averaged JPY 80 to the U.S. dollar in the second quarter versus JPY 90 last year. We were pleased to see that sales growth was geographically broad-based throughout Japan and that the sales trends improved as the quarter progressed. The store count held steady during the quarter.
Sales in Europe continued at a strong pace for the second quarter. Total sales increased 32%, largely due to unit growth in all categories, as well as a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. European currency strengthened against the dollar, which means that in constant currencies, total sales increased 17% while comps rose 11% due to solid performance throughout the quarter. This was on top of a 21% comp increase in last year's second quarter.
Geographically, comps range from good growth in our U.K. stores to even stronger growth on the continent. While the largest portion of our sales growth in Europe was the local customers, the results have been a noticeable increase in sales to foreign tourists, especially from China and Russia. The new stores we opened last year in London's Canary Wharf and Barcelona are performing very well. And during the quarter, we opened second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich in their airports. Rounding out the segment review for sales or other sales, which increased 46% in the quarter due to similar growth in the wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and wholesale sales of rough diamonds.
From a merchandising perspective, our 30% worldwide sales growth in the quarter was generated by double-digit percentage increases in all jewelry categories. High-end statement jewelry sales rose up in the quarter. Engagement jewelry sales were very strong due to substantial increases in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe coming from growth in both units and average price. The fine and fashion jewelry categories were strong led by well-known designs like Tiffany's Metro, Notes, Keys, Return to Tiffany and 1837 collection, as well as our successful Celebration rings and the relatively new yellow diamond collection. In essence, we enjoyed broad-based strong growth in diamond jewelry and gold jewelry sales, and we also had reasonably good increase in silver jewelry sales, including continued growth in the Americas.
And designer jewelry sales were up nicely led by the design of Elsa Peretti. We introduced a multitude of new designs every year, and 2011 is no different with a strong lineup of new products, including the new Tiffany Locks collection, Tiffany Twist and Elsa Peretti bottle collection of beautiful pendants. And we are excited about the upcoming launch of Paloma Picasso's Venezia collection. 
Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin increased 1.2 points in the second quarter to 59%. This was entirely due to sales leverage on the fixed cost, cost of sales. Rising commodity prices have compelled us to take selective retail price increases on the various product categories and in most regions this year. These higher diamonds and precious metal costs are obviously affecting everyone in the industry and resulting in price increases. 
As we said before, our objective is to maintain gross margin on our product. Based on the sales results, we continue to believe in our ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our competitive position.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 37% in the second quarter. A meaningful portion of that SG&A expense growth was due to $34 million or $0.16 per share after-tax of nonrecurring expenses for the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, which was completed in June. Those expenses are primarily related to the fair value of the remaining non-cancelable lease obligation reduced by the estimated sublease rental income, as well as accelerated depreciation of property and equipment in our former locations, incremental rent and payments related to terminated leases. 
In last year's second quarter, we recorded $3.7 million of nonrecurring relocation expenses. By and large, we pretty much recorded all the nonrecurring expenses related to the headquarters relocation. Excluding those nonrecurring costs, SG&A expenses rose 26% largely due to higher store occupancy costs, increase staffing, higher marketing spending and sales-related variable costs. After reducing marketing spending in 2009 due to external conditions, we have since have increased the marketing-to-sales ratio toward a previously higher level in 2008 as we enhance brand awareness in existing and new markets. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to sales increased 2.1 points in the quarter, but excluding the nonrecurring items from SG&A expenses this year and last year, the ratio would have improved by 1.4 points showing the strong effect of sales leverage on fixed costs. Other expenses net of $9.6 million, which was primarily interest expense, were modestly lower than last year. And an effective tax rate of 31.2% in the quarter came in lower than the 34% rate last year, primarily due to a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. 
Putting it all together, net earnings rose by substantially better-than-expected 33% in the second quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings increased by even stronger 58%. The return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity were 11% and 19%, respectively. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

As many of you are aware, we have invested substantially in our infrastructure over the past decade.

As many of you are aware, we have invested substantially in our infrastructure over the past decade. The strength in Tiffany sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and I continue to be actively involved in that process. I would like to highlight the key initiatives. 
As a major jeweler selling high-quality diamonds, we have built an organization that has significant wide-ranging abilities to source our needed diamond supply. That does not offset the almost 40% increase in rough diamond prices in the past year that we are experiencing, but it does strongly help us from a supply perspective. The outlook for diamonds over the long term certainly looks as though rising global demand will continue to put pressure on supply and therefore, price. Our organization must continue to be proactive in maintaining strong relationships with diamond producers, which may also continue to include providing some financial support when necessary to ensure greater supply. 
A recent example of this strategy is our providing financing for the expansion of the mine in Sierra Leone in return for a supply agreement earlier this year. Similarly, we have developed extensive internal capacity and capabilities for finished goods manufacturing, which last year produced 60% of the products we sold. Our 3 facilities in New York and one in Rhode Island have been successfully supporting our growing product needs. 
And last year, we expanded production into Lexington, Kentucky, and earlier this week, we moved from a temporary space there into a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility that will open ultimately employ about 125 people. We have 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey, one which ensures that our store inventories are replenished in a timely way and the other it shouldn't leave the billing direction to customers. Both of these facilities capacity to support our planned business expansion for many years to come.
One of the reasons that the expensive infrastructure I just described supports our business so effectively is because of the investments we have made in information technology. We have developed what I believe is a world-class organization, both in terms of people and system capabilities, providing technology supporting our business from customer base transactions to distribution to inventory management. All of the supply chain, distribution and IT strength support our store base, our e-commerce and wholesale distribution and will enable us to further expand our geographical reach. In addition, the relatively fixed cost nature of this infrastructure will enable us to continue to improve our operating margin. 
And to our real estate services group, we are now fully settled into our new headquarters at 200 Fifth Avenue. We are locating our organization with a major project that involves the collaborative efforts of numerous people, and we now stand to benefit from organizational efficiencies and cost savings. 
All in all, Tiffany's operating capabilities are strong, and we are well prepared to withstand our business over the long term. As we announced in June, Pat McGuiness has assumed the position of Chief Financial Officer from me. Pat has been effectively in charge of most financial divisions functions for several years now. And he and I have worked closely, and we'll certainly continue to do so. 
I'm pleased to now introduce Pat to offer some comments about our balance sheet and financial outlook."

I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter,",1016,"Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, we had $565 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We had $694 million of short-term and long-term debt, and total debt to stockholders' equity was 29% at July 31 versus 40% a year ago. 
We're using that strong balance sheet in several ways. An 18% year-over-year increase in net inventories at the end of the quarter supported sales growth, new stores and new products. We are expanding our statement jewelry inventory assortment in key markets around the world, and we are being opportunistic in purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds. Also contributing to the inventory growth were higher product acquisition costs and almost 1/4 of inventory increase came from the translation effect of stronger foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect net inventories to increase at least 15% this year. 
Accounts receivable at quarter end were 16% higher than a year ago due to strong sales growth, but it also included some effects of foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures of $111 million in the first half of the year were up from $51 million last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. This increase is due to a higher number of store openings, a greater number of store renovations and the relocation of our New York headquarters. 
CapEx this year will likely represent almost 7% of sales. This is pretty consistent with our longer-term CapEx outlook of 6% to 7% of sales. We were also using some cash for share repurchases. We spent nearly $25 million in the second quarter to buy approximately 330,000 shares at an average cost of $74.29 per share. We have spent $52 million in the first half of the year to purchase about 783,000 shares at an average cost of $67 per share. We have approximately $340 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the currently authorized program that will run through January 2013. We plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and higher-than-normal cash balances while continuing to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Now let's review our financial outlook for the full year.
This updated outlook incorporates the better-than-expected results from the second quarter and August trends while maintaining our expectations for the remainder of the year. As Jim discussed on the conference call 3 months ago, enough macroeconomic uncertainty remains, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Therefore, our outlook does not premise upon the continuation of such strong comparable store sales increases that we achieved during the second quarter. 
Our full year forecast now calls for a high-teens percentage increase in worldwide net sales. By region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a high-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a mid-teens percentage. Sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 30% with local currency comp close to 25%. Sales in Japan to increase by a high single-digit percentage in total with a low single-digit comp increase in yen. And sales in Europe to increase by at least 20% with local currency comps up by low double-digit percentage. We expect other sales to increase about 25%. We will increase our worldwide store base by 7% this year, which includes opening 17 company-operated stores and closing one in Japan. 
In the Americas, we will now open 6 stores this year. This includes stores already opened in Calgary and Northbrook, as well as stores scheduled to open in the Stony Point Mall in Richmond, the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, the department store in Brasilia and the second store in Vancouver in the Oak Ridge Center. A store plan for Montréal is now scheduled to open at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We will also assume relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby mall of Chestnut Hill. 
In Europe, we are adding 3 stores this year including the stores we've opened in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as a second store in Milan next month. The planned opening of a store in Nice has been slightly delayed for early 2012. 
In Asia-Pacific, our plan continues to include opening 4 stores in China, 1 in Taiwan and 3 in Korea, 2 of which have recently opened. Our margin assumptions for the year also factor in the better-than-expected second quarter results. We now expect the operating margin to improve by more than a full point, excluding nonrecurring items, coming from improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, both of which are tied to sales leverage fixed costs. 
We continue to expect other expenses net of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. So we are now forecasting full year earnings per diluted share a range of $3.65 to $3.75 per diluted share, not including nonrecurring expenses of about $0.20 per share. Our previous outlook calls for EPS in a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses. 
This new forecast represents a 25% to 28% increase over last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded nonrecurring items. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the third quarter is continuing to exceed our expectations with noteworthy strength in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Japan. This is especially encouraging in light of the recent and well-known stock market volatility. 
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and first half of the year and are well positioned for the future. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Tuesday, November 29. That concludes our call.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.

Now we can proceed. On our conference call 3 months ago, we characterized Tiffany's first quarter results as outstanding due to 20% sales growth and 39% earnings growth, excluding non-recurring items. The second quarter results that we reported today deserve at least a similar superlative description. We achieved strong and better-than-expected sales growth in all geographic regions, with worldwide sales up 30%. That enabled us to gain considerable leverage on expenses, and achieved a solid improvement in the operating margin when excluding non-recurring charges, and record a 58% increase in net earnings, excluding those non-recurring items.  EPS of $0.86, excluding the non-recurring items, was well above our expectation, and also above analysts' expectations. Please refer to today's news release for further details of those non-recurring items.  These results were a further indication of strength in the luxury industry, and we again raised our full year outlook based on the better-than-expected results. 
Let's now review sales by segment. In the Americas, total sales rose 25% due to a higher average price per unit sold, as well as unit growth in most product categories. In fact, sales increased in all price strata above $250, with notable strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. On a constant exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales rose 23% on top of a 5% increase last year. Comps increased by double-digit percentage in all 3 months. Please note that in the future, while we will continue to disclose comps on a quarterly basis for each geographical segment, we will no longer discuss monthly intra-order trends because of our focus on longer-term performance.
Within the Americas, the sales growth was obviously led by our stores in the U.S., but we also had good growth in our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship stores surged 41% on top of an 8% increase last year, with a substantial increase in sales to foreign tourists, and the remaining portion of the increase due to higher local customers sales. That 41% increase was sharply higher than the comps we saw in our 8 other New York area stores. Comparable Americas brand store sales increased 19% on top of a 4% increase last year. 
Geographically, U.S. sales growth was pretty broad based, although there was greater strength in the Western half of the U.S., and our 6 stores in Hawaii and Guam continued to show very strong sales growth due to Japanese tourists' spending. In fact, from a customer perspective, roughly half of our U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from higher spending by foreign visitors, increasingly led by Chinese travelers. The benefit from sales to foreign tourists is most meaningful in New York flagship store, as well as in certain of our stores in Florida, Las Vegas and California. 
During the quarter, we opened our fourth store in the important Chicago market in Northbrook, Illinois, and our fourth company-operated store in Canada in Calgary, Alberta, rounding out the Americas, our e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 16% on top of a 2% decline last year due to increases both in the number of orders and in the average size per order.
Turning to the Asia-Pacific region. Sales increased 55% in the quarter due to roughly equal increases in both the number of units sold and in the average price per units sold. On a constant exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 45%, and comparable store sales rose 41% on top of a 7% comp increase last year. Sales were strong throughout the quarter and in most countries, with especially strong growth in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. We're also very pleased with performance from new stores. The store count was unchanged in the quarter, but we recently opened 2 new stores in Korea this month, and had a number of openings scheduled for the next few months. And earlier this month, we completed a dramatic renovation and expansion of our store on Collins Street in Melbourne. 
Looking at Japan, our business there continued to show improvement that began a month after the tragic earthquake and tsunami in March. Total sales in Japan in yen in the quarter rose 8% entirely due to 8% comp growth that was on top of a 7% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, total sales in Japan rose 21% in the second quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, which benefited from the stronger yen, which averaged JPY 80 to the U.S. dollar in the second quarter versus JPY 90 last year. We were pleased to see that sales growth was geographically broad based throughout Japan, and that the sales trends improved as the quarter progressed. The store count held steady during the quarter.
Sales in Europe continued at a strong pace for the second quarter. Total sales increased 32%, largely due to unit growth in all categories, as well as a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. European currencies have strengthened against the dollar, which means that in constant currencies, total sales increased 17%, while comps rose 11% due to solid performance throughout the quarter. This was on top of a 21% comp increase in last year's second quarter.
Geographically, comps range from good growth in our U.K. stores to even stronger growth on the continent. While the largest portion of our sales growth in Europe was to local customers, the results have been a noticeable increase in sales to foreign tourists, especially from China and Russia. The new stores we opened last year in London's Canary Wharf and Barcelona are performing very well. And during the quarter, we opened second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich in their airports. Rounding out the segment review for sales or our other sales, which increased 46% in the quarter due to similar growth in the wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and wholesale sales of rough diamonds.
From a merchandising perspective, our 30% worldwide sales growth in the quarter was generated by double-digit percentage increases in all jewelry categories. High-end statement jewelry sales were robust in the quarter. Engagement jewelry sales were very strong due to substantial increases in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, coming from growth in both units and average price. The fine and fashion jewelry categories were strong, led by well-known designs like Tiffany's Metro, Notes, Keys, Return to Tiffany and 1837 collection, as well as our successful Celebration Rings and the relatively new Yellow Diamond Collection. In essence, we enjoyed broad-based strong growth in diamond jewelry and gold jewelry sales, and we also had a reasonably good increase in silver jewelry sales, including continued growth in the Americas.  And designer jewelry sales were up nicely led by the designs of Elsa Peretti. We introduced a multitude of new designs every year, and 2011 is no different with a strong lineup of new products, including the new Tiffany Locks collection, Tiffany Twist and Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of beautiful pendants. And we are excited about the upcoming launch of Paloma Picasso's Venezia collection. 
Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin increased 1.2 points in the second quarter to 59%. This was entirely due to sales leverage on the fixed cost that are in cost of sales. Rising commodity prices have compelled us to take selective retail price increases on various product categories and in most regions this year. These higher diamond and precious metal costs are obviously affecting everyone in the industry, and resulting in price increases. As we said before, our objective is to maintain gross margin on our product. Based on these sales results, we continue to believe in our ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our competitive position.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 37% in the second quarter. A meaningful portion of that SG&A expense growth was due to $34 million or $0.16 per share after tax of non-recurring expenses for the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, which was completed in June. Those expenses are primarily related to the fair value of the remaining non-cancelable lease obligations, reduced by the estimated sublease rental income, as well as accelerated depreciation of property and equipment in our former locations, incremental rent and payments related to terminated leases. 
In last year's second quarter, we recorded $3.7 million of non-recurring relocation expenses. By and large, we pretty much recorded all the non-recurring expenses related to the headquarters relocation. Excluding those non-recurring costs, SG&A expenses rose 26%, largely due to higher store occupancy costs, increased staffing, higher marketing spending and sales-related variable costs. After reducing marketing spending in 2009 due to external conditions, we have since been increasing the marketing-to-sales ratio toward a previously higher level in 2008 as we enhance brand awareness in existing and new markets. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to sales increased 2.1 points in the quarter, but excluding the non-recurring items from SG&A expenses this year and last year, the ratio would have improved by 1.4 points, showing the strong effect from sales leverage on fixed costs. Other expenses net of $9.6 million, which was primarily interest expense, were modestly lower than last year. And an effective tax rate of 31.2% in the quarter came in lower than the 34% rate last year, primarily due to a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. 
Putting it all together, net earnings rose by a substantially better-than-expected 33% in the second quarter. Excluding the non-recurring items in both years, net earnings increased by an even stronger 58%. Return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity were 11% and 19%, respectively. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

As many of you are aware, we have invested substantially in our infrastructure over the past decade, the strength in Tiffany's sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and I continue to be actively involved in that process. I would like to highlight the key initiatives. As a major jeweler selling high-quality diamonds, we have built an organization that has significant wide-ranging abilities to source our needed-diamond supply. That does not offset the almost 40% increase in rough diamond prices in the past year that we are experiencing, but it does strongly help us from a supply perspective. 
The outlook for diamonds over the long term certainly looks as though rising global demand will continue to put pressure on supply and, therefore, price. Our organization must continue to be proactive in maintaining strong relationships with diamond producers, which may also continue to include providing some financial support when necessary to ensure greater supply. 
A recent example of this strategy is our providing financing for the expansion of the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone in return for a supply agreement earlier this year. Similarly, we have developed extensive internal capacity and capabilities for finished goods manufacturing, which last year produced 60% of the products we sold. Our 3 facilities in New York and 1 in Rhode Island have been successfully supporting our growing product needs. And last year, we expanded production into Lexington, Kentucky, and earlier this week, moved from a temporary space there into a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility that will open ultimately employ about 125 people. We have 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey, one which ensures that our store inventories are replenished in a timely way, and the other, it shouldn't leave fulfilling direct shipments to customers. Both of these facilities have capacity to support our planned business expansion for many years to come.
One of the reasons that the expensive infrastructure, I've just described, supports our business so effectively is because of the investments we have made in information technology.

We achieved strong and better-than-expected sales growth in all geographic regions, with worldwide sales up 30%. That enabled us to gain considerable leverage on expenses and achieve a solid improvement in the operating margin when excluding non-recurring charges and record a 58% increase in net earnings, excluding those non-recurring items.  EPS of $0.86 excluding the non-recurring items was well above our expectation, and also above analysts' expectations. Please refer to today's news release for further details of those non-recurring items.  These results were a further indication of strength in the luxury industry, and we again raised our full year outlook based on the better-than-expected results. 
Let's now review sales by segment. In the Americas, total sales rose 25% due to a higher average price per unit sold as well as unit growth in most product categories. In fact, sales increased in all price strata above $250, with notable strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales rose 23% on top of a 5% increase last year. Comps increased by double-digit percentage in all 3 months. Please note that in the future, while we will continue to disclose comps on a quarterly basis for each geographical segment, we will no longer discuss monthly intra-order trends because of our focus on longer-term performance.
Within the Americas, the sales growth was obviously led by our stores in the U.S., but we also had good growth in our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store surged 41% on top of an 8% increase last year, with a substantial increase in sales to foreign tourists and the remaining portion of the increase due to higher local customers sales. That 41% increase was sharply higher than the comps we saw in our 8 other New York area stores. Comparable Americas branch store sales increased 19% on top of a 4% increase last year. 
Geographically, U.S. sales growth was pretty broad-based, although there was greater strength in the Western half of the U.S., and our 6 stores in Hawaii and Guam continued to show very strong sales growth due to Japanese tourist spending. In fact, from a customer perspective, roughly half of our U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from higher spending by foreign visitors, increasingly led by Chinese travelers. The benefit from sales to foreign tourists is most meaningful in New York flagship store as well as in certain of our stores in Florida, Las Vegas and California. 
During the quarter, we opened our fourth store in the important Chicago market in Northbrook, Illinois and our fourth company-operated store in Canada in Calgary, Alberta.  Rounding out the Americas, our e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 16% on top of a 2% decline last year due to increases both in the number of orders and in the average size per order.
Turning to the Asia-Pacific region. Sales increased 55% in the quarter due to roughly equal increases in both the number of units sold and in the average price per units sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 45%, and comparable store sales rose 41% on top of a 7% comp increase last year. Sales were strong throughout the quarter and in most countries, with especially strong growth in the Greater China market as well as in Korea. We're also very pleased with performance from new stores. The store count was unchanged in the quarter, but we recently opened 2 new stores in Korea this month and had a number of openings scheduled for the next few months. And earlier this month, we completed a dramatic renovation and expansion of our store on Collins Street in Melbourne. 
Looking at Japan, our business there continued to show improvement that began a month after the tragic earthquake and tsunami in March. Total sales in Japan in yen in the quarter rose 8%, entirely due to 8% comp growth that was on top of a 7% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, total sales in Japan rose 21% in the second quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, which benefited from the stronger yen, which averaged JPY 80 to the U.S. dollar in the second quarter versus JPY 90 last year. We were pleased to see that sales growth was geographically broad based throughout Japan and that the sales trends improved as the quarter progressed. The store count held steady during the quarter.
Sales in Europe continued at a strong pace for the second quarter. Total sales increased 32%, largely due to unit growth in all categories as well as a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. European currencies have strengthened against the dollar, which means that in constant currencies, total sales increased 17% while comps rose 11% due to solid performance throughout the quarter. This was on top of a 21% comp increase in last year's second quarter.
Geographically, comps range from good growth in our U.K. stores to even stronger growth on the continent. While the largest portion of our sales growth in Europe was to local customers, the results have been a noticeable increase in sales to foreign tourists, especially from China and Russia. The new stores we opened last year in London's Canary Wharf and Barcelona are performing very well. And during the quarter, we opened second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich in their airports. Rounding out the segment review for sales are other sales, which increased 46% in the quarter due to similar growth in the wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and wholesale sales of rough diamonds.
From a merchandising perspective, our 30% worldwide sales growth in the quarter was generated by double-digit percentage increases in all jewelry categories. High-end statement jewelry sales were robust in the quarter. Engagement jewelry sales were very strong due to substantial increases in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe coming from growth in both units and average price. The fine and fashion jewelry categories were strong, led by well-known designs like Tiffany's Metro, Notes, Keys, Return to Tiffany and 1837 collections as well as our successful Celebration Rings and the relatively new Yellow Diamond Collection. In essence, we enjoyed broad-based strong growth in diamond jewelry and gold jewelry sales, and we also had a reasonably good increase in silver jewelry sales, including continued growth in the Americas.  And designer jewelry sales were up nicely, led by the designs of Elsa Peretti. We introduce a multitude of new designs every year, and 2011 is no different, with a strong lineup of new products, including the new Tiffany Locks collection, Tiffany Twist and Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of beautiful pendants. And we are excited about the upcoming launch of Paloma Picasso's Venezia collection. 
Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin increased 1.2 points in the second quarter to 59%. This was entirely due to sales leverage on the fixed costs that are in cost of sales. Rising commodity prices have compelled us to take selective retail price increases on various product categories and in most regions this year. These higher diamond and precious metal costs are obviously affecting everyone in the industry and resulting in price increases. As we said before, our objective is to maintain gross margin on our product. Based on these sales results, we continue to believe in our ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our competitive position.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 37% in the second quarter. A meaningful portion of that SG&A expense growth was due to $34 million, or $0.16 per share after tax, of non-recurring expenses for the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, which was completed in June. Those expenses are primarily related to the fair value of the remaining non-cancelable lease obligations, reduced by the estimated sublease rental income as well as accelerated depreciation of property and equipment in our former locations, incremental rent and payments related to terminated leases. 
In last year's second quarter, we recorded $3.7 million of non-recurring relocation expenses. By and large, we pretty much recorded all the non-recurring expenses related to the headquarters relocation. Excluding those non-recurring costs, SG&A expenses rose 26%, largely due to higher store occupancy costs, increased staffing, higher marketing spending and sales-related variable costs. After reducing marketing spending in 2009 due to external conditions, we have since been increasing the marketing-to-sales ratio toward a previously higher level in 2008 as we enhance brand awareness in existing and new markets. 
The ratio of SG&A expenses to sales increased 2.1 points in the quarter, but excluding the non-recurring items from SG&A expenses this year and last year, the ratio would have improved by 1.4 points, showing the strong effect from sales leverage on fixed costs. Other expenses net of $9.6 million, which was primarily interest expense, were modestly lower than last year. And an effective tax rate of 31.2% in the quarter came in lower than the 34% rate last year, primarily due to a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. 
Putting it all together, net earnings rose by a substantially better-than-expected 33% in the second quarter. Excluding the non-recurring items in both years, net earnings increased by an even stronger 58%. Return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity were 11% and 19%, respectively. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

As many of you are aware, we have invested substantially in our infrastructure over the past decade to strengthen Tiffany's sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and I continue to be actively involved in that process. I woul",541,"Thanks, Mark. As many of you are aware, we have invested substantially in our infrastructure over the past decade to strengthen Tiffany's sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and I continue to be actively involved in that process. I would like to highlight the key initiatives. As a major jeweler selling high-quality diamonds, we have built an organization that has significant wide-ranging abilities to source our needed diamond supply. That does not offset the almost 40% increase in rough diamond prices in the past year that we are experiencing, but it does strongly help us from a supply perspective. 
The outlook for diamonds over the long term certainly looks as though rising global demand will continue to put pressure on supply and, therefore, price. Our organization must continue to be proactive in maintaining strong relationships with diamond producers, which may also continue to include providing some financial support when necessary to ensure greater supply. 
A recent example of this strategy is our providing financing for the expansion of the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone in return for a supply agreement earlier this year. Similarly, we have developed extensive internal capacity and capabilities for finished goods manufacturing, which last year produced 60% of the products we sold. Our 3 facilities in New York and 1 in Rhode Island have been successfully supporting our growing product needs. And last year, we expanded production into Lexington, Kentucky and earlier this week, moved from a temporary space there into a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility that will ultimately employ about 125 people. We have 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey, one which ensures that our store inventories are replenished in a timely way and the other efficiently fulfilling direct shipments to customers. Both of these facilities have capacity to support our planned business expansion for many years to come.
One of the reasons that the expansive infrastructure I've just described supports our business so effectively is because of the investments we have made in information technology. We have developed what I believe is a world-class organization, both in terms of people and system capabilities, providing technology supporting our business from customer-facing transactions to distribution to inventory management. All of these supply chain, distribution and IT strengths support our store base, our e-commerce and wholesale distribution and will enable us to further expand our geographical reach. In addition, the relatively fixed-cost nature of this infrastructure will enable us to continue to improve our operating margin. And thanks to our real estate services group, we are now fully settled into our new headquarters at 200 Fifth Avenue, relocating our organization with a major project that involved the collaborative efforts of numerous people, and we now stand to benefit from organizational efficiencies and cost savings. 
All in all, Tiffany's operating capabilities are strong, and we are well-prepared to withstand our business over the long term. As we announced in June, Pat McGuiness has assumed the position of Chief Financial Officer from me. Pat has been effectively in charge of most finance division functions for several years now. And he and I have worked closely, and we'll certainly continue to do so. 
I'm pleased to now introduce Pat to offer some comments about our balance sheet and financial outlook."
35576,138701857,163292,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 26, 2011",2011-08-26,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter,",1020,"Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, we had $565 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We had $694 million of short-term and long-term debt, and our total debt to stockholders' equity was 29% at July 31 versus 40% a year ago. We're using that strong balance sheet in several ways. 
An 18% year-over-year increase in net inventories at the end of the quarter supported sales growth, new stores and new products. We are expanding our statement jewelry inventory assortment in key markets around the world, and we are being opportunistic in purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds. Also contributing to the inventory growth were higher product acquisition costs, and almost 1/4 of the inventory increase came from the translation effect of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect net inventories to increase at least 15% this year. 
Accounts receivable at quarter end were 16% higher than a year ago due to strong sales growth, but it also includes some effects from foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures of $111 million in the first half of the year were up from $51 million last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. This increase is due to a higher number of store openings, a greater number of store renovations and the relocation of our New York headquarters. 
CapEx this year will likely represent almost 7% of sales. This is pretty consistent with our longer-term CapEx outlook of 6% to 7% of sales. We were also using some cash for share repurchases. We spent nearly $25 million in the second quarter to buy approximately 330,000 shares at an average cost of $74.29 per share. We have spent $52 million in the first half of the year to purchase about 783,000 shares at an average cost of $67 per share. We have approximately $340 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January 2013. We plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and higher-than-normal cash balances while continuing to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. 
Now let's review our financial outlook for the full year. This updated outlook incorporates the better-than-expected results from the second quarter and August trends while maintaining our expectations for the remainder of the year. As Jim discussed on the conference call 3 months ago, enough macroeconomic uncertainty remains, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Therefore, our outlook is not premised upon the continuation of such strong comparable store sales increases that we achieved during the second quarter. 
Our full year forecast now calls for a high-teens percentage increase in worldwide net sales. By region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a high-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a mid-teens percentage, sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 30% with local currency comps up close to 25%, sales in Japan to increase by a high single-digit percentage in total with a low single-digit comp increase in yen and sales in Europe to increase by at least 20% with local currency comps up by low-double-digit percentage. We expect other sales to increase about 25%. We will increase our worldwide store base by 7% this year, which includes opening 17 company-operated stores, and closing one in Japan. 
In the Americas, we will now open 6 stores this year. This includes stores already opened in Calgary and Northbrook as well as stores scheduled to open in the Stony Point mall in Richmond, the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia and the second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre. A store plan for Montreal is now scheduled to open at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We will also soon relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby mall of Chestnut Hill. 
In Europe, we are adding 3 stores this year, including the stores we've opened in Zürich and Frankfurt as well as a second store in Milan opening next month. The planned opening of a store in Neuss has been slightly delayed into early 2012.  In Asia-Pacific, our plan continues to include opening 4 stores in China, 1 in Taiwan and 3 in Korea, 2 of which have recently opened. Our margin assumptions for the year also factor in the better-than-expected second quarter results. We now expect the operating margin to improve by more than a full point, excluding non-recurring items, coming from improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, both of which are tied to sales leverage on fixed costs. 
We continue to expect other expenses net of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. So we are now forecasting full year earnings per diluted share in a range of $3.65 to $3.75 per diluted share, not including non-recurring expenses of about $0.20 per share. Our previous outlook called for EPS in a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, which also did not include the non-recurring expenses. 
This new forecast represents a 25% to 28% increase over last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded non-recurring items. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the third quarter is continuing to exceed our expectations, with noteworthy strength in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Japan. This is especially encouraging in light of the recent and well-known stock market volatility. 
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and first half of the year and are well positioned for the future. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Tuesday, November 29. That concludes our call. Thank you for listening."

We have developed what I believe is a world-class organization, both in terms of people and system capabilities, providing technology supporting our business from customer-facing transactions to distribution to inventory management. All of these supply chain, distribution and IT strengths support our store base, our e-commerce and wholesale distribution and will enable us to further expand our geographical reach. In addition, the relatively fixed-cost nature of this infrastructure will enable us to continue to improve our operating margin. And thanks to our real estate services group, we are now fully settled into our new headquarters at 200 Fifth Avenue, relocating our organization with a major project that involved the collaborative efforts of numerous people, and we now stand to benefit from organizational efficiencies and cost savings. 
All in all, Tiffany's operating capabilities are strong, and we are well-prepared to withstand our business over the long term. As we announced in June, Pat McGuiness has assumed the position of Chief Financial Officer from me. Pat has been effectively in charge of most finance division functions for several years now. And he and I have worked closely, and we'll certainly continue to do so. 
I'm pleased to now introduce Pat to offer some comments about our balance sheet and financial outlook."
35576,138701857,165312,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 26, 2011",2011-08-26,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter,",1020,"Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, we had $565 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We had $694 million of short-term and long-term debt, and our total debt to stockholders' equity was 29% at July 31 versus 40% a year ago. We're using that strong balance sheet in several ways. 
An 18% year-over-year increase in net inventories at the end of the quarter supported sales growth, new stores and new products. We are expanding our statement jewelry inventory assortment in key markets around the world, and we are being opportunistic in purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds. Also contributing to the inventory growth were higher product acquisition costs, and almost 1/4 of the inventory increase came from the translation effect of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect net inventories to increase at least 15% this year. 
Accounts receivable at quarter end were 16% higher than a year ago due to strong sales growth, but it also includes some effects from foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures of $111 million in the first half of the year were up from $51 million last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. This increase is due to a higher number of store openings, a greater number of store renovations and the relocation of our New York headquarters. 
CapEx this year will likely represent almost 7% of sales. This is pretty consistent with our longer-term CapEx outlook of 6% to 7% of sales. We were also using some cash for share repurchases. We spent nearly $25 million in the second quarter to buy approximately 330,000 shares at an average cost of $74.29 per share. We have spent $52 million in the first half of the year to purchase about 783,000 shares at an average cost of $67 per share. We have approximately $340 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January 2013. We plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and higher-than-normal cash balances while continuing to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. 
Now let's review our financial outlook for the full year. This updated outlook incorporates the better-than-expected results from the second quarter and August trends while maintaining our expectations for the remainder of the year. As Jim discussed on the conference call 3 months ago, enough macroeconomic uncertainty remains, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Therefore, our outlook is not premised upon the continuation of such strong comparable store sales increases that we achieved during the second quarter. 
Our full year forecast now calls for a high-teens percentage increase in worldwide net sales. By region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a high-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a mid-teens percentage, sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 30% with local currency comps up close to 25%, sales in Japan to increase by a high single-digit percentage in total with a low single-digit comp increase in yen and sales in Europe to increase by at least 20% with local currency comps up by low-double-digit percentage. We expect other sales to increase about 25%. We will increase our worldwide store base by 7% this year, which includes opening 17 company-operated stores, and closing one in Japan. 
In the Americas, we will now open 6 stores this year. This includes stores already opened in Calgary and Northbrook as well as stores scheduled to open in the Stony Point mall in Richmond, the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia and the second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre. A store plan for Montreal is now scheduled to open at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We will also soon relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby mall of Chestnut Hill. 
In Europe, we are adding 3 stores this year, including the stores we've opened in Zürich and Frankfurt as well as a second store in Milan opening next month. The planned opening of a store in Neuss has been slightly delayed into early 2012.  In Asia-Pacific, our plan continues to include opening 4 stores in China, 1 in Taiwan and 3 in Korea, 2 of which have recently opened. Our margin assumptions for the year also factor in the better-than-expected second quarter results. We now expect the operating margin to improve by more than a full point, excluding non-recurring items, coming from improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, both of which are tied to sales leverage on fixed costs. 
We continue to expect other expenses net of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. So we are now forecasting full year earnings per diluted share in a range of $3.65 to $3.75 per diluted share, not including non-recurring expenses of about $0.20 per share. Our previous outlook called for EPS in a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, which also did not include the non-recurring expenses. 
This new forecast represents a 25% to 28% increase over last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded non-recurring items. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the third quarter is continuing to exceed our expectations, with noteworthy strength in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Japan. This is especially encouraging in light of the recent and well-known stock market volatility. 
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and first half of the year and are well positioned for the future. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Tuesday, November 29. That concludes our call. Thank you for listening."

Now let's proceed. Following a robust first half of the year, we are very pleased this morning to report strong third quarter results. As an overview, the 21% worldwide sales growth, or 17% on a constant exchange rate basis, exceeded our expectations to the solid performance in most regions that demonstrate the advantages and opportunities for us from an increasingly growth of stores and customers.
The operating margin rose 3.5 points through the SG&A expense leverage. As a result, net earnings rose 63%, and earnings per diluted share were $0.70 in the quarter, up from $0.43 per diluted share last year. Excluding nonrecurring items last year, net earnings still rose by a strong 52%. And despite global economic uncertainties, we slightly raised our full year earnings outlook to reflect some of the better than anticipated third quarter performance.
Now let's look at the details of the quarter, starting with a regional sales review. In the Americas, total sales rose by a better-than-expected 17% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. In addition, we continue to see unit sales growth in all price strata above $250, with notable increases at the highest price points. One example of the stronger activity at the high end was the great success of our annual blue book event for top customers held in October. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales in the Americas rose 15% on top of a 5% increase last year. Broadly speaking, our stores in the U.S. performed well, as did our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store rose 24% versus a 3% decline last year, with most of that large increase due to sales from foreign tourists.
Conversely, sales growth in New York area brand stores was more modest as it reflects higher percentage of local customer demand. In fact, the sizable portion of our total U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from sales to foreign visitors particularly to customers from Asia and to a lesser extent from Europe, but there was also good increase in sales to U.S. customers. On a side note, if you are in New York, we invite you to be charmed by our especially festive holiday windows of our Fifth Avenue flagship store.
Comparable American brand store sales increased 13% on top of an 8% increase in last year's third quarter. It's worth noting that geographically, the 13% branch store comp increase reflected much greater strength than the Western half of the U.S. including markets like Texas and California as well, as a very strong sales growth in Hawaii and Guam driven by Japanese tourist spending. We opened 3 stores in the Americas in the quarter including one in Richmond Virginia, our fourth store in Las Vegas and our third location in Brazil, in the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia.
Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased 11% on top of the 7% increase last year largely due to an increase in average sales per order and the smaller increase in the number of orders shipped. On a related note, we were pleased to see it recently reported that L2, a think tank for digital innovation ranked Tiffany highest in their digital IQ index in the jewelry and watch category. L2 sided digital confidence as a point of differentiation for our brand because we offer a website that is searchable, shareable and mobile optimized and that tied social media efforts to a broader digital strategy. I can share with you that we plan to further enhance our social media program and dramatically revamp our website next year to derive strong marketing and sales benefits.
Now let's turn to the Asia Pacific reasons. Total sales in the quarter surpassed our expectations by surging 44% due to similar growth in both the number of units sold and in the average price per units sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 40%, with comp store sales up 36% on top of an 11% comp increase last year. The Asia Pacific sales growth was strong throughout the region, with especially strong double-digit growth in the Greater China market, but also noteworthy increases in Australian and Singapore. 
In the quarter, we opened 3 Asia Pacific stores including 2 in Korea, in Degu and one in China in Guangzhou, as well as relocating our very successful store within the Wynn Resorts in Macau. We are on track to open 3 additional Asia Pacific stores planned in December in China, Taiwan and Korea.
Our business in Japan performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter. Total sales in yen rose 3% due to 4% comp growth versus a 2% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, factoring in the yen being 9% stronger than last year's third quarter, total sales in Japan increased 12% entirely due to an increase in the average price per unit sold.  Sales growth was pretty consistent between the Tokyo area and other regions. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 55 in the quarter.
In Europe, total sales on a constant exchange rate raises increased 15% in the quarter while comparable store sales rose 6% on top of the 24% comp increase last year. Including translation effect, total sales in Europe in dollars rose 19% in the quarter, largely due to unit growth and a modest increase in the average price per unit sold.
It was a noticeable difference in performance between Continental Europe, highlighted by double-digit comps in France, Germany and Italy versus a modest decline in U.K. comp sales. While Europe is facing challenging economic conditions, we've attributed Tiffany's better performance in some countries to our growing brand awareness and market penetration. Having said that, we are certainly not implying that Tiffany will be completely insulated from these economic challenges.
In addition, although a clear majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, European sales have been increasingly benefiting in a few countries from growing sales to foreign tourists notably from China and Russia.
In the third quarter, we opened Tiffany's second store in Milan in the Excelsior, which now gives us 5 stores in Italy. And we are excited the recently announced that Tiffany opened a store in Prague in 2012 in addition to other planned openings.
Beyond the retail store performance I've just discussed, I should add how [ph] our performance of our website in New York, Asia Pacific and Japan. These websites are generating the e-commerce sales and along with additional informational sites that we have in some Asia Pacific countries are also proving to be very effective marketing tools to drive customers to our stores.
Lastly, sales in our other segments declined 19% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and modest decline in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. So that covers sales by segments. Let's now take a brief look at some product category highlights.
The 21% worldwide sales growth in the quarter was quite broad based, with solid percentage gains across the key jewelry categories ranging from our iconic classics to new designs. This included strong growth in engagement jewelry sales, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and as I alluded to earlier, very healthy increases in high end safe and jewelry sales. We also saw significant increases in our fine and fashion jewelry categories, with stronger growth at higher price points. This was typified by the classics in platinum and diamond such as studs and pendants, as well as strong gold jewelry sales, while silver jewelry sales posted more modest growth. Popular jewelry designs at higher price points include the Victoria Collection, our beautiful yellow diamond collection, Tiffany Metro and of course, our celebration rings. While a couple of popular collections that span more moderate eyes point include the Return to Tiffany and 1837 collections.
The Keys Collection remains one of our top sellers across its wide range of price points, and this year's introduction of Tiffany Locks collection is already proven to be very successful. Designer jewelry sales posted a good increase in the quarter highlighted by the introduction of Paloma Picasso's collection. And outside of jewelry, we have been expanding our relatively new Leather Collection with more designs, as well as distributing into more of our U.S. stores. So we are certainly pleased with a wide range of merchandising success in the quarter.
Let's now review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margins came in at 57.9% in the third quarter versus 58.5% in the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to a shift in sales mix. We saw strong growth in higher priced diamond jewelry that earns a lower gross margins but of course, contributes substantial gross profit dollars that generate incremental sales leverage on SG&A expenses. And gross margin was also marginally reduced by higher commodity costs despite the price increases we've taken this year.
Precious metals and diamond prices caused the period to stabilize or even slightly decline in recent months, but we will not attempt to predict future move. Most importantly, we continue to believe in our competitive ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our relative market position.
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10% in the quarter. Excluding $6 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's third quarter tied to the New York headquarter's relocation, SG&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year, largely due to higher store occupancy costs and increased staffing and sales-related variable costs. Those same factors as well as higher marketing spending contributed to a 21% increase in year-to-date SG&A expenses or 18% excluding nonrecurring items. We continue to achieve excellent sales leverage on fixed SG&A cost in the quarter. On the adjusted basis, to exclude nonrecurring items, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales in the quarter improved by 3.2 points to 40.1%. While on the year-to-date, the ratio improved by 2 points to 39.5%.
While adding up the third quarter strong sales growth would increase gross profit and contained SG&A expense growth, earnings from operations rose 50% over last year and excluding nonrecurring items were up 41%. Other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, was $10.4 million in the quarter. That was somewhat lower than last year. The effective tax rate of 33.9% in the quarter was in line with our expectations and compared with 34.9% last year.
Bottom line, third quarter net earnings rose 63% to almost $90 million and with $0.70 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings increased 52%. So we consider these third quarter results to be quite and presume most of you will agree with that assessment. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Pat McGuiness, to review by density pilots and our outlook for the rest of the year."
35576,142457089,197131,"Tiffany & Co., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2011",2011-11-29,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. And good day to everyone. The third quarter was encouraging with strong sales and earnings growth, and the company continue to generate strong returns with the return on average assets running at 12% and return on average stockholders' equit",1300,"Thanks, Mark. And good day to everyone. The third quarter was encouraging with strong sales and earnings growth, and the company continue to generate strong returns with the return on average assets running at 12% and return on average stockholders' equity at 21%. We are pleased with this strong demand and equally pleased that we are well-positioned with an efficient infrastructure and strong balance sheet to move forward. 
On our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, we had $297 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $709 million, representing 31% of stockholders' equity at October 31 versus 38% a year ago. We view our strong as a competitive advantage especially in times of macroeconomic silences and uncertainties. Combined with an efficient supply network, we're able to maintain high inventory availability in our stores. Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 25% higher than a year ago due to a 58% increase in combine raw materials and working process inventories as well, as modest 8% increase in finished goods inventories. Overall, the increases afforded sales growth, new stores and new products. The increase also reflected significantly higher production acquisition in raw material costs.
Part of the increases as we had forecasted at the start of 2011 have been to expand our safe and jewelry assortment in key markets to create additional sales opportunities. We have been purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds in support of sales growth and to secure supply for our expanding internal production. I should add that only a couple of percentage points of the inventory increase resulted from the translation effect of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar.
We expect net inventories at year end to increase roughly 15% above the prior year end. On a related note, we are pleased with the start-up of a new jewelry manufacturing facility that we opened a few months ago in Lexington, Kentucky. That additional capacity is nicely complementing our existing locations in the New York area and Rhode Island, positions us well to continue to expand internal production. Now moving to the rest of the balance sheet.
Accounts receivable are in excellent shape, declining 5% in the past year, reflecting a decline in receivables owed by independent distributors. Our capital expenditures were $182 million in the first 9 months of the year compared to $89 million in the same period last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. The delta is a function of store openings and a greater number of store renovations, but it also reflects the buildout of our new headquarters.
As we continue to expand our business, we are also returning some cash to stockholders. We have been repurchasing our common stocks steadily and opportunistically. In the third quarter, we spent $86 million to buy approximately 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $65.37 per share. In the first 9 months of the year, we have spent $139 million to purchase about 2.1 million shares at an average cost of $65.97 per share.
At quarter end, we had $250 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the current reauthorized program that runs through January 2013. 
Now let's turn to our forecast for the year, which mostly reflect some fine-tuning of assumptions from our previous guidance, as well as the better-than-expected third quarter results. For the full year, we are still forecasting a high teens percentage increase in worldwide net sales to approximately $3.7 billion. That annual forecast implies a low teens percentage increase in worldwide sales in the fourth quarter. We highlighted our full year sales assumptions by regions in today's New York news release.
Those full year assumptions imply that in the fourth quarter, by region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage. The local currency comps up mid- to high-single digit percentage; fourth quarter sales in Asia Pacific to increase by more than 20% with local currency comps up around 20%.  Total sales in Japan to increase by a mid-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter with a low-single digit comp increase in yen. And for sales in Europe in the fourth quarter to increase by mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low-single-digit percentage. And we expect that other sales will decline about 10% in the fourth quarter. 
By year end, we will have increased our worldwide store base in 2011 by 6%, or 4% growth in square footage, which reflects adding a net of 14 company-operated stores. A few locations originally planned to open in 2011 were delayed due to construction and site availability beyond our control, which will contribute a higher rate of store expansion plan for 2012.
In the Americas, we have added 5 stores during the year. This includes 3 stores in the U.S., in Northborough, Richmond and Las Vegas, one store in Canada, in Calgary, a store in Brasilia, which now gives us 3 stores in Brazil. We relocated one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby mall at Chestnut Hill. And we are getting ready to open a second store in Vancouver. In Europe, we have added 3 stores this year, in the airports in Zürich and Frankfurt as well as a second store in Milan. In Asia Pacific, we have opened 3 stores with 3 more planned in the fourth quarter in China, Korea and Taiwan. 2  additional stores originally planned for China in the fourth quarter have been delayed into early 2012. And year-to-date in Japan, we have opened one new store while closing 2 other locations.
We still expect the operating margins to increase more than full point in the year, coming mostly from SG&A expense leverage. This implies an operating margin in the fourth quarter roughly equal to last year. We're looking for full year other expenses of about $43 million and an effective income tax rate of approximately 34%. 
Adding it all up, our forecast now calls for full year earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share. This excludes a $0.20 per share of nonrecurring expenses that we have already recorded. This EPS range would be up 26% to 30% from last year's $2.93 were diluted share which also excluded nonrecurring items. We are previously forecasting EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share, which also did not including nonrecurring expenses. This implies fourth quarter net earnings in the range of $1.48 to $1.58 per diluted share. As we noted in today's news release, worldwide sales growth so far in this fourth quarter is meeting our expectations despite recently in Europe as well as in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic markets of the U.S.
Although it's probably too early to draw any conclusions, we are cognizant of the challenging economic conditions and uncertainties in a number of markets, and believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our latest forecast. 
In closing, come we have every reason to be pleased with Tiffany's performance so far in 2011. We are well-positioned in the holiday season and over the longer term horizon. The Tiffany & Co. brand remains strong. Customers are increasingly attracted to our well-designed, high-quality products. Our stores of strong inventory positions. We have a well-developed and efficient infrastructure, and we have a solid balance sheet to pursue our expansion plans.
That concludes my comments, please feel free to call Mark with any questions. And please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's Tiffany's holiday period results on Tuesday, January 10. Our best wishes to you during the holidays, and thank you for listening."

Now let's proceed. Following a robust first half of the year, we are very pleased this morning to report strong third quarter results. As an overview, the 21% worldwide sales growth, or 17% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, exceeded our expectations to the solid performance in most regions that demonstrate the advantage and opportunities for us from an increasingly growth [indiscernible] of stores and customers.
The operating margin rose 3.5 points due to excellent SG&A expense leverage. As a result, net earnings rose 63%; and earnings per diluted share were $0.70 in the quarter, up from $0.43 per diluted share last year. Excluding nonrecurring items last year, net earnings still rose by a strong 52%. And despite global economic uncertainties, we slightly raised our full year earnings outlook to reflect some of the better-than-anticipated third quarter performance.
Now let's look at the details of the quarter, starting with the regional sales review. In the Americas, total sales rose by a better-than-expected 17% due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. In addition, we continue to see unit sales growth in all price strata above $250, with notable increases at the highest price points. One example of the stronger activity at the high end was the great success of our annual Blue Book event for top customers held in October. 
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales in the Americas rose 15% on top of a 5% increase last year. Broadly speaking, our stores in the U.S. performed well, as did our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store rose 24% versus a 3% decline last year, with most of that large increase due to sales from foreign tourists.
Conversely, sales growth in New York area brand stores was more modest, as it reflects the higher percentage of local customer demand. In fact, the sizable portion of our total U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from sales to foreign visitors, particularly to customers from Asia and to a lesser extent from Europe, but there was also good increase in sales to U.S. customers. On a side note, if you are in New York, we invite you to be charmed by our especially festive holiday windows of our Fifth Avenue flagship store.
Comparable Americas brand store sales increased 13% on top of an 8% increase in last year's third quarter. It's worth noting that geographically, the 13% branch store comp increase reflected much greater strength than the Western half of the U.S. including markets like Texas and California, as well as very strong sales growth in Hawaii and Guam driven by Japanese tourist spending. 
We opened 3 stores in the Americas in the quarter: including one in Richmond Virginia, our fourth store in Las Vegas and our third location in Brazil, in the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia.
    
Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased 11% on top of the 7% increase last year largely due to an increase in average sales per order and the smaller increase in the number of orders shipped. 
On a related note, we were pleased to see it recently reported that L2, a think tank for digital innovation ranked Tiffany highest in their digital IQ index in the jewelry and watch category. L2 cited digital confidence as a point of differentiation for our brand because we offer a website that is searchable, shareable and mobile-optimized, and at high social media efforts to a broader digital strategy. I can share with you that we plan to further enhance our social media program, and dramatically revamp our website next year to derive strong marketing and sales benefits.
Now let's turn to the Asia Pacific region. Total sales in the quarter surpassed our expectations by surging 44% due to similar growth in both the number of units sold and in the average price-per-unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 40%, with comp store sales up 36% on top of the 11% comp increase last year. The Asia Pacific sales growth was strong throughout the region, with especially strong double-digit growth in the Greater China market, but also noteworthy increases in Australia and Singapore. 
In the quarter, we opened 3 Asia Pacific stores: including 2 in Korea, in Daegu and Incheon; and 1 in China, in Guangzhou. As well as relocating our very successful store within the Wynn Resort in Macau. We are on track to open 3 additional Asia Pacific stores planned in December in China, Taiwan and Korea.
Our business in Japan performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter. Total sales in yen rose 3% due to 4% comp growth, versus a 2% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, factoring in the yen being 9% stronger than last year's third quarter, total sales in Japan increased 12% entirely due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. Sales growth is pretty consistent between the Tokyo area and other region. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 55 in the quarter.
In Europe, total sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 15% in the quarter, while comparable store sales rose 6% on top of the 24% comp increase last year. Including translation effect, total sales in Europe in dollars rose 19% in the quarter, largely due to unit growth and a modest increase in the average price-per-unit sold.
There was a noticeable difference in performance between Continental Europe, highlighted by double-digit comps in France, Germany and Italy versus a modest decline in U.K. comp sales. While Europe is facing challenging economic conditions, we have attributed Tiffany's better performance in some countries to our growing brand awareness and market penetration. Having said that, we are certainly not implying that Tiffany will be completely insulated from these economic challenges.
In addition, although a clear majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, European sales have been increasingly benefiting in a few countries from growing sales to foreign tourists, notably from China and Russia.
In the third quarter, we opened Tiffany's second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which now gives us 5 stores in Italy. And we were excited to recently announce that Tiffany will open a store in Prague in 2012, in addition to other planned openings.
Beyond the retail store performance I've just discussed, I should add how pleased we are with the performance of our website in Europe, Asia Pacific and Japan. These websites are generating e-commerce sales and, along with additional informational sites that we have in some Asia Pacific countries, are also proving to be very effective marketing tools to drive customers to our stores.
Lastly, sales in our other segments declined 19% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and modest decline in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. So that covers sales by segments. Let's now take a brief look at some product category highlights.
The 21% worldwide sales growth from the quarter was quite broad-based, with solid percentage gains across the key jewelry categories, ranging from our iconic classics to new designs. This included strong growth in engagement jewelry sales, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and as I alluded to earlier, very healthy increases in high-end statement jewelry sales. We also saw significant increases in our fine and fashion jewelry categories, with stronger growth at higher price points. This was typified by the classics in platinum and diamond, such as studs and pendants, as well as strong gold jewelry sales; while silver jewelry sales posted more modest growth. 
Popular jewelry designs at higher price points include the Victoria Collection, our beautiful Yellow Diamonds Collection, Tiffany Metro and, of course, our Celebration Rings. While a couple of popular collections that span more moderate price point include the Return to Tiffany and 1837 collections.
The Keys Collection remains one of our top sellers across its wide range of price points, and this year's introduction of Tiffany Locks collection is already proven to be very successful. Designer jewelry sales posted a good increase in the quarter highlighted by the introduction of Paloma Picasso's new Venezia Collection. And outside of jewelry, we have been expanding our relatively new Leather Collection with more designs, as well as distributing into more of our U.S. stores. So we are certainly pleased with the wide range of merchandising success in the quarter.
Let's now review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin came in at 57.9% in the third quarter versus 58.5% in the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to a shift in the sales mix. We saw a strong growth in higher-priced diamond jewelry that earns a lower gross margins, but of course, contributes substantial gross profit dollars that generate incremental sales leverage on SG&A expenses. And gross margin was also marginally reduced by higher commodity costs despite the price increases we have taken this year.
Precious metal and diamond costs appeared to have stabilized or even slightly declined in the recent months, but we will not attempt to predict future near-term move. Most importantly, we continue to believe at our competitive ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our relative market position.
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10% in the quarter, excluding $6 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's third quarter tied to the New York headquarter's relocation. SG&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year, largely due to higher store occupancy costs and increased staffing and sales-related variable costs. Those same factors, as well as higher marketing spending, contributed to a 21% increase in year-to-date SG&A expenses, or 18% excluding nonrecurring items. 
We continue to achieve excellent sales leverage on fixed SG&A costs in the quarter. On the adjusted basis, to exclude nonrecurring items, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales in the quarter improved by 3.2 points to 40.1%, while in the year-to-date, the ratio improved by 2 points to 39.5%.
While adding up the third quarter's strong sales growth with increased gross profit and contained SG&A expense growth, earnings from operations rose 50% over last year, and excluding nonrecurring items were up 41%. Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was $10.4 million in the quarter. That was somewhat lower than last year. The effective tax rate of 33.9% in the quarter was in line with our expectations and compared with 34.9% last year.
Bottom line, third quarter net earnings rose 63% to almost $90 million, and with $0.70 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings increased 52%. So we consider these third quarter results to be quite good and presume most of you will agree with that assessment. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Pat McGuiness, to review balance sheet highlights and our outlook for the rest of the year."

And good day to everyone. The third quarter was encouraging with strong sales and earnings growth, and the company continue to generate strong returns, with the return on average assets running at 12% and return on average stockholders' equity at 21%. We are pleased with this strong demand and equally pleased that we are well-positioned with an efficient infrastructure and strong balance sheet to move forward. 
On our balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, we had $297 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $709 million, representing 31% of stockholders' equity at October 31 versus 38% a year ago. We view our strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage, especially in times of macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties. Combined with an efficient supply network, we are able to maintain high inventory availability in our stores. Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 25% higher than a year ago, due to a 58% increase in combined raw materials and work-in-process inventories, as well as the modest 8% increase in finished goods inventories. 
Overall, the increases supported sales growth, new stores and new products. The increase also reflected significantly higher production acquisition in raw material costs. Part of the increases, as we have forecasted at the start of 2011, has been to expand our statement jewelry assortments in key markets to create additional sales opportunities. We have been purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds in support of sales growth and to secure supply for our expanding internal production. I should add that only a couple of percentage points of the inventory increase resulted from the translation effects of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar.
We expect net inventories at year end to increase roughly 15% above the prior year end. On a related note, we are pleased with the start-up of a new jewelry manufacturing facility that we opened a few months ago in Lexington, Kentucky. That additional capacity is nicely complementing our existing locations in the New York area and Rhode Island, and positions us well to continue to expand internal production. 
Now moving to the rest of the balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in excellent shape, declining 5% in the past year, reflecting a decline in receivables owed by independent distributors. Our capital expenditures were $182 million in the first 9 months of the year, compared with $89 million in the same period last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. The delta is a function of store opening and a greater number of store renovations, but it also reflects the buildout of our new headquarters.
As we continue to expand our business, we are also returning some cash to stockholders. We have been repurchasing our common stocks steadily and opportunistically. In the third quarter, we spent $86 million to buy approximately 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $65.37 per share. In the first 9 months of the year, we have spent $139 million to purchase about 2.1 million shares at an average cost of $65.97 per share.
At quarter end, we had $250 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the current re-authorized program that runs through January 2013. 
Now let's turn to our forecast for the year, which mostly reflect some fine-tuning of assumptions from our previous guidance, as well as the better-than-expected third quarter results. For the full year, we are still forecasting a high-teen percentage increase in worldwide net sales to approximately $3.7 billion. That annual forecast implies a low-teen percentage increase in worldwide sales in the fourth quarter. We highlighted our full year sales assumptions by regions in today's New York news release.
Those full year assumptions imply that in the fourth quarter by region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage, with local currency comps up by mid to high-single digit percentage; fourth quarter sales in Asia Pacific to increase by more than 20% with local currency comps up around 20%. Total sales in Japan to increase by mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter with a low-single-digit comp increase in yen. And for sales in Europe in the fourth quarter to increase by mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low-single-digit percentage. And we expect that other sales will decline about 10% in the fourth quarter. 
By year end, we will have increased our worldwide store base in 2011 by 6%, or 4% growth in square footage, which reflects adding a net of 14 company-operated stores. A few locations originally planned to open in 2011 were delayed due to construction and site availability beyond our control, which will contribute to a higher rate of store expansion plan for 2012.
In the Americas, we have added 5 stores during the year. This includes 3 stores in the U.S.: in Northbrook, Richmond and Las Vegas; 1 store in Canada, in Calgary; a store in Brasilia, which now gives us 3 stores in Brazil. We recently relocated one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby Mall at Chestnut Hill. And we are getting ready to open the second store in Vancouver. 
In Europe, we have added 3 stores this year: in the airports in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as the second store in Milan. 
In Asia Pacific, we have opened 3 stores with 3 more planned in the fourth quarter in China, Korea and Taiwan. Two additional stores originally planned for China in the fourth quarter have been delayed into early 2012. And year-to-date in Japan, we have opened 1 new store, while closing 2 other locations.
We still expect the operating margins to increase by more than a full point for the year, coming mostly from SG&A expense leverage. This implies an operating margin in the fourth quarter roughly equal to last year. We're looking for full year other expenses of about $43 million and an effective income tax rate of approximately 34%. 
Adding it all up, our forecast now calls for full year earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share. This excludes a $0.20 per share of nonrecurring expenses that we have already recorded. This EPS range would be up 26% to 30% from last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded nonrecurring items. We are previously forecasting EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses. This implies fourth quarter net earnings in the range of $1.48 to $1.58 per diluted share. As we noted in today's news release, worldwide sales growth, so far in this fourth quarter, is meeting our expectations despite recent weakness in Europe as well as in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic markets of the U.S.
Although it's probably too early to draw any conclusions, we are cognizant of the challenging economic conditions and uncertainties in a number of markets, and believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our latest forecast. 
In closing, we have every reason to be pleased with Tiffany's performance so far in 2011. We are well positioned in this holiday season and over the longer-term horizon; the Tiffany & Co. brand remains strong; customers are increasingly attracted to our well-designed, high-quality products; our stores have strong inventory positions; we have a well-developed and efficient infrastructure; and we have a solid balance sheet to pursue our expansion plans.
That concludes my comments, please feel free to call Mark with any questions. And please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's holiday period results on Tuesday, January 10. Our best wishes to you during the holidays, and thank you for listening."

Now let's proceed. Following a robust first half of the year, we are very pleased this morning to report strong third quarter results. As an overview, the 21% worldwide sales growth, or 17% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, exceeded our expectations to the solid performance in most regions that demonstrate the advantage and opportunities for us from an increasingly growth --
[Audio Gap] 
-- of stores and customers.
The operating margin rose 3.5 points due to excellent SG&A expense leverage. As a result, net earnings rose 63%; and earnings per diluted share were $0.70 in the quarter, up from $0.43 per diluted share last year. Excluding nonrecurring items last year, net earnings still rose by a strong 52%. And despite global economic uncertainties, we slightly raised our full year earnings outlook to reflect some of the better-than-anticipated third quarter performance.
Now let's look at the details of the quarter, starting with a regional sales review. In the Americas, total sales rose by a better-than-expected 17% due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. In addition, we continue to see unit sales growth in all price strata above $250, with notable increases at the highest price points. One example of the stronger activity at the high end was the great success of our annual Blue Book event for top customers held in October.
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales in the Americas rose 15% on top of a 5% increase last year. Broadly speaking, our stores in the U.S. performed well, as did our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store rose 24% versus a 3% decline last year, with most of that large increase due to sales from foreign tourists.
Conversely, sales growth in New York area brand stores was more modest, as it reflects a higher percentage of local customer demand. In fact, the sizable portion of our total U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from sales to foreign visitors, particularly to customers from Asia and to a lesser extent from Europe, but there was also good increase in sales to U.S. customers. On a side note, if you are in New York, we invite you to be charmed by our especially festive holiday windows of our Fifth Avenue flagship store.

It's worth noting that geographically, the 13% branch store comp increase reflected much greater strength than the Western half of the U.S. including markets like Texas and California, as well as very strong sales growth in Hawaii and Guam driven by Japanese tourist spending. 
We opened 3 stores in the Americas in the quarter: including one in Richmond Virginia, our fourth store in Las Vegas and our third location in Brazil, in the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia.

At quarter end, we had $250 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the current re-authorized program that runs through January 2013.
Now let's turn to our forecast for the year, which mostly reflects some fine-tuning of assumptions from our previous guidance, as well as the better-than-expected third quarter results. For the full year, we are still forecasting a high-teen percentage increase in worldwide net sales to approximately $3.7 billion. That annual forecast implies a low-teen percentage increase in worldwide sales in the fourth quarter. We highlighted our full year sales assumptions by regions in today's New York news release.
Those full year assumptions imply that in the fourth quarter by region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage, with local currency comps up by mid to high-single digit percentage; fourth quarter sales in Asia Pacific to increase by more than 20% with local currency comps up around 20%. Total sales in Japan to increase by mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter with a low-single-digit comp increase in yen. And for sales in Europe in the fourth quarter to increase by mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low-single-digit percentage. And we expect that other sales will decline about 10% in the fourth quarter.
By year end, we will have increased our worldwide store base in 2011 by 6%, or 4% growth in square footage, which reflects adding a net of 14 company-operated stores. A few locations originally planned to open in 2011 were delayed due to construction and site availability beyond our control, which will contribute to a higher rate of store expansion planned for 2012.
In the Americas, we have added 5 stores during the year. This includes 3 stores in the U.S.: in Northbrook, Richmond and Las Vegas; 1 store in Canada, in Calgary; a store in Brasilia, which now gives us 3 stores in Brazil. We recently relocated one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby Mall at Chestnut Hill. And we are getting ready to open the second store in Vancouver.
In Europe, we have added 3 stores this year: in the airports in Zürich and Frankfurt, as well as the second store in Milan.
In Asia Pacific, we have opened 3 stores with 3 more planned in the fourth quarter in China, Korea and Taiwan. Two additional stores originally planned for China in the fourth quarter have been delayed into early 2012. And year-to-date, in Japan, we have opened 1 new store, while closing 2 other locations.
We still expect the operating margins to increase by more than a full point for the year, coming mostly from SG&A expense leverage. This implies an operating margin in the fourth quarter roughly equal to last year. We're looking for full year other expenses of about $43 million and an effective income tax rate of approximately 34%.
Adding it all up, our forecast now calls for full year earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share. This excludes a $0.20 per share of nonrecurring expenses that we have already recorded. This EPS range would be up 26% to 30% from last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded nonrecurring items. We are previously forecasting EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses. This implies fourth quarter net earnings in the range of $1.48 to $1.58 per diluted share. As we noted in today's news release, worldwide sales growth, so far in this fourth quarter, is meeting our expectations despite recent weakness in Europe as well as in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic markets of the U.S.
Although it's probably too early to draw any conclusions, we are cognizant of the challenging economic conditions and uncertainties in a number of markets, and believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our latest forecast.
In closing, we have every reason to be pleased with Tiffany's performance so far in 2011. We are well positioned in this holiday season and over the longer-term horizon; the Tiffany & Co. brand remains strong; customers are increasingly attracted to our well-designed, high-quality products; our stores have strong inventory positions; we have a well-developed and efficient infrastructure; and we have a solid balance sheet to pursue our expansion plans.
That concludes my comments, please feel free to call Mark with any questions. And please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's holiday period results on Tuesday, January 10. Our best wishes to you during the holidays, and thank you for listening."

Now let's proceed. Following a robust first half of the year, we are very pleased this morning to report strong third quarter results. As an overview, the 21% worldwide sales growth, or 17% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, exceeded our expectations to the solid performance in most regions that demonstrate the advantage and opportunities for us from an increasingly [indiscernible] of stores and customers.
The operating margin rose 3.5 points due to excellent SG&A expense leverage. As a result, net earnings rose 63%; and earnings per diluted share were $0.70 in the quarter, up from $0.43 per diluted share last year. Excluding nonrecurring items last year, net earnings still rose by a strong 52%. And despite global economic uncertainties, we slightly raised our full year earnings outlook to reflect some of the better-than-anticipated third quarter performance.
Now let's look at the details of the quarter, starting with a regional sales review. In the Americas, total sales rose by a better-than-expected 17% due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. In addition, we continue to see unit sales growth in all price strata above $250, with notable increases at the highest price points. One example of the stronger activity at the high end was the great success of our annual Blue Book event for top customers held in October.
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales in the Americas rose 15% on top of a 5% increase last year. Broadly speaking, our stores in the U.S. performed well, as did our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store rose 24% versus a 3% decline last year, with most of that large increase due to sales from foreign tourists.
Conversely, sales growth in New York area brand stores was more modest, as it reflects a higher percentage of local customer demand. In fact, the sizable portion of our total U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from sales to foreign visitors, particularly to customers from Asia and to a lesser extent from Europe, but there was also good increase in sales to U.S. customers. On a side note, if you are in New York, we invite you to be charmed by our especially festive holiday windows of our Fifth Avenue flagship store.
Comparable Americas brand store sales increased 13% on top of an 8% increase in last year's third quarter. It's worth noting that geographically, the 13% branch store comp increase reflected much greater strength than the Western half of the U.S. including markets like Texas and California, as well as very strong sales growth in Hawaii and Guam driven by Japanese tourist spending. 
We opened 3 stores in the Americas in the quarter: including one in Richmond Virginia, our fourth store in Las Vegas and our third location in Brazil, in the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia.
    
Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased 11% on top of the 7% increase last year largely due to an increase in average sales per order and the smaller increase in the number of orders shipped.
On a related note, we were pleased to see it recently reported that L2, a think tank for digital innovations ranked Tiffany highest in their digital IQ index in the jewelry and watch categories. L2 cited digital confidence as a point of differentiation for our brand because we offer a website that is searchable, shareable and mobile-optimized, and at high social media efforts to a broader digital strategy. I can share with you that we plan to further enhance our social media program, and dramatically revamp our website next year to derive strong marketing and sales benefits.
Now let's turn to the Asia Pacific regions. Total sales in the quarter surpassed our expectations by surging 44% due to similar growth in both the number of units sold and in the average price-per-unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 40%, with comp store sales up 36% on top of 11% comp increase last year. The Asia Pacific sales growth was strong throughout the region, with especially strong double-digit growth in the Greater China market, but also noteworthy increases in Australia and Singapore.
In the quarter, we opened 3 Asia Pacific stores: including 2 in Korea, in Daegu and Incheon; and 1 in China, in Guangzhou. As well as relocating our very successful store within the Wynn Resort in Macau. We are on track to open 3 additional Asia Pacific stores planned in December in China, Taiwan and Korea.
Our business in Japan performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter. Total sales in yen rose 3% due to 4% comp growth, versus a 2% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, factoring in the yen being 9% stronger than last year's third quarter, total sales in Japan increased 12% entirely due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. Sales growth is pretty consistent between the Tokyo area and other regions. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 55 in the quarter.
In Europe, total sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 15% in the quarter, while comparable store sales rose 6% on top of the 24% comp increase last year. Including translation effect, total sales in Europe in dollars rose 19% in the quarter, largely due to unit growth and a modest increase in the average price-per-unit sold.
There was a noticeable difference in performance between Continental Europe, highlighted by double-digit comps in France, Germany and Italy versus a modest decline in U.K. comp sales. While Europe is facing challenging economic conditions, we have attributed Tiffany's better performance in some countries to our growing brand awareness and market penetration. Having said that, we are certainly not implying that Tiffany will be completely insulated from these economic challenges.
In addition, although a clear majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, European sales have been increasingly benefiting in a few countries from growing sales to foreign tourists, notably from China and Russia.
In the third quarter, we opened Tiffany's second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which now gives us 5 stores in Italy. And we were excited to recently announce that Tiffany will open a store in Prague in 2012, in addition to other planned openings.
Beyond the retail store performance I've just discussed, I should add how pleased we are with the performance of our websites in Europe, Asia Pacific and Japan. These websites are generating e-commerce sales and, along with additional informational sites that we have in some Asia Pacific countries, are also proving to be very effective marketing tools to drive customers to our stores.
Lastly, sales in our other segments declined 19% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and modest decline in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. So that covers sales by segment. Let's now take a brief look at some product category highlights.
The 21% worldwide sales growth from the quarter was quite broad-based, with solid percentage gains across the key jewelry categories, ranging from our iconic classics to new designs. This included strong growth in engagement jewelry sales, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and as I alluded to earlier, very healthy increases in high-end statement jewelry sales. We also saw significant increases in our fine and fashion jewelry categories, with stronger growth at higher price points. This was typified by the classics in platinum and diamonds, such as studs and pendants, as well as strong gold jewelry sales; while silver jewelry sales posted more modest growth.
Popular jewelry designs at higher price points include the Victoria collections, our beautiful yellow diamonds collections, Tiffany Metro and, of course, our Celebration Rings. While a couple of popular collections that span more moderate price points include the Return to Tiffany and 1837 collections.
The Keys Collection remains one of our top sellers across its wide range of price points, and this year's introduction of Tiffany Locks collection is already proven to be very successful. Designer jewelry sales posted a good increase in the quarter highlighted by the introduction of Paloma Picasso's new Venezia Collection. And outside of jewelry, we have been expanding our relatively new leather collection with more designs, as well as distributing into more of our U.S. stores. So we are certainly pleased with the wide range of merchandising success in the quarter.
Let's now review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin came in at 57.9% in the third quarter versus 58.5% in the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to a shift in the sales mix. We saw a strong growth in higher-priced diamond jewelry that earns a lower gross margin, but of course, contributes substantial gross profit dollars that generate incremental sales leverage on SG&A expenses. And gross margin was also marginally reduced by higher commodity costs despite the price increases we've taken this year.
Precious metal and diamond costs appeared to have stabilized or even slightly declined in the recent months, but we will not attempt to predict future near-term move. Most importantly, we continue to believe at our competitive ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our relative market position.
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10% in the quarter, excluding $6 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's third quarter tied to the New York headquarter's relocation. SG&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year, largely due to higher store occupancy costs and increased staffing and sales-related variable costs. Those same factors, as well as higher marketing spending, contributed to a 21% increase in year-to-date SG&A expenses, or 18% excluding nonrecurring items.
We continue to achieve excellent sales leverage on fixed SG&A costs in the quarter. On the adjusted basis, to exclude nonrecurring items, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales in the quarter improved by 3.2 points to 40.1%, while in the year-to-date, the ratio improved by 2 points to 39.5%.
While adding up the third quarter's strong sales growth with increased gross profit and contained SG&A expense growth, earnings from operations rose 50% over last year, and excluding nonrecurring items were up 41%. Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was $10.4 million in the quarter. That was somewhat lower than last year. The effective tax rate of 33.9% in the quarter was in line with our expectations and compared with 34.9% last year.
Bottom line, third quarter net earnings rose 63% to almost $90 million, and with $0.70 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings increased 52%. So we consider these third quarter results to be quite good and presume most of you will agree with that assessment. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Pat McGuiness, to review balance sheet highlights and our outlook for the rest of the year."

The third quarter was encouraging with strong sales and earnings growth, and the company continues to generate strong returns, with the return on average assets running at 12% and return on average stockholders' equ",1303,"Thanks, Mark. And good day to everyone. The third quarter was encouraging with strong sales and earnings growth, and the company continues to generate strong returns, with the return on average assets running at 12% and return on average stockholders' equity at 21%. We are pleased with this strong demand and equally pleased that we are well-positioned with an efficient infrastructure and strong balance sheet to move forward.
On our balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, we had $297 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $709 million, representing 31% of stockholders' equity at October 31 versus 38% a year ago. We view our strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage, especially in times of macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties. Combined with an efficient supply network, we are able to maintain high inventory availability in our stores. Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 25% higher than a year ago, due to a 58% increase in combined raw materials and work-in-process inventories, as well as the modest 8% increase in finished goods inventories.
Overall, the increases supported sales growth, new stores and new products. The increase also reflected significantly higher production acquisition in raw material costs. Part of the increases, as we have forecasted at the start of 2011, has been to expand our statement jewelry assortments in key markets to create additional sales opportunities. We have been purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds in support of sales growth and to secure a supply for our expanding internal production. I should add that only a couple percentage points of the inventory increase resulted from the translation effects of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar.
We expect net inventories at year end to increase roughly 15% above the prior year end. On a related note, we are pleased with the start-up of a new jewelry manufacturing facility that we opened a few months ago in Lexington, Kentucky. That additional capacity is nicely complementing our existing locations in the New York area and Rhode Island, and positions us well to continue to expand internal production.
Now moving to the rest of the balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in excellent shape, declining 5% in the past year, reflecting a decline in receivables owed by independent distributors. Our capital expenditures were $182 million in the first 9 months of the year, compared with $89 million in the same period last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. The delta is a function of store openings and a greater number of store renovations, but it also reflects the buildout of our new headquarters.
As we continue to expand our business, we are also returning some cash to stockholders. We have been repurchasing our common stocks steadily and opportunistically. In the third quarter, we spent $86 million to buy approximately 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $65.37 per share. In the first 9 months of the year, we have spent $139 million to purchase about 2.1 million shares at an average cost of $65.97 per share.
At quarter end, we had $250 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the current re-authorized program that runs through January 2013.
Now let's turn to our forecast for the year, which mostly reflects some fine-tuning of assumptions from our previous guidance, as well as the better-than-expected third quarter results.
